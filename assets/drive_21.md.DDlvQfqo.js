How did Nelly Furtado get so lucky? Even though \\"Loosed\\" was heavily produced by Timbaland, it's still lame. A weak, warbly voice being drowned by the heavy sounds of a beat machine. You can tell that Nelly is a Gwen Stefani fan because that's who she often attempts to copy when it comes to vocals and musical style. Nelly can't sing and she can't rap either. I saw her performing on the show \\"So You Think You Can Dance\\" last week and she, along with Timbaland, both looked like pieces of cardboard on stage. So add 'no stage presence' to the list. Supposedly Nelly can play a few instruments, but I heard very few instruments being played. Anyway, there's nothing special about this CD. This will be forgotten like a hot dog and macaroni & cheese dinner at the end of the month. Skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Likable but not perfect","review":"The reason to buy this is because of \\"Promiscuous,\\" the song of summer. But Loose, the third album from eclectic singer-songwriter Nelly Furtado, doesn't center solely around that instant first single. \\"Wait For You\\" and \\"Maneater\\" are likable enough (though not nearly as listenable as the aforementioned \\"Promiscuous\\") and cover the same concept of being addictive club-ready Hip Hop pop. The most Whoa, Nelly!-sounding track here is \\"All Good Things\\" with its introspective lyrics, great performance by Nelly and use of multi-interesting instruments. It's not perfect, but it's definitely worth listening to. Casual listeners will eat this up, but dedicated fans of the \\"I'm Like a Bird\\" Furtado will call her a sell-out (which isn't true) and fly away themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nelly Furtado - Two awesome dance tunes!","review":"I bought this CD for the \\"Promiscuis Girl\\" and was happily surprised at Track #9. I can't think of the name of the song offhand, but I absolutely love it. There are some other great slower songs on there too. The only thing that holds me back from the 5 stars are a few songs that I just don't enjoy and choose to skip through. One is a song that I can't understand. When I listen to a song I listen to the melody AND the lyrics.. and if I can't understand them.. I'm lost. I would still recommend this for purchase though."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Nelly but this album fell flat.","review":"For the most part I love Nelly Furtado. But, this album has only 2 really good songs. They are \\"Maneater\\" & \\"Promiscuos\\". The rest of the album fell flat. There's some talk in the beginning of some songs and at the end. I know some artists think by adding their personal touch of talking will entice others to love their project even more. I guess in the end, Nelly's album ended up like all the others. They entice us with 1 or 2 cover songs and then they hope we won't mind all the other bad songs. If you like Nelly Furtado but only want to own good songs, buy the singles which will have the remixes. If you have a lot of money and don't mind wasting it, go ahead and pick up this album. I think I just made a mistake and bought this album without sampling the whole thing. That's why I gave it 2 stars. Someday I will learn.A music fan"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God There's iTunes and Other Digital Music Stores..","review":"..so that you can buy only the track(s) that you like.

Well, this is not that CD (for all you hardcore Nelly fans). I must've made a mistake, I thought I bought Nelly Furtado, not Nelly. Not only is the album a flop but the feeble attempt to perform these songs live have outstandingly failed, EVERY time. Please Mizz Nelly send me my money back.WHERE IS NELLY FURTADO AND WHAT HAVE YOU DONE WITH HER??!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected this album to be much better....","review":"I expected this album to be much better than it really was. I attribute the rating of this album mostly to the production. It seems as if the songwriters and producers put as little work as possible into this one as was required to get a paycheck. With the exception of a couple songs, I will be much more careful about which whole albums I will buy again. I loved Nelly Furtado's first two albums, but this one just didn't do it. The soul is gone. The producers here are hoping that the sound of a couple analog synthesizers will put substance into this album and they are just dead wrong. The albums here are maturing backwards... listen to all the tracks before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally getting the appreciation she deserves","review":"Nelly Furtado is an extraordinary artist. Her lyrics and songwriting skills are among the best in the business. She has been turning out excellent albums for years. Folklore was her most artistic work so far, and sadly dismissed. Fortunately, Loose is achieving the kind of success Folklore deserved. It is definitely a complete turn in a different direction than Folklore, but is still a quality work. Loose is much more influenced by R&B.; There are also less ballads and mid-tempo songs on this album.Still, Loose is the kind of album which is set to widen Nelly's fanbase. Old fans will still be happy with two great ballads on the album (All Good Things Come to an End, In God's Hands).I'm just glad to see Nelly Furtado getting appreciation. It was a smart move for her to tackle rap and R&B.; Madonna couldn't get away with it, but Nelly can because of her ethnic background and her skill.Keep them coming, Nelly!

What a joy! I too watch it often because it is so funny. HOWEVER......I recently was given a suround sound system, and this DVD was released in MONO. I truly adored not just the performances in this movie but also the music. But, alas, even after trying all the different settings on my surround sound system, I am not \\"surrounded\\" by the music, it will only come out of the front speaker. I was sooooooo disappointed. I would go out and buy a blu ray player tomorrow, if this would be re-released on blu ray in stereo, or dolby 5.1.

Schroeder is to be commended for his efforts. The low budget is evident throughout, but the acting is solid and the message an important one. Even if it is a bit overwrought, one of the greatest issues for American Indians today is struggling with their identity and where they fit in this world. What some may see here as melodramatic racism is actually a very real stigma that many \\"mixed-bloods\\" have to face. In the end, this facet of the film makes it an important one, and a decent addition to the woefully inadequate genre of Native American film.Eddie Spears is excellent - I hope to see him get more work. If only Indians could get roles in films where their ethnicity was not the primary character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This Movie","review":"I choose five stars for many reasons, and the reasons are that I love this movie, love Eddie Spears and his acting.

From the highest plain of genius to hack work--however professionally wrought--few were as comfortable in older forms than Harris. The Quintet is highly touted, but it is a portion of the violin sonata that touches the heart. Once in a while in Shoatakovch as he is meandering along, an exquisite melody emerges as if the composer just awakened to it. Harris does this sometimes. In his choral work 'We Know that Susan Takes her Studies lightly' for female choir and piano you have a lovely from the heart sweet caprice, thus Harris has the beauty of song within his heart and it is certainly worth waiting for--patiently I must add-- for much of his choral work is not of the best quaity in terms of creative essence--however he always demonstrates a consummate well schooled professionalism.If you would want to take a relaxed and pleasant promenade with Harris, then hear this violin sonata, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Waste","review":"This program really rates no stars, but that is not possible, so it gets one.

The selection of visuals available to the production was apparently limited: the same ones are used over and over and frequently have no relationship to the soundtrack.

I bought a Bratz doll and a Brabie Fairytopia for my daughter. Within five minutes, I had the Barbie opened and she was playing with it very happily. Forty-five minutes later, I was still working on getting the Bratz out of the box. I finally gave up!! It is actually glued in the center in the box!!! What idiots would glue a doll into a box???? I called the company and the representative hung up on me! The next person I talked to gave me a fake email address!

You can pose them in any way and make action poses too. They are so fun and all, but they don't have a playset, to make a fight scene. So therefore I give this product a 9/10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unintentionally Hilarious","review":"This DVD is unintentionally hilarious! Only buy this DVD if you are a fan of bad ninja movies, like me and my friends. This is the perfect DVD to buy and laugh at. American Ninja 2 was pretty funny and put us to tears at one point, but American Ninja 3 was hilarious all the way through. Take note of the bad voice-overs of the children at the beginning of American Ninja 3 obviously done by adults (it's hilarious).This DVD was great. There were severals scenes we rewinded several times because they were so hilarious, and each time they made us laugh hysterically."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Ninja 2","review":"I like part 2. I'm not a fan at all of cussing and that sort of thing, but the martial arts was great. The thing that I like the most is the fact that the former undefeated world karate champion, Mike Stone, was not only the fight coordinator, but the \\"head\\" bad guy ninja. Mike is the best karate fighter in history due to his pro career with no losses. He beat Chuck Norris, Allen Steen, and many other greats of the 60's and 70's karate era. It's good to see a former champion doing fight scenes like these. The fight scenes were more realistic that what you see in most movies like Van Damme's flicks. I think Stone did a good job as a coordinator. Watch the way mike fights, he's very technical and good at what he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dudikoff and Bradley","review":"An American Ninja double-feature.

The plot, characters, and battle scenes were monotonous and bland. The political complexities ended up being linear. A has problem with B, so shoot both A and B and C wins.Very sad considering I have enjoyed the Lt. Leary series up to this book.I felt that the problem began when the majority of the focus ended up on Adele with her anti-social behavior and robotic outlook on life. You know what you get with her and because she is devoid of emotions, the book followed suit. Also, the excessive use of \\"a Mundy of Chatsworth\\" or \\"my word as a Mundy of Chatsworth\\" was very distracting.Definitely read the first 3 books, maybe the fourth, but skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Stagnate Pond","review":"This is a hard review to write for someone who loved the other stories in this series. But really, don't bother. I've had this book for months and reading more than a page or two a week is a chore. And I'm only halfway through. It's that slow. Nothing of any interest at any level has happened yet. I really should give this book a one-star rating, but the last half has to be better. Doesn't it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"RCN Still Sailin'","review":"David Drake borrows from events in Italy, circa 5th Century BC, merges it with elements from Patrick O'Brien's novels and sets it in space. This 5th book in the \\"RCN Series\\" continues the adventures of Commander Daniel Leary and his signals officer/spy/librian friend Adele Mundy. Together, with their shipmates from the corvette Princess Cecile, they confound the corrupt politicians on four planets, stop an army from invading an allied world and shoot down a blockading cruiser. The story is a little slow at several points, because the good ship & crew end up traveling back & forth several times between three planets, to obtain weapons, crewmen and even a destroyer. The author's premise for space travel appears plausible and makes readers feel they're immersed a \\"Horatio Hornblower in space\\" yarn. While it's a decent stand alone novel, it's best appreciated if you've read the previous four books."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.","review":"This is a boring book, I'm on page 247 of 293 and nobody has known that there is a shark on the water (only a kid who don't speak and a couple that known of it existent since almost the beginning of the book and don't said anything to no one). If you like mafia stories, real estates and normal people doing normal things living on the eastern coast of the USA this is your kind of book. If you are looking for a good story about a shark in the loose (that has suppose to be the mayor character) buy another book. This can't compared with the original Jaws, I wish the original Jaws was made exactly like the book. Jaws 2 is boooooooring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Effort and in Error","review":"I agree with \\"Seeker\\" and others. Not only is Protestantism poorly represented, so also is the ancient Eastern Orthodox Church - and, each of the 5 references is in error.

TV Fame doesn't make experts."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a biased viewpoint","review":"I found out all to late the book was written by christian pastors, and quickly discovered the book had a biased slant to it. The book focuses greatly on the Abrahamic religions (what a surprise) and says little about any others.I was hoping for a anyalisis of the structure of religion, how they are formed, and all that. This is like a big brochure to sign up for a religion of \\"your\\" choice (Christanity being the correct choice in the eyes of the author.)The book is little more than a reference guide of the major religions out there, and deleves no further than that, other than to preach that religion is pure good and can do no evil (the authors must never watch the news or read a newspaper)This is the kind of book you borrow from the library for quick reference. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stating the Obvious","review":"The title says it all. Religion is for dummies. Well intentioned but dummies nonetheless. I still love religious people though. Wait, I forgot, I'm an atheist I don't feel love. Only religious people love and that's because they know God and God is love. There is no love without God, a specific God written in ancient children's books preached by supremacist masters. Forgive me the sarcasm but thinking that you know there is a God and that you personally know that God is the ultimate arrogance."},{"rating":"1","title":"for general knowledge","review":"This book trys to give an upfront view, from the point of judeo/christian book reading. Most of the information is about \\"book\\" religions that dictate what to believe but does explain their religion well to those of the other religions. Suprisingly the native american religion was covered. They tried to limit their research to those of 1 million members or more. It would be good if they tried to expand this book into a series so everyone was covered , from their view ,so it is known what their view point is of the 'lesser' religions.The up front review of this book is to save the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"Only buy this book if you want to see pictures of Guppies raised by the Gan Fish Farm in Singapore. Of 55 pictures of Guppies in this book, 35 are Gan Fish and 17 are from some guy named Tanaka. That leaves only 3 pictures of other guppies. This book should have been a sales brochure for Gan and Tanaka. None of the Guppy pictures are of more recent and nicer looking strains that you see out there, at least in my opinion. In addition, the information in the book is better covered in some of the guppy web pages.

It caricatured Christians as self-righteous, intolerant and mean-spirited. The two leading Christian characters in the film rant like lunatics much of the time. Phillip E. Johnson's bookDEFEATING DARWINISM BY OPENING MINDS (available at Amazon) writes about how Christians were stereotyped.The play did get one thing right.

The entire thing was orchestrated by the Darwinists as a test case. The law on which the trial was based was merely symbolic; it wasn't meant to be enforced. The trial was anything but dramatic. It was an open and shut case: the prosecution won and Scopes was fined. The law was eventually revoked. Those who see the Scopes Trial as a victory of Science and Reason over religious dogmatism and antiquated fundamentalism don't know the facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inherit the Wind","review":"This book is extremely confusing and very hard to follow.

This is the only reason I have given it 2 stars instead of one. The ending is very obvious, as to who the killer is and like all of the other people wrote, it is totally implausible that none of the FBI agents would have noticed what was going on. The whole method of killing was ridiculous and made no sense and then .... now, for those who don't want to know the ending, don't read further........to blame it on hypnosis is ludicrous and a simplistic way to try to tie knots together. Obviously Lee Child doesn't know a thing about hypnosis, because it has been proven that while you can make people do silly tricks on stage, you can't make them do things that go against their character or will and the concept of these post hypnotic suggestions is totally bizarre. Maybe the novel should be called The Stepford Army Girls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read any Reacher book except this","review":"I love the series but the murder method in this one is so incredibly unrealistic and lame and cheap and cliche that it totally spoils what would be a really entertaining book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I've been entertained by the previous Reacher novels. This one is weak and inconsistent with the others. Reacher takes no guff from anyone, routinely slaps around multiple thugs, breaks bones and kills when necessary, but becomes a complacent servant to pencil neck FBI geeks when threatened? Hopefully, Reacher will grow a pair for the next novel. Oh, and yes, the killer is obvious way early. Look for the person who is the most unlikeable and has the most idiosyncrasies. If the author of a mystery tells you something unusual, it is for a reason to be explained later. That's in the mystery writers manual. Please Mr. Child, try harder next time. And as others have said, the murder method is absurd. A zero star rating would be too high for this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very ....Blind","review":"I'm reading all this authors books in order. I like his style short straight sentences (He isn't into the adjective game with adjectives about adjectives on top of adjectives), the good guys are slightly flawed but prevail,the bad guys fail and the stories are involved and interesting. Simple straight comfort food for an afternoon read. The reason I rated this title so low is also simple. The whole story is about the identification of the bad \\"guy\\" but the person was identifiable by the reader very very.....very early in the book. Anyone that thinks about what they are reading will have to read the following 2/3 of the book knowing the ending. Very, very, ....very tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly and Dumb","review":"Not much to say about this book. In a review of another Reacher book (\\"Echo Burning\\"), I said that these books were fun reads despite their many drawbacks as novels (careless and sloppy writing, no attention to factual accuracy, one dimensional characters, plots that rely on coincidence etc). This book is not fun, just stupid.The plot is literally incredible in many respects. The mysterious villain is telegraphed. The facts are wrong (my favorite: Fort Dix as a Marine Corps base--at the time the novel was written, it was an Army and Guard/Reserve base as it had been for over 80 years). If you can even faintly buy the ending and explanation I've got a bridge in Brooklyn that I could sell to you. Don't read it. It will only encourage the author to do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Reacher yet","review":"Did I miss something. Two books ago, Jack saves an FBI agent who just happens to be the daughter of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and grand daughter to the President. In that book Reacher came in contact with the head of the FBI and Chairman of the JCS. So now I am to believe to get Reacher to work for them (FBI) they threaten his girl-friend.What world does the author live in, in the real world one call to the agent he saved would have heads rolling..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only disappointing Jack Reacher novel","review":"I've loved all of the Jacker Reacher novels... until this one. Don't get me wrong, the story reads great, as always. However, the ending is completely disappointing. I don't want to give it away, but it's based on a stereotyped, way-overused, and completely false quasi-science that is impossible to happen the way it does in the book. When you see this plot in a TV show, you know that the writers are running out of ideas, as they always seem to eventually use this one. I expected better from Lee Child. Perhaps others can overlook that (or don't realize it's completely unreal), but it ruined the book for me.So go ahead and read it if you can't stand the thought of missing a Jack Reacher novel, but if you're new to the series, please start with another one, like The Persuader or Without Fail, or at the beginning with The Killing Floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!","review":"Good read!

It tried to be a \\"whodunnit\\" and was short on the usual Reacher mayhem. That in itself isn't terrible, but this story seemed very mechanically cranked out, got awfully repetitive and after a while I really didn't care what happened. Although the ending is a big surprise, getting there wasn't worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably Unbelievable","review":"This novel had its elements, but the basic premise was so preposterous that it undid any good aspects. The \\"bad guy\\" all but acquired magic powers in order to carry out his crimes. (In the interest of not giving away the plot, there are some misleading terms in this review.) If this sort of thing was possible, people would be using it all the time in criminal activity, but they aren't -- because it's not possible.In short, I didn't believe anything about this novel. The author must have been in a desperate mood during its composition -- even Reacher's breakup was abrupt and not well explained. I wanted to read the whole series, having started out with the first one. This one makes me want to abandon the project entirely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I usually enjoy reading the Reacher series of books. But this one disappointed me.

That being said, it does make sense to the reader at the end of the book. It's funny how I being into this series never guessed who the perp was until it was revealed to me.

I'm used to LeCarre, Ambler, Greene, Sandford and others of far better quality. Child wants the reader to believe the FBI is run by morons. While this may be the popular view, I don't subscribe to it and neither will countless others after they think about what this book suggests. I can't detail the offending matters without giving away the plot, but trust me: you don't want to waste your time or money on this. Contact me and i'll send you my copy. It won't be in my library long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on empty","review":"The fourth book in the Reacher series lacks the action, pacing and plausibilty of the earlier novels.

You just know that knowing how and why will tie the whole story together. Unfortunately, Lee Child apparently didn't have a clue about how to pull everything together when he started this book. Child's explanation might make sense in some alternate universe, but certainly not here. The ending wouldn't have been any less believable if the crimes had been blamed on space aliens.Others have already commented on Jack Reacher's poor hygiene.

It keeps you one the edge of your seat.Jack Reacher is blackmailed by the FBI to solve a series of murders that he's first been accused of and later been absolved of. Jack travels the country in an effort to solve these murders. Even at the end, when I just can't imagine how these murders are committed, Jack solves the problem and saves yet another woman.Jack is smart, interesting, well read and at times I even get a chuckle out of his comments and behavior. He is also hard and knows how to do what needs to be done in a tight situation. Jack takes care of the little guys and brings the big ugly nasties down to size. He is my new hero.This isn't my first Jack Reacher novel nor will it be my last. In fact, I even like the novels by this author that are not Reacher novels.Well worth the money.Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite inplausible.","review":"I double if the FBI Blake and dearfield are realistic characters.

I have a couple of sticking points that bothered me however. One was how vicious the FBI treats Jack at the end. It was way over the top in my opinion and the bit about the priest that makes an appearance towards the end is never really explained. I don't want to add anything else that may spoil the book for anyone. Aside from those two things I would recommend this book. I like the character of Jack Reacher, he always stays so calm and cool.

When reading his other novels, you are sometimes uncomfortable with what you suspect are cliches. In this one he writes about my home state, and it isn't simply cliche, it is absurd.

This one was on cassette tapes and they sounded like a distant echo chamber with muffled narration. In addition the story line was fluffed out with the meat being less than 40% of the time. I believe we have heard 5 others which were much better than Running Blind and suggest you skip this one, particularly if it is a cassette audiobook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Editor needed","review":"Lee Child writes American fiction with English diction. His style is lithe and flexible. I found his book engaging and engrossing and very annoying.I wanted to write him a disgruntled email asking him why he took me out of my pleasant suspension of disbelief by making me ask questions that the book had no answer to. Why does his character take only a toothbrush and have no clothes to change into? Why does he concentrate in minute and loving detail on Lisa Harper's clothes changes and forget that his hero is equally human and in need of clean clothes? Surely a hero who takes two showers in an eight hour period has some notions of human hygiene.Lee Childs notably has no long and gushing list of thanks and praise for everyone from his turtle to his manicurist, and I presume he has no editor either. I suggest he hires one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better Reacher novels","review":"For me, Running Blind is amongst Lee Child's best Reacher novels.

It just made no sense. It was fast paced and there were interesting twists, but it was fairly easy to unravel. Some of the irritating staccato dialogue was eliminated which is fine with me, but the book was still peppered with phrasing that no one in America would use. In general I enjoy the Reacher novels, but IMHO Lee Child needs to give Reacher a backpack with a change of clothes and a stick of deodorant. Female readers want to think of Reacher as a tough, sexy guy, but a week without a change of boxers gets in the way.

However, the science has since then progressed and even we the hoi poloi now know better. The most cursory research should have informed this author of the basic unsoundness of his murder method. His insistence on its use grated on my nerves and utterly destroyed any enjoyment I may have derived from the book. Characters are badly fleshed-out, awkwardly motivated, and flatter than a stack of pancakes.

I read it through, but since I already knew who the bad guy was (in what was surely the most telegraphed foreshadowing I've ever seen), and I knew the manner of killing was completely unrealistic, it was hard for me to get into it. Thrillers are cool because they *could* be true -- there was just no way this premise could be true, that's all.I don't ask much out of thrillers.

Dix New Jersey in the 60's, I did find it odd that Mr. Child referred to the sprawling Army base as a Marine Base? Silly of me to be so distracted I guess, but it stopped the story for me and I am having trouble finishing the book, but I will. I am a huge fan, though certainly disappointed to hear the rumor that TOM CRUISE will be playing Jack Reacher? I Hope that's a joke. I am a fan, and will get through this and on to book #5.

Instead it is based on an old myth that holds no truth, no I will not give it away, but expect to be disappointed. I wish that Childs' had done a little more research since his whole premise is based on something that research has showed to be impossible.

The author should make me change my mind a million times, until i finally settle on one person, who turns out to be wrong(As Child does in his previous three books).

Peter Sellers is my favorite actor but the accents he uses in this movie don't work.

When he says his lines, it's like he's reading them right off the script. Make-up! Mr. Bosley's smoking jacket! Take ten! The teen-age girls are adorable, Gilbert's mother and mother's friend are right on the mark, as well. But Paula Prentiss!

New York City looks great particularly in the scene where Walker walks through snow-covered Central Park on Christmas morning.

I had an older Nokia, similar to this model. and that phone would take a lickin' and keep on tickin. This thing, is just plastic w/ some lights. How many ways can I say it... GARBAGE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I've ever owned.","review":"This is the worst phone I've ever owned. After several months the paint has begun to chip off. The voice quality is fair at best. The battery life is terrible. Occasionally the mike stops working and the battery needs to be removed to reset the phone. When the phone is powered off, a number of settings (like the default messaging center) disappear and must be re-added.I will be replacing this phone soon and it won't be with another Nokia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Phone w/ Short Battery Life","review":"I can't think of anything to gush about with this phone. Usually I like Nokia's but have been disappointed in this one.The sound dips up and down while listening to a caller.The moving display on the front screen annoys me to no end and is difficult to read. It is a large screen on the front, yet only 10% of it is utilized. The time and number of missed calls etc moves up and down the screen. Why?My only hope is that perhaps if I feel like reading the manual this can be customized.And the battery....it is CONSTANTLY beeping at me because it needs to be recharged. It is ridiculous how poor the battery life is!Basically, this is just a generic phone to me. I am struggling to find reasons that I like this phone over others. I can't think of a feature that makes it stand out above the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"nokia 6126 has 2 very bad features","review":"I had 2 of these phones sent to me (the first one was bad).

In terms of the discography and his collected works, I personally think the top 5 are: Fly Like An Eagle, The Joker, Book of Dreams, Sailor and this CD.If you enjoy Fly Like An Eagle, Book of Dreams or The Joker, you'll like this CD. What's a shame is his record company (with the exception of the 30th anniv. \\"Fly\\") has not remastered his major works and you can't even purchase this from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of the best","review":"Star Wars, the world within our own, has been an escape and a fantasy for people around the world for 25 years. With the new prequels, a new breed of genius has taken the visual cues from Episode 1 and have developed an evolving world that leads into the dismal grey world of the original trilogy. Lead Art Director Doug Chiang, Ian McCaig, Jay Shuster, Ed Natividad, Ryan Church, Eric Tiemens and others bring together visual assault and appropriate culture cues to develop a wide array of designs and illustrations for Episode 2. If you are an artist, or are interested in the production level of film artistry, then this is a must have book. From the magnificent simplicity of the vehicle designs, to the flowing, organic genius of the character designs, this culmination of artwork is a glimpse into the world we continue to love and grow with."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must buy","review":"I debated on whether to buy the hardcover or wait until the paperback came out. I was more interested in the clothes designs than anything else. I'm glad I didn't wait! I loved all of it. The art work alone is worth the money for the book. I loved how they talked about the development of the designs from the sets to characters. This is a book worth buying and the hardcover will last a lot longer than the paperback book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Lights, Small Type","review":"Nice art.Small text and caption numbers.Read in bright light.Nice tie-in of illustrations to screenplay that may be missed by some. It's pretty subtle.Result: Though the book is poorly designed, the illustrations are beautiful making The Art of Star Wars The Attack of the Clones a must for any Star Wars and Sci Fi movie fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great look at the art behind Star Wars","review":"Length:: 0:22 MinsThis art book is noticeably better that the already good The Art of Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace.This time round, even more details are added to the concept art. Most of the sketches are now coloured. As usual, the pages are filled to the brim with character designs, environment paintings, storyboards, sculptures and ships. All drawings are captioned by the individual artists on the idea they are trying to bring across.In some ways, the character designs and sketches look better on book than in the movie. The environment paintings are just epic.Included also, at the back of the book, is the full script for the movie.This book is highly recommended to sci-fi artists, concept artists and of course Star Wars fans.(More pictures are available on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Una gran compilación","review":"Para todos los amantes de Star Wars en latinoamérica, este es un libro que se debe tener.

Además, el guión entrega una mayor visión de lo que ocurre en la vida de Anakin Skywalker, en su paso hacia el lado oscuro."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not that good.","review":"Beautiful illustrations rendered in marker and wonderful costume sketches. A very interesting read, but for the amount of money i paid for it, i expected more. It could have done with some fullblown, full colour screenshots (the final effect after all the study work) and i wished more attention was paid to the panorama of the planets. Coruscant, Naoboo and Tatooine would have been lovely to see; their screenshots taken aerially and spanned over a page. I expected at least some screenshots, sadly there are none. But that aside, everything proved to be a wonderfully 'read'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine children's book about the Mummers parade in Philadelphia","review":"This is a book from my childhood by an author who often wrote about Philadelphia.

Brings vegan cooking to a whole new level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must like spices, ethnic food","review":"My husband is a vegan who got this book as a gift. If you do not enjoy foods with strong spices, or different ethnic foods, this is not a book for you. As a non-vegan, I was expecting the vegan foods to try to closely imitate the tastes of their non-vegan equivalents. This is not the case and it left me quite disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, a keeper!","review":"I've only made a few recipes from this book so far: Bowties with Buttons (i eliminated the kasha as my family is picky, but it still made an interesting side dish!), the Chocolate Chip Cookies--very good and didn't require any esoteric ingredients!, and the Lasagna Primavera, which was admittedly a bit time consuming but well worth it as both my husband and 4 year old enjoyed it. I think i'll be making quite a few recipes out of this book, if only to expose my family to more ethnic flavors and dishes. I gave the book four stars just because i have had to tweak seasonings--the vegan bechamel sauce was a bit bland without some garlic and salt, and the tofu filling for the lasagna called for parsley which is fine but not very flavorful for an Italian dish. I would rather she had exact measurement for salt and pepper instead of \\"to taste\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best vegan cookbook by far!","review":"If your vegan, you know that its tough to make or find good food. Every single dish (and there have been plenty of them) that I have made from this cookbook has been 100% delicious. The consistancy is impecable. I have many cookbooks and this one is by far the best. The recipes are easy to follow and the varity of dishes is what keeps me opening it up night after night. I recommend this cookbook to anyone who is interested in having GOOD vegan food. I have served some dishes from this book to my non vegan or non vegetarian friends and they have said \\"wow, i could totally go vegan if you cooked for me.\\" You wont be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time consuming...","review":"I live in a fairly small city, so we only have the basic big brand grocery stores here. Some of the things in these recipes are expensive and difficult to find. Also, the recipes are pretty time consuming. The food is deliscious though, so if you don't spending a little (time and money), you'll probably be quite pleased with the meals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Simple Book","review":"This is a great cookbook if you are looking for healthy vegetarian meals. I am not a Vegan, but most vegetarian cookbooks rely so heavily on milk and cheese I don't find them useful. This book is great for both beginning and advanced cooks. Most recipes don't have too many ingredients or steps so it is very unintimidating.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of great recipes!","review":"I have already found many great recipes in this book.

I also own Veganomicon (which has received rave reviews) but it doesn't compare to this one. Every recipe I've tried in Vegan Planet is AWESOME. I especially like the Pumpkin Pie Pancakes, Pad Thai, and Baked Beans. This is a must have cookbook for any vegan, and ESPECIALLY aspiring vegetarians and vegans. Get out there and buy it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quantity not Quality","review":"Everything I made was mediocre at best and there are so many other vegan cookbooks out there that I got rid of this one after it sat unused for years so that I could make room for better vegan cookbooks. Don't waste your money, get Vegan with a Vengeance and Veganomicon and start from there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, with Errors","review":"I found this book largely disappointing. The savory dishes I tried were uniformly bland. I made it a practice to double the spices, and still found them bland. I tried one dessert, a fruit cobbler, which contained an unfortunate typo. (do not put 2/3 cup sugar in the fruit, they are supposed to get only 2 tbsp) This cost me a large amount of fairly expensive fruit, plus an extra helping of frustration.Those looking for a comprehensive vegan cookbook would do better with \\"Veganomicon.\\" I also like \\"Vegan with a Vengeance.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"great Vegan cooking and lifestyle","review":"Not only are there hordes of recipes, but also a wonderful section on vegan lifestyle and helpful things to know for new vegans (like vegan egg substitutes, where to buy vegan shoes, and how you are helping to save the planet).

It trimmed the nose hairs as well as trimmed up my ear hair very well. I made sure I maintained it well, cleaning it regularly etc. But after one year it sounded like it was working at full speed but it started to trim only about half of the hairs. Then it started to only work sporadically. I would change the battery to no avail and then suddenly it would start up again. But now it makes a very lazy wirring sound when it runs and barely trims anything. I give this item 5 stars for the year it worked and understand that all products do often have a certain life span. But whatever the cost of this item 1 year is just not acceptable. So for as a lasting, working product it gets barely 2 stars. I will buy another brand and caution other buyers to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely unfunctional","review":"I bought this model a year ago and have never had it effectively cut nose hair.

The Buddhist concepts explained were the clearest and most easy to understand yet, even on the topic of emptiness.I highly recommend this book if you want to learn about Buddhism, whether you're interested in Star Wars or not.

Before I read this book, I thought I was going to have to make all those screentones myself! Boy, was I wrong! :D This book tells you what materials you'll need to write and draw your own manga, and describes them in great detail! However, I only gave this book 4 stars because...-It doesn't describe how to draw people very well. If you've mastered that (which I haven't), the book's fine.-It barely has any information on paneling.-The first few pages are colored digitally. A bit ironic that there are pages colored digitally in a book that gives instructions on how to draw traditionally, don't you think?Overall, if you're still a beginner, this book is not for you.

I thought it was cheap ($20 item, around $10 shipping), but now I realize it isn't.Maybe I will start with the negative aspect of the product: Too simple, only one big and one small compartments, with the small one being the front pocket. In addition, The straps are small. I am big, but I see many larger people than me around and to be honest if you are aroun XL or XXL size it would be quite uneasy to put the backpack over a jacket as its straps are simply too short.The good part: it looks durable, does the business, and now I will keep it as a spare since I now have another one(Not JanSport:) but sill, the price somehow appears to be alittle too much for me. For the same amount I gave I could find a real nice Adidas or Nike (original ones:) back in my country."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"This backpack is very soft cloth.

He liked the design; I liked the Jansport brand (I have had several Jansport backpacks and always was very happy). Well, the backpack was so thin I could read this review online through the material. The backpack was so lightweight that my son's water bottle could put a hole through its side. The bottom had such little support that a wet paper grocery bag would provide superior results. In summary -- I returned the product the day after it arrived at my home. I actually contacted the seller and asked him/her if this was a knock-off, and he reassured me that it was a genuine product. Although I couldn't believe him completely, the vendor was very nice and professional about returning the backpack."},{"rating":"1","title":"too different in color","review":"The color of the real thing is dark gray which is very ugly.

Go to a store and look at it first and buy it there. I would have never EVER bought this bag if I was able to check it out first.

It can hold all of my school books, but I'm thankful that I don't have to bring them all at once. Front zipper pocket is very large and holds my pen pouch, a small purse, and cd player.

I remember carrying even more books in high school, so yeah, that's out too. When you get this, you're really just paying for the name brand. They pocket the difference by sacrificing quality.1. Smaller than it looks.2. Very thin fabric.3. The joke they call 'padding' doesn't keep the sharp edges of any book from sticking into your back.4. The straps feel very weak, and I don't feel comfortable carrying all my books in it.5. The backpack has a tendency to 'slide' down; the buckle doesn't hold the straps well, so the nylon slides past it and causes the straps to loosen against your will."},{"rating":"2","title":"backpack","review":"This is a great backpack, it is very durable and looks great.

I hoped that it would be a follow-up to Wilkerson's book, The Vision - I was disappointed. Although a call to holiness is good (it will produce a wonderful and peaceful life), it is Jesus' holiness and righteousness bought with His precious blood that covers the Church - not our performance. No one is going to get any approval from God through performance (e.g., constant repentings, altar calls, tithes, fastings, prayer marathons, and other gimmicks - too many to mention here). It is trusting and (get this)BELIEVING that the blood (and nothing else) is enough. Through Grace we no longer act from fear and liability but from love and responsibility. We evangelical Christians need to forget about the old testament and move into the new one if we are going to convince others that our Jesus is \\"The Real Deal.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiocy","review":"Throw rational thinking right out the window if you want to like anything Wilkerson writes these days. After reading his earlier book, \\"the Vision,\\" you'd think he'd have learned that his ability to prophesy the future was non-existent. But no, having learned nothing from the errors he made there, he's back to try again. This time he tells us that America will soon (note: he wrote this book in 1985) be destroyed by a nuclear attack by Russia. He then goes on to decry such evils as watching TV and listening to Christian rock music, twisting logic and scripture to such a degree that I doubt God Himself could recognize it if he read this book. Wilkerson used to be a rational thinker, more focussed on ministering to addicts and gang members. Now all he cares about it making one false prophecy after another, seemingly without the shred of honesty he would need to know that they aren't coming true."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull horror film","review":"This film pretends to be different.

This one is slightly--slightly--better than Konga, Gough's horrible giant ape movie, if only because there is not as much reliance on horrible special effects. But it is really bad. Gough shouts and screams constantly, giving a truly terrible, artificial performance. I know he is a good actor, so he obviously was not taking this role seriously; but it's sort of cynical to take the money and then turn in such a bad performance. The perky, young actresses set new lows in bad acting, but then they were not hired for their acting abilities. The script is idiotic. Among other things, why would a shrewd old lady attempt to blackmail a mad killer in her deserted shop while he has a pair of ice tongs in his hands?! She might as well wear a \\"kill me\\" sign!

However, upon his return he learned that another man, Dr. Cook, was claiming that he had reached the North Pole nearly a year earlier.This book was very well written and engaging. It was written in a storytelling fashion rather than a dry recitation of facts and details.

The card has been running great on my Windows 2000 Pro machine with no problems. The software is a nice addition and I can even see me neighbors access point. The antenna is removable so that if I do need a better signal I can attach a better antenna on the back.Answer: If you have a DI-614+ (22Mbps) and you are going to get a wireless PCI adapter you should definitely get the DWL-520+ (22Mbps). Gget the DWL-G520 (54Mbps) if you have a 54Mbps Access Point. The best speeds you can get with the 520+ and the 614+ are about 10-12Mbps real throughput. With the G520 and the 614+ you will only get 4-6Mbps at best because 54Mbps will step down to 11Mbps not down to 22Mbps.

This is the result if you take bad editing, stolen scenes, and no plot and throw money at it.From the beginning where Neil Shaw (Wesley Snipes) gets in a fight at a major event and the event \\"never happened\\" to the public to the scene where a sniper kills a major diplomat at a major U.N. event. Does no one have security details in these things?His intuition of bombs in backpacks and the events that happened in the translators apartment are also quite unbelievable. If he's that talented shouldn't he be working for Ms. Cleo instead of risking his butt?The ending to this movie is a direct rip off of \\"The Matrix\\", unfortunately neither of the characters are superheroes so it comes off as ridiculous.Don't Waste your Money. And someone please convince Wesley Snipes not to waste his time or talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Movie, Substandard Acting","review":"I wasn't expecting too much when I rented The Art of War, just some mindless action entertainment. In all reality there isn't enough action in this film. Wesley Snipes plays a role that he's played a thousand times before, renegade cop. The plot twists in this film are right out of the 1990's action screen writing handbook. One thing I will say in favor of this film is that the martial arts sequences were accurately portrayed. Good hand to hand combat sequences and no Matrix style garbage. The plot is actually not bad, involving the UN and a US/China free trade agreement but The Art of War is not worth the time. Wesley Snipes should actually starting reading the scripts he chooses to sign on for."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Excuse for a Film","review":"It's final. Wesley Snipes has been type cast. No one can deny that. In this action thriller, Snipes plays Neil Shaw, a covert operative working for the U.S. Government. After years of service, one of his team-mates gets killed and then he is pinned for the death of a high foreign national. Now he is on the run looking for the person who did this to him. This is nowhere near Snipes' best. In my opinion Jungle Fever or Boiling Point show his true acting ability. It is overly violent, using Matrix style matial arts as one of its' the key selling points. I figured out the so-called \\"mystery\\" in the first few minutes of the movie. Even with a talent filled supporting cast; Donald Sutherland (Disclosure, Shadow Conspiracy), Anne Archer (Patriot Games), and Michael Biehn (Aliens, Terminator). This movie couldn't be helped. One to steer clear of it at all possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not that good","review":"This is one of those movies that starts and ends like hundreds of others do. It seems like I had already seen this movie before. The action scenes were just like any other action movie.

Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be fast paced action film with a great cast and high production values. I'm not talking about a great film, but still very entertaining compared with most of the drivel from Hollywood. I could not understand all the bad reviews. Then a started to get a nasty suspicion which was confirmed when I read some of the Amazon reviews. Apparently this country has been so intimidated by the extreme right in this county that any piece of fiction that is critical of these wackos is rejected out of hand by the media.

What happened to the cool detachment and finely-drawn characters of \\"Being John Malkovich\\"? Sorry, Charlie, but your own writers-block is never good material for a film, especially when it turns out this overplayed and underwritten.

He had lots of frustrations--including the computer writing 3/4 of a wonderfully good novel. Unfortunately, he wasn't a good enough author to finish it.The last two lines of the story were a repeat of the lines that began it--giving the impression of a computer writing a story about a computer writing a story...I hadn't thought about this story in years but after watching this movie I did.

A hint for those of you who are considering watching this, keep asking yourself: Who is writing the screen play now? I loved the realizations that I went through as I started to \\"get it\\". The acting is really superb, the characterizations are interesting, the snippets of \\"The Orchid Thief\\" are great.

I just think that maybe the events in the swamp after Cage is held hostage by Streep and Cooper are a bit too much. They feel somewhat contradictory to the previous pace and angle of the film, it's a brainy movie that in the end resorts to suspense and violence to carry out the necessary change in the main character and resolve itself. I think that Kaufman could have managed to resolve the story successfully in a more subtle way. In any case, he delivers it.But it is a movie for people who like to reflect on the creative process, so, in a sense, if you're not the intellectual type, don't go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Nicholas Cage","review":"Agreat movie, the actors were good, the plot also was good.

This is even a little less impressive as it concerns the reliable dramatic device of a man and his twin brother, who may or may not be a figment of the other's imagination.

Reviewers that give this thing more than two stars are doing a prospective buyer no favor. Cage remains his usual one-dimensional self. The story is...boring. Very few of us are going to hang in there with a tale of a flower. Trust me on this one guys! The \\"twin brothers\\" (Cage in both roles) are confusing, as Cage is still Cage. Set your sights higher and buy any other new release. You can only improve your shopping cart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year!","review":"Went to see this movie as the critics all gave raving reviews. First suspected something might be wrong when I saw there was no one else in the theatre. Walked out halfway through the film (something I have not ever done before).If you think Hollywood and the movie making business is the center of the universe, and thoughly enjoy stories about screwed up people - then you might like this movie. If on the other hand you see making movies as only a very small part of the real world, and if you don't enjoy mucking through the details of messed up lives - then this movie is a waste of time.Frankly, even a \\"1 star\\" rating for this movie is too high!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cage at his most annoying; most overrated film of the year","review":"This movie could have been written by a film school student with no talent. The plot is trivially simple: a screenwriter can't think of a decent screenplay, so he writes a screenplay about himself trying to write a screenplay. Oh, and did I mention you get to see several scenes of Nicholas Cage masturbating? And a scene of Meryl Streep snorting hallucinogenic drugs? Why didn't anyone think of this sooner? Maybe because it's immature, gimmicky, and totally pointless. Cage and Streep have hit their respective low points."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what i was thinking","review":"Ok, I don't know about you but i could not get into this movie it draged on and was just dull to me, It could not keep my attention i turned it off half way into it.Eevn though it has Niclas Cage , Meryl Streep and Chis Cooper who are top names it just didn't do it for me . Maybe i should give it another chance but why bother? One star for trying.sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adaptations","review":"This had to be the worst dissapointment I have viewed in a long time. I bought this DVD haven read \\"The Orchid Thief\\" which was a great book;much more than I can say for the movie.I am surprised the author of \\"The Orchid Thief\\" approved the script of this movie.It was slow at the beginning and slow at the end and everywhere in between.

Kaufman was assigned to write a movie about Susan Orlean's \\"The Orchid Thief\\", but instead he came up with a biography of himself and his failure to make an adaptation of the book. This isn't a film it's a documentary of Kaufman's failure to screenwrite."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of time..","review":"The movie is so lame and boring!! And what irritated me the most was the character played by Nicolas Cage - Charles Kaufman. He is such a pathetic loser, halfway thru I wanted to jump into the movie and slap him hard !This is one of those attempts to show a messed up movie and characters, try and make a mix of fantasy-n-reality. Some directors know how to do it and it works, but Spike Jonze is not one of them.And to top it all, the ONLY special which the DVD contains is the theatrical trailer!!!!!!!!! Nothing else. Run away, faaar faaar away.Hmmm..one thing which I wanted to say that there are 2 car crash sequences in this movie which were like - friggin' amazing. Gave me quite a jolt. Just mentioned, that's all..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Adaptation is a beautiful process\\"","review":"In this film, adaptation has two meanings. The confusing but brilliant story follows a Hollywood screenwriter Charlie Kaufman (Nicolas Cage). Who is struggling miserably to adapt Susan Orlean's \\"The Orchid Thief\\" to a screenplay. With his twin brother Donald (also Cage) who also becomes a screenwriter, both their stories blend in beautifully when they help each other escape the swamp from Orlean and John Laroche (Chris Cooper) who are armed with rifles. Adaptation comes with a fantastic screenplay written by the real Charlie Kaufman. Chris Cooper won an academy award for best supporting actor. One of the year's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great","review":"This is such a wonderful movie, could have been great. so different, interesting, thoughtful... but then it does falter.. it throws in the car chase, the pursuit, the murder, alligator attack... sheesh......the screenwriter obviously ran out of steam (though this is exactly predicted in the movie's story, but still it fails).. or was fearful that it couldn't make a profit as it was.So, I watch it to that point and turn it off, and it is quite good that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and sooo different...","review":"I will admit that when I first started watching this movie I thought..\\"Oh No..this is going to be a boring one..\\"...I was so wrong. Give this movie a chance because once it begins to really build its momentum..it just keeps getting wilder and wilder. I found it interesting that it was sort of like a movie within a movie, and though I havent been pleased with his work lately, I think that Nicholas Cage was phenomenal in this flick. I highly recommend this. I can guaraantee that it is unlike anything that you have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"The first 80% or so of the film are boring. If you try to conceal your lack of ideas by writing a story about lack of ideas... and jumping back and forth in time... Then there is obviously enough of surprise, sex, violence, drugs, and dead bodies to boost the IMDB ratings to incredible levels. I regret watching it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those of us who never got to see The Verve in concert...","review":"This video was absolutely fabulous! Unfortunately, I never got to see the Verve in concert. Fortunately, I discovered \\"The Verve - Video 96-98\\". After it, I came to the conclusion that this band has been very under-rated, particularly in the U.S. They are so talented, the music they created along with Richard Ashcroft's voice is just perfect!! Best of all, you get to see live concert footage, which was a great treat for me, since I never got to see them live. If you're a fan of the Verve now, you will be blown out of your mind when you see this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying for all verve fans!","review":"I just can see this over and over again to satisfy the still-very-verve-me. But i thought it might have been better if the interviews with the fans could have been more musical than 'I love Richard but he doesn't love me'. Verve is about music, vigour for music and life... and more behind-the-scenes and older songs from A storm in heaven or the E.P would be great. It's the 'new mainstream' merchandise for the 'Urban Hymns' fans but i really wish someone could just get a video collection of live sets or scenes with all their older songs...and if any one can get hold of Voyager... tat will be awesome! So are we expecting a collection of Richard's new videos?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic from start to finish.","review":"From the opening scenes of Richard Ashcroft playing a demo of \\"Drugs Don't Work\\" by himself with an acoustic, through the live footage of The Verve performing songs such as Bittersweet, this video retains my attention throughout. Very cool interview footage set often in the background of performance footage, detailing some of the band's ill-fated confidences, helps to provide insights into what the members thought while they were together. There's a very heavy, psychedelic feel to much of this video, with the live performance of \\"Life's An Ocean\\" truly blowing me away. Great performances, with an unreleased demo version of \\"Space and Time\\" and instrumental of \\"Velvet Morning\\" help to round out what I consider to be an excellent viewing, and listening, experience. A video I've watched many times, and will probably continue to watch in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious!","review":"A bunch of (...) singing songs.

Woody Allen wrote <Bullets over Broadway> \\"People dont tawk wike dat!\\" And in this book they dont. There is nothing in here worth reading, out of a college assimilation course (Which I hope doesnt exist because no one deserves to read this.) The whole book is about some Chinese maid living in a Jewish families house in China, but the characters are too many and too complex, don't expect to be able to relate to any of them.Just a warning!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peony","review":"Peony is a book of great detail and drama. You could picture every scene and action that each character takes with the descriptive words written by Pearl S. Buck.Peony has been a bondmaid in the House of Ezra all her life. She has played, talked, and spent all her time with David, Ezra and Madame Ezra's only son, since her childhood, and has grown to love him. But Peony's love is more than a sisterly love. Due to traditions it is forbidden for Peony and David to wed. Now during the years as a servant by David's side Peony must try to resolve her love for him.Peony is a realistic fiction book that is full of tragedy and despair that keeps drawing you in with each chapter and page you turn. Based on true events that happened in China over a century ago Peony is a remarkable book that will teach you a lesson about courage and letting go of the one you love most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"This book is another great Pearl Buck story. The characters tend to stay with you even after you finish reading ----- in my estimation, that is a sign of good character developement on the part of the writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peony Review","review":"Peral S. Buck is one of my favorite authors, but this book was not the best. I might have misread the summary before ordering it, but I thought it was about Peony marrying a foreigner. Although it is a narrative about her love, it dragged on. The history of the jewish colony in China was interesting. I would not choose to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"In my opinion, Buck's greatest novel. I have read this book dozens of times and will read it more. Every time I read it, I am completely engrossed in the meaning behind every word. I'm satisfied with the way things turned out even though I was not at first. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Buck","review":"My grandmother put the book Peony by Pearl Buck in my hands when I was about 14 years old. I hadn't even heard of The Good Earth!

It doesnt make sense to me why they would even advertise this feature if it wont even work with their own products.

One thing leads to another, and, of course, Nancy saves the day once again, not excepting an offered reward. This, like many of the later re-writes in the 70's, is dull, lifeless, and stale. The writing is bland and there is no charector development whatsover. I have read every yellow-spined Nancy and have to say that about only half the set is any good. If you possibly can, try to read the originals written by Mildred Wirt during the 30's and 40's....the golden-age of Nancy Drew, although (most) of the revised and later ones are not bad (some of them classics), the originals are the best...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish it were better","review":"Since I was teaching the short story I wanted to also show the film.Loved seeing young Harry Belefonte and early Zero Mostel but the film does not haveimpact of the short story and drags.

The theme of a man's need to believe in something resonates.But the plot goes in a different direction, much of it is about the angel. And the language is often harsh and the movie itself resembles The Pawnbroker in its cynical and harsh view of New York life at that time.Mostel is perfect, I believe every word and action of him. Belafonte would be a great choice as the angel if the plot eliminated the earthiness and self-pitying of his character and stressed the idea of him as an angel. As for the rest of the cast, Milo O'Shea as a Jewish doctor?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Understanding of Angels","review":"The only reason I'm reviewing this movie is to caution traditional values families not to waste their time on it. The premise to the story could be a wonderful portrayal of a man's search for meaning in life and for God. But the so-called angel has no hesitation to use the Name of the Lord in vain . . . and often. My wife couldn't believe how contra-real-angel he was.

She is definitely a hypocrite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite character development","review":"Edith Wharton gives us a beautiful gift with Ethan Frome. She paints such vivid, lovely, yet desperate images with words; you can envision the blue colors of the snow of New England so clearly. The greatest strength of this novella is its character portrayal. Wharton makes the reader care so much for Ethan and Mattie...and even feel the great sadness of Zeena's life. The reader leaves this story with a greater amount of compassion for the needs and longings of fellow humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for you if you like happy endings!","review":"Don't read this one if you're looking for a happy ending. Luckily, I knew ahead of time that it was comparable to a Greek tragedy. I probably wouldn't have read it if it hadn't been such a short book (99 pages). But, I figured that I could easily give up such a small amount of time for a classic. I enjoyed Edith Wharton's writing style, and will probably read more of her works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as bad as everyone says","review":"Perhaps this is one book that shouldn't be assigned in English classes throughout the country. It seems that noone who is \\"forced\\" to read Ethan Frome actually enjoys it. I picked this up during an Edith Wharton phase and really enjoyed it. It is short and gripping. Ethan is a pathetic character who has to deal with the consequences of his actions for the rest of his life. By trying to escape his shrewish wife, he only tied himself to her more completely. Ethan Frome is a sad novel about doomed romance and the desperation of New England winters. I would not recommend it as an Edith Wharton primer, try Summer or The Buccaneers first. Once you have gotten hooked on Wharton, give Ethan Frome a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great... must read!","review":"this was a great and beautifully written story... i'm not someone who is into romantic books but this was one of the few i love!

His wife was annoying, her cousin was a ditz, and he was a loser. The plot was predictable and the only suspense was if Zeena would kill Mattie over the Pickle Dish. This whole book was one terribly acted out soap oprah that had really no plot twists at all, no action of any kind, or any really flavor. Ethan and the gang were in a story that was little more than mushed up pasty muck. The only real unpredicatable part was the end, which actually livened the book a little...but that's at the end of course. I'd tell you the ending, but I don't want to ruin it, you'll have to waste your own time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one.","review":"I read Ethan Frome because my school requires it. However, I can't imagine why. The book would be deperessing if you felt some emotion while reading it. Ethan Frome centers on a man who wants to leave his wife and marry someone else. The only redeeming part of this book is nobody dies. Don't waste your time and money with Ethan Frome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best way to spend money","review":"I read this book because it was recommended to me. I can't imagine why. It has all the emotions of a rock, has no depth, nor did it strike my interest in any way. For nearly the entire book, I found myself criticizing the main characters for their lameness and stupidity. It is now taking up space somewhere in a corner, and will probably remain there until it turns to dust. There was only one good thing about this book: it was short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reading Ethan Frome has all the pleasures of swallowing a porcupine","review":"I hate this book more than any other I've read. Edith Wharton indulges herself in a meticulous catalog of imaginary human misery.

Rather it was the lowest possible form of fiction about a man who thinks he is in love, but is not. His life is merely so depressing that he would jump anything that came along. I did not find any value or enjoyment out of this novel what-so-ever, and that is not just me being cruel, because I am trying to be as kind as i possibly can.

The unrequited romance between Ethan and Mattie, the sickness of Zeena, the botched suicide attempt, and the life on a cold, unproductive New England farm made the book very very depressing, and overall was a representation of stagnation.A very hard book to get into. I had to read it for school, and found it to be a chore. Despite the tragedies that are otherwise interesting, yet disturbing, Edith Warton unfortunately presents them in a bland, and rather impersonal manner. It has been hailed as a great novel, but I wouldn't call it essential reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wharton used a dictionary of symbolism to write this book.","review":"While I have no objection to this book's ultimate chilling conclusion about justice (or lack thereof) in life, I found Edith Wharton's style deplorable. In short: \\"Here. I just thought up an excellent symbol, and it's really obvious what it stands for. But still, because I'm oh-so-proud of myself, let me tell you exactly what it means.\\"The only use for this book is as an instruction book in identifying symbolism -- but even for that, it's a bit too basic and clearcut.

I read it mostly for the mellifluous prose. This book, however, is dull in every sense. The prose are flat and spare. The story is flat and spare. And I hate it. It was boring. Usually her stories are engaging, interesting, and hard to put down. I knew when I bought this book it would be bad. I asked myself, \\"What the hell does Edith Wharton know about indigent peasants?\\" And after reading \\"Ethan Frome\\" I realized she knew nothing! Stick to the glittering affluent New York life that you knew and were a part of.

If this was the first book by Wharton that someone has read, they probably won't read any of her others, which is totalluy wrong, because she is a great author. This particular book however, is far to depressing and boring to be on the top of anyone's list. It is so boring that sometimes you can be reading the boo, yet not taking any in, and when you \\"wake up\\" you find yourself lost, not knowing where you are in relation to where you left off. It is my beleif that this book probably loses most of its readers after the first few chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just lovely","review":"If you've read other Wharton works, you suspect her denouement in a case of forbidden love, but nonethless, \\"Ethan Frome\\" is compelling to read.

She takes you to New England in the winter of a simpler time and tells a small story transcendently. So good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rosebud does them in","review":"Plowing through this novel was as arduous and monotonous as the long snowy carriage rides from Ethan's homestead to the town of Starkfield. Did I just complete a grueling meditation retreat? It was mercifully short, though, not even 140 pages, and it does offer glimmers of intellectual satisfaction amidst the text's long zazen session. Most of the character descriptions pop off the page with vividness. Mattie's way of \\"throwing her head back when she was amused, as if to taste her laugh before she let it out\\" was pure literary gold, and the various ponderous descriptions of Ethan's countenance, that he had a \\"moral isolation too remote for casual access\\" and could feel \\"huge cloudy meanings behind the daily face of things\\" served as charitable descriptions of a man with Job-like tragedy in his life. Overall, if you are budgeting just one Edith Wharton novel for your reading list, I wouldn't choose Ethan Frome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early 20th Century love triangle","review":"This is a short story of a love triangle forcing a man to choose between his sick wife and her cousin. For being written in 1911, it is not the worst book ever published, but today's readers who are experiencing it for the first time will find it dull and lifeless.

He falls in love with Zeena's cousin (Mattie) who is staying with them in order to help out, and because she needs a place to live.

Zeena has some clue that their is something going on between them. She tells Ethan that she is going to send Mattie away and bring someone who is more helpful. Ethan doesn't want her to leave and he wants to leave with her, but doesn't have enough money. While Ethan is taking Mattie to the train station they stop and get on a sleigh one last time.

Jeffrey Brown deserves more attention -- the illustrations were great.Elizabeth Ammons took a straightfoward story and post-neo-racia-femini-homo-colonia-hegemoni-classstruggled it in her introductory notes. This is what passes for scholarship? Good grief. This book is not so difficult to understand, that she had to decide that race underscores the whole thing. And Toni Morrison as an expert opinion leader? I'm insulted, but I'm not surprised.Last, one would think in a world where Howard Zinn's corrupt scholarship has been so thoroughly discredited, that scholars would be reluctant to cite him so prominently in their work.

It grows on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and Poignant","review":"Edith Wharton's short novel may not have the dimensions of her \\"Age of innocence\\" work when it comes to social codes, love and loss, but it is such a gem! the esoteric quest for love which may come with pain and isolation is magnificent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing happened","review":"This book was the most uneventful book I have ever read. I kept waiting for a big scene or something interesting to happen. The only halfway interesting thing happened at the very end and it wasnt even that good.

He finds some \\"excitement\\" when Mattie comes to visit, but again, the reader wonders why, because she's vapid and uninteresting. To recap: we're presented with characters that aren't the least bit likable to begin with, and turn pages eagerly waiting for The Happy Ending. Instead, Wharton ends with all three characters living together and making each other even more miserable. I feel like I wasted three precious hours of lifetime reading this book.

Set in the remote countryside of western Massachusetts, Ethan Frome explores the effects of isolation from society and social settings in general. Ethan Frome struggles to decide whether to stay with his bland wife or leave with the younger Mattie. In the end, all that Ethan Frome amounts to is a sappy soap opera that ends with a failed suicide attempt.

Obviously it had an impact on me. Other reviews here say, \\"Boring, nothing happened, the man was stupid and made stupid choices.\\" That was exactly the point! At the age of 14 it was brought home to me that it is easy to get into a situation where one small bad decision after another leads you to a life that is just plain awful. It encouraged me to consider the concequences of my actions 5, 10, even 20 years down the road. The concepts in this book are relevant to so many modern situations (How will your later life be affected if you get pregnant/do drugs/flunk school now?) A smart English teacher will incorporate these discussions into any class requiring this book for reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful of What You Wish For","review":"Obviously, high-school aged people who are \\"forced\\" into reading this will find it boring and long-winded. What a shame; I hope you all have good teachers who can teach this wonderful book in a way to make it vivid and real for you. Wharton is a rare writer who can take a simple winter's day and turn it into a finely-wrought canvas. The story of Ethan Frome itself is very interesting and I myself read the book from cover to cover in one sitting. The ending is a surprise, and brings to mind the old adage: Be careful of what you wish for. You might get it.Perhaps because this book is almost ninety years old and doesn't have a splashy, gory cover or jacket blurbs from modern hacks, it appears to young people as boring. Again : what a shame. You don't know what you're missing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow Moving, but Worth the Time","review":"I picked this book out of the library just by chance. I started reading it, and, if I didn't pursue it, I would never have finised it. It was so boring in the beginning, and way through the middle, but at the end is where I couldn't put it down.

The best part is that Ethan and Mattie got what they deserved at the end of the bookI would recommend this book to anyone who likes the romantic-type novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing...","review":"For starters, nothing good happens in this book. Why is it that books assigned to schoolkids (statistically the most likely to commit suicide and suffer from depression) are usually relentlessly depressing? I found this novel extremely hard to get through, not just because of its dark subject matter but because I wanted to run, screaming, from these characters and the setting.BTW, I also hated the Great Gatsby, so there.I give it two stars because the quality of the writing is pretty high, but this is a book few (sadists?) would read for enjoyment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring......","review":"If u enjoy reading tragic love stories then this is the book for you! This book bored me to death. It might be short but it takes forever to read! I rate this book two because it didn't go anywhere. It only took place at the farm and had only three characters.

It is very descriptive."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was FORCED to read this book.","review":"Yeah, I had to read it for an english class, which stinks in the first place because having to pick apart every novel you read in high school will discourage any kid from reading--and I'm on the Literary Mag! I have to admit, I saw the movie before the book, just because I love Liam, who played a wonderful Ethan. This book's other characters, you know besides Ethan Zeena and Mattie, were so flat and had no point. I really didn't understand who any of the other people in the book were accept maybe their jobs in the town. With that many flat characters, how can it be interesting? Only the end is enjoyable, and then when it goes back into the author's view, it becomes (and ends) boring again. See the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Passion","review":"I am fascinated by the way the author portrays Ethan Frome. She begins the novel from the view of a visitor to the little town of Starkfield. This visitor is intrigued by the solemn, crippled man and gradually learns more of his life story. Ethan had previosuly married Zeena out of pure desperation for a human companion. Their marriage quickly turns stale. When Mattie comes to work as a housemaid, Ethan grows to love her upbeat spirit and cheerful attitude. He is then torn between loyalty to his wife and his love for Mattie. Zeena banishes Mattie from their home, causing Ethan to struggle with the decision whether to run away with her or not. This book clearly shows the importance of love.

If you are looking for an undercover love story, than Ethan Frome is without a doubt, the perfect book for you. I do not usually give too many books 4 stars, but I feel that this book was extrodinary. It had everything that I perfect book should have.Great imagery, great theme, great wording, and great charecters. To conclue this statement, if you are looking for a wonderful storry to read in your spare time, then you should definately pick up Ethan Frome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected ending makes the novel!","review":"Ethan Frome was an awesome book! I FELT SO BAD FOR ETHAN! He was such a sweet guy and he could not change any of the horrible circumtances that his life brought him. I loved Mattie and I think that she deserved a better life than what she ended up with. Wharton describes these characters so well that at the end of the novel I felt that I knew Ethan and Mattie for years. I knew that Zeena was a hypocondriac from the begining of the novel and I did not like her shallow attempt for the attention of all those who knew her. Overall this book is really good because it is concise and has an unexpecting ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Boring Book","review":"This book was pretty short. I didn't really like it.

It's pretty much just a slow-paced, depressing romance novel that shouldn't have ever been considered as required reading, let alone chosen. You really don't have to look far to find a better choice. I will admit that the story isn't terrible, it's just not very original or intriguing to me..just kind of dull, and more than a little dated. The ending fits with the rest of the book and although it doesn't really surprise you, it doesn't make you feel cheated either. So, the book is consistent, but it's consistently underwhelming."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it and was forced to read it!!","review":"Book was pretty bad.

It is a compilation with an objective. The objective is to present the forms of music called guaguanco or given the name. Much of what Johnny Pacheco and Pete \\"El Conde\\" Rodriguez did with their versions of guaguanco in the 1960s and 1970s is more accurately guarachas or sons. It sounds very little like the guaguancos performed by Los Munequitos de Matanzas. Both versions are presented here. Cheo Feliciano popularized his version of dance friendly, for non Cubans, guaguanco about the same time and had success with it up into the 1980s. If you don't care about the accuracy of the anthropology, this is a fabulous and danceable disc; even the more primitive tunes are hip shaking and floor scuffing deliveries.

Douglas, but ultimately fails. The secretive world of the court would be difficult for any journalist to penetrate, and here Woodward and his cohort Armstrong prove themselves not to be up to the task.A word about this book's availability.

The history lesson it provides are a description of the pulse and perspective of this country in the time frame that book discusses, as well as the major issues the nation was facing at the time. The psychology lesson is insight into how these judges, who I certainly took to have a measure of impartiality, still remained political animals (and still very human)-they decided cases not on principals but on how they felt about issues and where they stood on the political spectrum. Though this cuts away at the idealism I had about the sanctity of the Supreme Court, it was a reminder about what they were doing-laying down judgment, which at its very heart is about one's interpretation and feeling about an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!!","review":"Impressive work and Kudos to Woodward and Armstrong. Though it may not be one to pick up for pleasure reading, actually I would highly recommend not reading it unless you needed to find info on the topic or are intrested in the topic. In a review, Anthony Lewis highly critized the book on the way it bashed members on the court and his close friend Brennan. And perhaps that is persicly the reason Lewis did not like the book, because it was often over critical of his friend. The book fully covers the court and gives great inside perspective, though it is questionable about the accuracy of their sources. So, if you are intrested in the topic, great read it.

The problem is that the author remains at such an abstract and intellectual level throughout most of the book. As a result, you don't fully enter into the narrator's world, and you don't really get to know the characters. There is a scene about 30 pages from the end, when some peddlers come selling water in buckets, and there's a fight over the water, when I found myself saying, \\"Yes--this is exactly the kind of engaging detail that has been missing from most of this story!\\" The ambiguities of the cat-dog character and the wall-as-conduit-to-alternate-reality do not make up for this fundamental shortcoming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memoirs is a lesson in incrementalism","review":"What struck me most in the marvelous Lessing short book, Memoirs of a Survivor, is how matter-of-factly we accept horrific changes as long as they happen bit by bit. The absence of emotionality in the story, noted by others, is, I believe, intentional. As conditions worsen, the main character (and her ward) find ways to adapt, but never consider what actions they might take to reverse the societal decline.This is a story about our inherent passivity, our overweaning trust that someone else will surely take care of things when they go bad. It is also a testament to our ability to adapt to changing circumstances, but in general I feel it is a condemnation of our blindness to perceive and then resist those changes that dismantle and ultimately destroy vibrant societies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy Seas.","review":"I spent most of this movie asking why this ship wasn't moving in heavy seas.Then I spent a few minutes yelling at it.Highly predictable \\"boo\\" factor here.Telegraphed from the off.I happen to like mindless entertainment late at night.Sometimes I just watch a stoopid movie.Ten Little Indians did it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"So bad it's funny","review":"Ok, I had high hopes for this flick, but I was very let down.

The bad thing about this toy is it does not stack up (as shown in the advertisement) making them a little frustrating for my daughter to play with, and in my opinion aren't really worth $6.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok.","review":"I thought these were going to be a lot of fun. However, when floating in the tub, you can't really stack the tubby tumblers. My daughter thinks they're ok, but she prefers plain old rubber ducks."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent practical overview","review":"I've read 10 books on PM in the last 3 years. Without a doubt this is the most practical one I've read. It takes PM theory and goes much further than other beginner's guides to actually telling you how to do apply the theory in the real world. The mind maps are particularly good. I have used these maps extensively for operations staff training and brain storming for phase planning. Highly recommended reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"This book is a must have for anyone in project management. It is easy to understand, presented well, and will benefit people of all experience levels. Greg clearly knows what he is talking about and should be teaching courses on project management. I only wish I had this book when I was in that business!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute Beginner's Guide to Project Management Second Edition","review":"Greg has pulled it off again making it even clearer this time the need to map a project and use a process. I have handed this book to a few PMs in our organization. Great tool with clear language that any new or experienced PM can apply to their projects. Handy reference as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good reference text but minimal groundbreaking value","review":"I would recommend this book only to someone with no prior professional experience, entering the world of employment. The author assumes the reader has a complete lack of prior knowledge of any project management skills. It could be a good reference guide to someone with the project management duties but without the formal PM title. Otherwise, I would not recommend this book for anyone with more than two years professional experience.It seems to be written for a high school level education, which has advantages and disadvantages: it is easily digestable and a quick read but sometimes risks presenting the material in an overly simplistic description.While it provides a thorough introduction to the concepts of project management in a cookbook style, it does not provide adequate background on the soft skills, political savvy, and negotiation skills required of a project manager to resolve conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Sign","review":"I bought this for a gag gift and was very impressed with how professional the quality of the sign is.

Reverend Jen is supported by her rich, suburban (Maryland) parents and, unlike most of you reading this, will never need to get a job. Instead, she has the luxury to \\"slum\\" it out in the LES, surround herself with supportive nimrods, and crank out moronic drivel. It's easy to knock hardworking people and mock society when you are a kept bird who never has to roll out of bed before noon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take THAT Fodor's","review":"Every city guide should be as funny and personal and filled with wisdom and real experiences as Reverend Jen's Really Cool Neighborhood. This book is poetry of the ridiculous. I highly recommend it, especially to anyone who's ever struggled in New York. You will laugh with recognition.By the way, Les Misrahi, the companion play that comes with the book and was apparently performed by the author with puppets outside her landlord's office is also hysterically funny. It tells the story of the author's alter-ego Jen Valjean, who was imprisoned for stealing a glue stick from Kinko's. Silly and brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Artist. a True New Yorker","review":"This is truly a \\"guide\\" to not just the Lower East Side, but to NY's creative history of earnest rebellion and unrelenting honesty. That NY's true blood flows through the crevices between the Starbucks, the $12-sandwhich French restaurants and the faux-dive lounges that have muscled their way in is the potency behind this spirited L.E.S. tour-guide. I admire Rev Jen, a woman who has worked a record number of different and strange jobs and hosts an amazing open mic in order to be the most prolific artist ever and a bane to the spiteful and impotent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reverend Jen HAS a Job","review":"I was shocked and horrified to see a review in which Reverend Jen's work of genius was given only one star and in which the Reverend is portrayed as a trust fund kid! The Reverend writes in her book about working for the man whilst continually producing art. Reverend works as cashier, runs a weekly open mike, runs her own zine and troll museum and much much more. It sounds as though this review was written by either a.) a jilted lover b.) her landlord or c.)or her former editors at a magazine that shall remain nameless, but who went out of business shortly after canning the Reverend. To call Reverend Jen a kept bird is ludicrous!!! Her kitchen ceiling has a hole in it! She has been working since she was 14! No, she does not come from a trailer park, but she is no Paris Hilton and she is not the type of person to ask for anything. This one-star review was both slanderous and bitter and should be disregarded by anyone considering buying this witty, winsome, yet scathing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BE A BUBBLEBRAIN-WEAR THIS!","review":"Che was nothing other than a self absorbed communist who used the safety, and desperation, of people to serve his self absorbed existance, all while using the people's welfare to serve himself!

And while _Tide's Arising_ has a polished sheen to it, I was slightly disappointed. Certainly, the broken beats on the album are crisp and quick and the production quality is strong, but I don't feel he's breaking much new ground here. The rapid fire vocals on \\"Traveling\\" and \\"State of the Mental\\" sound too similar; the grindy R&B on \\"Quintessential\\" and \\"Heaven\\" pleasantly fall by the wayside. As well, some of the shorter instrumentals sound too contemporary adult (\\"Pino + Mashi,\\" \\"Masina's World\\"). The staccato flavors of \\"Syndrome,\\" however, do help set that track apart, but I'm afraid the listener's interest is too apt to come and go like the tide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased with product","review":"Since we already had one of these gates, we knew exactly what we were purchasing when we bought a second and third one.

Definitely has some influences from STP, Smashing Pumpkins, and other top name groups. Good lyrics, hookin' guitars, & some electronica thrown in (but, not too much). On \\"Mono Baby\\", lead vocal sounds like Smashing Pumpkins Billy C.....really good tune. \\"Concrete Bubble\\" & \\"Junkie\\" are great hard drivin' tunes that beg to be played loud! \\"Star\\" is a nice little ballad thrown in, and, the 1st version of \\"Weight\\" (track #11) is a super ballad. As another reviewer stated, there is a faster, rock version of this great song about 48 seconds after the end of the 1st (same track). I like this CD almost as much as the new STP #4....lots of similarites (except vocals). I highly recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss These Guys","review":"I actually had already bought this album upon it's release but when I moved across the country, I took the CD case but the CD was no where to be found.

I remembered having something like this when I was a kid. I ordered them for a road trip we were going on this Summer. The only problem is that the trip I took was driving through corn fields and alot of empty land.......not much to see. One of the cards was looking for a dog, cat, girl, boy, mailbox, etc. These are not things you usually see on a highway. I think overall, they are alot of fun as long as you are doing highway and more populated areas together. My kids loved them and although it was hard to get bingo because of where we travelled, they still had fun. Maybe someone could make cards like this with license plates on them instead of other items to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for road trips or trips to school","review":"We got these from a retail shop while on vacation a few years back. We keep them in the side pocket of the car and pull them out for games on longer road trips. They are great to help pass the time when everyone has gotten bored from the usual activities in the car. Recently, we started using them in a car pool. The kids love them; the only drawback is, after a few trips via the same route, they know just where to find things. I have them call out when they see things so only one kid can claim credit for what they see. It adds a little more challenge that way. These would also be great to take along on field trips, scout trips or any trip covering new territory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood memories!","review":"I recently sought these out as a gift for a friend on a cross-country car trip with his kids. We used to play this for hours as kids. He loved it, as it brought back childhood memories for him as well. And the kids had a ball with them. These are the original cards that are exactly how we remembered them. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A single card? Really?","review":"I guess I overlooked the 'sold individually' portion of this description and I swear they have elaborated since I ordered this, but I still gotta say: a single card? Really? For Bingo? If I order two how do I know I won't get the same two? Maybe that's the fun part, finding out. The item looks like the same card we had as kids. It's probably just as fun as I remember and as durable as cardboard can be. I'd love to write more, but I have to go play bingo against myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some items are impossible to find in the suburbs","review":"My DH found one of these cards at a local retailer. They had just one left. Too bad DH didn't look closer at the items on the card. It's impossible to get a bingo in any direction with the card we have, living in the suburbs as we do. They have things like Silo, Tractor, Haystack. Yeah, right. None of those around here. It makes for a very frustrated kid. This wasn't as good of an idea as DH thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bingo","review":"I had a very old bingo card my children use to play ( all in there 30's now) got the address & ordered more cards for my grandchildren.

She previously was using a Jupiter Komfort Kruiser XL100, which I loved. The Komfort Kruiser was a booster with a back, and although it still fits her to this day, she was eager to move into a backless booster. I think the Dakota booster works great. It gets her to the height she needs for the seatbelt, but allows her to feel more like a big kid by not having a back. This booster is a quality item and large enough to fit her until she will be old and large enough to no longer require a booster. The pocket on the side is handy as well, although does not work well with drinks (I advise buying a bottle holder to put on the arm rest!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've seen.","review":"Looks good, seems comfortable.

The actors all play their roles well and the intensity of their emotions simply leaves one breathless. Having watched this movie about 10 times, I learn something new about myself every single time I watch it. This is one of the most traggic love stories ever written. It might leave you in tears but there is something about it that is undenyable true and real.

I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work for boys...","review":"the seat is made for girls obviously, as there is a large gap for the pee shield to slide into the front of the seat, but it's so large, when a boy pees, it gets stuck in the gap and you have to wash the seat out every time, defeating the purpose of them learning to do it on their own. and after only a month of use, the vinyl is starting to crack on the edge, making my son nervous to sit on that part. also, after having to rinse it off on a regular basis, it looks as if the cartoon print is wearing off. overall, quite disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be VERY, VERY careful with this seat","review":"We used this seat to train our son. While he loved it because he got to sit on the 'big' potty, it created a ratehr harrowing event. His 'winky' got caught on little plastic spray guard and caused a 3/4\\" cut around the shaft.

There was a pretty good amount of information in the script. As a DVD, though, it was a sorry production. Somebody with a desktop video production rig decided to try out every special effect in the software...three or four time over. The video is very distracting, hard to watch, and only rarely relevant to what is being said. The music track is unrelenting and also distracting, sometimes to the point that you miss what is being said. (I must admit that the first music track, which sounds a bit like \\"Riverdance\\"-type Irish folk music, is a musical genre that I absolutely abhor...so my opinion here is slanted by that.) Every time the narrator pauses to take a breath, the music volume swells in a most inappropriate way. The DVD is certainly not worth the price because the information is not appropriately presented for video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing value","review":"I own and have watched \\"What the Bleep\\" and \\"The Secret\\", and this DVD does not compare favorably. It depends too much on the graphics and music, which are admittedly great but which often overshadow the narration. The material is sometimes difficult to follow and is made more difficult by the lack of quality narration. The DVD doesn't get to the meat this buyer was expecting (2012 and the relation of the sun, the earth and mankind) until close to the end. And there is at least one serious digression (a comparison of the Egyptian god Horus to Jesus Christ) that while interesting, seemed to me to take more than its share of the DVD's short length. Harper's concepts are relevant, and it is urgent that they be communicated to mankind, but the packaging detracts from the credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Hear The Voice Track","review":"Once again a lot of hype for a very poorly mixed and edited film. I don't know what it is about these films that always falls short with the music/voice mixing. The music is way too loud and the voices are too faint. Not to mention, the music sucks. If there is any 'hidden' knowledge being presented, you'll have to wear headphones or constantly adjust the volume for the crappy music interludes. Why can't they pan the music to one side, the voice to the other, and hire an experienced mixing engineer for appropriate levels? My suggestion to this production company: Stick to the information and tone it down a bit on the unnecessary bells and whistles. Frankly, most of us just want to hear the info, and not be subjected to a bunch new age music and cheap transition effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and self respect!","review":"Ulli Lommel's (who is this anyway) Black Dahlia is the most worthless piece of nothing that I have ever subjected myself to.

The problem clearly is just this: the script is entirely B.S.Those who liked Usual Suspects (a film I thoroughly hated) and who enjoy the work of Hitchcock (a director who never did anything for me) ought to get off on this fakery.Like I said, cast is very good, with the exception of Jake Busey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember That Movie Charlie Kaufman's Bro Was Writing","review":"in Adaptation?

But making a wild turn next to the ending of the film, a turn that made clear that all that happened before a lie (or a kind of dream) was inexcusable, absurd, and made me feel like an idiot. (maybe that was the intention of the producers...)Technically, the movie is very good, and acting is top notch (except by the father of the little guy.

I'm glad she did because I wouldn't have wanted to miss it. This movie fits into the thriller category and begins with a rainstorm flooding out the roads. A variety of people are then forced to check into a roach motel. From a famous actress to a reformed prositute to a police officer transporting a convict, you see it all. One by one, murders start to happen with no clear cut reason as to why. However, as the movie progresses, pieces of the puzzle are put together. The ending of the movie is well worth the watch alone. This is a not-to-miss movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"thriller","review":"this is a heart pounding thriller in which you never know who is the bad guy or even what is real and what is not real. This great psychological thriller will continually keep you guessing great casting as well i highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Countdown...","review":"Ten people wind up stranded at a desert motel during a thunderstorm. All is well until someone starts killing them one by one. IDENTITY is a movie w/ loads of secrets and twisty surprises. The action grows increasingly odd and ultimately turns completely illogical. In the end, we find that this is necessary to the story. John Cusack, Ray Liotta, and Amanda Peet play the central characters. The rest of the cast is equally awesome, w/ Rebecca DeMornay (The Hand That Rocks The Cradle), Clea Duval (How To Make A Monster), Alfred Molina (Species), and Jake Busey (The Frighteners, Starship Troopers) among them! There's a cop, a convict, a chauffeur, a has-been movie star, a hooker, a family, a young couple, and Larry, the jittery desk-clerk. None of these people are who or what they appear to be. Many secrets will be revealed. Many will die. This all culminates in a mindf'ing final twist that will pry your jaw open! Highly recommended..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly Psychologically Thrilling","review":"This film is one of the best in psychological thrillers. It keeps you guessing and re-guessing as the plot moves on and the dead bodies start disappearing. John Cusack is at his brooding best paired with Ray Liotta. This is a movie that could have easily been over-acted, but the cast carries the story line well. There's limited gore and guts but just the right amount of suspense to keep you glued to the the movie. Don't miss out on this one, you'll be glad you spent your time and money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass up this one","review":"Hackned script and bad acting by all but a couple of actors. I found the ending different but unsatisfying. At the beginning, the dialogue was mumbled and low, so I tried to turn on the Closed Captions, and found there was none. Alfred Hitchcock did the Bates Motel much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entertainement. Above the average","review":"As you may be reluctant to watch this movie, reading the story which looks pretty basic, you may expect a lot more than you would.This is not the best movie of the year, but it was sure great and it went beyond all expectations.Otherwise, this movie has absolutely nothing to do with Memento (flashbacks and anachronous stories have not been invented in Memento!) I perfectly understand people who don't like it, but I would say that most of people won't be disapppointed.Of course, if you can bear a little suspense in the movie,don't watch. For all the others, this will be a great catch."},{"rating":"1","title":"From someone who saw it at the theater","review":"This movie a joke. It is an insult to any viewer's intelligence. The shocking secret is so blaringly obvious, it's beyond stupid. The ending of the movie is a total ripoff. Save your money. The only saving grace is the actors, but then the story is so lame that it totally overshadows their performances.

It leads you to question your own intelligence and purpose as a human being, for if this movie made 50 million dollars at the box office, everybody on this planet are certainly a bunch of wacknuts.Save your money, and your dignity, let this film sink into obscurity - let it rest in peace, not in your dvd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Identiy, Truly Unidentifiable","review":"Bad writing, choppy action, and horrible twists brings \\"Identity\\" down to levels of other awful psychological thrillers such as \\"Abandon\\" or even worse, \\"American Psycho\\". The film starts off with introducting the uniteresting ensemble characters one bye one such as John Cusack, Amanda Peet, and Ray Liotta who all give the worst performances of their carrer in this film. No real storry, and no real climax in this film it's just a redundant mix of gore and a suprise ending that doesnt seem to make much sence. The main theme of the film is skitzophrenia which hasn't been used well since 1999's \\"Fight Club\\" perhaps the best film of the generation. \\"Identity\\" will be a film without one in film history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Identity - Ending is easily guessed by the middle.","review":"Very much enjoyed the film! The Blu-ray disc was HD perfection. Acting, direction, camera work, and all other crafts were very good. The \\"switch\\" at the end can be easily perceived by the middle of the story, but it did not lessen the enjoyment. A good night seeing a film at the theater -- the big screen one in my own home that is, sans noisy, rude people, no outrageous priced snacks, no out of focus projection, no soundtrack cranked up to ear drum-breaking level, and no sub-zero air-conditioning. Ah, the way movies should be seen! Identity = good, but rent, don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Movie","review":"Identity...How can i explain this movie in words? When i saw it the FIRST time i kind of had to let is sink in. Then when i relized what a great thriller it was, i knew it was my favorite movie. What's not to like, you go you suspense, horror, and twists, and that's what makes a good movie. I have seen this movie a couple of times, and really looked at how the movie was made, and who the actors and actresses were. Amanda Peet, the star actress of the movie, is my favorite actor in the whole world. Her work is great, and she has done many movies. Ok... I'm getting off subject. The movie is about 10 people who get stuck because of a storm. A family, a newlywed couple, a callgirl, a limo driver, an 80's actor, a convict and a cop. What happens is people start dying one by one and everyone is getting freaked out. I can't say anymore because i will give it away but everything is great! Watch this movie, you'll enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark, gripping suspense!","review":"I've always loved John Cusak, so when I saw this one I decided to give it a try, even though I hadn't heard of it before seeing it on the shelf. Step by step, you'll find yourself trying to guess who the murderer is, to find out in the end you're probably wrong. I don't know if I totally care for the very end of the movie, which is why I'm going giving it 4 stars, but I would recommend this one if you're into suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best psychological movies ever!","review":"I really have enjoyed watching the movie...three times already and I can say that it \\"tickles\\" your mind and think a lot of things at the end of it.Dont judge the book by its cover they say .... and its correct."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems interesting, IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK","review":"Sounds like a great thriller, great trailers, etc. Movie's going great until almost the end. The whole story is in some crazy guy's imagination and none of it is real. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not expected","review":"I did not expect the twist in the middle. (Of course, I knew nothing about the movie going into it.)The twist in the middle threw me, I felt a bit put out by it. I never got completely back into the movie, but by the end I was mostly back in, and liked it well enough.John Cussack is perfect; and a couple of the most violent bits become situationally expremely funny. The rest of the cast are also fairly perfect, but I am a Cussack fan at heart, and I liked his performance.So... all in all? It was ok. I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ten Little Indians\\" meets \\"Psycho\\"","review":"\\"Identity\\" is a well-constructed thriller about ten adults (plus a young boy) who are stranded together at a creepy motel in the Nevada desert during a seemingly endless rainstorm. I won't go into plot details, because numerous others have already done so. While the movie owes a lot to previous entries in the mystery-thriller genre, it is still quite effective. It keeps you guessing until about 15-20 minutes from the end and there are more than a few scares along the way. Not one of the great ones, but well worth watching at least once ... maybe twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fargo trumps Ten Little Indians","review":"It was a dark and stormy night. Several strangers, that we are slowly (very slowly) introduced to through a series of out of disordered flashbacks, are force to stay in a sleazy motel. As with all sleazy motels people start to dismantle \\"Fargo\\" style. The characters have the audacity to compare their situation to Agatha Christie's \\"Ten Little Indians\\" so is the last one standing the culprit? At least we are not treated to a gushy love story overlay.Not all the gimmicks in the world can disguise this common slasher movie posing as a physiological thriller.And Then There Were None - Starring: Barry Fitzgerald, Walter Huston Director: René ClairTen Little Indians - Starring: Hugh O'Brian, Shirley Eaton Director: George Pollock"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"This movie requires our brain to be fully alert as it is NOT of those slasher flicks like \\"Friday 13\\" or \\"Freddy\\" where even a drunkard can enjoy without actually thinking.The director has done a terrific job especially in the way he introduces the characters which gives us a hint about Schizophrenia on the prowl.He,the director,does not seem to attach much importance to the elements of gore,blood and suspense in the way the victims are being killed.All the killings are done by a schizophrenic individual and the killings are like to an outside individual, as if they are performed under the depths of sea..Am i confusing ?.Anyway this movie is a treat to those who want to see a good movie not neccassarily a horror movie.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Big Gigantic Headache","review":"Without giving away too much, this movie is both figuratively and literally a great gigantic migraine headache. Headaches of any kind have never been enjoyable. This one is no exception.If it weren't for John Cusack and Amanda Peet, they would have never been able to produce this movie with the absolutely non-plot storyline. Why does Cusack even agree to star in such a dumb movie? He has talent, as well as Peet - at least I think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ending cops out","review":"This movie's ending is a cop-out of the worst degree.All throughout the movie you are trying to figure out how it all was happening. How did everybody get where they are? What's the explanation of their birth dates?(Spoiler coming)(I warned you)When it's all in the guy's head, the it-was-all-a-dream ending is a major cop-out. No wonder we couldn't figure it out, joke's on us! A movie with a surprise ending at least owes us a puzzle that we could have figured out with clues throughout the movie. It's a shame when the cop-out ending is that it really didn't happen the way we perceived it (except The Sixth Sense)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!","review":"This film had a lot of hype going for it. So when I actually saw the film I was very dissapointed. Now it'snot as bad as all that, but it's just another hollwood piece of tripe, thrown together very quickly in order to make an extra buck.John Cusack is excellent in it, which is very surprising since he had to get his tongue twisted around an awful script.Never the less, I did enjoy it for a while, but the end was simply crap. It was one of those annoying endings that could be the ending to any film ever made. Which is very annoying because it just felt like whoever wrote couldn't think of an ending so he just pulled this one out.Rubbish ending. Not particurlarly engaging. If you want to see a really good film, that's set in a motel on the road, then just watch Psycho.Alfred Hitchcocks Psycho that is, not that crap re-make."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, this movie sucked...It is only good if you...","review":"Man, this movie sucked...It is only good if you stop the movie after the part where they think it is some ghost from the Indian barial ground that is killing them off one by one.If you watch any of the movie after that point (which is a about an hour into the movie) you will be very disappointed, IT JUST GETS STUPID.Please take my advice, I scratched the last 45 minutes of the movie off my DVD, I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish someone WOULD spoil the ending...","review":"...then I'd know what the heck happened.

Psychobabble is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to watch, psychologically inaccurate","review":"I had high hopes for this movie since it starred several excellent actors. My husband and I had a difficult time sitting though this silly movie without walking out. As it was, we stayed through the credits hoping to catch the name of the psychiatric consultant so we could send a poison pen letter. Wisely, no psychiatrist allowed his or her name to be associated with that movie.I did not find the end of the movie surprising, because it was similar to some of the \\"multiple personality\\" themes that were once popular in daytime soap operas. I suspect that modern soap opera audiences are now sufficiently sophisticated to see through that old theme.Many small and large details were laughably and gratuitously wrong.The actors performed well but the stupidity of the plot kept me from enjoying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This title is ripped...","review":"The same principle to this story was written by Stephen King in an earlier work of his entitled \\"The Secret Window.\\" This story just has more \\"personalities\\" and more victims. The writers should've come up with something out of their own minds, not out of the mind of one of our great literary achievers such as Stephen King...a disappointment to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent but it bums out totally at the end....","review":"The first hour or so of this film is fantastic. The setup is simple. Different people get caught up in a flash storm only to end up in a motel where they start getting bumped off one by one. The story is very interesting, fast, with lots and lots of plot twists along the way but it all falls to pieces in the end with what the filmmakers probably thought was a unique and original twist-type-premise for the whole film. It sadly is not and even the final scene is like something out of Scream VII.Watch \\"Brazil\\" or \\"Jacobs Ladder\\" instead to see how they got this kind of a plot twist right."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE of the greatest","review":"This movie is a must have for anybody who loves thriller movies. I don't even care if you like thrillers just get the movie. Lots of other people have already said what it's about so i'm not going to say again I just have to say that when i first saw it and it got out i was like wow!!!!!!!!!!

Initially I was ready to turn it off ... the jumping from character to character, well, I'm just not as good as I used to be at figuring out quick scene changes, flashbacks and things that don't seem to connect. I'm glad I stuck it out. This was truly a great mystery thriller with fine acting, twists and turns, a unique story line, and while I would have preferred a different end, all in all this was a fine film and I recommend seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Things are not always as they appear.","review":"At first I thought this would be just a basic poorly scripted suspense flix. But it was far more complex than that. Identity is a very engaging movie that was not overly predictable. After seeing this I went into work recommending that people see it.The major annoyance I have with the film is a slight but critical blunder. I'm used to Hollywood getting psychological diagnosis wrong. Hollywood often plays with diagnostics for dramatic purposes. This blunder was not an error for dramatic effect. It was just a stupid error that should have been corrected.

However, I failed to see where this humor came from a loving and appreciative place. To me, it all sounded pretty superior and judgmental.

Very dark stories, well acted, well directed. You should get this DVD if you're thinking of it. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD of the damned...","review":"My \\"review\\" is solely for the DVD itself and not the movie it contains. I ordered this double feature a long time ago and threw it on the shelf to watch when I was bored. Well yesterday I found myself with a few hours to kill so I thought I would take a look. Well, much to my frustration, my player could not read the disc. I thought it might need to be cleaned or something, but I tried a half dozen other movies and none of them had any issues. So it looks like the DVD has some kind of an issue that won't allow it to be recognized and played. I noticed a couple of other people had the same issue. So bottom line is this...While I cannot speak on the movie itself...I would not buy this version of the movie because it seems to be hit or miss on whether or not it will play. Just wanted to send out a little warning to prospective buyers. Have a good one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Village And Children Of The Damned","review":"DVD does not work could only watch Village of the damned, also could never get the menu to work. The DVD was not much but I expected it to work. Do not buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"Spooky kids, crazy town. Village of the Damned is a cult classic with those of us that grew up in that era of the 60's. They are very low tech and low budget which can be very refreshing these days. Women suddenly find themselves pregnant and they all give birth to kids that have the same strange powers. They seem to share one mind and use their mental powers to control everyone. What do they want? To take over the world of course! Great creepy fun. Being in black & white seems to add an air of suspense. Children of the Damned is a picture of much lesser quality. It's a 1995 remake starring Christopher Reeves. It just doesn't measure uo to the original. I'd avoid that one if I were you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anything like the remake","review":"this 1960 version of village of the damned is not worth seing its so low budget and not even scary like the remake all the victims in this movie u never can see because their is nothing to show dont get this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb City","review":"Village of the Damned isn't so bad. George Sanders is always worth seeing. But the film is an obvious cheapy (made for under $300,000), and you have to be about eight to get excited about the strange eyes of the strange children who come, apparently, from another planet. In the end, the hero blows up the monsters (and himself); the classic cheapie horror show ending.Children of the Damned is much worse. Again, an obvious cheapie, this sequel can't figure out what the strange children are supposed to be doing on the planet. The couple of sentences uttered by the head freakie kid make no sense at all. So, in the end, the children with the strange eyes are all destroyed. Again. What a waste of film."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Type Of Village People!","review":"Caught this flick by chance on TCM yesterday a.m. and watched it straight through (which was easy, considering it clocked in at a mere 77m). A truly creepy beginning leads to a disturbing middle which then leads to a shocking conclusion. All told a great sci-fi/horror flick without an ounce of blood (why horror? The scene where the kids will a guy to blow his head off with a shotgun is terrifying!). The eyes are creepy, the blonde wigs are creepy, heck, even the clothes the kids wear are creepy. A real great flick from the British school of cinema. Disturbing? You bet. But quite entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Both for an Awesome Price","review":"These stories are going to stick with you. Easy to remember, disturbingly hard to forget. Both tales inspire horror, fascination, and paranoia in almost equal doses. Yes the acting could be better but the stories could not.

Village of the Damned is a good movie, and pays credit to the original story.

One man suggested Wahl, which I had never heard of, and when he mentioned that it was the last American manufactured razor, that sealed the deal. It came with 3 differently gauged foils. The charging base was unassembled for some reason, which I quickly remedied with some model glue. The cleaning brush is utterly worthless; the fact that I use an old toothbrush says it all.I have exceptionally bad luck with merchants, so of course, mine was the one that slipped through quality control and arrived with a misaligned grip. This did not affect its performance, which is first rate, and I suppose most men could just grin and bear it, but I returned it for replacement as my relationship with merchants is essentially a state of war.

Just turn this bad boy on and you'll wake the neighbors. Get my point?Poor quality materials.This is just a joke really. Made in china junk. Poor plastic and the cover doesn't even stay on over the blades.Shave is just okay.Used another panasonic model and it cut all the whiskers this wahl left behind.Awkward to hold.Very bulky and awkward in the hand.

I could have lived with that if it gave a good shave. After charging the shaver for the required time I tried it out. It sounds like a lawnmower. It vibrates almost as much as the 5 hp vibratory plate compactor I use to compact stone with! My hand and face were both numb from the intense vibration after I finished shaving. As I went over parts of the jaw bone I felt my teeth tingling from the vibration.It gave an okay shave.

I have been using a gillette razor and the andis styliner 2 for shaving my face and head. The razor tends to cause black heads and razor bumps and the styliner to me is more for touch up work than full shaves. While this whal product can't cut nearly as close as a razor, it did a good job. It did leave serveral loose hair spots on my face so I touched it up with the edger that is attached to the shaver. That combo worked well. I had a very close shave. I would reccomend this product for those of you whose skin does not respond well to a true razor shave. I follow up my shaves with the bump patrol facial application and I don't get any bumps.

And the price is just great: a fraction of what other more famous brands cost.Let's \\"face\\" it: the Wahl shaves very close, not as close as a regular blade of course, but no electric razor does anyway. However, if you don't want to \\"rip\\" your skin off, use the Wahl: it is much easier, safer, more comfortable, less messy and more time-saver than using even the most \\"cutting edge\\" 3, 4 or 5-blade disposable razors.

I like strong women characters who stand up for themselves, but Rachel, Doris and Lillian, the daughters of the awful Sara, took verbal abuse all though their childhood, and still kow-towed to Sara to the point I started skipping the same old dialogue over and over.

Sam's Illustrator 10 book is actually very helpful for those never having used Illustrator before, which I haven't (although I am experienced in Photoshop). The book could be helped with a CD and color diagrams, but otherwise it is a straightforward instruction book that is easy to read.

I am all for the killing scenes, but how can you have a movie called \\"The Mechanic\\" and not have the main actor at least work on a few cars in between killings.

It seeks to explain how one draws valid meaning from qualitative data. The focus of the book, as a consequence, is analysis. The authors see themselves as logical positivists. Three components of analysis are: data reduction, data display, and conclusion drawing/verification.Like a large number of other scholars, they see compatibility between qualitative and quantitative research. They contend that \\"qualitative research can be outright 'confirmatory.'\\"This book covers the basics of doing a qualitataive study.

This collection of photographs makes an excellent companion volume to Elizabeth Sharpe's \\"In the Shadow of the Dam\\".On a more personal note, I would like to thank Ms. Thibodeau for providing me with what are probably the highest-quality pictures of my great-great-grandfather Thomas Skinner I will ever possess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Year","review":"This is one of the best movies of its year. I don't know what year it was made so I can't say best of ex. 2000 though that may be the year. I heard ever since he was young, Nolan, the director wanted to make movies backwards. This movie was really good. It's probably the only movie that would ever work better backwards than forwards, and it has one of the ten most shocking endings in the last decade. Joe Pantoliano, (from the Sopranos) and Guy Pierce umm... (Memento) light up the screen, while Carrie Anne Moss (The Matrix) better than a girl, though one seen of her's is scary. In summation, probably the best cast for the movie. If you're watching the DVD, make sure you don't choose to watch it in forward motion. It will ruin the experrience."},{"rating":"1","title":"No region free","review":"Be careful! This item only works on region 1.

I thought it was going that way for the first twenty minutes or so of the film. It sure did keep me wondering and riveted. However, like a lot of movies tackling complex themes and ideas, it had to resort to a trainwreck of an ending...Suddenly, from suspense to psychological, it takes a turn for the philosophical. It's not as bad as Vanilla Sky, but you get the feeling they're in the same new genre--the I-Can-Do-Anything-With-This-Movie-And-Come-Out-Original genre. I had more questions than answers after the movie ended which that explanation just didn't solve. Too bad, I really wanted to like it...go watch Insomnia for real psychological suspense and thrills--no, not the remake from Memento's director, Christopher Nolan, but the original by Erik Skjoldbjaerg.

Where?","review":"I suppose the only reason I could suggest this film to anyone is if I have a sincere desire to torture someone else, or the person I'm referring it to is just as confused as this movie is. The movie from beginning to end is exactly that, confusing. The constant \\"rewind technique\\" the film seems to use is part of the love/hate issue I experienced. I think it's very trendy technique though. It's just they use it way to often. You get 5 minutes ahead only to go back 10. It's very frustrating for me to watch.

Why? Because this move gives the audience a big 1-2 punch by filming the movie scenes backwards. At first you'd think it looks normal but the scene before it makes it intense.

Still though, it's a really an original piece of work. It's not every film where you hear the lead charcater say \\"I'm chasing someone,....oh wait, he's chasing me\\", I love scenes like that. Guy Pearce does a great job in the film too, it's an very unusual role and he handles it very well. Joe Pantalino and Carrie Anne Moss a very good too as the 2 people he trusts his memories with. Memento is brain twisting and a bit confusing but still, I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited edition","review":"This is probably one of the best movies in my collection but the limited edition version is simply awful. In a nutshell the special features are a mess. It's almost like being harassed by your DVD.The DVD starts out by asking you a ton of stupid questions which, for those seeing the movie for the first time, would help to give away some of the movies mystery.The original DVD version is much much better. It has the movie and the short story that the movie was based on. THAT IS ALL THAT IS NEEDED but I guess Christopher Nolan wanted to milk the fans for a few more bucks.A nice special feature for this DVD would have been to have the option to play the movie in sequential order. While this would be a horrible way to first watch the film, I'm sure many fans wouldn't mind watching it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original and interesting...","review":"I have read some reviews that claim this movie is not as innovative as it seems...I disagree mainly because no movie has been so well made with the story moving both forwards and backwards to the climax of the movie. If there has been a movie like this I have not seen it or heard of it, and I seriously doubt the acting or directing will be comparable.The fun of the movie lies not in guessing the climax, but in the causes, a more difficult task than it sounds, since the movie definitely is a little strange, and certainly disturbing.Hopefully Pantoliano and Pearce will be nominated for Best Actor, as they richly deserve for jobs very well done.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Film","review":"This is a unqiue film and can be confusing at times because everything happens backwards. So I highly suggest watching the special features first because it helps explain the movement of the film and gets you prepared. Otherwise, the viewer may get lost. The story is about Leonard, so traumatized by a blow to the head after his wife's rape and murder, that he has lost his short-term memory sohe takes Polaroids of everyone he meets and writes notes on them so he can remember them later. He also has tattoos all over his body which are all reminders as well.This film was meant to be somewhat confusing for the viewer because it is confusing for the main character as well, who is our guide throughout this film.I really enjoyed this film and it is definitely worth the buy. I would highly suggest getting the two-disc limited edition because it has some helpful extras which make the movie a little easier to understand for the viewer"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good non-formulaic thriller","review":"Hard to explain the plot of this movie without revealing spoilers, so I'll just say Memento is definitely worth a view, maybe two. I do not watch a lot of mainstream movies, mostly because I don't feel like distilling the small amount of good material from the enormous volume of waste that is released into the theaters. But Memento was a terrific exception to the rule, and the filmmakers didn't even have to use special effects as a crutch since the story was compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Momento","review":"Momento is a mindbending thriller which follows its protagonist, played by Guy Pierce, from the end of his journey back through time to its beginning. In the film, Guy Pierce has a rare condition in which he has no short-term memory. This handicap makes everything harder, as he has to take polariod pictures of people he meets and writes notes upon them to remember something about that person. He is on a mission though, looking for the elusive John G. that raped and murdured his wife, and gave him his condition. When he finds John G. he is going to make him suffer just as he has suffered. Without ever lowering its sharp intensity, Momento comes to a close with not only a satisfying, but an all to poignant end."},{"rating":"2","title":"FADING AWAY","review":"What a wonderfully realized concept for a thriller this is! Christopher Nolan adeptly manages to hold the strands of his main character's constantly disappearing memory together, but if not for the stunning performance of Guy Pearce the entire premise of the film would collapse like a house of cards. Joe Pantolino, and Carrie-Anne Moss are also excellent in this suspenseful, ever-twisting, puzzle that definitely puts the 'mind' in mindgame. MEMENTO is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"otnemom weiver","review":"I waited until the Limited Edition of Memento was released to see it for a second time. I was plesantly surprised. Not only can you watch the film with director Christopher Nolan's commentary but you can also watch the film in chronological order. It is amazing that backward or forward...the film works both ways and is one of the best psychological thrillers in years. Memento is that rare film that can be looked at over and over again and you will always find something that you missed the first time around. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original concept grabs & keeps our attention.","review":"This is a thoroughly original movie. This movie would be right at home in the Twilight Zone or on Playhouse 90. Guy Pierce was convincing as the \\"guy with the memory thing\\" and Carrie Ann Moss was sweet with a hint of something you can't quite put your finger on. Joe Pantoliano was great as the \\"good cop - bad cop\\" dual personality. This movie kept me guessing right up to an ending that could have easily come from a John Carpenter flick. A little twisted but nothing that should offend anyone. There are lots worse on commercial TV.

For those who would like to see the movie in chronological order, you should definitely buy the 2-disc \\"Limited Edition.\\" The 2nd disk has a hidden feature that allows you to see the movie chronologically:1) After inserting Disc 2, select the clock.2) Select answer \\"c\\" 5 times for the questions that come up.3) Select the pictures of the woman changing a tire in reverse order (3,4,1,2)I would not use this feature if you have not seen the movie already, because it ruins the ending (or should I say the beginning?) of the movie. However, it is a great feature for watching the movie over again and understanding the logical sequence of events without feeling like you have amnesia."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD version's pluses and minuses","review":"Ditto what everyone else said about the theatrical version's outstanding cast, direction, and screenplay. This review instead will focus on the DVD's bonus content.For a DVD, the added content -- one TV interview with the director, widescreen format, Dolby audio, digital video, small picture gallery -- is unexceptional. For a movie of Memento's artistic stature, a secondary soundtrack featuring commentary by the cast and director would have been greatly appreciated.I did discover one worthwhile goodie: Buried amid the DVD features is a collection of fictitious newspaper articles and doctors' reports that cast the main character of the movie in still another surprising new light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six Flags Over Your Psyche","review":"Jankis!

We know that there will be a special edition eventually with special features, an added scene and, hopefully, a director's commentary. But with this, we got a DVD earlier that had a few things on it. It wasn't loaded, but you couldn't call it a brown bag edition. And now they're releasing this.

Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano turn in great performances as a man with no short-term memory and a his enemy/sidekick/friend. You will need to watch this movie more than once, because once you've seen the end (or the beginning, as the case may be) you'll want more than anything to go back and observe again how it got there. This DVD is especially nice because it includes, as a special feature, the complete text of the short story the movie is based on.

The premise, the film technique, the characters...all of it was haunting. I knew very little about \\"Memento\\" when I saw it, and I'm glad I didn't. The way that the film is unraveled backwards is unique and mindbending. I often had to ask, \\"Wait, what just happened?\\" in my mind, but it is not too hard to follow. It's true, this movie has you asking \\"Why did that happen?\\" all throughout it. You see something happen, and have to wait until you backtrack further in order to understand it. When I left the theater, I could not speak, I was still trying to fully take in what I had just seen...I think it took me an hour to act normally.

Perhaps there is some rhyme or reason to the STUPID quiz at the beginning which EVENTUALLY will lead you to the special features, but all it ended up doing for me was PISSING ME OFF!!!!!!! It served no purpose as far as I was concerned.I returned to the store today where I bought it, who's policy is that OPENED DVD's may only be returned for the SAME item.I pleaded with the clerk to let me exchange it for the NORMAL DVD version, explaining that the price is the same or less than the LIMITED EDITION and... \\"it's basically the same movie\\".Fortunately, he agreed.

It was difficult to follow, but that's not why I dislike it so much. I found it to be really stupid. The story line is lame, the characters are under-developed, and it is very unrealistic. I mean, jeeze, does anyone really believe that you can give yourself a tattoo with a syringe and some ink from a bic pen that is perfectly legible and looks professionally done? Also, when one gets a tattoo, doesn't it take longer than a few hours for the skin to heal and return to normal? WEAK !! None of the characters in this movie are worth caring about at all.Don't waste your time or your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap cinematic tricks.","review":"The only reason this movie keeps you guessing is through the use of deceptive editing. Had the director used a straight-forward timeline, the \\"mystery\\" would be immediately evident.. I personally don't like contrived confusion. If the screenplay isn't clever enough to engage the movie-goer then throw in a few \\"cuts,\\" jump the time-line around, and \\"voila\\" instant confusion. Much the same effect as Quentin Tarantino uses. When the movie ended, I felt cheated because the mystery is so profoundly mudane. Give me Hitchcock any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but completely depressing","review":"Memento is well made, if nothing else. Taughtly written, well directed, well acted, and once you get used to the backwards storytelling, surprisingly easy to follow. Hopefully it will give a much deserved boost to the careers of Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss and Callum Keith Rennie (not that he really needs one, but I'll show a bit of patriotism anyway).Despite all its good qualities, and despite the fact that I'd like to go back and figure it out properly, from start to finish, I don't think I will. The film is so relentlessly depressing, and disturbing that the ending, while clever, and satisfying on one level, brings its own sense of relief that you can get back to normal life. You certainly don't want to know the characters afterwards. However, this is probably an indication of how well the film establishes mood, and it's definately worth a watch, but I'm not sure I'd recommend buying it right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rethink this one","review":"Although it's based on an interesting concept--that of short-term memory loss--I have difficulty understanding why anyone likes this film. It's very violent, plus the nature of the story requires the same scenes to be played over and over. Enough already! We got the point! The same point could be made in a much more interesting fashion. The production was fine, but overall I found this film to be a real downer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange and unable to follow","review":"This movie was boring strange and we were unable to follow it.

The first half of this movie is not just taught but also funny as hell. The humorous aspects of Guy Pearce's \\"Condition\\" are really well-placed and just make the audience laugh out loud. But the second half of the movie abandons the humor of the story and instead turns into a full-fledged thriller. It's good still, but not nearly as good as the movie's first part. In fact, I'd say the first hour of this movie is one of the best hours of film I've ever seen. Though it does tail off, the movie is still supurb and worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, but ultimately unsatisfying.","review":"The idea of a movie running backwards is intriguing, and this one is well-edited. The different styles made the film a puzzle to figure out as it runs. The whole premise of having no short-term memory is fascinating. Memento has the dark, edginess of Fight Club. It is a very dark film. So if you like movies for the concept, and don't care about a happy ending or uplifting message, then you'll probably like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretentious dreck","review":"I watched this movie based on recommendations, and i hated it.

The truth is that the director made this movie solely for the fact to say \\"Im smarter than all of you, so im going to make a movie that none of you can understand so ill look like the genius\\"And Another Thing, the reason this movie won so many awards makes sense because if you think about it, the average movie critic sees over 1000 movies each year.

The Black and White scenes are the beginning of the movie played forwards. The Color Scenes are the End of the movie played backwards. The actual end of the film is the middle of the story, kind of confusing, but a very original and cool concept. It really points out what it must be like for Leonard who cannot remember past five minutes or so...Funny...I don't feel drunk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a movie you'll forget","review":"Saw this DVD recently - a few friends of mine had hated it, but the reviews here on Amazon encouraged me to give it a try, and i must say i'm not disappointed.This is not a movie to be watched if you want an escape, laughs or tender moments. However, if you'd like to see a movie that demands your full attention to work out what might be going on, then this is a good choice.I found the idea of coping with a condition where one has no short-term memory quite intriguing. I felt that Guy Pierce did a really good job of playing a complex role, and Carrie Ann Moss & Joe Pantiliano were pretty good too.Christopher Nolan does a great job of intelligently directing what must have been quite a challeging movie to make. The editing, central to this movie, was quite smartly done.I don't mind watching this movie once more, perhaps even backwards !!That having been said, this is the kind of movie that you'd either like to watch again & again, or else regret having seen even once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spooky and haunting","review":"Ever wondered what life would be like if you had no short term memory? Then check out this haunting movie..I will be honest the plot is not the best at times but, the movie sucks you up into it.Like some of the more alternate genre movies this one starts at the end of the movie and leads you back to the beginning in steps.. It helps you to distinguish between past and now using black and white photo and color photo both..Sit back and enjoy this one folks.."},{"rating":"2","title":"F'd up movie","review":"Simply, this movie is good, but it confuses you so many times, ive seen this movie at least 5 or 6 times, and i thought that i knew what was all going on, but i still dont."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film!","review":"I think I'm the only person out of my entire sphere of friends and family that actually liked this movie. I mean I really liked it, I think its great. Pierce does a great acting job, and the film doesn't insult your intelligence, it makes you work to follow key plot points.

The ending is horrible, though! It destroys the character's believability. There are other movies like this: _Primal Fear_ comes to mind. The filmmaker just can't resist sticking in his gimmicky little \\"surprise twist\\" ending, even if it ruins the film. Lots of people disagree with my opinion on this, and I don't know what to say to them: if Guy Pierce's character doesn't strike you as a totally unacceptable portrait of a human being, you don't really know our species that well.But up until that phony ending, it's a real nice movie. The backwards narration forces you to give your full attention, and the result is that you become deeply involved in what's going on. It's quite an experience, and I guess ultimately I recommend this movie for that reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Imaginative","review":"Truly an imaginative way to experience a movie - and, while certainly not for the \\"weak-minded\\", I think of the line I just read from one review that stated that it was \\"courageous\\" to make this film in the US. While I do not agree with his brutal assessment that we are as dimwitted as he thinks we are, I DO think that we are far too accustomed to the \\"linear\\" approach to movies - bad guy does bad thing, good guy gets him, blah blah blah. Twists and turns everywhere. Excellent dialogue, especially for Guy Pearce. What is unclear to me, even after a couple of viewings (and with a substantial IQ), is how Natalieis involved with the story - it is a little blurry towards the end.

The central performances are emotionally engaging and taut. Some have complained that this DVD is problematics because there's no commentary. If you watch the film closely and rewind when necessary, is commentary really needed? It might have been nice to hear what Nolan had to say, but I think this film speaks for itself.Unfortunately this has come out on DVD now; it might have had a great shot at winner a best original screenplay Oscar, but being out on video reduces, if not completely elimates, the \\"event\\" value of such a picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"One that keeps you guessing","review":"This film is one of those that keeps you guessing until the end; and one that provokes discussion after you finish watching it.

The movie is told backwards (and I was told that at the beginning as kind of like a caution) so I thought the whole movie is going to be leading up to that scene. Little did I know about the strange plot twists and almost too thought out of a script. Christopher Nolan (Screenwriter and Director) excells in every aspect of writing a genius script. The dialogue is very real and the characters are fully developed. There isn't one reason you shouldn't see this movie, unless you're under the age of around 12 because of the violence and lots of profanity.

Okay, so the characters don't end up giving each other hugs and kisses at the end. So what? It's a great movie that holds your attention for almost 2 hours.I hate movies that assumes the audience is stupid. Nothing worse than a movie that spoon feeds you whats going on, and this one doesn't. Sure, some people won't be able to follow what's going on, and that's too bad for them, but this is a great movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Gets Old","review":"I give it only four stars because even after watching it three times I'm still fuzy about how to connect the dots.

Does he have a tattoo-making friend who owes money to the phone company? I couldn't tell. Also, why does the bald man come so much to the hotel rooms? Does he work for the phone companies maybe? Also the girl was pretty but was in dark places many times - does she have the light burning problem? Maybe she is a witch and explodes in the daytimes!! Can someone please explain? I like the man in the room but he should try markings other than words; he is not a piece of paper!! Maybe that's why he keeps going to same places again!!

The solution, for Leonard, is to become a killer, a good one because he doesn't feel regret (because he soons forget what he did!!!). When Teddy says that he already killed the \\"certain\\" killer of his wife, and proves it by showing a photo of LEonrad smiling full of blood, Leonard destroys the evidence (by means of burning this photo and the photo of the guy he just had killed), and selecting Teddy to be his next \\"target\\", the next man to be hunted to give some meaning to his life!!!!

That much I can garantee you. Guy Pierce suffers from a specialized form of amnesia where he no longer can make short term memories. His long term memory is intact right up to the incident which caused his condition...and his wife's death. Thus our swiss-cheese brained hero is seeking revenge for his wife, while his memory is wiped clean every ten minutes or so. Covered in tatoo's, pocket's full of polaroids with notes scribbled on them (such as a picture of what his car looks like, aptly labeled \\"Your Car\\") Pierce has to try and find the man responsible for the way his life is now while mixing with a great assorment of characters with no idea of how he met any of them or who he can trust.

Leonard cannot remember short term experiences, if he talks for a few minutes he forgets what he started to say. He's trying to track down his wifes killer. which is difficult if you can't remember the clues to the puzzle.Leonard uses tattoos and polaroid photographs to remind himself of the important points, but can he trust the past?Remeniscent of Pulp Fiction in the way the timeline is de-linear, this sparkling classic will be remembered as the film which made both Guy Pearce, and the writer/director Christopher Nolan.

Daring in the way it's done, as it is all backwards, perhaps confusing watching it the first time around but after more viewings the pieces of the puzzle start to click. It still has its flaws I know, like how does he know about his condition? But then again, if he didn't there wouldn't be a story would there?

Smart friends. Memento is a classic who-done-it murder mystery (...) We are deliberately fed conflicting misinformation at the end of the film (or should I say the beginning?). It is as if the director (...) structured the plot-line in reverse chronological order, with the hope that his audience would be sufficiently confused that they would either assume there had been logical explanations for everything or, better yet, they would had invent their own explanations. My friends have come up with differing explanations (...), however these explanations are not necessarily grounded in the \\"facts\\" presented in the film. (...)The real kicker is that many people are watching the movie over and over, hoping to figure it out. Dustin Hoffman's character in Rain Man will sooner figure out \\"Who's on first.\\" And that's because Memento, like Abbott and Costello's famous routine, is not a riddle - it merely thinks that it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 a charm....be prepared to watch this movie at least 3 times!","review":"The more I watch this movie the better it gets.

But It's a shame that so many people find it acceptable to find a film that has been edited this way so interesting. It demands too much concentration and attention.

B.S.!!! This film is unwatchable! I'm not against movies that make you think or assemble the plot in a piece at a time.

Then the end of the movie comes, which is actually the beginning of the story and the viewer discovers the truth: this movie was pointless to begin with!"},{"rating":"1","title":"trying to forget this","review":"memento is one of the movies i ever saw i can't believe it actually stole 25,000,000 from moviegoers it made no sense to me what so ever if want to waste the money then rent memento."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could lose my memory of this movie!","review":"The only good thing about having short term memory loss would be the viewer would forget this crappy, boring, overated movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"It gave ME brain damage!!","review":"What a pretentious mess..I was forced to watch this tribute to pain by a relative who thinks this film is \\"so wonderful and innovative\\". FAH! How can a film be boring and irritating at the same time? The plot revolves around some doofus trying to find his wife's killer, but not like Mannix. He stumbles about in a haze due to the fact that he has no long term memory: \\"Who are you? Where am I? Oh yeah, I wrote down here somewhere..\\"It gets worse, everything is shown backwards, so we see what happens to the goofball in the end, which is the beginning, but it does'nt matter. By the end of the film, which is the beginning, you really don't care about anyone in this forgettable film. I was asking myself the same questions as the main character. And I wanted a drink.A complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone with such a condition should not be carrying a gun ...","review":"...or he may kill the same person many times over.I saw this movie in a theater and in a few hours completely forgot about it, until month later, when visiting the same theater suddenly recognized it among the playing features. Perhaps the film had so powerful an effect that it caused in me a condition, similar to one of the protagonist (at least in relation to the contents of the movie itself). Or may be it was a lack of emotional depth, unrelated shallow characters, and complete absence of purpose that left me nothing to remember. I tend to believe it was the latter.Two stars for an honest attempt at originality."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD fine but story line is confusing and depressing","review":"I heard this was such a good movie but I did not like it ...kind of depressing and weird. Thanks,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Acting","review":"I was intently watching the whole time, parts played very well and kept me interested. Could sense all the emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"I was disappointed in this movie. The cast was great but the story was slow and not to my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Darn Depressing for Me","review":"The acting was too well done. All three leading ladies range from somewhat disatisfied to suicidally depressed and they were convincing. But here's the thing. Watching and listening to people who are depressed is DEPRESSING. And watching this movie was depressing. I watched for about an hour thinking it might pick up, that perhaps a real ray of sunshine would appear. But... I'm giving up. I will not put myself through watching the rest of it.Having gone and read other reviews now, even some by people who liked the film, I don't think I missing anything. Whew.... I need to go watch Miracle or Rudy or Remember the Titans, SOMETHING inspirational to shake off this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boy, did Kidman deserve that award!!!","review":"When it was announced that Nicole Kidman had won the best actress award, I thought \\"Well, she did not deserve that.\\" I knew this movie was great, but wasn't sure about Nicole's performance. Now after seeing her heartbreaking and amazing performance as the troubled Virginia Woolf, she is at the top of my great actress list. Not to negelct Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep, they are always amazing in their roles. For some reason men have trouble watching this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense","review":"I went to this movie knowing that it was going to be rather intense but it hit harder than I expected. This isn't a bad thing but it was a surprise.The 3 stories are interwoven beautifully, with little or no jarring when moving from one to the other. In fact, I really liked the way the film transitioned.The acting is exceptional but I took 1 star off for the story itself being rather hard to follow. I got the feeling that I should have read the book first or at least known the history of Virginia Woolf and her book \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". The research I did after seeing the movie cleared up some of the questions I had.I've heard some negative reviews based on the homosexuality portrayed in the movie. It's sad that people would focus on that instead of just accepting it as part of the story. It's not a \\"gay\\" or \\"straight\\" film but the portrayal of 3 women who's lives are not what most would consider typical."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for everyone","review":"Yes, it's an expensive cast. Yes, it's beautifully made. Yes, it makes an excellent job of conveying a particular mood.The trouble is, there is no let-up from that mood. Two hours of a downward spiral of doom, depression, angst, despair, and suicide, with no let-up at all. With no refrain from such melancholy I was relieved when it ended - the film is lacking in contrast somewhat.I wasn't left with anything at the end of the movie - just a desire to cheer myself up. It didn't make me question anything and it didn't raise any issues for me. I found it unchallenging - the only challenge was following the dense plot and the tedious, whispered monologues.Your mother might like it - but she'll wonder what you're trying to say when you give it to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the book","review":"While this is based on my favorite book, I hated it so much that I could not even finish watching it. The book is largely internal monologue, which does not transfer to the screen. Also, the book is more character driven than plot driven, which really does not transfer well to the screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good acting . . . Bad movie","review":"Is it possible to have a great cast that gives great performances and have a bad movie? Yes it is . . . and this is it. My recommendation - see most anything else (I nearly feel asleep)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good movie","review":"I thought this would be a good movie with all the great actresses until I realized that Virgina woolf was indeed very mentally ill so was her sister, lets face it Lesbian sisters who are also incestuous to each other. I am sorry But I am ashamed to see a movie like this get such a good review, trying to portray something so creepy as being ok, it not ok"},{"rating":"2","title":"hello freelancing???????","review":"...I thought it was the most beautiful piece of cinema i've seen in a while, not that i don't disagree with some issues. Particularly troubling is the character of Laura Brown, beautifully rendered by Julianne Moore. Laura was mentally sick. period. No doubt the strictures of her lifestyle added to her demons but judging her decision of abandoning her family to be the only choice she had is misplaced. I feel more sorry for the children that were forced to grow up without a mother than a person whose choices in life to me read individual failing rather than progressive feminism."},{"rating":"1","title":"superficial","review":"There are three interrelated stories in this movie, but each is essentially formulaic and, inevitably, none of them is explored in depth. The result is a series of snapshots which simply do not add up to a satisfying movie. Is there some interrelation between the stories which provides a payoff? Apart from the trite and obvious (time passes and things change) I see none. This is a very disappointing movie, in view of the accolades and high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overacted from the start","review":"This was the most overacting in a film I have seen in a long time. I was going into to this film thinking this has 3 super actress of our lifetime. I turned out to be very boring and hard to watch. Yes, it seemed like HOURS and HOURS watching these actresses trying for an Oscar nomination.The story is tied to together with the writings of Virginia Wolffe and how it \\"effected\\" their lives. It ends up being a jumbled up mess and very confusing.The film was no joy or entertaining for that matter. It was a waste of 2 HOURS.Watch \\"The Pianist\\" to see how a film should be done with great acting but not overacting every role."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and Confusing","review":"The first fifteen minutes were incredibly boring. No, I wasn't expecting an action movie. The mixture of four time periods was confusing. I've got better things to do than try to keep all the story lines straight and still get the message. I doubted it would get any better, so I gave up. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and depressing","review":"It's a depressing movie about a mental illness that makes one desire to commit suicide. I found nothing inspirational about the movie because the characters did nothing to change their situation.The movie attempts to philosophize about life and happiness. Noone should take that seriously because it's coming from a mentally ill person. The message is don't cherish life and it took all of two hours to deliver it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hours","review":"If you weren't depressed when you walked in to see this movie, you certainly will be by the time you finish it. Many customers walked out early and I wish I had. What a waste of talent.Don't bother to go see \\"The Hours\\". believe me you will find itvague, disjointed and distasteful. No one was happy, not even the serious little boy. He was so worried about his mother that he could think of nothing else. What a downer this movie is."},{"rating":"2","title":"three women, three suicides","review":"Virginia Woolf's 1925 novel Mrs. Dalloway becomes the common thread that knits together the stories of three women (Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep) from three different times and places, all of whom attempt suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen","review":"My wife purchased this movie on a recomendation from a friend. This movie was long, dull, and depressing. It's about 3 lesbians from different time periods who commit suicide? It goes back and forth between the women and thier dull lives. I knew from the first 5 minutes it was going to suck but my wife made me sit through this garbage. At the end we both were shocked at how displeasurable the experience was. I am baffled at how anyone could enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours","review":"This movie is not worth one star unless you enjoy being tricked into watching a movie about homosexuality and can't possibly figure it out until the very end.Save yourself the pain and avoid this movie at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie that will make you snooze !","review":"I just try to figure out why they made this movie.The story is simple and it's possible to resume in few words : 3 lesbian and suicidal, bored in life women are living in different period time. That's it ! Nothing else. Isn't there a lack of something that makes a story interesting ? Yes ! This something is missing a lot. Believe me. It is boring and nothing happen except everlasting dialogues. This stuff should have been a book only. Showing the book and turn each page in front the camera could have been more exciting !Run away before you fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great piece of work","review":"You need to be well versed in literature to understand this film - even then it is not a great piece of work. It is simply about depressed self-absorbed lesbians. There is little else for anyone that does not fit into one of those categories. Not even Kidman and Streep's superb acting skills could resurrect this film from the dust bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooorrrrrriiiiinnnnnnnnnnnnnnnggggg!","review":"Lots of big names but very slow, boring and depressing.

Nicole Kidman is unrecognizable, her make up is great, Julianne Moore has been denied by the award comitee for years, she's a great actress she deserves one already, and Meryl Streep as always saving a play that lack of a true stunning ending, I just lost this movie at the end..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too melodramatic","review":"After and hour and I couldnt take The Hours anymore and shut it off.

The acting is excellent, especially by Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark, dank, moldy, musty and full of itself.","review":"If you liked this movie, get a friggin' life. \\"The Hours\\" is one of the most horrible films that I've had to sit through in quite some time. The movie goes on forever and the score just magnifies the tedium of it all. I couldn't stop thinking of that scene in \\"Apocalypse Now\\" with Marlin Brando holding his head in his hands and muttering \\"the horror.....the horror\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Suburbs Suck.","review":"Virginia Woolf is frustrated by having to live in the suburbs instead of in her beloved London to the point of being suicidal - she later DOES commit suicide after the Germans bomb her London home to oblivion - thank you, Germans; Julianne Moore's 50's housewife is trapped in the suburbs with an entitled husband and an unpleasant neurotic child who grows up to be a failed impersonator of Marcel Proust and a torturer of Meryl Streep's character who lives in Greenwich Village but creates chores for herself that make her just as suburban as any housewife with busy work that has her circling the drain instead of reaching any higher plain. Both Nicole Kidman and Julianne Moore are better actresses than Meryl Streep and have bigger roles in this film as well. I guess Mrs. Dalloway is a nonevent. She does have an interestingly strange face - sometimes she looks Asian."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT!","review":"i have to disagree with the negative reviews towards this film. One reviewer said it was \\"HARD TO UNDERSTAND\\" and another said \\"ITS TOO DARK\\". To those really, open your minds before you open your mouth or type a word to review an item.From my point of view, i aint gonna tell you what the film is about b/c the very first review does that quite well actually. But i gotta say i absolutely loved this movie. yes it is dark, depressing but really you do have to understand it to really know whats going on..but thats the beauty of some movies U ACTUALLY HAVE TO THINK TO WATCH THE MOVIE sadly for the reviewer who didn't \\"understand\\" the movie there's gonna be alot more to be released in that manner. lol i guess he aint gonna watch any movies anytime soon.Truth is, i loved it more for its realistic subjects about these 3 ladies. this is great acting and a great film."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED \\"THE DAYS\\"!","review":"This dreary, boring movie seemed to go on for days! Sorry, but I could not find a shred of empathy for these characters and can't believe it received so many oscar nominations and an oscar for best actress. This is not entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitively Awful","review":"This Film is one of those that only the Critics would love.Believe it or not, on my First view of HOURS, I did not know that Virginia Woolf was played by Kidman. I just knew that who-ever it was had been truly Dreadful.As good as the Artistic production is on this Work, Kidman is just Plain Awful.And Just as I Loved The Start of SCREAM because Drew was Done away with, it was brilliant that Kidman's Character was appropriately Dispatched.Such a waste of Space for these Hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hours (Widescreen Edition)","review":"The night I first watched this movie I had trouble sleeping. My emotions where all over the place and I felt as if someone had taken a large piece of my life and made a movie of it.Desperate - All wanting the truth in their lives but sofrightened to take the step.Flowers - Color, beauty, contrast to the real world.Words - Beauty, conflict, traumer, insight, irrelevance,deep thought, totally absorbed, live and diesituations.Party - The giving of.Duty - What is a women's duty, children, wife, writter,cook, cleaner, nurse, lover, or all of the above.Gets less traumic the next time you watch and more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A film about life with depth","review":"I think life and death with mental illness were well expressed in the film. The author knows how people in distress feel, think, and do, and the film beautifully expressed it. Since different life stories of different persons go on at the same time, I think I may have to watch carefully a few times to completely get the whole story. Some words said in the film are as beautiful as literature. It is psychological and philosophical.I would like to warn you that there are many suicidal scenes, and death is underlining thing in this film. Just so you know in case you may want to avoid that topic certain times of your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"I thought when I saw this movie it would be entertaining, but it wasn't. The theme of this movie homosexuality, sucide and mental ilness is not my form of entertainment. This movie was the worst one I ever seen except for the movie American Beauty. Please don't go to see this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"For those of you who like Lesbian movies, this will be great for you. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Boring! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Goers Beware","review":"I should have learned my lesson by now. When a film is touted as a \\"must see film\\" by movie critics, I'll remember this film and make sure I don't waste my time or money to see it. I wouldn't recommend renting this film for home viewing either. This film starts out depressing and I kept waiting for it to get better. This was just another vehicle for Hollywood to push homosexuality and lesbianism as a normal way of life. There was nothing in the previews or reviews to alert the public as to content and what they could expect if they went to see this film. I tried to find something in the film to keep me watching but gave up after 50 minutes and left along with several others. Walking out was refreshing after the doom and gloom I had just endured."},{"rating":"1","title":"An upsetting and demented movie!","review":"I don't really know what the magnificent reviews are all about. I guess when you have actors like Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman the critics tend to get overexcited. I was very upset by this movie. It theme was morbid and the music even more depressing. I guess in times like these it is the \\"IN\\" thing to constantly harp on themes like homosexuality and lesbianism, but this is not an uplifting movie. When I go to see a film it is to be entertained and come out with a good feeling. This film certainly failed on that count. I don't want to see women kissing women, AIDS victims throwing themselves out of the window and women drowning themselves in a lake. This story is about misfits who cannot accept life. Aside from the acting, which was great, I hated the film. I'm sorry I bought it and will soon dump it. Hollywood is becoming obsessed with the gay issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"What a boring and dark film!! We watched it because of all the hype about this movie from media. What a waste of talent and film!! What tries to be a moving story turns out to be a disappointment. Actually, it wasn't all that disappointed as we were not anticipating anything out of the film to begin with. What we did learn was that there was a lot of homosexual overtones to each of the characters. I didn't have a problem with how the movie cut back and forth to each of the 3 characters, however, the stories were very unattractive. It made you want to slap each of them and say \\"Snap out of it!! Grow up and be glad you are alive!\\" Seriously, each of these characters brooded over everything. Kidman's character was the worst. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this terrible movie. This movie and \\"American Beauty\\" are in the same boat. Let's hope it sinks and goes straight to the bottom!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hours","review":"this film was truly awful and a waste of my time...I thought there would be a deeper view of these women and their emotions in their time but the point was lost...took days to finally figure there was just no point to this movie..if you want to see these actresses kiss other women see it but if you are looking for some deep emotional drama that delves into the complexity of a woman don't bother seeing this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically good, horrible content","review":"This film was excellent from a technical standpoint - the three timeframes were seamlessly blended and the cinema work was great. For that I give it 2 stars.Having said that, the story itself was little more than a blatant celebration of homosexuality and lesbianism. It is a sad testimony that so much effort is being made to 'make mainstream' a deviant lifestyle.Interesting that the advertising never points out the true nature of the film - otherwise, my wife and I would never have gone to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Beyond Belief","review":"My wife and buy movies to be entertained. After 45 minutes of this one, we looked at each other and said why are we watching this show. The title is appropriate however, minutes do seem like hours hanging on to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"they never should've made the movie","review":"even though all the actors did a great job and it is very faithful to the book, but you really wouldn't get this movie unless you read the book, which is much better and you get it more. The hours is really about inside one's mind, and no matter how hard you try, you just can't get that on screen. if you didn't read the book, the feeling you are getting from the hours is basically that there's something wrong with the women but you don't really know what, they just appear wrong. it's too awkward.go read the book, if you didn't like the book, don't even bother to see the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Boring and pointless. If you want a deep and thoughtful film, try the foreign section of your video store. There is no motivation as to why Julianna Philips' character wants to kill herself. I don't think a failed birthday cake warrants such drastic measures. Her character is dull, and perhaps has more going on inside her head, then is relayed to the audience. And what about Kidman's fake nose and glasses. If an actor can't play the role from within her own instincts and needs cheap props to get them there, it's time to revisit acting class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Over-rated \\"Artsy\\" Flick","review":"Tremendous cast - well acted. Still, a deeply disappointing film. While it was a well-made film, I didn't find it deserving of the accaim it has received.The plot was too melodramatic -- all truly brilliant women are lesbian, eccentric, depressed, and suicidal. In my opinion it was a not so subltle attempt to villify the nuclear family, portray marriage between men and women as oppressive, and promote the notion the only truly fulfilled woman is the openly gay middle-aged Clarissa.That's art?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed viewer","review":"This moving is awful: boring, depressing and pointless!

I couldn't even finish watching the last half hour or so. No wonder they were troubled... They need JESUS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Waster","review":"I thought this movie was a complete waste of time. The movie was hard to follow and really had no good point. I can't even believe I sat through the whole thing! I love a good biography and good acting, but this storyline did not hold my interest. I almost dozed off a few times. I don't even want to give away the movie. I would feel bad knowing other people would be wasting 2 precious hours of their lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"I found this movie dull and two-dimensional. The plot is about three women in three different time periods (only separated by about 40 years each), who are depressed. The plot connects the people through a book by Virginia Woolf. I am not sure what the point of view of the writer was. There are several philosophical statements repeated. It seems that the movie is about people not living the way they want to live. It never seems to develop completely. However, the acting is superb. As a woman, I did not feel a connection to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUH? TOO MANY HOURS!!","review":"All i could keep thinking was-What is the point of this movie? It STINKS!!!I saw it at a preview screening for free and still wanted to walk out.Kidman was the worst in this bad excuse for a movie.She is MUCH MUCH better in Moulin Rouge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hollywood's self-indulgent mess","review":"Yes, it's Virginia Wolfe, and yes it's Streep, Kidman and Moore, all very well respected actors. But COME ON! I hated it. It's so DEEP that one is supposed to bow down and grovel at its' inner meaning and mensa level plot. Kidman was better in Days of Thunder and Eye Wide Shut (that statement was sarcasm for those who weren't sure).Oh well, I've never felt the impulse to write one of these reviews before but I just felt compelled to air my feelings. I absolutely love the movies. I am seduced by good plots and great characterizations. This was boring and tedious. Don't waste your time or money unless you need to have something to chat about at your next afternoon tea in the Hamptons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal, pointless joke of a movie","review":"What a load of tripe this film turned out to be. It's completely humorless, pointless, and incredibly pretentious. It has all of the depression of Ingmar Bergman's studies on madness and depression but with none of his artistry or insight into the human condition. You know zero about the three leads conditions nor do you care, it all seems to be an excuse to show off film editing techniques and to allow a crew of fine actors/actresses to \\"shine\\" by overacting in hopes of winning the coveted golden statue. An hour into the film I wished they would all stop their crying and carry out their suicidal urgings so I could move on to a real film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Sobfest","review":"I can't understand why people raved about it. It is full of neurotic people, self-centered, solipsistic characters who take themselves so seriously and with such verbosity against a background of plaintive music that you're grateful when someone finally succeeds at dying.The movie is very good at evoking the sense ofclaustrophobia that the characters feel, but the characters are not themselves interesting enough to justify the overwrought emotions this movie tries to stampede over us.Interesting narrative structure, interweavingthree separate stories, two of which mirror events in Woolf's book Mrs. Dalloway, and a surprise ending. Still,a disappointment and hardly deserving of the raves it got."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Wonderful Performances","review":"All of the women in this film give good performances. Nicole Kidman does a wonderful job playing a whacked out sheltered Virginia Woolf. My favorite performances where those by Julianne Moore and Meryl Streep. These two women seemed to outshine Nicole Kidman in this film. All three storylines were strong. I really think this is a chick flick, I liked it, my husband hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Hour","review":"Only One Hour was all I could handle before I decided \\"this just isn't going to get any better,\\" and headed for the lobby.I admire all of the the actresses here. They have each been in an excellent role recently. Further, I admire Virginia Woolf, one of the pioneers of Modern literary technique. But this grumpy film about three women who are unhappy for some inexplicable reason, surrounded by their sad friends, un-understood by servants and loving husbands, relatives, children, inflicted needless cruelty on its viewers. Yes, I get the idea that they are repressed lesbians, and they may want to commit suicide over something which seems trivial to others, but did they have to be so unrelievedly grim about it? A magnificent wallow in self-involvement. Let young people see this film only as a punishment for truly bad behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEX TRASH","review":"Sex Trash directly from the Mind Sewer Masters of Hollywood. Disturbing. Very disturbing. Nicole Kidman at least had the intelligence to disguise herself with that nose job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts out bad and gets worse","review":"This movie starts out simpering, ridiculous and depressing and descends into maudlin, ridiculous and depressing. That is, it would be depressing IF YOU CARED ABOUT THE CHARACTERS. All three female leads navel gaze and contemplate suicide. You find yourself rooting for the characters to kill themselves so that they would save the rest of the world from the misery they inflict by their constant self-obsession.And it's an ugly, dark film. The lighting is blue or brown. The soundtrack is the same minor-chord piano riff over and over again. Juliana Moore's teeth look like they've been through 40 years of tea drinking and have never seen Ultra Brite. Nicole Kidman uses one facial expression -- a frown.I hated this movie and watched it to the end solely so I could write an informed review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Boring to Watch","review":"I'm so glad I didn't buy this movie but only rented it.I looked forward to seeing it all the way home from work, but found it so boring that I turned it off after only 10 minutes.I must give a word of praise for the makeup artists, though. They did a wonderful job of transforming Nicole Kidman's face into a semi-resemblance of Virginia Wolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"As fun as being smashed in the kidneys with a hammer","review":"Perhaps I am biased in that I wish Virginia Woolf was still alive so I could run her over in my car. Twice. But aside from the fact that this film was based on that repulsive stain on literature that is Woolf, it was still horrendous. All the characters are so uninteresting that you want them to die within the first 10 minutes just so something exciting will happen. Kidman looks likes she's suffering severe constipation for most of the film, although that may just be the fact that she's playing such a ridiculously boring character that she has no choice but to try and add some personality. If you have the choice between seeing this film or running face first into a wall, pucker up and plant a big one on that slab of concrete, because your head will hurt less than sitting through this crapfest. I hate Virginia Woolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"endless hours","review":"At the end of the ultimate in chick flick moviedom, my husband summed it all up in one phrase, \\"what a waste of money.\\" Let me go a few better: what a waste of time (viewing as well as producing), costuming, make-up, lighting, film and talent. All these good actors with one set of directions, mule, puke and be miserable.Did you catch the part about the little boy having a tea party with his stuffed animals? How about Meryl not knowing who the father of her daughter is, \\"yes dear, you were conceived by anonymous sperm donor!\\" The only reason we sat through it was to see how it would be tied together in the end. This film deserves a new rating: So What.Roger Ebert gave this movie 4 stars. I think he was bribed."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Woman \\"Magnolia\\"","review":"Excellently acted by all three actresses. Juliane Moore shines in her role as a \\"50s\\" desperate housewife. Her role particularly interested me because of the similarity of the story lines with another movie she appeared in which was \\"Magnolia\\", which also included John Reilly who played the policeman in Magnolia and her husband in Hours. Magnolia is another screenplay that involves the lives of people and the way their paths interact. In \\"Hours\\" we are treated to a three generational story about how a book causes this intersection. In Magnolia we see many more intersections all leading up to an unrealistic ending (the frog shower). In comparison, Magnolia did have a somewhat happy ending. And both films left me totally satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airy Fairy Ending","review":"I found the movie to be a bit too melodramatic. The first two women suffered from the claustrophobic pressures of their societies. But Meryl Streep's character I didn't get. I could not understand why she was so miserable unless it was over the loss of happiness she used to have with her AIDS-ridden ex-lover Richard. He did nothing to ease her pity for him and almost blamed her for being selfish in missing the happiness they shared instead of allowing him to die in peace. Ungrateful, if you ask me.In the end, Julianne Moore's character creates a sort of closure for all those involved, but I certainly have not seen the results of that closure. I'm still confused. What was resolved, if anything was resolved at all? The theme of the movie went along the right dramatic lines but the ending just fizzed away. Performances were rightfully brilliant but story line just a bit too airy fairy for me. Not a heavy drama, but not a light drama either. Watch it if you have the patience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correcting disinformation from Connecticut . . .","review":"The reviewer below from Wallingford, CT stated The Hours was one of the worst movies he had ever seen. One has to wonder, though, just how much of it he actually saw. He says it's about \\"3 lesbians . . . who commit suicide.\\" Leaving aside the issue of whether or not \\"lesbian\\" is the most appropriate way to describe two of the three main characters, this supposed plot summary is just plain false. Only ONE of the women commits suicide -- the one who really existed in real life, and did indeed really commit suicide, Virginia Woolf. And, guess what, she does it in the first five minutes of the movie.It would appear that not only did the Wallingford reviewer \\"know from the first 5 minutes\\" that this movie \\"was going to suck,\\" but that he didn't bother to watch beyond that initial 5. If he had, he might have seen (the rest of) one of the most extraordinary American/British movies of the past decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"More movies ought to be like this.","review":"I know I'm only thirteen, and I admit I haven't read the book (I have a two page reading list already), but if more movies had deep, moving stories that made you think like this one does instead of hours of car chases and battles and whatnot, then we would all be better off. Action is good in small amounts, but the amount of movies in the theater that don't contain action is deppressingly low. This movie combines the lives of three different women in three different times, yet they are all connected in a way. This movie is creepy at times, due in large part to the erie music, in some ways it is scarier than most horror movies. But it is scary in a way that even the wimpiest people can watch it with out a problem. I am probably not making much sense, but you'd know if you'd seen the movie. It is truly a masterpiece that should be seen by everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Social Work","review":"Great movie for anyone that works in human services.

I had no idea who Virginia Woolf was until I watched this movie.Mental illness, AIDS, child abandonment are what make this movie sad and moving.You wont recognize Nicole Kidman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Fuss Over a Bad Movie","review":"The plot of this movie was basically about three suicidal, depressed, lesbians in different time periods who all had something to do with the book \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". I spent the entire movie trying to figure out the point of it and when it ended I was confused and disgusted. I think this movie was a waste of The Hours I spent watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could barely make it through it....","review":"I'm sorry - but this movie was horrible! I would classify myself as an average american, and this just did NOT appeal to me at all. I will give a huge kudo to Nichole Kidman for her performance, but other than that - it was awful. I get so tired of people continously putting the \\"beautifully creative\\" label on any movie that portrays homosexuality in a positive role.Pass on this one....please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of No Value","review":"A movie with incredible shallow character development. It replicates the view of every misogynist that woman have no meaningful life other than the one driven by their own hormones. If I were a woman (or feminist) I would be insulted by this manic-depressive, \\"lesbianic\\", incestuous world that has been created. It offers nothing, makes no point and has no relevance. If acting means extracting all joy from your words and facial mannerisms then the acting was great... if it means more than that it was horrid. What a dog of a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Shame!!!","review":"What a shame when an all star cast meet and achieve nothing! It is not because they are bad in any way, shape, or form, but because the story does not mean alot to %99.999999 of normal people.You have to be from a psychologically defected familly to relate to \\"this so called movie\\".The story is very simple, 3 females suffering from depression in 3 different periods of time each with minor differnce in the environment.\\"Suicide, homosexuality, and social communication\\" seems to be the high notes of the movie. Even no adaptive/positive behavior is shown or contemplated in the whole script.This is what I call a \\"Dark Movie\\" that should be viewed with the tv screen off to achive the best result."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to walk out but my wife wouldn't let me.","review":"I counted 4 suicides, 3 lesbian kisses (all sad), a terminal homosexual AIDS patient, artificial insemination (fatherless daugther), mental depression, child abandonment (very sad eyes) and breast cancer. I could go on with the depressing themes but you get the idea. Add in annoying time shifts and you have a huge chick flick flop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two boring Hours","review":"This movie is pointless and a poor transition from page to screen. The book was lovely and moving. The movie dull and lifeless, and the musical score has to be one of the worst in modern history. I will give the actors all A's for effort, but their talent is wasted here."},{"rating":"1","title":"A focus on pain, with painful music","review":"The acting's pretty good in places -- but that's all.The surest sign of what you're in for in this kind of Hollywood Spectacle is the music -- driving you to believe something important is happening, when nothing is happening. Even the music goes nowhere -- it starts with portent and ends with portent -- the typically lightweight range and depth of a self-important 'modern' idiot like Philip Glass.Anyway, that's just the most irritating thing about a movie that says nothing about death because it says nothing about life -- except symbolically in an oft-repeated story about 'a particular morning on the beach'. We're supposed to feel \\"what a bunch of trapped people -- maybe we're all trapped -- but maybe there's hope\\". I know this because the point is made at the beginning and is remade dozens of times -- focusing on the same pain endlessly, in a flat movie where nothing will unfold but your cerebellum."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Ugly Nose That Changes Colors in the Light","review":"As much as I have appreciate prior works of each of these actors, I had no sympathy for any of them. I found them selfish, depressing, neurotic and I did not care if they lived or died except the little boy who ended up jumping out of the window. I could identify. Someone needed to put all of them out of their misery. When Meryl Streep started making out with her roommate, I was about to jump out the window and decided instead to turn it off and return it to the nearest video store ASAP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"The Hours has an audience in people who share the void suffered by its characters. That void is where a life is supposed to be. If you are one of these people, then get a life. The rest of us found The Hours unforgivably dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dark and depressing film.","review":"The underlying theme of this film seems to be one should live, and end, one's life as one wants to, no matter what the consequences for others. The film concerns three unstable women whose lives are intertwined through Virginia Woolf's novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway.\\" There is no real plot and I could not sympathize with any of the main characters. The only character I could sypathize with was Kitty whose life was being taken out of her hands. Also, I didn't think it was possible for Julianna Moore to look unattractive, but this film managed it. I do not understand why this film has received rave reviews. For anyone who wants to see it, I recommend waiting to rent the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful, pretentious, boring waste of talent","review":"this film is a plotless melodrama about selfish, self-absorbed people. it was dull, pretentious and boring. the only straight male characters were weak and codependent(mr. virginia woolf) or clueless(mr. julianne moore). reverse the genders of the male stereotypes and there would have been an outcry of political incorrectness. don't waste your time. one would think that with this many stupendous actors that something better could have been made of it all but alas...it was terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadness!","review":"These three women were looking for something that none of them found. They needed unconditional love, and in that their three lives came together. There is such a ubiquitous sadness, and it makes one wonder if it is possible to find some sense of happiness or fullfillment in one's life, or if it is just a chimera. Running away or dissolving your identity into somone else's or just walking into a stream is not an end, and, unfortunately is not much of a beginning either. Are we all destined for unhappy desperation . . great talent doesn't do it, neither does a conventional housewife's existence give answers, nor, apparently does caring for someone else. Maybe life is a haphazard set of experiences leading downward, and ultimately to nothingness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Mess of a movie","review":"I looked forward with anticipation to watching this movie after I saw a trailer for it. I was greatly disappointed with it. Jumping between 4-5 time frames to women who you didn't know what their basic malfunction was made the movie very hard to understand. I had no clue until the credits were rolling that the one lady was supposed to be Virginia Wolfe, probably because I missed the clues. But why these woment were depressed, who was Richard and why was he in the one woman's life(Streep), were never answered. All in all it was not entertaining. Maybe if you have a degree in literature it might have made more sense, but as someone who has never read Virginia Wolfe's work (nor do I care to) it was a senseless and boring movie. My copy is going out the the thrift store. Maybe someone else will enjoy it. I'm just glad we got it cheap at a library sale as I would have hated to pay full price for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no substitute for quality...","review":"The Hours has all of the ingredients of a great film: subtlety, competent acting, good dialogue, great costuming, and Meryl Streep. Usually a discriminating moviegoer has to go to the independent theaters to catch a quality movie. I personally love \\"timeline movies\\", and this one was very cleverly done.If you are taking the initiative to read customer reviews (Amazon.com customer reviewers are the some of the best reviewers I have ever seen, way better than the \\"movie critics\\", except for Roger Ebert, of course), you will find this movie thought-provoking and intriguing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting more.","review":"I thought this story was very slow and boring. I only made it through about 30 minutes of it but that was enough for me. Maybe , given more time, it would have picked up its pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-acted but hard to understand","review":"This movie has beautiful acting and cinematography but it is difficult to pick up the various threads and make sense of them, particularly if you are unfamiliar with the Virginia Wolfe novel, \\"Mrs. Dalloway\\". The movie centers around three women, Virginia Wolfe, played by a hard-to-recognize Nicole Kidman; an unhappy young housewife from the 50's, played by Julianne Moore; and a modern-day woman played by Meryl Streep. Their stories interweave with one another and there are common themes of mental illness, lesbianism and unhappy women with death wishes. Not exactly light entertainment! There were times when I wanted to tell the main characters to snap out of it and get on with life rather than wallow in the melancholy and self-pity which they display. This is a movie designed more for art than for entertainment, so be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hours and hours of dreary drudgery","review":"Please understand that I knew going in that this was a highly rated film that has a large adoring audience. But I will always give an honest assessment of how I react to a film. Maybe my expectations were too high. No, that's not it, at all. I really didn't know what to expect.This is three stories spun loosely into one. Set decades apart, in the 1920's, 1950's and 1990's, three women lead very comfortable but miserably unfulfilling lives. They mope about, drowning in self-pity, wishing they were happy, but doing nothing to achieve that goal. They seem to luxuriate in their own angst. Oh, sweet sorrow...Bah! These women are largely unsympathic characters with no discernable qualities other than their deep dissatisfaction with their upper-middle class existence. I'm just glad that I rented this rather than seeing it in a theater, where I'd have paid so much more for two hours of sheer boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unstable","review":"Surely you have seen or at least heard of Clint Eastwood's \\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly?\\" Well \\"The Hours\\" would more appropriately be titled \\"The Insane, the Unhappy, and the Confused.\\" Yes it was beautifully filmed. Yes it was well acted. But what is the point? Oh, by the halfway mark I had consumed 2.5 bourbons so maybe I missed the point. If you are male, stay away.

Although the performances of Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman, Julianne Moore and Ed Harris were at times brilliant, I found the story to be an artistic tribute to sadness, dispair and confusion. The intertwining stories left me often confused and discouraged by the inability of the characters to do anything positive to change their lives. Instead they focus on death as a solution and give the impression that everything in life is hopeless. This is another case of Hollywood trying to show how intellectual it can be and missing the point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slooooooow.......kept checking how much time was left","review":"Wow - this is the slowest movie I've seen in a long time. Slow slow slow. Any other Harrison Ford move is way better. I think this is by far his worse flick and the worst and slowest I've seen in a long time. I kept checking how much time was left and looking for places I could fast forward a quick 30-90 seconds. Yuck.Reviews are 1-5 stars which makes average a 3 (1+5)/2 instead of an average of 2.5 (0+5)/2 which would be true if one could give 0 stars. Being the worse flick I've seen in a long time, I would give it a 0 if possible. Mentally I subtract about 1/2 point from averages overall reviews to get a more accurate product rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Drama","review":"Harrison Ford can do no wrong.

I was quite dissappointed with the finale - again Arab terrorist, US national security at stake, dumb US embassy agents. Multiple deja vu. Desole. I excpected something more original and kinkier, smth darker and deeper. Overall, it's always a pleasure to see smth different from mainstream simplified ugliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining, underrated movie","review":"This is a lot of fun - a must for any fans of Ford, Polanski, Paris, etc. Special kudos to the Grace Jones song which recurs throughout the picture - it is haunting, beautiful and hypnotic, like Paris itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb!","review":"This is one of my very favorite Harrison Ford movies. The action keeps moving and H.F. is, as always, right on the mark. I also enjoyed the Parisian location shots and the great soundtrack, which includes music by Grace Jones. I wish the soundtrack was still in production!This is a great film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining","review":"Unfortunately, like most movies of this type, the plot simply isn't credible. Might as well watch batman or some such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat suspense!","review":"While Roman Polanski was avoiding authories in America in 1988, he managed to put together a superb suspense thriller. It stars Harrison Ford in a rather unique role; that of a doctor, an every man type such as Jimmy Stewart in \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" without the Indiana Jones hype. Although filmed 18 years ago, it seems more contemporary that ever. A fine thriller that even Hitch would approve!What is NOT contemporary is the fact that we consumers here in Region 1 - North America, that's right, Canada too, get nothing but JUNK & GARBAGE from the releasing studios. Lousy, grainy transfers in the edited Pan & Scan format; not fit for anything but a 7\\" DVD personal viewer! Why is this and most any other post-1953 movie presented in it's original aspect ratio available in Region 2 - Europe but not on this side of the pond? Disney is by far the major offender in this area but hey, what say you Warner Bros.?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A frantic search!","review":"\\"Frantic\\" is an admirable film in which the violence plays the role of referential support, focusing basically about the psychological aspects of terror, anger and disturbance aroused in the soul of this Amercian doctor when his wife is kidnapped just in the first day of the trip.To my mind, this film signed and drifted the successful career of this successful actor. Harrison grew up as actor conferring him for that moment the label of the mature actor for definition. It's not a mere casualty \\"Working girl\\" would be his next film. Nay, his terrific performance in \\"The fugitive\\" keeps a very narrow resemblance in which dramatic facets respect this role.One of the most distinguished cult movies of the eighties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Awful pacing make it only worth it for the score","review":"I got this from my grandma when she bought my DVD player for my 8th grade graduation. I expected a great movie but I was so wrong and found myself falling asleep and stopping it. I had to turn it off a number of times before i could finish the full viewing. All i can say that is good about this film is the acting and the great score. I like the type of noir sound that is in the score. with a little more action this would be excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frantic?!?","review":"Frantic? Hardly! This poorly-directed and produced film really rides on the back of Harrison Ford and a few, albeit short, scenes of fast action, none of which really amount to creating much suspense. The character of Sondra is poorly depicted by Betty Buckley, an actress whose small part should have served the role of building sympathy for her plight. Instead her brief moments at the beginning of the film tend to disengage the audience. There is never any great compassion developed for her as Buckley unwittingly portrays her character as snobbish, difficult, and unloveable to some degree. In terms of directing, Polanski misses the mark as there is rarely any sense of urgency or parallel understanding transferred over to the audience; the movie is disjointed at times. It would be easy to become as ambivalent about the whole thing as the French police. I would recommend a strong pot of coffee for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"frantic","review":"This is an excellent polanski film for personal film noir. Ford does a great yet subliminal character formed from a simple plot to recover his wife from a mysterious disapearance. An involved story that is more eclectic than straight forward in it's telling...."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of Harrison's worst...","review":"After I watched this, I was frantically trying to get my money back. Having been too young to see it when it came out in the theaters, I thought that I'd give it a try on DVD. I've loved pretty much everything that Ford has been, but this one certainly does not go on my list. I think that the basic premis of the movie is a good one... man and wife go to exotic foreign city, woman vanishes from hotel room, man scratches his head, hotel offers no clue, man goes crazy (or becomes frantic, i guess)... but the main chunk of the movie, the 'frantic' part, is put together poorly.. it is hard to follow, at best, and the collection of characters that Ford encounters is a blur. This movie is best watched on cable on a Sunday afternoon as you fall asleep on the couch.. do NOT waste your money on a personal copy of the DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD 1 star, movie 3 stars","review":"FRANTIC is not among the best of Polanski's movies, in fact it represents one step in his decline. However, he is/was a serious filmmaker, and the movie deserves to be presented in its correct 1:85 to 1 format.The same goes for ARTHUR, the same goes for CHARLEY VARRICK. Also MOSCOW ON THE HUDSON, perhaps Paul Mazursky's best movie, full screen only. Very good movies incomprehensibly marketed in full screen.I would be delighted to see My Cousin Vinnie or American Pie released full screen, because they deserve it. Junk release for junk movie.Do not even think about buying this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Harrison Ford's best movie","review":"This movie was very slow and didn't have a story line. I would not reccomend it to anyone! Big wast of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning","review":"This is a fairly entertaining thriller with a nice performance by Harrison Ford in his standard 'everyman' role to recommend it. Unfortunately Emmanuelle Seigner looks lost in her role and gets blown off the screen in every scene she and Ford share. But be warned, this DVD lacks any bonus materials and can only be viewed in pan/scan mode. There are no titles, no chapter index, not even a selection menu at the beginning of the movie (no features to select from). It doesn't seem as if the picture has been enhanced nor has the sound been remastered. Pretty lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 2004 transfer still lousy","review":"If you hope, as I did, that the 2001 and 2003 reviews that warn against the lousy transfer of this move do not apply to the 2004 edition, this is unfortunately not the case. The 2004 transfer looks like a bootleg made from a VHS tape. Why is Warner treating this movie so crappily? It is an excellent film and deserves a DVD release that does it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frantic needs better","review":"Great movie, but what's with the pan and scan dvd?

Thanks in advance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Film Disgraceful Transfer to DVD","review":"This is one of my FAVORITE movies. Despite the horrible transfer to DVD I still watch it often. I am writing this with the hopes that with the stellar release of Polanski's Tess the powers that be WILL do a new transfer of this Polanski masterpiece.

The soundtrack is just as awesome as the movie. The first track, In the Name of the Father, is so...unsettling. The deep musical riffs just hit you in the heart. Yea, I know, it sounds dumb, yet it's true. I also like the track Whiskey in the Jar. I am very familiar with the original Irish drinking song, and this more upbeat, modern version of it is great, although it doesn't really pertain to the film.

It's true that song selection (& execution) on the A-side is a bit obvious (read: tedious), but one has the sense that these critical reviewers didn't bother flipping the wax over. I defy anyone to find a stronger, more fully-realized set of live B-side performances on any other commercially-released Dylan album or, for that matter, on any other commercially-released B-side at all. Crank it up (preferably on vinyl) and give it a listen. Way likely, for example, the side offers Bob's strongest \\"Masters of War\\" (no mean feat)--but all these new versions of older tracks are equally kickin'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great classic live album!","review":"This album is just one of those great but mediocre albums that came out in the 80s,i already had it in audio tape.Together with still life a live album by the Rolling Stones,John Lennon live in NYC and Hall and Oates live at the apollo,this album is a rare gem,it's like listening to a bootleg hard to find cd.This could have been greater if they release a special edition of this with bonus tracks such as All along the watchtower or either of the two between Mr. Tambourine man or Knock Knocki'n on heaven's door or Blowin'in thre wind or house of the rising sun.Still it worth a single penny for your listening pleasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"more bob live","review":"At least the third Maggie's farm on a Columbia records live Dylan album (that I've heard).

Mick Taylor plays in a dramatic style, which seems to me the most appropriate for Dylan's music. Dylan himself was in perfect form in that year and his voice was at its highest level. It would have been right to include \\"Jokerman\\" in the song list. Other live performances of Mr. Dylan are obviously superb, but in my opinion this must be considered the hugest point at the moment.

Second, let me say this album stinks. Dylan is near his nasally, incomphensible worst here. It's a chore getting through this album. I listened to this once and then gave it to a co-worker. The only thing saving this from one-stardom is his excellent band, led by ex-Stone Mick Taylor, and some great work (there's a shock) from guest Carlos Santana. Unless you're a Dylan completist, take a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Dylan Live CD","review":"Dylan started with \\"Before the Flood\\" - an excellent document of his 1974 tour. The he released \\"Hard Rain\\" , which was only so-so (get Live 1975 the bootleg series instead). The he released the Budokan set, which was rock- bottom. That set was so bad that expectations were modest for this live set.Surprise- this is good! He's got a good backing band led by Mick Taylor of Rolling Stones fame and he does a good 10 song set here. Maybe not his best live work but better than much of the other live LPs of the period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad record even for Dylan fans","review":"I wouldnt recommend this one even to Dylan Fans. The sound is terrible, and Dylan voice is at his most nasal. Mick Taylor sounds good, Santana plays in the last song, but basically there are many other live albums better than this one. The acoustic set is maybe the best from the set. But then again, the sound spoils the listening experience. I spent the first 3 songs trying to adjust my stereo trying to get the best sound and by the fourth I just gave up. Its a 3 star record but Ill give it a 2 just for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grew To Love It","review":"I ordered this album because it is one Dylan effort I did not own. So, I played it and was, frankly, lukewarm to it. But, knowing that most of Mr. D's stuff generally needs to grow on me, I waited and replayed it several more times. Each play managed to increase my appreciation, to the point that now I absolutely love this thing! I love every song version on this album, except for \\"Tangled Up In Blue\\", which I merely like. If only I could give it more stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the master at war","review":"This album is worth buying for the Rendition of Masters of war & a totally brilliant \\"Garage\\" Rock version of Highway 61.

The sound quality is not too good and performance is not too exciting except for some nice guitar solos. It has 10 songs ranging from 4 to 6 minutes long. The total lenght of the CD is 52 minutes.The sound quality is not very good. It is loud and noisy. The audience chatter is way too high in many spots. You can actually pick out some talking in the back ground.This is one of Dylan's lesser performances. His singing is particularly annoying. He vocals are very affected. He sounds like one of those comedians who do a bad imitation of Dylan with the over exaggerated accent.The back up band is not very good and renditions of the songs are not anything new or special.The only thing that makes this CD worthwhile are some amazing guitar solos on 4 of the tracks. And no wonder...the guitarist is Mick Taylor, of Rolling Stones and Gong fame. But, the guitar playing is not enough to recommend this CD.This is Dylan's second worst CD. His worst is Dylan and Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow!","review":"Dylan's 9,975,232nd live album in two years and, you know what?, \\"Maggie's Farm\\" and \\"Ballad of a Thin Man\\" still haven't lost their bite!!!

Unfortunately it suffers from terrible remastering. Straying far from Big Country's trademark bass-heavy, echoey, drum-heavy mix (listen to the Crossing & Seer), the engineer on this reissue leans more for a brittle, clean, dry, highly treble sound that is altogether displeasing & far from Big Country's original vision.

Larry frequently writes for that publication, and his knowledge of Alaska is superb. I bought the book to judge if I should hunt in Alaska, as I heard the research aspects of getting there and hunting was difficult. His book gave me everything I needed in order to plan my trip. There has to be 300 phone numbers and over 20 detailed mapsof Alaska's hunting regions. I can't believe this book has not been made until now. If you plan to ever hunt in Alaska, you should own this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First time hunter in Alaska","review":"I have known Larry on and off for the last ten years and was very excited to hear of this book. Most of my experience in hunting was for white tail in Michigan. I always dreamed of hunting big game but had no clue where to begin. This book does it all from what to bring, what to expect, and how it is done. I personally have read the book three times and learned something new each time. I am looking foward to my first float trip next year. The book list so many references that it is impossible to go wrong on planning and executing a sucessful float trip. Outstanding work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I needed a book that would completely prepare me for my up and coming trip to Alaska. I have heard about floathunting as an effective means of finding animals as well as experiencing the beautiful Alaskan wilderness. Larry's book was very thorough and gave me all the information I needed to make the trip. His style of writing kept me interested and got me even more excited for the trip. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music...","review":"I bought this cd to expand my collection of French language music. I want to improve my comprehension and expose my 18 month old son to the sounds of French. I also enjoy the \\"Cajun\\" style, and thought this would be fun. It is!My son and I really like the music, and Michael Doucet's accent and style of singing are charming. I don't know if he's the \\"real deal\\", but he sure sounds it to my untrained ear.A couple of the other singers are not quite as convincing. I especially dislike the children's style. Fortunately they are only featured on a couple of numbers. I also cringed the first time I heard the strong modern American English accent that one of the female singers has.It is definitely not the ideal cd for improving your Parisian French, I'm not even sure if the \\"Cajun\\" dialect is authentic, but it's certainly a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone shoulda put this turkey to death","review":"I can't believe that there are so many good reviews of this movie on Amazon. This movie absolutely stunk. You knew exactly what was going on 20 minutes into it. I kept watching, hoping that there would be some twist that would save it... but there wasn't. Believe me folks, this movie is pretty darn close to being as bad as The Postman or The Patriot. I ordinarily don't write reviews, but the reviewers so far must be related to the filmmakers or paid to say nice things or something. This movie is an insult to intelligent movie-goers. Fair warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks subtlety.","review":"This film really isn't as clever as it would like to be. Most of the performances are disappointing and the dialogue has no subtlety which makes it almost insulting to its audience's intelligence. Plus, the multiple plot twists at the end seem unoriginal now that the trend is so overused.This film could have had some real surprises and raised some real questions. It should have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Texas Burning","review":"So many reviews already. Let's keep this short. Has anyone mentioned the absurdity of making a !Texas! !Death! !Penalty! !Movie! AND COMPLETELY LEAVE OUT RACE?!? Yikes. Yes, the red herrings are annoying, but this is even worse for being Mississippi Burning all over again.Why do writers and directors think that they can preach the hard-line about a serious topic....while making a 2nd rate thriller of the month? For that matter, why do otherwise smart actors think that they can act there way out of a hot-house mess of a script? Spacey, Winslet and Linney are always fun to watch, but what a waste of talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking, fine acting","review":"I really enjoyed The Life of David Gale, although the editing made the story feel very rushed. I love Kevin Spacey, and he gave another compelling performance in this movie. I didn't much care for the casting of Kate Winslet, though she too did a good job. I love how the movie keeps the audience guessing right up until the end. VERY strong political statements are made and really hit you over the head, but since it is supposed to be from this man's perspective, even this point can be explained and justified."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking and entertaining","review":"This movie was well worth watching. Many movies out these days leave me feeling like I wasted my time. The Life of David Gale may be controversial, but depicts a very unfortunate, but realistic view of human passions. There were a few cases throughout the film when the situations were questionably believable, but the overall premise of the movie provoked complex thought and emotions. This movie was fraught with symbolism, and an array of metaphores that contributed to the complexity of the movie. It seems that many previous reviewers possibly may have taken this movie for \\"face value\\" only and were resistant to analyzing the depths of this film. I gladly will recommend this movie and will watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"politically muddled flick","review":"Another liberal tear-jerking flick. The \\"surprise\\" ending is supposed to make us feel bad and finally see the light about how evil the dp is. Instead my wife and I got the feeling that maybe justice was served after all. Typically all the pro-dp characters in the movie are one-dimensional cartoons. They're all idiot bible-thumpers, including the governor who is of course a direct ripoff of George Bush. The plot is unbelievable, and when the final plot \\"twist\\" is revealed, I not only was glad for what happened in the movie to Spacey, I wanted to see the same justice done to the people who made this turkey. Another two plus hours of my life that I can't get back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but very good","review":"I saw an advanced screening of this movie, and I really found it to be thought provoking and powerful. Spacey and Winslet gave great, believable performances. Some of the editing threw me off, which kind of detracted from the the story. I had become very interested in this story and was pulled into it, then the way in which the movie transitioned between present and past pulled me back out. In spite of that, I really enjoyed this movie.I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, so I won't give details. But my favorite part of the movie is the Govorner of Texas - a striking resemblance to GW. It was a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake and unsatisfying","review":"An innocent man is executed for the murder he did not commit. The crucial evidence for his innocence arrives five minutes after he is put to death. And everybody suffers: the victim, the man, and the viewers. Bad movie from an acclaimed director. Makes an excellent gift to the governor of Texas."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Death penalty opponent David Gale (Kevin Spacey), himself imprisoned on Death Row for the murder of a fellow activist (Laura Linney), tells his story to a newspaper reporter (Kate Winslet) supposedly so that she can clear his name. This well-made film with its excellent cast starts out well but soon becomes implausible and silly. It may appear to be anti-death penalty propaganda, but the illogical surprise resolution of the story reveals it to be completely ambivalent. While masquerading as a serious film, it is actually an overwritten mystery with a dunderhead plot that portrays those on both sides of the issues as fools or worse--gun-toting good ol' boys on one side and dishonest crazies on the other. If it doesn't offend you regarding your position on the death penalty, it should offend you as a lover of good movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising...","review":"With Kevin Spacey, I automatically expect good acting, but with this particular movie I think that not only was Spacey's acting exceptional but Kate Winslet pulled off a moving preformance. While the movie does take a little time to warm up to the viewer with the main plot, as the movie progresses as with the character development, there are much more twists and turns which force the viewer to question almost everyone's motives. With the exception of Gabriel Mann's character, Zack Stemmons (of which I was not too fond with), the characters were well sculpted and were sucessful with creating a specific atmosphere and causing the viewer to relate to one or more of the character traits being exposed throughout the course of the movie. Overall, I believe that this movie was full of opinion and always kept the viewer on the edge of their seat. Another Spacey success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Plot, not great movie","review":"I enjoyed this movie for the plot.I liked Kevin Spacey's performance, but the rest of the movie felt flat, undimensional. The story is great whether you are for or against capital punishment. Ever see a movie where you think \\"I'd rather read the 'book'\\"? Well this was one of those movies for me.But the \\"endings\\" are worth watching the movie for. Very good surprises."},{"rating":"1","title":"When bad movies happen to good actors. . .","review":"I was told to watch this movie by people claiming it was, \\"The best ever\\", \\"keeps you on the edge of your seat\\", \\"The ending was amazing\\".

The twists at the end shocked me big time! Great writing, direction, music, and even acting! Kevin Spacey and Kate Winslet have great chemistry. A lot of people I know have enjoyed this movie for the same reason: It has a point. All it's saying is not everyone on the Death Row is guilty. It has it's mistakes, just like everythin else. I'm not for or against Death Row and the movie is saying the same thing.Also, this movie really makes you think! It seems to me that the people who hated this movie might not like to \\"think\\" exactly about what the movie is really trying to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie about obsessive fanatics","review":"I really wanted to like this movie. I like everybody in it. But in the end (without blowing the story), it was a farcical tale about a bunch of fanatics who are so obsessed with their singular ideal that when we learn the truth about what is going on, they become so completely unsympathetic to the point of being moronic.If the filmmakers were trying to make a film showing the pointlessness of being such an individual, then I would have to say, \\"Job well done.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"On my list of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"I like complex films but this was too much, too implausible, too ridiculous to be beleived.

Hey, no surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This movie was far too contrived and unoriginal to make it even a midly interesting viewing. Kevin Spacey was not in his top form in this movie, and combined with the horrible plotting and pacing the movie is a near-catastrophe. Unless you are a hardcore Spacey or Winslet fan, I would avoid viewing this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful statement!","review":"Alan Parker made an invaluable and potent statement about such controversial theme . He built and admirable puzzle with many dramatic twists all along the film which deserved to my mind a major treatment and consideration .In the last two decades I just remember three admirable works about this similar theme : The Fifth Chapter of Decalogue , Dead man walking and Dancer in the dark.Spacey plays a very credible role and despite the female counterpoint is not at the same level ( the role was perfect for Cate Blanchet , Juliette Binoche or Naomi Watts) the film reaches the goal . I think something happens with Parker when he decides to make edge of the knife pictures : Midnight express , Mississippi burning have not been rated by the most of critics ; it would seem Parker is accepted only when he films musicalsIntelligent , mature and outstanding movie ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"This was a film of two intentions - a thriller, and a message movie. It is a worthy intention to put the message into some context as a thriller to make it palatable; it makes the medicine easier to swallow. However the film is beset by a problem of balance .. Where the thriller slacks off, the message seems too in your face, and where the thriller takes off it seems too shallow for want of the message.Alan Parker handled the balance so much better in Mississippi Burning, that if you came to this expecting the same standard you would be very disappointed.However, the cast do adequately, and Spacey and Linney do brilliantly, adding the depth that makes the film engrossing enough to enjoy watching.Those who are expecting the film to hold its own as a thriller will be disappointed however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitifull tripe","review":"Why either of these actors (Spacey and Winslett) got involved in this silly and insincere film is beyond me. Sure, if you put aside the subject matter, it could be deemed an entertaining, over the top, predictable, plodding, badly scripted thriller. However, to disregard the seriousness and worthiness of the subject matter here in such a crass way made me retch.Yes, there's a twist at the end (as is the norm nowadays for films striving to be 'clever') but you will have sussed it out well before it happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"Watched this one tonight for New Year's Eve and thought that this film was pretty good...in the beginning it does drag just a bit...but it quickly takes off with some twists and turns that you would not believe.A man is on death row for the murder of a woman, found dead on her living room floor, with her hands handcuff behind her back, a duct taped mouth and a plastic bag over her head that is duct taped around her throat. It is all signs of the perfect murder...but is it....watch this film and find out for yourself!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stupid movie","review":"Some idiot sets himself up so that he has to get executed in order to convince society that it's wrong to execute him. This would make a pretty good Three Stooges plot; Larry and Curley set up Moe so he has to slap them so he can see how unjust it is to slap them.The statistical fact is that capital punishment is 100% successful as a deterrent to murder; every murderer who's ever received capital punishment has never murdered again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fraud, A Humbug","review":"In the 1800s, this story would have clearly been called \\"a humbug\\", which today means a fraud. This movie is one long fraud, and a really preachy one at that. A complete waste of my time. The makers of this movie probably don't realize that they just come across as preachy, liberal Hollywood types telling everybody else to become enlightened.As with other reviewers, I agree that if you want to see a thoughtful film that examines the death penalty, buy \\"Dead Man Walking\\" with Sean Penn and Susan Sarandon - now that's a film worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dichotomy","review":"This movie was disturbing for all the wrong reasons. First, the acting ranged from superb (Spacey) to very good (Linney) to chew the scenery big-time (Kate). The direction was great, and so was the screenplay. The movie, however, wasn't enjoyable at all. It was simply cheap exploitation. Worth watching (rent it),but only with a hand firmly on the FF button"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"I have never seen such a waste of talent before in a film before. We see Kevin Spacey playing the same role he's played a million times, then we have sell out Kate Winslet with a bad American accent and the same facial expression throughout the entire film. The only good thing about this movie is Laura Linney's performance. Avoid this Hollywood tripe at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat and overblown.","review":"...Despite its pretensions, The Life Of David Gale is little more than a R rated version of the sort of schlock that frequently appears on the Lifetime network. Instead of Aidan Quinn, Mary Stewart Masterson and Holly Hunter we get \\"bigger\\" names in the form of Spacey, Kate Winslet and Laura Linney.Unfortunately Winslet (whose had difficulty finding anything worthwhile to appear in since Titanic) spends much of the films duration struggling with an unflattering American accent. Spacey does that \\"unhinged\\" thing he's now spent a decade doing and Linney appears to be doing an impersonation of Holly Hunter.Not a terrible film, just a film that appears to be a little too taken with how important it thinks it is.Oh, and the ending (like Pay It Forward) has to be seen to be believed."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT AN EPIC, BUT A PRETTY GOOD MOVIE","review":"What \\"Dead Man Walking\\" accomplished at an emotional level, \\"The Life of David Gale\\" accomplishes in its message and plot. No it isn't one of the great movies of all time, but it certainly isn't the horribly bad movie that I imagined after reading the reviews on this site.It is a sly take on capital punishment, as you probably know already. It will hold your interest right through to its twisted end, which is pretty much what entertainment is to me.Having said that, I did find the characters a little cliched --(1) the alcoholic and dissolute but \\"genius\\" professor(2) the emotional, crusading activist(3) the plucky, assertive reporter(4) the good-old-boy country lawyer(5) the well-groomed but brainless governor(6) the oh-so-quiet texan mystery manThe movie has its moments, and although the \\"big explosive ending\\" was not exactly opaque to me, it did make me think for a couple of days after the movie.

It could have been the riveting, shocking drama that was promised. Instead, it quickly beomes hokey, second-rate, easily predicatble tripe that is so obsessed with its own attempts at being clever that a decent script was forgotten somewhere.It wants desperately to be smart and shocking, but it is anything but. Anyone paying any bit of attention can guess the ending within the first half an hour. (Every one of the five people I watched it with did.) The only areas where this movie succeeds is in making all death penalty abolitionists look like a bunch of nutbags, and all women look like either devious and conniving jezebels or helpless and clueless morons who need a man to guide them every step of the way.

Catherine Wheel. Very good band, good song-writing, good vocals and musicianship throughout. I am fairly well impressed with these guys.

I remember the first time I heard it I thought this was something out of the dark part of the 80s, but it's out of the 90s. I couldn't believe that.Anyway, I can't stop listening to The Nude, it evokes a lot of mixed feelings. I think (for me) it's about a girl I can't have not because she hates me or something, but because we're in a position where I can't have something with her right now, so I hold her as something like a beautiful paint, that I can only look upon but not touch... \\"You're making me doubt myself\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best album ever","review":"The fact that this album, and many others by Catherine Wheel, was overlooked by radio and music magazines -- what can I say?

The rest of the book was just nonsense or obvious ideals thrown in there so that the author would be able to sell the book instead of making it a smaller article."},{"rating":"2","title":"When regular people need to understand complex problems...","review":"Ultimately a hopeful book, When Good Companies Do Bad Things attacks the concept of corporations as monoliths. Instead, through examples, anecdotes and analysis, we see that global business corporations are more human than we think, for better and worse, and subject to change---if they [and we] choose it-- for the better.

Note that while the description says it extends for long reach, that's still only about 3 feet. That's just fine for taking along in your car for the occasional dig-out, but you'll get tired of using really quickly if you are thinking of using it for your front walk!The push-button mechanism for the handle extension is easy to use, the blade and handle are strong, and the extension of the handle into the blade ensures long-life, unlike some models that are pinned into a short socket only. You want stainless steel, as in this shovel, when you are storing a shovel in your car - you don't want it rusting in your trunk, staining everything it touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small size, very good quality","review":"I would say it is smaller than I expect, although I read the description before I buy.

Just don't expect an unbiased read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pro-Charles Book","review":"I tried reading this yesterday as soon as I got it, but after the first three chapters, I had to put it down.I enjoy biographies that tell both the postive and negative side of a person or insitution; this book mostly promotes the positive side of Prince Charles, and doesn't really tell of his negative side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"I love things about the royal family. But this book put me to sleep faster than a double dose of Ambian.Penny is a Prince Of Wales fan, through and through. And she quite likes Camilla.

Caution. DO NOT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally biased","review":"Don't waste your money on this book! It is only a pep rally for Prince Charles. Diana comes off as a spoiled brat who couldn't do anything right and Charles is a saint! It takes two to ruin a marriage so I don't think he's blameless.It touches a bit on the rest of the royal family, but all of them come off as saints as well. Queen Elizabeth handled Diana's death perfectly, and it was all Sarah's fault that her and Andrew's marriage collapsed.To write a book about anyone I think you have to see both sides and Penny Junor unfortunately, didn't do that. This is a big zero to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This book is a total waste of time. It is highly subjective and very critical of Princess Diana. The rest of the royal family members come under scrutiny, but Diana fairs the worst. It is more than obvious that the author favors the queen and the Prince of Wales, especially the prince. The author lavishes praise on Kate Middleton and hopes that Middleton and Prince William will settle down and live happily ever after and bring credibility and respectability to the monarchy. Give me a break! I found the book to be tactless and devoid of any substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"worthless","review":"This study guide really upset me.

The exchange between players is refreshing, inventive and cutting edge. A sound that's truly their own. Many times recording are just acontrived mimic of other players of the past.

I just tried again and kept skipping to the next track until there were no more next tracks. The music can't compete with that idiotic noise.

Even the few films that are watchable have the Passport logo\\" Bela Lugosi Collection\\" in the right hand bottom corner. There are a couple of these films that look like historical pieces that you see on the history channel ....when i say bad, i mean reallllllllllly bad! Hard to believe they would even release a couple of these unwatchable gems(unwatchable because of picture quality) on dvd at all, i mean what was the point of releasing this garbage? I wish Lugosi Jr could get control of these films and do them right! For good Lugosi i recommend avoiding this and check out titles by Roan Group(they restore beautifully) or the Navarre Corporation who release Bela Lugosi Estate versions of the dvds.Taking a chance to see \\"if\\" it might be worthwhile, will only leave you with a box of coasters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerie and strange","review":"I saw this movie late one night on TV about 35 years ago as a child, and some of the images haunt me still! Lugosi is really quite good here, and the whole thing is set in an eerie, impoverished home for the blind...this creates a dark, disorienting, atmosphere of helplessness. Watch for the trap door that drops victims into the Thames River mud flats! Lugosi's creepy man/beast henchman is the stuff of children's nightmares....OK, now to address the Alpha DVD quality. No, it's not great. It could be better. But let's face it: as kids we watched these things on grainy black & white TV sets with bent rabbit ear antennas! You could hold your breath for the \\"Collector's Edition\\", (at a price 4x more) but you're simply not going to see this film anywhere else. The DVD is ridiculously cheap.

Orloff has been setting people up w/ fat life insurance policies, only to kill the poor suckers after making himself their sole beneficiary! With the help of his blind, giant henchman, Jake, Orloff has been busily dumping his victims into the Thames! Orloff's utter contempt for the human race is very convincing! Will he be stopped before more people perish?? Scotland Yard is on the case!

Quit whining and watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem is revealed by the title...","review":"... and a good ending cannot overcome it.There is no supernatural foe to drag us through the tepid parts, and a somewhat interesting yet slow mystery is not enough to make us sit without fidgeting. Especially not when the quality of the print is poor.The Human Monster is smarter than most of this type of fare, as it is based on an Edgar Wallace novel. But like most of this type of fare, nothing of any real note happens until the last fifteen minutes. Then it gets quite good, with chases and plot twists and the expected, if satisfying, retribution. Yet by that point the damage is done.As a movie, the Human Monster makes a very good poster.See also: \\"The Monogram Nine,\\" as they are known to Lugosi's most ardent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lugosi Thriller","review":"This is Lugosi's best British film, it's an exciting fast paced thriller with Lugosi in top form. In the dual role of the sinister Dr Orloff and the seemingly kind Dr. Dearborn Lugosi runs an insurance racket in which he drowns blind people and dumps their bodies in the Thames. The film is handsomely mounted, with good production values and a top cast. The film was remade in the 60's with Klaus Kinski in the Orloff role but this is the version you should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"bela lugosi a forgotten king","review":"before karloff there was lugosi. this box set includes some of his best work. you will enjoy some of his best momments on screen. highly recomended for old school horror fans. hail to the king."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Lugosi deserves better than this and so do we","review":"I'm a fan of these mega-movie packs and own several of them, so you know that I'm forgiven when it comes to picture and sound quality.

Like a 25 year old VHS, the image changes from light to very dark constantly and the soundtrack is muffled throughout. Look for a copy of the Roan double feature (w/Mystery Liner) or the Diamond double feature (w/The Ape Man). Both are much better prints. This is a total waste. Cover sure looks nice, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A low-budget mystery that only has Bela Lugosi to recommend","review":"This is an example of Bela Lugosi's lesser film work. It's a creaky, \\"cheapy-creepy\\" featuring Lugosi in a dual role. A killer stalks London, and Bela's slum-area workhouse is connected. There is also a blind \\"ape-man\\" sort of killer creeping around the slums, leaving a trail of victims. The film is obviously dated and produced on a low budget. Determined Bela Lugosi fans should be pleased, but others should beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"A great collection for an even better price.

It's a hilarious look at relatinships and the differences between men and women. Ephron examines the ways the two sexes deal with eachother and life in general.This is a great comedy for, really anyone. There's really nothing that would stand out and make someone not like this movie. It's a classic, perfectly crafted script in which people's conversations about their lives, and more meaningless things, turn out to be ironically funny.It's a classic comedy I would recommend to anyone who enjoys 'witty banter' without being too unrealistically clever. It's a comedy for people who like to use their minds and get something more from the comedy than just, for instance, slapstick humor.It's a great movie and a comedy for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie--wonderful blu ray","review":"\`i love how they improved the quality for this blu ray. i adore this movie--one of those classic films i could watch over and over again. when i bought this movie, it was around 3 bucks. 3 bucks for a blu ray--deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is pretty classic","review":"I didn't see this movie until long after everyone else had, but I can see now why it's considered a classic. This is relatively early Meg Ryan establishing the persona she carries so well today. The idea of Meg Ryan and Billy Crystal being romantically involved has very little believability, but that doesn't affect the humor or the story. The movie did not strike me as typical Rob Reiner style with the exception of the humor. With Billy Crystal in it, you know you're going to get humor. It's a very he-said, she-said movie with a decent but small supporting cast. It may or may not be a must-own, but it's definitely a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This was a Christmas present for a neice and she loved it!

I never get tired of watching it and have to actually remind myself to let some time pass before I watch it again. Billy Crystal and Meg Ryan are perfect together. I agree with another reviewer that they are better together than Meg with Tom Hanks (although I very much liked Sleepless in Seattle and You've Got Mail). I wonder why Billy and Meg haven't made another movie together? Yes, the diner scene is BY FAR one of the funniest scenes of all time. No matter how many times I've seen it, I always ROAR with laughter as much as I did the first time. But another great scene is the wagon wheel coffee table argument! I love to quote the line \\"this stupid, Roy Rogers, wagon wheel, garage sale coffee table!\\" A CLASSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Movies","review":"When Harry Met Sally is a joy to watch. Harry (Billy Crystal) and Sally (Meg Ryan) meet in the late seventies when they share a long-distance trip. They travel from the University of Chicago (my alma mater) to New York (the place where I grew up) so I have a special place in my heart for this movie.Harry and Sally dislike each other intensely during the trip. Even during this first trip, their dialogue is interesting and fun, and they seem to have chemistry. They lose touch at the end of the car trip. They meet once or twice more and eventually become friends.The movie works as an answer to the question of whether women and men become friends, but it works even better as an answer to the question of how friends fall in love and whether it is better to be friends first or not.Bruno Kirby and Carrie Fisher are great in supporting roles. Unless you hate all romantic comedies, I strongly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie with Great Extras","review":"This is a classic movie that has been long overdue on DVD. I got my copy in the mail today and the extras are great. My only complaint is that there were not any current interviews with Meg Ryan. The commentary by Rob Reiner is good, but there are lots of sections of the movie that he doesn't say anything.Meg Ryan is my favorite actress and this was my favorite movie of hers until City of Angels came out. This a must buy for anyone that loves Meg or Billy or owns this movie on VHS. The DVD truely represents it well. I would really be excited if they rerelease it in a couple years with a commentary with Billy and Meg."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Film","review":"It's a good movie for anyone. I like the music in the film and the scenes of all of the happily married couples. It reminds us that romance is unpredictable.

Great flick, absolutely FLAT soundtrack. Criminal, positivly CRIMINAL. Reiner, you MEATHEAD; YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They've ruined this movie","review":"This movie has been among my favorites since I first watched it as a kid. The dialogue, pacing, humor, and music has made it a complete package for me. Unfortunately, the remastered version now has new music playing during familiar and popular scenes, causing the tone and mood to be thrown off balance with the rest of the movie. I wish I had known about the new soundtrack before I purchased this edition. While it might work for those just discovering this movie, it falls flat for this fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie","review":"I am a huge action movie fan. Cannot get enough of it. John Woo, Bruce Willis, and Jet Li are my heroes. Comedy is another one of my favorites with Kevin Smith and the Farrelly brothers leading the list. Only liking a few date movies, i thought this one would waste a night. I sat down to watch this movie expecting a stupid date movie. I was wrong. This has great views on sex and how it affects a relationship. It is also very funny especially the memorable scene with the orgasm at the diner. This is a great movie to own and I don't think I will get tired of it soon. It is the best romance movie ever only trailing to my favorite Chasing Amy. A classic, a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good romantic comedy, but it's not the best one out there.","review":"Although both Crystal and Ryan becomes a little overbearing at times, they're tolerable throughout the movie... The chemistry between them isn't the same as say... Meg Ryan and Tom Hanks, but nonetheless, it's still good and passable on-screen.The story somewhat bothered me in the sense that the \\"romantic dialogue\\" between the two was predictable and cheesed up. But still, it's not supposed to be American Beauty or anything, so it doesn't get to me too much.If you want a good romantic comedy, try picking up \\"You've Got Mail,\\" which is also written/directed by Nora Ephron. She also did Sleepless in Seattle in case you were wondering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to see in blue ray","review":"I know its kind of silly but I still like this movie.

Wonderful!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They keep meeting each other!","review":"Great movie, been meeting to pick it up for years. Makes for a great sick day off! One of those movies that doesn't age, ignoring the horrible 80s clothes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My friend Rod loves this film","review":"..and he knows love, baby. The duality of man is never better represented than in this complex symphony of a flick about life, love, and the pursuit of Meg Ryan. Too bad she didn't continue in films of this vintage instead of sappy junk like \\"You've Got Mail.\\" The storylines involving the relationships she and her friends endure weave together seamlessly like the libretto of a fine opera, and I am not just saying that because if I cut this film Rod will never help me with my computer again. Nope, I really mean it. A first class fun ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible repackaging of an already released product. Skip It!","review":"This is nothing more than the original release of the DVD of the classic film repackaged to include a compilation of music from the decade in which it was released. The worst thing is that none of the music on the CD has anything to do with the movie itself. I'm not even sure that any of the songs were released around the time that the movie was in theaters. Had it been the actual soundtrack of the film included we might've had something to get mildly excited over. There's also a 'time capsule' booklet with events that happened during the 80's. There are much better ways of learning 80's history than with a 16 page leaflet.Skip this product entirely, and instead try the 'Collector's Edition.' It is far superior with remastered 5.1 audio sound, exceptional audio commentary and a number of featurettes on the making of the film. The only thing better would be to see a remastered version on Blu-Ray (hint, hint Sony!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can I add anything to the already great reviews?","review":"I dont think I can add much to the already great reviews of this film. One thing is the great lines throughout the film ie. when Crystal's character realizes he's fallen for Ryan's character at the 2nd new year's party which goes something like \\"when you realize you want to spend the rest of your life with somebody, you want the rest of your life to start as soon as possible....\\" How true is that? Looking back in our lives, we can all find a time in our lives when we felt that way. Another scene with the Ingrid Bergman / Casablanca discussion \\"you're the worst kind... You think you're low maintanance but you're high maintenance...\\"If you are a Meg Ryan fan, this is the most beautiful she has every looked in any film... ever. The makeup, costume and filming in the 2 new year party scenes make her look just beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference","review":"This book provided an easy way of finding out the review of an item before even buying it.

Mutating at will from golden boy to savage monster, Krause stalks Amick to feed his seductive mother. As the tension mounts and the casualties pile up the town's tabbies gather for a final chilling showdown with the monsters in their midst.\`Sleepwalkers' is a movie whose main plot thrust comes from the pre-opening credits description of what the movie title means. Just about all character backstory and motivations are given here, and we are then treated to a ninety-minute entertainment that plays out these events in a simplistic but interesting manner. The acting, for a horror picture, is remarkably good.

Inexplicably incestious Cat people live like cia undercover agents in a small town, and stake out victims to gain energy. There is no explanation as to what these creatures are, and basically the whole thing is a solid vehicle for a bunch of scenes involving painfully conspicious latex prop limbs being torn and split while the creatures feed off of the energy of fresh victims (one scene where a man has his hand cut off actually rivals luke skywalker's incredibly unconvincing appendage loss in \\"The Empire Strikes Back). The cat people themselves are reminiscent of japanese rubber suit monsters (one almost expects power rangers to jump out) and the morphing special effects look ridiculous.

Alice Krige and her son are \\"Sleepwalkers\\" a pair of an Ancient Race that manages to \\"shift change\\" their shapes at will. Alice is having sex with her son which sounds pretty sick to me. Maybe these two should appear on the Jerry Springer Show. The Mortal Enemies of Alice and her son are cats (!!!) so why they didn't buy a couple of big Doberman dogs to keep the cats away is anybody's guess.Alice's son seduces the beautiful Madchen and then all her breaks loose.

Maybe it's because I'm more familiar with the Gospels and so another version of events colored my own response. Perhaps it's because the telling was not as lively and personal as I Claudius.

I found this a very sexy and humourous book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun story than color teaching tool","review":"\\"What is Cat's favorite color?\\" This simple question forms the premise of this simple yet cheerful color identification book. Each two-page spread features another color as the background, and uses examples from the cat's life to illustrate it.Cabrera's style uses bold brush strokes and thickly applied acrylic paint. Her animals are painted as if done by a child, and there are clever little compositional features that are delightful to discover. On one page, a cow in the background mimics the pose of the cat. In another, fluffy white clouds take the shape of familiar objects to a cat--a fish and a mouse.One unfortunate byproduct of the graphic style however, is that the colors aren't really mixed too well. The purple comes off a little lilac and the red and orange are indistinguishable from each other. But if you use this book as a fun story to share, and not primarily as a color teaching tool, you should be safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Barbified Bratz!","review":"I'm a Bratz lover, and while Cloe has never been my favorite, this doll is just cheap.

You can't mix and match these clothes easily, because they're too costume-y. Also, the who look of this doll is remeniscent of 90s Barbies, with their cheesy and elaborate playsets.

The story line is what drags this movie down. Beyond the slew of predictable lines and scenarios, I found the message of the film a bit shallow. \\"Love conquers all...including schizophrenia.\\" It's just not life-like. Some of the imagery and allusions are heavy-handed at times. I wanted to scream, \\"OK, I get it.\\" Not a terrible film, but not that great either. If you want to see a more compelling Depp film, see \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Left of center chick flick","review":"Johnny Depp may be committing career suicide with his misquotes, but when your acting is as good as his, even lighthearted fare such as \\"Benny & Joon\\" become gems.It's heart is in the right place; most films rarely deal with behaviour disorder patients as protagonists (much less romantic leads!), but for some odd reason, it works here. Masterson is as luminous as ever, Aidan Quinn does a fine job as the straight man, and Julianne Moore turns in a decent performance as always. But Johnny Depp is the real star of the film, and basically gives it the pulse it desperately needs to carry it to the end.Well worth the rental, but if you happen to buy it, it's still a charming little film to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Benny and Joon","review":"This was such a wonderful light-hearted movie.

He is not only incredibly good looking (as usual) in it, but he is incredibly cute and funny as well! This movie just lifts your spirits.

Benny has been taking care of Joon since their parents died in a car crash. However, he has reached a breaking point. Then Joon wins Sam after loosing a poker bet. Kind of wierd, huh? Anyway, Joon and Sam fall in love and that leads to complications for Benny. Enough plot summary.This is not a fascinating film on mental illness. Other than the unusual lives of the characters, this movie boils down to a basic romantic comedy, cliches and all. However, the tribute to the classic physical comedy of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin along with the movies' meaningful, memorable music, make this film a cut above the average and worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic example of Hollywood ignorance","review":"Benny (Aidan Quinn) is the brother of an autistic girl named Joon (Mary Stuart Masterson). He's a bit restrictive and protective of her. Sam (Johnny Depp), the \\"quirky\\" guy, moves in. Hilarity ensues. So, what's the problem? The moviemakers were not content with making a funny, lighthearted movie. Instead, the movie gets very serious and preachy about several points - whether or not Joon can live on her own, whether or not Sam needs to get a job, etc. These questions are presented as ones with obvious answers, because, of course, love conquers all, as we learn in Hollywood. Sam is portrayed as the truly wise character of the movie, while crazy old Benny is still stuck on backwards ideas like earning money to provide for yourself and caring for the mentally handicapped.There were a few funny parts, courtesy of Johnny Depp, but I wouldn't recommend seeing this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISFIRE","review":"Although Johnny Depp is to be lauded for his deft physical comedy in this romantic fairy tale, it isn't enough to save this implausible film. Depp plays a somewhat eccentric young man who finds himself filling in as a \\"housemate\\" to a young mentally ill girl who lives with her brother. Mary Stuart Masterson is effective as Joon, and Aidan Quinn does her sincerest best but the film ultimately fails in its ignorance of reality. Julianne Moore has an early appearance as Ruthie, the failed actress who works as a waitress and befriends Benny, Joon and Depp. The movie manages to sugar coat mental illness and we're asked to believe that this obviously disturbed young girl is capable of living on her own. While its message of love conquers all is admirable, the reality of Joon's situation is overshadowed by this sentimentality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shear Disappointment","review":"I have wanted Benny and Joon since I saw it four months ago. I guess aiming cheap was not the best of ideas. Not only did the DVD not play on my gaming consoles it did not play on my laptop or DVD player.

Yes, Depp is great, given what he has to work with, but overall I am very sorry that I was subjected to this horribly stupid, insensitive movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"An art-nazi tour de force.

It is comical at times, but never slapstick, just whimsical. Great acting from Aidan Quinn. Johnny Depp's acting is excellent as well. You get the impression that he is a clown in a circus that no one else can see. Everything he does expresses playfullness.I would call this movie a decent drama, but it is elevated immeasurably beyond that status by the magical drama of Johnny Depp's Chaplan-like antics. This is directed by the same Jeremiah Chechik who gave you National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation. This is quite a departure for him, but it is in my opinion an endearing comedy/drama/romance.Good movie for lonely sunday afternoons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"I purchased this as a gift for an 18 year old girl.

He was so nutty and surreal, and yet he was grounded in reality, and worked between the lines with that aspect. \\"Joon\\" was crazy, yet lucid in unique ways that enabled her to see the weaknesses in others and know the why of it. The \\"sane person\\", Benny, was the one who was least 'in touch' with what was really going on in life, although on the surface it would seem that he was the normal one, who was able to do things \\"right\\", to function the way society says that we must. This interesting and complex story brings out the brilliance that can be found in the most unlikely spots of humanity, and the humor that you can find in the most dismal circumstances, if you really try."},{"rating":"2","title":"The characters grew on me","review":"For whatever reason, I was resistant to this movie. The first time I saw it, I had trouble getting into it, but as the story progressed, the characters -- and their predicament -- grew on me. Each time I've watched it, I've liked it better. I also think that it contains one of those absolutely, drop-dead classic movie scenes (don't want to be a spoiler but it involves a window and Johnny Depp's frantic attempts to get Mary Stuart Masterson's attention).It's a great movie, about love and being different. And it contains some terrific lines. Paraphrasing: \\"But aside from a little mental illness, she's okay, right?\\" Don't fight it. Watch this movie, and give in to its timeless appeal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Johnny Depp","review":"It was so much fun watching this classic Johnny Depp movie. Definitely one of my favorite movies, I could watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud at This Quirky Movie","review":"I've been a Johnny Depp fan for years. This movie (how did I miss it when it was new?) simply reinforces my admiration for his craft.As Sam, a strange, sweet, quirky man with a mild form of mental handicap, Depp performs a Buster Keaton routine with stunning grace as he entertains a crowd in the park. This routine alone makes the film worth watching.But add to this sight gags (for example, Depp mashing potatoes with a racket or steaming a grilled cheese sandwich with an iron) that cause giggles and moments of sweetness that touch your heart without being cloying. . . and you've got a movie that is truly entertaining.After so many poor movies, Benny and Joon was a refreshing change. My copy will be shelved in my permanent collection.Five stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved that film thank to the problem","review":"In fact the first time I saw that film because I thing J.

It offers easy to read information without the drudgery of tons of reading. I think Parent Magazine is fabulous, having subscribed to it for many years myself. I'm so pleased to see that they are giving the best of what they have to offer in this book. As a behavior specialist and author of The Voucher System Behavior Management Program, I have spent a great deal of time and effort looking for a book that addresses the challenges and questions that often arise with a four year old. (Children are learning so much at age four and need a great deal of parent/child interaction. It's also the age where they learn that \\"no\\" really means \\"no\\".) This book is my choice for the best most concise book on children of this age. I highly recommend it! I also recommend the book that follows this one on the 5-6 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great compared to others","review":"This book was okay. It spoke about how gays deal with sexual orientation issues in the workplace. The good thing about it is that it included case studies of a gay black man and a bisexual white woman; so the authors were trying to think about diversity within the LGBT community. However, this book is simplistic and doesn't say much. There are large-scale studies and anthologies out there about gays in the workplace that are more thorough, and just better. You should consider reading this, after you've read all the other stuff on the topic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Unique Album","review":"This album has some extremely good tracks on it. The songs are a blend of jazz, electronica, hip hop, and plenty of other things. There is no music that I know of that has a similar song to this.However there are a couple of songs that I didn't really like. For example \\"Knock Me Down Girl\\" just sounded like a generic R&B; song and was a little out of place(if being out of place on this album is possible, it's pretty diverse).If you want something unique, get this album. It's really different from Slicker's other stuff as well as really different than any other band/artist out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excursions in Geometry","review":"This guide is ambiguous and provides very little information about obscure topics such as inversive geometry. The text is difficult to comprehend not because of its vocabulary, but because it tend to veer off course. Although the subject matter is interesting, it is very difficult to expose when confronted to diagrams that are basically not explained. This could not be used as a classroom guide because it tends to confound even gifted math students. An interesting remark was made, which was, \\"I think he's going to start talking about his dog right now.\\" This book would only be reccomended to the top 2% of math students, because it is not accesible to the general public. I should hope that someone who reads this book writes a revision of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for a beginner","review":"As a beginner to Web Applications, i found this book extremely easy to understand. The book covers all the topics necessary to get going to develop a complete basic web application. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants information regarding State Management, Data Binding, ADO, UI/Web Controls, Basic Security etc. Also, this book would be very useful to anyone who has little or no experience with ASP.NET before and who want to get their basics right before plunging on to a project.

But I found the soundtrack to be disappointing. I bought it for the Faith Hill song \\"There You'll Be\\" If you are like me, I recommend the single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get bamboozled by this one!","review":"The so-called soundtrack for \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a major disappointment. The film was full of great period songs and music. None of them are on the soundtrack. Instead, you can enjoy an hour of absolutely forgettable, mediocre orchestral background music. OK, the theme song is stirring, at least the first two or three times. But the rest is a real bore. When I want to listen to orchestral music, I go to Bach, Brahms and countless other true pros. Don't get bamboozled by this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very depressing soundtrack","review":"The soundtrack is a waste of money. I have seen the movie twice over Memorial Day weekend and it is very good. The soundtrack is very bad. Wait for the video. It is as if the producer took the darkest music of the movie and recorded it for the cd. There was more uplifting music I heard in the movie which should have been on the soundtrack, but I guess they left it off so that another soundtrack can be release later as with Titanic which was a much better soundtrack. On the same token, the music did not make Pearl Harbor. The story and the characters are what make Pearl Harbor such a great movie. Only buy this if you are a collector of soundtracks. This is one very depressing soundtrack. All of the high melodies from the movie are no where to be found. So sad for such a good movie. Put this cd on the shelf with Saving Private Ryan to collect more dust after a few spins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pearl Harbor / Hanz Zimmer Review","review":"Hanz Zimmer has a gift for film scores. There is a familiar tone in all of his scores but each still manages to remain unique and beautiful. If you have seen the movie Pearl Harbor you know how the score heightens the drama and intensity of each scene. If you are a true film score fan, as I am, you relive the movie through the music.This soundtrack is not as long and not quite as haunting as other Zimmer scores, such as The Last Samurai or Batman Begins, but it is beautiful and will not disappoint. If I had to mention a weak spot or flaw, it would be the first track, the Faith Hill song. She has a wonderful voice but the song is predictable and sounds like so many other average love ballads weighing down commercial radio today, with it's couple of versus, repetitive chorus, and swelling over done finish.But otherwise, I would say, if you like the movie and are a film score fan you will like the Pearl Harbor soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Soundtrack","review":"This soundtrack is good.It's not for sure a materpiece of film-scoring but it's always worth listening to it.It's a moving soundtrack, sometimes sweet and sometimes strong and it isn't repetitive, also because it doesn't last so much: if it last more it would surely be repeticious, but that's not the case.Well, I can't explain the matter for wich I like it and you might like it as well, I just say that I like the music and the tunes in this cd and if you appreciated the samples of the first two or three tracks, you'll like the entire cd as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Soundtrack Ever!","review":"I think the Pearl Harbor Soundtrack is the best ever! All the music sounds so beautiful and exciting! Hans Zimmer is the best composer of all time. All the soundtracks he makes are always good, but this is the best hands down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Harbor Soundtrack Bombs","review":"While the movie Pearl Harbor is amazing, the soundtrack does not follow suite. It begins with a mediocre ballad by Faith Hill and the remaining 8 songs, while nice to listen to, are not Hans Zimmer's best work. Tracks 2-4 are so similar it's hard to tell accompanies the numerous TV trailers. For a 3 hour movie, I them apart. It does not include the powerful music that expected a much longer soundtrack. I'm sure we'll get more music when a follow up CD is released. One will no doubt be released so that consumers who want a better soundtrack have to shell out more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful soundtrack!!","review":"When I saw Pearl Harbor, the movie moved me so that I had to get the soundtrack. It was just an awesome soundtrack! Hans Zimmer did a magnificent job on the soundtrack, and Faith Hill's \\"There You'll Be\\" fitted in right with the movie. The soundtrack and movie made me wanna learn more about Pearl Harbor and I thought that was great. Anyone who is thinking to buy this CD, you don't have to think about it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAPTURES THE PURE ESSENCE OF THE MOVIE","review":"When I went to watch the movie I couldn't help but notice the wonderful music. It takes your breath away when combined with the actual action in the movie, but even alone the music takes your breath away. It doesn't even compare to other cd's. It's superb and I love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pearl harbor","review":"I bought this CD for Faith Hills song and hoped the rest of it would be good also.

It could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity Personified","review":"I was disappointed in this soundtrack. The introductory and final songs were lackluster sentimentality. I would have hoped for something more from the producers. The instrumental offerings lacked excitement and musical tension. I would have though Zimmer would have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trailermusic aren't on the soundtrack","review":"I was very disappointing after I here the Soundtrack, because the trailersong wasn't on the CD. The other tracks are very emotional, but it's not like that what I expected! Where is the music of the trailer?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Rip Off","review":"The best way I can describe the poor selection of songs on this soundtrack is that it's a cheap and corny rip off of Titanic. How could Pearl Harbor be turned into a love story with a pathetic wannabe version of Celine Dione singing the theme song \\"There You'll Be\\". Faith Hill is about as dry bread as you can get, and sets a drab mood, due to the disappointment in the song while you're waiting for \\"a good part\\" or the \\"climax\\"....it never comes.I just don't think Faith Hill has (or ever will) what it takes to set the tone and capture an audience. Too important of a job to give to someone who can't even write her own songs..nor play any musical instruments. Faith Hill being a huge part in this..dullard is a word that comes to mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hans Zimmer writes the most recognizeable music in movies.","review":"That's not a compliment by the way.

Big deal. The film stunk and the uninspired score just had me thinking how much better the other films he's worked on were. Zimmer's better than this. The same can be said for most of the directors he usually works with. Perhaps it was just a paycheck to him...who knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally powerful and moving","review":"It's hard to put into words how much this soundtrack moved me. I like to play it right before I go to sleep, letting the beautiful melodies carry me off. The main theme that is repeated throughout the album is nothing short of gorgeous. The choral piece on one of the tracks lifts the soul above and beyond the horrible carnage of the sunny Sunday morning. While it is short in length, it is the best 45 or so minutes you can spend with a soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"Hans Zimmer has a wonderful talent that less of musicers have, and \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is his consecration.

Aside from that, I even like the non-lyrical songs on the album. The point of a soundtrack is to be reminiscent of the movie, and this one does an excellent job of that. When I listen to it I see the events of the movie in my head and go through the same emotions that the movie evoked. If nothing else, it's relaxing. I especially enjoy the uplifting \\"Tennessee,\\" full of hope and warmth. I may enjoy listening to the Backstreet Boys or Mandy Moore over instrumentals such as this album, but that doesn't make it any less emotionally stirring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop listening to it!","review":"Hello!This sountrack is amazing! Every single track has its own character, and I can remeber exactly where they were in the film. Just the music makes me cry and as soon as I saw the film, I went out and bought the soundtrack the next day!

I dont mind dated technology and special effects, this is classic science fiction. Barbara Bain appears a little wooden to me but it does not detract from the series.

This would have made it a little more plausible to begin with. However with that said, it's a fun series. Who doesn't love the eagles, the moon base design, and the color-striped armbands? Admittedly, some of the stories, especially in the 2nd second pushed even a ten year olds limit of imagination.

One minor complaint: the episodes are not arranged by airdate but at random, so I got the play list off IMBD and am watching them in order of broadcast. Fans of American style SciFi beware: the Brits do it a bit differently. Think of a combination of 70's Dr. Who, the Avengers, and the Prisoner. The series takes itself a little over-seriously, could have used more humor (Barry Morse tried to lighten things up in season one) but it's great fun to watch Martin Landau chew up the scenery and interact so convincingly with Barbara Bain, his real-life wife.

As a writer, I still look through this medium to see if there were any parts that can be embellished for newer ideas. What toppled the ratings of this show was the \\"Mind\\" entity beings that appeared on the first six or so episodes. But after that the writing started to switch to a more action oriented show.

In fact, that last sentence could sum up NRBQ's entire career, but that's what people love about them. As usual, they play with many different styles, including country, jazz and folk. This being a children's album, there are whimsical songs about everything from sleeping to tumbleweeds. This is a really fun album with some excellent songs. Another worthy entry in the catalog of the most underrated American band in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save Our Windows","review":"Mr. Meaney combines straightforward, grounded explanations with the right amount of humor to keep this work from becoming just another \\"how-to\\" text.

Also, the book could use a lot more diagrams and discussions on finishes and paint. The book limits itself to actually restoring to original working condition old windows and nothing about updating.

Changing some words around does not make the copyright of the song change.So I'll admit I went into my first listen of this album with a negative additude already.

I wouldn't take it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Bob - this CD is Over-Hyped & Over-Produced","review":"There is nothing of redeeming value with this music; the only reason it exists is because of the cult-like idolatry Bob Guiney receives from his adoring female fans of the ABC show 'The Bachelor'.The single, 'Girlfriend', is a cover from the band 'July for Kings' which Guiney claims he \\"re-wrote\\" to appropriately fit the meaning of his life - which is basically as phony as his singing ability and his autobiography.

There's plenty of people out there who can sing. It's a shame that so many of them stay relatively unknown (see July for Kings) while some has been goes out and sings other people's songs.

I have waited years to hear these guys again and I think this album is their best ever.I had the opportunity to hear them play live again last week and I cant wait to hear them again very soon. Bobs voice is just as awesome in person as on a CD. There is not one song on the new CD that you won't like. I have my favorites like \\"SO WRONG\\",\\"TEMPORARY LIFE\\" and \\"Fortunate\\". But the other 7 songs are great too and I don't think I have ever skipped over one song while playing the CD. Although repeat is often pushed.I wish Bob and the band the best of luck and cant wait for the next album.Way to go Guys you did it again!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Give credit where credit is due.","review":"Ok, so I have not actually heard this WHOLE cd. I did hear Bob sing on The Bachelor show and was impressed, but then I heard \\"his\\" first single, Girlfriend, and was less than impressed. This is for two reasons: a) Bob doesn't really have the rock vibe, which just makes his version of Girlfriend sound wrong (in his defense, the song I heard him sing on tv was Open Arms by Journey, an excellent song, and not easy to sing I don't think). b) I can't deal with the fact that I have not heard Bob publicly credit the originators of the song Girlfriend. The July For Kings version is 100 times better than Bob's, and while I know the band probably appreciates the publicity, they are not getting all the credit they deserve. Check out JFK's cd \\"Swim\\" and make your own comparison, though if you like Bob's single this CD will likely not disappoint your tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"other recommendations...","review":"For those that like the song, \\"Girlfriend\\" on Bob's debut cd, check out the band of who wrote the song. They are called July For Kings. Joe Hedges, the lead singer, wrote the song awhile ago, and it appears on their album \\"Swim\\" as well. Check them out, you might hear something you like! They are amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rock album by Bob!","review":"Bob Guiney's 3 Sides album was quite good. He and his band rock hard on the first couple of numbers! He writes some very emotional songs about love lost and love won over aggressive rhythms. This album makes me forget about his appearance on The Bachelor and makes me accept him as a serious musician and artist. The songs are reminiscent of some '90s alternative rock, but without the depressing themes. He sounds like Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish on a few numbers but picks up his own voice on the second half of the album. I like that he promoted the album differently without the excessive hype by performing in smaller shows and clubs. I look forward to Guiney making another album in the future because he is a rare talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Very surprised!

He even talks about life on the boat. Throughout the book is also illustrations and pictures to give the reader some background and/or enjoyment.This is not a book I would pick up to read unless you were familiar with Mark Twain's writing.

When I read some of the reviews, I was disappointed that they said not to use bath salts in this foot bath. That is no problem! The water jets are great and the water stays warm even after you have turned the heat off - what a wonderful way to relax - the jets are strong and you can remove the rollers if you wish.

However, because the summer has been so hot, I have not felt like using it much. That is okay with me because I do not stand on my feet all day during this time. Once I am back teaching, I am positive that it will be used often. The heating element works well; in fact, I have to turn it down or off when it gets a little too warm. I would rather have that problem than the reverse, though. The jets are nice for the toes and balls of the feet, but be sure to rotate them downward or else you may spray out onto the floor. The foot bath is almost too large for me and will fit even a men's size 13, I believe, so it is cumbersome to carry back to the shower for draining purposes. The \\"massaging\\" rollers on the bottom are okay but they don't really do much for my category of aches.

So far, no problem.It warms nicely and then maintains a very warm temp for 30 minutes. If you want more, simply hit the heat button again.

Would recommend this to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brookstone foot bath","review":"The product works very well. Some of the design functionality could improve. The cord wraps on the bottom so you have to lift and turn over before and after use to unwrap and rewrap the cord. It easily fills with pitchers of water (to avoid filling and carrying to where you wish to sit) but to drain the water you either have to lift it (and it isn't light when filled) or put on pedestal to allow to drain into a basin so you don't have to lift to empty out. Other than that it is fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!","review":"this is the BEST foot bath ever!!!! the heat works in seconds. you could have cold water and it would make it hot in about 2 minutes! and the jets feel very nice and it moves the water so well. it feels like a spa!! defiantly but this!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven for the feet","review":"On the plus side: I wanted a foot spa that truly kept the water warm. This spa does this by recycling the water while reheating it. The jets are adjustable, moveable and strong. The motor is quiet and it doesn't bother my husband while we are watching television. There is a plug for easier emptying. On the negative side, it is one of the more expensive foot spas on the market. It is bulky and heavy to move around especially when filled. The foot rollers on the bottom don't really do anything and could be eliminated in my opinion. You can't use anything but plain water per the manufacturer. Mine did arrive with a small crack in the blue water shield but I didn't want the hassle of sending it back as overall, I like the machine and my feet come out of it feeling great. I need that as I'm a nurse who works 12 1/2 hours shifts on my feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked","review":"I loved the idea of this foot bathbut the product leaked.

This one is amazing! I love the heat and it works so well, you have to turn it off for as bit or it gets too hot! That's a nice switch. This is far better then the ones who get cold in 20 or 30 min. It's a bit heavier, but also has more room for larger feet...if you need that. Even if you don't need it, the extra room is nice and the height of the water if good too! I use it all the time now and the first day I put some sea salt in the water and noticed some detox effects the next day. I'm thrilled with this unit and I feel it's worth the extra money...since it has no hastle and I actually use it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a relaxing, warm, serious foot bath."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is a nice foot bath!","review":"It is a very good foot bath. The water can be heated in a short time but won't be very hot.And it is very easy to use. The only deficiency is the sound is a little bit loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"We should have given more of our attention to the negative reviews on here, especially those who report that it only worked a few times and then never again. I received this unit on a Tuesday afternoon, later that evening after reading all of the instructions, I prepared to get some relief for my swollen feet. After filling with water, I plugged in the unit and pressed the power button, nothing. We tried in several outlets and no luck. We adjusted the water level too. So buyer BEWARE, some of these work only a few times and some don't work at all like ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, Reliable, Strong Value","review":"While a bit pricier than many of the other models, I took heart in the strong consumer reviews from fellow buyers. And I have not been disappointed. The Aqua-Jet Foot Massage Spa unit is well built and solid, with a nice wide base and sturdy construction. The high and low jet settings and variable bubble action, coupled with the heat selection, allow for a variety of customization options to achieve the right level of action for individual users.My only complaint is that although well built, I've yet to find a unit that accomodates large feet! My wife has size 9 feet and I have size 11 feet. While the unit is large enough to massage our feet if we keep still, we can't really use the massage rollers on the base of the unit without smacking our toes or heels at the front and back. Ah well -- a minor quibble, since the rest of the experience is top notch and it's proven a great overall value."},{"rating":"1","title":"The hydro jet on the left is broken","review":"I bought the item last year. At the beginning everything worked fine. During summer time I put it aside. Few weeks ago it was taken out and I looked forward to enjoying the massage by the powerful jets. However the jet on the left refused to work entirely. Very disappointed at the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so happy","review":"I purchased the foot bath because I am started to listen to all my aches and pains that my body is telling me and thought I am going to take care of myself because I do not want to fall apart at 42. I received my foot bath and was so excited. I used it 4 times and was real happy since I am on my feet all day. Well, sad to say that the heat and the massage no longer work. I tried plugging it in to different outlets thinking or hoping it was the outlet. I did not use any salts or oils like they advise you not to do. I was going to return it but it states that I cannot return this item do to sanitary reasons. Please do NOT purchase this item. It would have been a lot cheaper for me to just use a bucket of water to soak my feet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foot Baths","review":"I purchased this item thinking what I read about it here on Amazon would be true. Unfortunately the heated foot bath and Message is not what it sounds like. The heated part works ok, but as far as the message part, not even close. And the jets, come on, give me a break. For what I paid for this, over $100.00 and the most expensive one that Amazon had at the time I thought I would be getting a good foot bath. If I had to rate this from 1-10 I would give it a 3. Only because it does keep the water warm. In my opinion it is not worth the money or even half of what I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"All washed up","review":"Bought this thing as a gift for my wife. She was really excited to get it. Used it twice, with out any salts, and it worked great. Third time she went to use it, the jets didn't work. Got a hold of the company who sold it, and they said no problem, just send it back. So I'm thinking they are going to send me a new one, that works. Made me pay the return shipping, and just put the money back on my credit card.If I sold a defective item to someone, I sure as hell wouldn't ask them to pay for return shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"just like a pedicure","review":"Love this..like a peri minus the manual Foot massage.

However, I was disappointed that I was unable to get any massage effect from the rollers under my feet. Possibly this is because of my foot size(13). All in all I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but bulky","review":"We purchased his foot bath a little over a year ago. I works great but it's bulky and a little loud. If you don't mind that it's a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE PRICE!!","review":"Considering the price, this unit was a real disappointment. Within a short time the ice blue plastic \\"topper\\" cracked and had to be tossed. The foot bath was not as deep as I was anticipating and as far as the heat and jets they were just so so. Hugely overpriced for the quality of product it is. Better than other foot spas on the market, but not $70-$80 better. If this were priced under$50, it would be worth it in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost worth the full price...","review":"The Aqua-Jet Foot Spa does have some great qualties. Such as the rotatable aqua jets, which work really well. They only have two in the front where your toes are though. I wish they had something else in the back. Overall the spa does what it says but the massage nodes that help relieve stress are hard too feel when you roll your feet over them. It was kinda of a struggle to do and I had a friend try it and she had said the same. The heater does work well as long as you put luke warm water to start with. If your are looking for a relaxing foot treatment that practically knocks you out from relaxation, this is it. It may just be a little too pricy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 6 uses","review":"I use the foot spa infrequently, primarily for helping to recover from foot surgery.I've had the unit for over a year, but have used it only about 6 times (and being careful not to add anything to the water per the directions).This morning, I pulled it out, filled it with warm water, plugged it in and started it up in anticipation of helping a foot recover from another, recent operation. The unit worked for about 5 minutes and then the air pump quit functioning properly, making only a clicking sound and providing no air jet flow.The only advice from Brookstone customer service is to take it to a repair shop.I am extremely disappointed that such an expensive unit has failed and requires repair after just 6 uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - if it works","review":"I bought this for my husband for his birthday and it lasted exactly 31 days. After that the power button quit working and the drain plug broke. I sent it back to Brookstone, as it was outside of the 30 day store return and they promptly lost it. and are now saying I'm out of luck even though I have an RMA number, a tracking number from the shipper and the original order number from Brookstone.I won't ever buy anything from Brookstone again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks.","review":"I was really looking forward to a relaxing foot massage, but the bath leaked on first use -- what a mess.

In an effort to put more life in it, we are faced with a Jason who is killed but like in THE HIDDEN (a far superior film), he manages to live using host bodies. Although the screenwriters try to give us more motivation for Jason's murderous rampage, there is little suspense or novelty in the movie. Jason manages to kill off a few people, and his sister is recruited to finish him off. No real acting honors in this one, although Steven Culp manages to do well in his role as a tabloid tv producer. The ending is a joke in itself, with its reference to future Jason adventures. Not the best in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"wtf?","review":"I cant beleive they did this, they added a crapy plot, \\"only a vorhees can kill a vorhees\\" WTF??!!!!???!! jason had a sister? what a stupid plot, then at the end you see freddy's hand grabbing jasons mask and pulling it down under the ground (telling me freddy vs. jason is next).if you want to collect the friday the 13th film's i sugest part's 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 and X."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 STARS: If you like garbage, you'll love this movie!","review":"The beginning of this movie shows the audience how Jason is literally blown to pieces by a swat team. Does this kill Jason? No way!! Jason's heart comes back to kill some doctor and Jason goes from body to body to do fulfill his daily thirst for blood. This movie is about as lame as part VIII and part X of this series.If you think you might like this movie, think again and don't waste your time or you'll be sorry...this movie has the potential to make you retarded if you take it seriously. My advice is to stick with \\"Friday the 13th parts 1-6\\" (part 2 and 3 are clearly the best) and you will be a lot happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved the plot and the ending but the whole movie sucked!","review":"Ok the beginning of the movie was good but the rest of the movie was just blah! At the beginning of the movie it had the whole swat team trying to kill Jason and his heart came out and stopped beating then Jason's mask is layed on the ground then at the end of the movie what I liked the most is that Freddy's hand comes out and grabs Jason's mask telling me that there's going to be Freddy vs. Jason which I already know of and well I own Freddy vs. Jason it was awesome but through the rest of the movie it was just some black guy trying to be Jason slashing everyone with a huge knife. It wasn't a good movie I really wanted to see the real Jason then just some black guy. I do own all the Nightmare collection but not Friday the 13th. I sure wish I own all the Friday the 13th series but I don't have them. This isn't really the best Friday the 13th movie it's horrible.

Well anyways I would NOT recommend this to no one."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Buy this only to complete your collection...\\"","review":"Jason Goes to Hell is the worst Friday the 13th movie I have ever taken time to watch. Their was plenty of nudity, but there was just not enough of Jason! I mean, he looks really awesome with the metal hockey mask and his machete is cool and all that, but there was just too less of him. I really don't like the idea of Jason being a little Alien-like thing through the movie, and I especially don't like the idea of him crawling from body to body. It's just not the kind of thing that appeals to me. And, the director must have been in heat when he made this because it is full of perversion! So, I only recommend this if you want to complete you collection, otherwise, throw this one to the dogs.P.S. You can pick up the collectible 8\\" Jason poly resin statue at any Spencer Gift shop retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're keeping hell hotter these days","review":"Jason's back again but as his body is finally destroyed, we discover that he has a sister we didn't know about (thanks for telling us).

If you're heavily sedated, then help yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT WORTHY OF SEEING","review":"Well someone thought that it would be a good idea to make a new Friday movie, I just wish that there was a good story to go along with it. Jason returns to camp Crystal Lake. Somehow he is back to his old self, if I recall correctly he was turned back into a child at the end of part 8. Jason is killed by the FBI (which is new since no one has been willing to believe that he existed before), but his heart survives and travels from host to host until it can take over a blood relitive of Jason's and resurect him.

'Cause only a hardcore Friday the 13th addict could stand watching this senseless stupid movie.The director claims that he wanted to give us something different; well, he did. The only problem being that he did not really give us a Friday movie. I don't know what movie this really is; perhaps \\"Invasion of the Jason Body Snatchers\\" but definitely not a Friday.If you like old school Jason, then get part 6 or 7.

For that reason alone I rate it 1 1/2 stars!Unfortunately Freddy VS Jason was shelved for many years and was released after Jason X?! Which doesn't make any sense, so we have to pretend that Freddy VS Jason came out before Jason X to have this even begin to make sense.(I use the term loosely!) The only postive thing I can say about this film is that it's got a way too good DVD release and it makes Jason X and Freddy VS Jason look all that much better!I was really disappointed with this entry even though 'Jason Takes Manhattan' isn't much better! If you want to complete the Friday the 13th series, it should be seen as it does set up the superior sequel 'Freddy VS Jason'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sequel what were they thinking","review":"How could anyone think that Jason was dead.

I really only watched this for the end part when Freddy's hand pulls Jason into hell and belive me it wasn't worth it one bit.Another horrible thing about this movie was it's cast. That fat diner owner was so stupid with the whole Vorhees Birger and Jason fries. When Jason came in there I was so happy when all of them were killed.

I'd seen each of the movies a dozen times, but had somehow missed this particular movie. I barely even remembered hearing about it.I finally got to see it a few days ago and, wow... I mean, I honestly gave this movie a chance. I really did. This installment into the series is what PART 3 was to the HALLOWEEN series. Jason is barely in the movie. When you do see him, his makeup job is so weak that he becomes more comical than imposing or frightening. Now, I love Kane Hodder as Jason, but the acting in this movie is absolutely bottom shelf. There are a few decent visual effects, yet there are more than enough cheesy effects to counter and totally eclipse the good.This is the 2nd \\"mulligan\\" of the series: along with part 5, fans will wish they could simply remove them from the series and forever forget them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friday the 13th- part 9","review":"Jason, the living, breathing essence of evil, is back for another fierce fling.

The idea of Freddy's hand pulling down Jason's mask was great but that was the only good part about the movie. Again, as I said in my review of Part 5; Even though Jason was practically not in this movie that isn't the reason I'm trashing it. The plot itself was ridiculous and it took eight sequels to decide that only a relative of Jason can kill him by stabbing a \\"selected\\" knife through Jason's heart. Come on, even I could have come up with something better than that. Like Part 5 & 7, this is a real stinker.

This was a different friday movie,because jason was not in it at all only for a brief second in the beginning and towards the end!!!!!!

The film \\"The Hidden\\" was just like this. Friday The 13TH Part 9: Jason Goes To Hell was a copied movie. The Hidden was a great movie. The Hiddden was made in 1987, Friday The 13th Part 9 was made in 1993 so you can tell the producer of Friday The 13TH stole their great idea. Friday The 13th Part 9 is alike to The Hidden because they have this killer that hops from body to body by spitting a snake alien thing into their mouth and then the one with the snake alien thing is the new killer. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the Worst one yet","review":"Please don't buy this..It is terrible.

THIS MOVIE IS A DISGRACE TO FRIDAY THE 13TH AND THAT IS WHY IS DOESNT HAVE A FRIDAY THE 13TH LOGO. THIS MOVIE BELONGS IN HELL. IT ENDED PERFECTLY AT THE END OF PART 8 THERE WAS NO REASON TO MAKE THIS ONE. I SHOULD SAY TO THE DIRECTOR WHO MADE THIS MOVIE TO STOP WHILE HE CAN BECAUSE HE CANT MAKE A JASON MOVIE AND SHOULD NEVER TRY AGAIN TO. DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME WATCHING THIS MOVIE.

I think Jason X wil be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad","review":"I can remember renting this movie and actually enjoying the first parts of it...up until right after the coroner chows down on Jason's heart. Unfortunately that's the only scene in the whole movie that I did like. Though I also enjoyed how it made fun of all those tabloid news shows that take themselves way too seriously.

Why they bother to pretend that this is the same \\"Jason\\" as in the original Friday, I don't know. I guess they think the audience is pretty dumb. By 1993, it was apparent that 'they don't make 'em like they used to.' The 80s horror flicks were so much better, less loud, less obnoxious, and more fun. This is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Friday The 13th Part IX STINKS !!!!!","review":"Though I like th Friday The 13th series, this one STINKS!!!!!Jason is a little worm transfering from body to body.

The sound effect are much better, and so is the filming, but where\`s Jason? A Friday 13th movie, starring Jason for 10 minutes. That\`s not good enough. Jason died in pt.8, and my logic tells me that this isn\`t possible. But if you look away from the fact that it\`s a Friday 13th movie, it\`s a great movie. As said...I miss Jason, but great death scenes (Never have sex in a tent near Crystal Lake)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Friday the 13th Sequel","review":"In this ninth installment ( which was said to be the last - though \\"Jason X\\" will be released sometime later this year), is a surprisingly good sequel. In fact, it is the best \\"Friday the 13th\\" sequel. However, this film does have it's flaws. In the very first \\"Friday the 13th\\", it is made clear that Jason was an only child. But in this film, Jason suddenly has a sister(!). The film starts with a solid opening sequence, and the ending is even better. A top notch production which was nicely directed by Adam Marcus. This is also the best acted film of the series. Kudos to New Line Cinema (who acquired the rights from Paramount) for taking this series into a - much needed - new direction. A must for all horror fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, excellent horror movie, one of my favorites !!!","review":"A true horror movie...

It had the worst story and was completely unbelievable. One of the problems was the constant profanity. I'm a big horror fan but there's a difference between \\"being scary\\" and \\"bad taste\\". This movie was just bad taste. It is my recommendation that you skip this movie, especially if you're a Friday fan. You won't be sorry. It was worse than NIGHT OF THE SCARECROW. Yes, it was that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie can go to Hell.","review":"I'm a big fan of the Friday the 13th series, but I can honestly say that this movie is one of the biggest pieces of crap I've ever had the displeasure to sit through. The acting is lame and the story is pathetic. The only thing I commend the filmmakers for is trying to create an original twist to the series. Too bad they failed miserably and created the worst embarrassment to horror films since CGI. Don't waste your time with this one. Do like the majority of Jason fans do and pretend that this garbage was never created."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Three Mesquiteers (Not Roy Rogers!)","review":"This is a different slant on cattle rustling. Takes action in National Park and shows a different - not so helpful - side of the park rangers. Being that early in the 1930's, probably on the truthful side of things also! Involves a not so friendly stepfather, and the kind Mesquiteers, and a couple of good kids caught in the middle. (A bit of the old 'Tennessee/Arkansas' hill type folk and some of their good ol' hill music was entertaining :) too.) It will keep you wondering about the outcome as the rangers take a dislike to the three 'heroes', the Mesquiteers and put the blame on them! Watch what happens! Good for family viewing. Leaves a bit of wondering what might of happened in a 'sequel'! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Know What You Are Getting","review":"Please understand that this is NOT the orange Michael W. Smith Worship CD translated directly onto a DVD. This DVD is a compilation of the Worship and Worship Again CDs. Make sure you research the songs contained in this DVD, so you will not be disappointed, as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing is just the beginning","review":"This DVD is disappointing to say the least. From the moment Michael enters the arena through the crowd I feel like I'm watching carefully scripted theatre rather than worship to the King of Kings. The focus here is Michael W. Smith, \\"Worship Artist\\". Michael appears stiff and very conscious of the cameras, his movements choreographed. The direction is average, lacking inspiration and repetitive. The only moment I felt my spirit engage was during Awesome God. If you want a truly amazing worship experience on DVD I suggest you avoid this. You're better off buying Hillsong's \\"Blessed\\" or Christian City Church, Oxford Falls' new album \\"Lift\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Ahead Swinging Jazz","review":"What a beautiful no nonsense album! I have been a fan of Zoot and the Count for decades but this is the first time I've heard them together (1975) and it's the first time since the early Decca sides that I've gotten a chance to hear the Count stretch out. Good grief what a clinic in straight ahead swinging piano playing. My last records of Zoot were from the 50's. He has changed somewhat in his tone (heavier and a little rougher) and his style (a little more economical and less complex - if that's possible). Occasionally I will hear an old Zoot phrase sneak in - anyway, he still swings in the unique Lesterian sense. The real pleasant surprise to me is the bassist John Heard who is new to me. What a wonderful line he lays down. Finally, Louie Bellson is unobtrusive while firmly driving the group."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is an excellent movie","review":"This is a great movie with Hugh Grant and Sandra bullock. Sandra Bullock roll in this movie is yet another great roll. Her acting skills are superb as is Hugh Grant.

I also liked Sandra Bullock in movies like The Net, While you were sleeping for her excellent performances. So, with great expectations I wanted to see this so called comedy but it was a total disappointment. The movie was so boring that I could not even finish it. The actors look ordinary, the story looks ordinary and so the treatment. A total waste. The stardom is wasted and so is our time too.Was the movie taken it two weeks?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty to Look At: Otherwise a Waste","review":"Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock are nice to look at, as are many of the supporting cast. Some beautiful&sexy; outfits, too. Looking at their pictures in a magazine would be a better use of time.Thin plot; unbelievable behaviors for supposedly professionallawyers and wealthy businessmen. I guess the stars' names helped pay for the cost of making this film. In a nutshell:Thoroughly beyond belief, and rarely/lamely funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I loved this movie. It was very sweet. George (Hugh) and Lucy (Sandra) were perfect for each other. I laughed a lot during Two Weeks Notice. This is the best romantic comedy I've seen since Sweet Home Alabama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I rented this movie because it didn't look good enough to see in the theater. I was right. Actually, it wasn't worth the price of the rental, either. Best to wait for it to be on ABC or something. There were a few funny moments, but overall the writing wasn't very good, the acting was pretty bad (Hugh did a decent job, but Sandra seemed, as my husband put it, like a bit of an ice queen), and I could gather no real chemistry between them. They seemed like good friends, but the film didn't convince me that there was any real attraction between them. Overall boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like it.","review":"This is a very lousy and boring film. There's not much substance in the writing. I will not recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Can It Be . . .","review":"that two people who were so hilarious together on the publicity circuit for this film have no chemistry whatsoever onscreen?

She's done a number of them in the past, and with \\"Two Weeks Notice\\", she proves that she continues to evolve. If she continues to evolve this fast between movies, then in a few years, she'll get an Oscar nomination for Best Picture. Besides, Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant make a great acting duo. They know how to create the best rivalries and the best love scenes. Grant's great acting matches perfect with that.This movie doesn't have a dull moment. The writers know how to make their audience laugh. At the same time, they make many wonderful, meaningful political statements(another Bullock idea). Anyone who watches \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" will leave satisfied. One will crave for the next Sandra Bullock produced movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Predictable but fun","review":"Sandra Bullock plays a lawyer who is passionate in her defense of the downtrodden. She ends up working for wealthy playboy Hugh Grant who is interested only in women and making a profit. Soon their differing ideals begin to clash and Bullock threatens to quit because her job requires her to be on call 24/7 for such monumental decisions as to which tennis outfit Grant should wear to a benefit tournament. The ending is a foregone conclusion, but it's fun getting there and Bullock and Grant manage to throw off just enough sparks to keep things interesting. If you're looking for an evening of light entertainment, this might just be the movie for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong format","review":"I ordered the widescreen for my wife's birthday and received the full screen.

Of course once I started the video the 24 hours started so I spent 2.99 for nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bullock and Grant are an awesome combo","review":"This is one of my favorite movies. It has humor and romance and manages both with a logical sense of style that really makes the whole thing work. Too often movies will try so hard to be great but they slip up in one or more categories. It's annoying to watch a movie that seems to be fantastic only to blow it at the very end by doing something 'cute' but while trying to be cute it breaks the logical consistency it's strove for up to this point.Two Weeks Notice doesn't do that at all. It's logical, funny and cute all the way through while at the same time maintaining the sexual tension between Bullock and Grant very well. There is one scene with Bullock needing to use the restroom and using an RV that stretches the logic a bit but it doesn't go too far. All in all, great movie. Great romantic comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grant, Bullock Disappoint","review":"I have come to expect a lot more from both of these fine comedic talents!The plotline was way too formulaic and, Duh! everyone knows the two will eventually wind up together.Bad fluff by 2 great actors - let's hope there is better from them to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing humdrum non-love story","review":"I love both these actors, and they're both likeable and cute. But this movie was a dog. Firstly, the plot was very different than the feel of the movie you got from the trailer. Secondly, Ms. Bullock once again plays a soppy loser who orders chinese take-out night after night alone. Despite being a highly successful lawyer, her character comes across as a total loser with no confidence, just a fruity greenpeace nut. This is so disappointing when Sandra Bullock could be so much more. Why does she return to these rolls over and over again?Third, George and Lucy had no spark or chemistry. There was no love story here, just funny little scenes stuck together. The ending was very boring. They should have shown the wedding, except that Lucy's bridal getup was horrendously ugly! She looks like her name should be Agnes or something. See Sliding Doors instead with Gwyneth Paltrow, that was cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I'm a huge fan of Hugh and Sandra but putting them together was a bad idea, no chemistry whatsoever.

I thought Sandra and Hugh showed no chemistry what-so-ever. They were not realistic as a couple and I didn't like either one's characters. I went to see it thinking, \\"How can a Hugh Grant/Sandra Bullock movie be bad.\\" Well, they answered it for me. I could of thought of a million things better to do with my time. I will flip the channel when I see it on cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Weeks Nap","review":"If neither Sandra Bullock nor Hugh Grant (to a lesser extent) can save the thinnest and most damningly simple movie, then it's safe to say that it is indeed junked. Unlike one of the other Mark Lawrence movies featuring Bullock, 'Miss Congeniality,' Bullock doesn't get much of a chance to show off her screwball splendor. Instead, what we get from both leads is a tired effort at replaying what movie audiences love most about them, which is one joke too many and one too lame already. But, if all else fails in a screwball romance, you can at least be assured of eye candy with this pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"First put on your best British accent. As you read this review, it might seem the review is much better than if you read it with an American accent, which is exactly what happened with \\"Two Weeks Notice.\\" Without Hugh grant, this movie would have been the same old romantic comedy with the always charming Sandra Bullock. Although it would have been better than any J-lo movie, it would not have been half as good as it was. Hugh Grant has an amazing gift that lets him make anyone laugh; maybe it's his sarcasm and his perverted sense of humor; or maybe it's his British accent. He and Bullock had great chemistry and were extremely funny together. Bottom line: Hugh Grant could probably make reading the dictionary funny and perverted; imagine what he could do with Sandra Bullock."},{"rating":"1","title":"I already saw this once....","review":"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw \\"the ring\\" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable.

About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big \\"oh i've always felt this way kiss\\"Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse.

What else can you say about the wonderful Hugh Grant, and the amazing Sandra Bullock?The story is about an affluent New Yorker (Grant), who depends so much on an employee (Bullock), who does not want to work for him.The plot is not all that great, however the acting helps push the forward. And this flick goes at an amazing speed!I won't say this film is wonderful and all, but trust me, I will recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't a comedy be funny?","review":"I am very surprised by all the good reviews here for this film. I sat there waiting for something to happen, but for the entire thing it was just unfunny. I cared nothing about the characters played by Bullock and Grant. I went in hoping that it would be the caliber of writing of someone like Richard Curtis on Notting Hill or Love Actually (two terrific Hugh Grant films), but this was just a complete waste of time where you want those hours of your life back. I noticed Bullock's name as a producer. I hope this doesn't mean she fudged with the script to make it \\"funny\\" in her mind. (Anybody remember when actress Kim Basinger complained that the writer of the script for her film Marrying Man had no conception of comedy and she decided to rewrite it? The writer she was complaining about was Neil Simon.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment!!","review":"Sandra Bullock tries the old, \\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\\" routine for this movie.

Overall, this is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"My face was stuck in a grimace the whole time.","review":"I usually love Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant, but unfortunately this movie is really bad.

Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Weeks To Long","review":"Being a fan of both Miss. Sandra Bullock and Mr. Hugh Grant I looked forward to what I felt would be a fun movie, unfortunately I was to be quite disappointed.Miss Bullock's character lacked the manic energy she has frequently displayed and that this story badly needed. Her character, Lucy Kelson, had a great deal of potential, which a lackluster performance did not deliver.Mr. Grant's performance was better, but not markedly so. The \`one liners' he delivered had little punch and even less humor. The chemistry between the two main characters, necessary in this type film, just didn't seem to be there.The one bright spot was Miss. Alicia Witt, as June Carter, a sort of rival to Miss Bullock's character for the affections of Mr. Grant. Her performance had energy, humor, the vulnerability of youth and at the same time the sense that she was potentially a predator manipulating the situation for personal gain.Bottom line: Even the best miss on occasion and this is one such occasion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny with wit and silliness","review":"Two Weeks Notice had humor that definitely made the audience laugh.

It's cute, somewhat though not too funny, with some chemistry between Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant. It has all the ingredients of your standard romance comedy: a New York city backdrop, a wealthy bachelor, a scheming rival, a heroine with a heart of gold. If you like romantic comedy, you'll like this for the most part. If you're lukewarm or dislike romantic comedy, you'll hate this movie.HOWEVER, the DVD vastly improves the movie. The voice over with Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant is very, very funny-much funnier than the movie itself.

It'll work well for an date with your significant other or if you just want to lift your mood.Unfortunately, like many such films, this film isn't particularly exciting or original. It begins with the characters hating each other, then being forced into a situation where they work closely together, and then near the end of realizing they love each other. In fact, this movie follows the same narrative arc of Sandra Bullock's other romantic comedies, such asThe Proposal. It lacks the spunk and freshness of a film likeMiss Congeniality."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review that is a lot like monopoly...","review":"OK, this review is going to be fairly short. I have to say that this movie could have been great, but unfortunately falls flat at the end. The first half of this movie is great, Hugh Grant is hilarious and Sandra Bullock manages to be cute and intelligent at the same time, and these characters are completely believable. Grant has a line where he says \\"My life is a lot like Monopoly\\" ( which had me rolling ) and sadly the movie is a lot like Monopoly, in that it is a 'board' game and I found myself very 'bored' in the last half of the movie.This movie is hilarious enough in the first half that I watch just that part then turn it off, because I know what is coming. The last act has them coming together and confessing their love for each other, and at that point it feels completely rushed and unbelievable, like this is the end, so they love each other, ummm, roll credits. I recommend the first half highly, then just skip the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemistry Between Grant and Bullock - None","review":"When I first saw this movie, I was looking for a funny, romantic, movie full of laughter and romance. What I got - a few funny lines, and absolutly NO onscreen chemistry between Grant and Bullock. The plot was good, but it kind of dragged on a bit. The ending didn't hit home, and overall, the film wasn't very good. If you are looking for a good romantic comedy, don't bet all your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"And I like Sandra Bullock!","review":"Sometimes a bubblegum movie is old bubblegum, tired and chewy and not very sweet. This movie has all the pieces but doesn't have any zing to it, any purpose. They go back and forth a little bit but they never truly convinced me that they were in love or their love was in danger. Alicia Witt, a superb actress didn't really have much to do in thsi film and Hugh Grant's bumbling charm boy routine is wearing thin.I'm not sure about Bullock, she's filling a niche I'm sure. Doing films that appeal to her, that she gets paid a lot for, that help employ a lot of people. But I'm not qute sure if she's developing further along as an actress, if she's willing to take a risk and do something edgey or different or challenging. She just seems to be the best at the romantic comedy pairings movie of the season. Hopefully she'll start getting better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"About Nothing","review":"Fresh of watching \\"About A Boy\\" I felt like Hugh Grant could do no wrong, so despite less than stellar reviews I decided give \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" a shot, which was a mistake. While there are some comedic moments, this a romantic comedy and Bullock and Grant have NO chemistry. In most of the scenes they seem only mildly aware of eachother mostly focusing on thier actions. As a result, I never felt like they should be together. Further, the plot seems to jump around. Right after getting hired, the plot leapfrogs to weeks later where Grant and Bullock are now supposed to be chumy, but I never felt it. THey seem to be tired of eachother and their action forced by the plot's simple-minded purpose. After his great romantic comedies of the 1990s, this a huge step down for Grant and even for Bullock, who mostly makes bad movies anyway. This is not worth your time because it clearly wasn't even worth the actors full attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny and very sweet","review":"I'm a big fan of romantic comedies and this is one of my favorite. I received this movie as a graduation gift and I really like it. Hugh Grants George character was such a pain in the butt to Sandra Bullock's Lucy character but he grew on her.Lucy was always an overachieving, take charge, and want to make a difference person while George was guy who never really needed to work hard just represent his company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very funny or romantic","review":"Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are two great actors, and putting them together in a romantic comedy seems like it would make perfect sense. However this was the wrong choice for them. This movie just wasn't very funny, and I really didn't feel any chemisty between the two. I coulden't wait for this movie to be over. All in all, this movie wasted some big time talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun and cute Hugh Grant movie!","review":"I pretty much own all of Hugh Grant's movies, so this is just another one in my collection, however it is a very cute romantic movie with Hugh providing his typical subtle little one-liners. Sandra Bullock is another of my favorite actresses and the two of them have a wonderful chemistry together. It's just a really great film and it's one that you want to just watch over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE AWESOME MOVIE!","review":"This movie has a great cast & great plot!

If you don't want to have to watch the entire movie, here are the locations of each heart. I think I found them all. These are listed by hour:minute:second. 18:32, 20:04, 23:38, 24:13, 26:38, 28:14, 33:02, 37:28, 41:36, 47:16, 57:50, 1:13:01, 1:24:29.The extras on the DVD are of the usual fare, but not outstanding. The commentary is somewhat interesting, with Sanda and Hugh bantering about. The movie itself is somewhat forgettable, but is an enjoyable little film. I agree with another reviewer who said that it's like iceberg lettuce: not really great for you, but certainly not bad for you either, and you'll forget all about it an hour after it's over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable Fluff","review":"Nothing worth seeing-- Grant has made some classics in this genre (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Notting Hill, Bridget Jones's Diary)-- but \\"Two Weeks Notice\\" is not a classic. It isn't even an admirable effort. It is clear he enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock offscreen, but they share little onscreen chemistry. Bullock continues her title as the \\"poor man's Julia Roberts\\" -- it's not a harmful film-- it's just not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Same story we've seen many times before. You know whats going to happen just by seeing the preview. Grant is great and charming. Bullock is her same old clumsy character. Supporting cast provides laughs as well. All right if you have nothing better to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"*snore* a waste of two good comedic talents","review":"You would think that a romcom with Bullock and Grant could hardly go wrong.Unfortunately it does in spectacular fashion.Zero chemistry is never a good start in a romantic movie, and two very funny people are let down by an unfunny script.The film feels like it never quite starts - I spent the whole thing waiting for the story to kick in - and then it's over.Very disappointing. I expect the commentary and bloopers are the best reason (if there is a reason!) to buy this movie.Just plain boring - what a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"An obnoxiously bad movie containing just about every PC cliche imaginable.

Plus, it is romantic without being sappy. Even my husband (a real guys guy) enjoys it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Far Cry From Notting Hill","review":"I've always been a big fan of Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock and I was really looking forward to seeing the two of them together. I sincerely wanted to enjoy myself, but the one thing you heard ALL the critics agree upon about this film turned out to be absolutely true-- It's about as ordinary and unoriginal as a romantic comedy can be. The conflicting question among all the critics was this: Were Bullock and Grant able to turn a rather dull movie into something good? I didn't think so unfortunately. Heck, I don't even think the pairing of Superman and Wonder Woman could have saved this film. It certainly doesn't compare well to Grants previous picture, ABOUT A BOY.My recommendation is not to waste your money on this movie unless you're a fan of these two actors... My final review is two and a half stars... Just too average and not many laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie doesn't have the typical twist-","review":"I am a sandra Bullock fan, I love her acting style, plus she is a beautiful person that shines through the movies she's been in. I got a good laugh out of this movie. It was well done by both actors. If you want to see a movie that will have you in stitches, then this is a great pick. I also recommend seeing this movie on a Sunday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring romantic comedy","review":"Sandra Bulluck (who is my favorite actress, by the way) never looked good in this movie and the chemistry between her and Hugh Grant was missing. Neither her character nor Hugh's was particularly like-able and the ending was, of course, predictable, but lacking in real emotion. Wait for cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"I already saw this once....","review":"I gave it two stars and i was being kind. Simply because I saw \\"the ring\\" and gave it one star and did enjoy it more than that. But this movie is so predictable. Maybe its because I've seen this before. yes it was in \\"you've got mail.\\" Two rich and professional people who in the begining dispise each other while one of them is in a relationship with another. About half way through the protagonist who's in the relationship miraculously drops the 'lover-we-never-see' and realizes how much she loves our other main character. But they save it all for the end with the big \\"oh i've always felt this way kiss\\"Sadly predicatable and loaded with a lot of dry humor, this movie wasn't at all what I expected, it was worse. Sadly, Sandra's 'girl next door good looks' and Hugh's quick oneliners weren't enough to rescue this movie from its date with Blockbuster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two Weeks Notice","review":"Just saw it on TV & love it & so I bought it & plan on watching it several times.

And this delightful picture elapses between the lives and times of these three adorable women; each one of them with her dreams and love affairs; someone of them fortunate; others simply a beauty illusion.As you may guess this summer breeze picture has all what you wish to seduce you.

This record really doesn't need to be heard by anyone, least of all GBV fans. I personally feel the band has gone downhill since Toby split around UTBUS, but this album is totally devoid of anything that made GBV who they are.Gone are the catchy, quirky melodies, the odd-ball lyrics.

This wasn't an isolated experience because I've gone through two of them and both have cracked and split after a year of use.

For starters, one of my dogs is scared to death of it and wont come near it because when the water level in the bowl gets low it gurgles just like a water cooler at work. The first time it happened she was drinking out of it and it freaked her out and now wont go near it. The other dog is just fine with it, but then again he's deaf, so the gurgle doesn't bother him. lol. The other issue i had with this is just like all water bowls, it gets dirty. so you still have to clean it as often as you would any other water bowl, but it's a bit more cumbersome having to take the big jug off, clean the bowl and but the jug back on. So, if your dog isn't afraid of the noise it makes and you don't mind the extra hassle cleaning it, it's great.

I only fill it halfway so that I can clean it out every time I have to fill it.Pros: No need to refill the water bowl 3x/day, knowing kittens are hydrated, avoiding spillage (they sometimes get carried away while playing and knock over dishes)Cons: Hair and other bits tend to gather at the bottom of the fountain every few days. I've caught the kittens trying in vain to clean it out.

My cat loves it and I didn't spill one drop of water out of it when filling it up. I'm not exactly Miss Coordination, either.

Seemed like a good fit for this bottle (note that the pic is of the 5 gallon dog food dispenser and not the waterer). Well, within a day or two of using it the dogs refused to drink from it. I pulled the bottle and poured a glass of water from it and it tasted awful. The plastic leaches chemicals into the water and the dogs wanted nothing to do with it. They drink out of some of the most rancid puddles and mud holes and they wouldn't touch this water. I can only use this dish without the bottle attached for them to use it. I would only suggest this for someone with enough dogs to empty it daily - otherwise the chemical taste of the water will get too strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"The waterer jug is constructed of a single molded piece of plastic with a small outlet and a 90-degree step inside the jug. Even a bottle brush cannot reach the sharp corner inside the jug where the mold will accumulate. You'd need a special hinged brush to reach the corner.The waterer base has a keyed removable top, and it is at least possible to reach most of the surfaces, but there are undesirable crevices which are hard to clean out. Worse, the surface finish is quite rough. It is thus impossible to remove the microscopic algae growth, so it quickly comes back.It's a great idea but poorly executed. If they'd designed it right, they wouldn't have to impregnate the plastic with microbicides!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog waterer","review":"This Waterer is great for my big puppy, he drinks so much in one day. i dont have to continue to fill it every half hour.

My cats like to play in it getting scum and food in the water so it needs to be cleaned at least once a week. It's a great product, and I don't mind filling it halfway, however it would have probably made more sense to get the smaller one. I would also suggest that the food and water are kept a good distance from each other to help keep the water clean. It is not fun to clean it while it's still full. As for the 'gurgleing' it is not a major problem with cat's since they don't drink as much as dogs it rarely happens while they are standing there.

Then it stopped delivering meals. Fortunately I was aware of it - I bought it for when we went away for weekends, but wanted to be sure the cat wouldn't starve while we were gone so set it up to feed. The Waterer I bought is fine. It's just a little water cooler. I wish it were a little more solid though.Back to the Feeder - I had to reset the whole thing twice before it worked. I had the right times and portions but just didn't drop the food. I'm going to give it another week or so before I ask to have it replaced.When it works it's great - good design for the cost.

I've had it about a month now and they all like it although it \\"gurgles\\" sometimes and startles them (when the new water comes down as they drink) but this definitely has entertainment value and doesn't stop them from using it. I took off 1 star because the base seems pretty cheap (a two part plastic snap together deal that has little tabs that look like they won't last that long), but the 5 gal. bottle is tough and sturdy and when it is all put together, it is pretty solid as a unit. My big dogs (Pitbull and Boxer) haven't messed with it at all (i.e., tipped it over, moved it or chewed on it). For 29.00 bucks, it was a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to clean","review":"I used this waterer for several months. I had always rinsed it out with fresh water before refilling it, and scrubbed the bottom part.

But this book should be seen as mearly Jung's perception of the book, and as a reaction to a religion of Law, and not of Grace.

Repeatedly hearing the same thingbrings about a distinct curiosity for a deeper and broader understanding.\\"Answer to Job\\" is a gift from Jung to christians in such sense.As enlightening as scientists come to explain the physicalbiblical wonders, so is Jung's insights to the psyche'sdevelopement(both God's and human's) since creation and where dohuman beings fit in the process, providing a unique perspectivethat fits right in. Another reason I like the book is due toJung's humble and objective attitude in observing, perceivingand interpreting, albeit how passionate he felt about the subject,I could sense his integrity as a scholar. This book is a valuablepersonal sharing from a man to his fellow human beings whom hecared about dearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a man his age, he sings great.","review":"This album was originally released in 1968, when Regis was Joey Bishop's sidekick. It was Regis's only commercially released album, although he later recorded some albums that he released on his own. Regis had an okay singing voice, but it was certainly nothing special. Also, his style was hopelessly outdated by 1968. The arrangements of these standards are incredibly corny, too. But a few of these songs are good for a laugh. The highlight of the album is the end of \\"Toot, Toot, Tootsie/Baby Face\\", where Regis yells out \\"Sock it to, 'em, Tootsie!\\".

I vaguely remembered something about this series. What I thought would be another dull movie night, turned into a very enjoyable one. I have spent the last week and a half watching all of the discs and decided that I should order this. I have tried to explain the series to friends and just get blank stares. I would describe it as a cross between Fargo, American Beauty, and Tales of the City. One minute I'm trying to deal with the tragedy of the moment and the next I'm questioning if it is appropriate for me to laugh out loud.

If you have not watched SFU you need to, it is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleased.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the gathering that occupied Alan Ball's world of Six Feet Under. And the perspective he gives on two commentary tracks gives insight into the thoughts and feelings human nature puts on display. I work as a paramedic in a rather large south florida community, and meet briefly with large numbers of people inside a week. I can attest to how people interact with one another without understanding why. Ball does an excellent job in capturing that. And the fact that he gives credit to those around him concerning the development and layers of the lives of the Fisher family and those who orbit their existence, in capturing a unique window into what it is like to have flaws, shows how great a film maker he is. He shows that we try and make the best of what we own the most...our lives. Thanks Alan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting, hoping for Blu-ray release","review":"I keep waiting, waiting, waiting for this to come to Blu-ray so I can buy and rewatch it.According to Amazon's DVD specs, Seasons 1 and 2 were presented at an aspect ratio of 1.33:1, while the other seasons went to 1.78:1. I suspect the aspect ratio (and corresponding video quality) are preventing its release on Blu-ray. We can hope HBO will invest some $$ in a \\"restoration\\" and maybe release it on Blu-ray to mark the 10th anniversary of the finale. Please do it for the fans!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like nothing else","review":"I had to read the 1 and 2 star reviews, because I found it difficult to believe that anyone could dislike this series so much. Most of them were about the price of the set or the vendor they bought from- not the show itself. Those who didn't like the show are mostly the puritanical homophobic set. Yes, this is not the series to watch if you can't handle two men kissing. However, if you're past all that and want to watch something unique, genuine and gorgeously shot, this is the series for you. Someone lamented he couldn't watch with his kids. Uh, hello...this is not a family show.Are the characters whiny and boring sometimes? Yes, they are....and they freely admit it. That's part of what makes the show unique. It shows us how we live as Americans with depth and purity rarely seen elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a huge fan of HBO series but I can't get into this one. I don't connnect with the characters, I find them dull and the whole storyline bores me. I have tried as it gets raving reviews from most who watch it, but I just don't care for it. There is not one character I even like! I love Deadwood, Oz, Rome and Carnivale. All wonderful above average shows,but this one is lacking something. It does not have any spark. I felt it is really dull."},{"rating":"1","title":"HBO GETS YOUR MONEY TWO WAYS!","review":"First, you have to BUY HBO to see this series...then, if you want the DVD's, you have to pay DOUBLE what other DVD sets cost!I think that's highway robbery...I'd rather not buy this set unless someone else gets it as a gift and then sells it for cheaper on eBay!I don't mind paying an average of about $30-$45 for a series, but every season of six feet is $80 or more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Know","review":"Too much sexual activity including homosexual activity. Too much too fast forward voiding the content of tne movie. Will not watch another season."},{"rating":"1","title":"six feet under first season","review":"so far, still watching the first season. But can tell you that by only watching the first show i would give the season a 2. the first show of any season should grab your attention, and they do that but they just dont do a very good job at keeping it. In the first show, theres death, closet \\"hook ups\\", gay soft core love scenes and just plain drama, wonder what the rest of the shows are going to be like. If you are into the slow paced ironic drama then this show is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and Uninspiring","review":"At first promising, this series quickly unwinds because the characters are not particularly interesting. Because of this, the writers choose to insert one bizarre situation or tragedy after another in order to give the characters something new to complain about.Not any of the characters acts like the adults that they are supposed to be, and not one of them is aware of the simple truth that if you're miserable, being in a lousy relationship isn't going to cure you of being miserable. The Gay Sex Death Hour is neither funny, witty, or poignant, and your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cutesy, content-free","review":"The Amazon staffer who compared it (on the DVD page) to a cross between Twin Peaks and Family was dead on. Because it's cutesy and content-free on the one hand, sentimental and melodramatic on the other. Most of the actors/actresses look like models and can't act, the supposedly \\"mysterious\\" Brenda is just another cliche, and the insistent soundtrack is a nausea-inducing combination of Rick Marvin Air Pudding and K-Tel hits. This mix might be \\"addictive\\" for some, but then again so is heroin.Look, I'm someone who believes that TV CAN be great art. A cross between, say, Barney Miller and, The Outer Limits might be more to my liking. But this bucket of suds? Forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Six feet under - complete first season","review":"Such a highly addictive series!I am not really a big watcher of series type shows, but this one caught me with the first episode and kept me hooked.Can't wait for season 2! Even considered ordering HBO just for six feet under ...It's content can be pretty rough at times (bordering on graphically shocking) BUT once you get past that; and the colorful language, you are left with pure laugh out loud comedy with surprises along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply superb","review":"Alan Ball has created the finest show on television. Though it lost some of its focus during the second season, the first season is magical. There has rarely been a show on television that has characters with such depth and plot of a mix between lighthearted, morbid, and emotional. Only HBO has the guts to do a show that's not the same old cop/ doctor/ lawyer drama, and they do what they do superbly.Rent it or buy it used because, as many others have said, the price tag is far too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"This set DOES have extras.","review":"At the time of this posting, Amazon has no extras features listed. But that's so not like HBO.

I am counting the days until season 4 arrives on the shelves and it's been a long, hard wait. This family is the epitome of dysfunction and watching their lives unfold can only make you grateful for your own, hopefully more sane life.I enjoyed the first season on DVD having never seen it on HBO and I don't think I ever got up to do anything else. I devoured all 13 episodes immediately went looking for season 2.With its very adult subject matter, this is not a show for kids. Be prepared to get addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best TV series EVER","review":"How can one make such an extravagant claim for any show? Possibly because of consistency in both the acting, writing and production values. Intelligent, extraordinarily moving, unpredictable, funny and real, it spotlights life in the land of death. Take Tony and the gang, the Fishers are the family I prefer to spend my Sunday nights with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-Changing Experience","review":"Seldom do we come across someone who actually has the power to change something about ourselves, to think over our own lives. Let alone a movie, or for that matter, a TV show.Well, I can honestly say SFU has changed mine. I had bought Season 1 out of curiosity and by the end of it, was completely addicted. It's dark humour, the repressed feelings about to burst out, these lovable yet out-of-their-minds characters, it was all so new, creative and just plain interesting that I couldn't wait to see more.Then I basically devoured Seasons 2-5 in over a month or so; and by the end of it, I can honestly say the series had changed my perspective on many things.It's an experience, really. And one worth experiencing. See for yourself. Thank us, the ones telling you to see it, later. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you laugh & makes you think...","review":"I was skeptical the first time I saw this show, but by the second episode I was hooked. The concept is brilliant and original, the writing deliciously realistic--despite the unconventional subject matter-- and the cast simply COULD NOT be improved upon. Each character plays their tragically human role magnificently and you'll almost certainly be able to relate to at least one of them. The range of issues tackled in the 1st series give the viewer much food for thought and may even serve to change your perception of life, death, and a number of the other things in between. Nothing I could write by way of a description would do justice to the show, so I'll leave it at that. If you're among the many who still haven't had the pleasure of seeing it then go for it. You won't be disappointed. This show is highly addictive ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting hit by a bus","review":"The writing and acting are outstanding. It's amazing to see Michael C Hall playing a repressed gay mortician after watching him gleefully offing bad guys on Dexter. Frances Conroy as the mother is a special treat and Lauren Ambrose as the younger sister is unforgettable. Rachel Griffin acts with her usual dynamic heartfelt excellence. Freddy Rodriguez holds his own as the embalmer with a gift for making the corpse look lifelike. The Nate character is a bit annoying but not enough to let you take your eyes off the other dazzlers. The secondary characters are also superb. There's a funeral every week and its always a great backdrop for whatever the characters are experiencing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well preserved... and almost lifelike.","review":"Nice product. Even ten years after, much better than typical network drek. A unique series (morticians!?) with great characters and some quirky humor. Enjoy watching the characters develop; the stories do a nice job getting these people out of their respective self-imposed shells. Knowing the opening scene in each show will feature someone's untimely death is a nice device for this series (if not a completely original concept). Show's not perfect, not for everyone (especially the occasional gay lifestyle portrayals, which will make some folks uncomfortable), but is VERY good, consistent and engrossing. Just finished watching Season 1 on Amazon Instant Video, thanks to the recent sale, and we've decided that the series is worth continued purchases."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Something..different\\"","review":"I was a bit skeptical when i first heard of this show, soap opera plots?, talking dead people ? come on.But as i kept watching, there was always something memorable about an episode from Richard Jenkins making appearences as the brothers dead father or the goody two shoes brother played by Michael C. Hall (Dexter)and other interesting characters The acting is excellent and the main theme title intriguing. Im not gunna say anymore, there is no middle ground with a show like this, its either you love it or hate it. If you saw \\"American Beauty\\"(one of my favorite movies) you might appreciate this show a bit more. If the show keeps up with the good story, count me in for season 2. In other words the season was in the mail when i got home wrapped in plastic and in 100 percent perfect condition.

However, a few tracks simply don't cut it with me. \\"LA River\\" wastes a fairly good music track with rather lame \\"I'm nobody\\" lyrics, while \\"Tomorrow I'll Be Nine\\" is the \\"I'm nobody\\" motif yet again, and I can't say I feel for the tyke.

It's obvious the author thought these through and tested them.The only drawback (and it's covered by the author in the preface) is that examples and pathing presume a Windows platform -- in spite of his preference for Unix.

If De Palma had thrown in some intentional humor, it might have been great. Alas, none of the funny parts were intended to be side spliting. What a disaster! Very sad for De Palma and Griffith. What was she thinking. Did you folks that gave this five stars, really think it was that good, or are you just perpetuating the joke? Shame on you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this may well be the worst thriller made in the 80's","review":"i can't even begin to tell how bad this movie is. it just rolls around in its own excess and asked us to play stupid and just follow along. i sold this one the day after i bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy","review":"Well i didnt rate it the best. If you want action the whole way threw the movie, then dont buy it. One action part turn my stomach a bit. I bought this movie for 2.99 Canadian. I knew it would be some type of a flop but hey it's only 3.00 right. If u like to laugh at cheesy things go ahead watch it. If ur looking for one sex scene go ahead watch it. To me when I watched it, the movie said to me an old cheesy, slightly porno type movie.

Basically a guy is given a penthouse type apartment to look after with a telescope. De Palma films most of the movie with this guy looking through it and the music in the background and forty minutes later after waking up you find he is still doing the same thing again.Then suddenly a bad guy appears from nowhere and starts to stalk the people in the apartments across the way....... and you know you have seen this done better elsewhere.... thus punch in the words \\"REAR WINDOW\\" in the search box and do motion picture films justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"POSSIBLY THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE (Really)","review":"Don't listen to the other reviewers. This movie is a new low in cinema -- I don't care that it is violent or exploitative or anything like that -- it is simply dull, badly made, laughably written, and a complete waste of your time. The ONLY nice part is that Melanie Griffith is not yet the puffy drunk plastic surgery victim she now is -- so it is interesting to see for that aspect alone. But wow, this movie is a complete loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Pulp Movie Making!","review":"Great stuff that keeps the audience interested at all times. Can you say that about most movies? The plot is great, the acting is over the top, and the cinematography is fantastic. It has the feel of an 80s horror flick which means it doesn't take itself too seriously. It also feels like two movies in one. The first movie is sort of a voyeristic creepy movie with that 80s feel and the second half is a sordid mystery with that 80s feel. There's the 80s again! It's definitely worth a watch. Enjoy with a movie loving friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stumbling block","review":"Aside from anything else that is good or bad, routine or entertaining about this film, I can't be the only one who was completely unable to get past the fact that, in the big murder scene, both the hero and the victim act more stupefyingly idiotic than any characters in the lowest-grade teen slasher ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Which film did some of you people see?","review":"Because I KNOW you didn't see any amazing acting, incredible plot twists or X-rated sex scenes in Body Double. This film is watchable if nothing else is on; I'll give it that. But \\"gripping?\\" \\"DePalma's masterpiece?\\" \\"a classic?\\" Only if you took a LOT of drugs before you saw it.

Grubb associates the believer's authority, correctly in my mind, with his favorite topic, Christ in you the hope of Glory. His approach is explaining how his organization, Worldwide Evangelism Crusade, learned to receive answers to prayer.Grubb has become one of my favorite teachers, I'm a little surprised that I hadn't heard of him till recently, and this is one of his best books.Here's a quote: “We saw that they went much farther back than we did. They first discovered whether their prayer was God's will; then having received assurance on this point, they prayed, received by faith, persisted, declared things to come, with all the authority of God Himself.�?\\n2\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"States a Problem, But Offers No Solution","review":"The author is obviously a highly skilled pilot and has extensive experience. His recounting of the progress in the airline industry is very interesting. I bought the book expecting to read about progress in dealing with the problems encountered in adapting new technology and adjusting to the obviously over crowded skies. While the author states (over and over) that both are very real problems, he does not offer much in terms of what is being done to address the pilot's ever expanding workload. He seems merely intent on convincing the reader that the industry and the FAA are out to get the pilot. This book is not so much a study of human factors as a pilot's complaints about an industry that probably somehow just became something he no longer cared to be a part of."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those interested in the history of women and needlework, a must read","review":"Wow, I'm impressed with this book. Fascinating, well researched and detailed history of women and embroidery. This is a must read for anyone, especially women, who embroider as their primary artistic expression. As an artist who is working within this medium to excavate and reveal the living present of misogyny, this book has enriched my understanding of the work I do. Highly highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Ray Bryant/Prestige Fun.","review":"Ray Bryant takes a back seat on this horn-driven gem, but it's a pretty cool back seat.

I'm not sure the best way to do this author justice, actually. He has a bit of Beckettian absurdity, but also a Raymond Carver sense of the downtrodden. Putting the two together results in some idiosyncratic insights. I also appreciate that he seems to be a \\"geographical\\" writer. His short-short stories with titles like \\"Texas\\", \\"Kansas\\", South Carolina\\" evoke a sense of place that really doesn't need more than the 2 or 3 pages he takes to convey it. My favorite stories were the title story, \\"Mr. Irony\\" and \\"Wayne's Fate,\\" but the story \\"Texas\\" actually inspired me to write something of my own along the lines he set out. A must-read for any fiction writer as well as any reader who appreciates formal and linguistic play."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is CRAP!","review":"I totally agree with Erik John Dolnack's review below.Just got a copy of the DVD myself and I am very disappointed with the way the whole thing was done.Lousy packaging, terrible navigation system and amateurish video quality.DD's masterpieces deserves much better treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Menu concept.","review":"The Videos are worth 5 stars, as Duran Duran were one of the first acts to really capitalize on this medium. Sadly, they partnered with somebody stupid who felt that making the menus complex, and hiding videos as \\"easter eggs,\\" would be fun. It's not.

If you're looking for lots of great extras - don't bother. They really didn't need to take up two discs with as little as they give you.

I remember trying to tape all these old videos from MTV back in my Simon days. Of course, that was near-impossible because you never knew when they were going to come on. Well, I've outgrown the crush, but not the love of the music. Just watching these brings back all those old high school days; I can always picture the reactions of my like-minded Duranie friends during specific points in each video. If you're a former addict like me, you won't regret getting these. My only complaint is the explicit nature of some of the videos. Hey, I'm a Mom now and fast-forwarding through Girls on Film is a necessity. Otherwise, enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS COLLECTION SUCKS","review":"Here's why: the opening sequence to \\"A View To A Kill\\", has been removed! It is supposed to begin with Grace Jones leaping off the Eiffel Tower, but instead it starts instantly with the opening chords to the song itself - unacceptable! Also, no \\"Meet El Presidente\\", or \\"Violence Of Summer\\". Why didn't Duran Duran have the brains to make this an all-encompassing set to their great songs? Why not include all of their videos and hell, why not Arcadia and Power Station? I HATE this collection. \\"Rio\\" has NEVER looked worse - the colors are way oversaturated.

I give the collection 4 stars purely for the videos themselves--boy did they take me back! I was a little surprised at the 'uncensored' and quite explicit version of Girls on Film and Chauffer. But otherwise the videos are great! I agree that the navigation is completely confusing! Took me a solid 30 mins to figure out what I was doing. I was also a bit peeved that I couldn't read the liner notes, as they were printed white on white. What's up with that? Overall it was a great D2 reunion. Can't wait to share it with friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Navigation Should Come Undone!!!","review":"This would've gotten 5 stars if not for the title screen. The navigation screen is very poor, until you get used to it. The letters of \\"GREATEST\\" outline in purple as you push the arrow keys on your DVD Player remote. When you hit \\"Enter,\\" a list of different videos will appear, under that specific letter. Only certain letters have videos, so make sure you're paying close attention to what letter is outlined in the purple color.Videos are great, music is great, but who they hired to design the DVD is questionable. If you just want the music and don't care about the visual aspect, look for the Greatest Hits CD. If you're a die-hard Duran fan, all of the hits are here, with the videos. Only navigation will cause a headache. It'll take some adjusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great videos!","review":"It's about time! The true \\"vanguards\\" of music video have finally released the (almost) entire collection. The packaging alone gets 5 stars-as artful as you would expect from Duran Duran.My only (big) complaint is that the cd-rom content appears NOT to be compatible with Macs. If I am doing something wrong, please advise! It's hard to believe that in this day and age, someone would release a product that cannot be used for a Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great addition to your collection!!!","review":"The reason I did not give this 5 stars is because:a) I hate the white on white lettering but that is a personal preference not a slam against DD or the DVD itselfb) there are a lot of \\"hidden\\" features that the casual person may not know about.There is also MANY different verions of the vidoes and the songs themselves. That is why on this DVD you need to understand how to get the hidden features. For example there are 4 different version of \\"New Moon on Monday\\" on the video.My recommendation would be that you go to http://www.duranduran.com and go to the ASK KATY section and look for the info about the \\"Easter Eggs\\". If you can't find it there, then you should go into the Message Boards and search under the topics and search for \\"Greatest DVD\\".There are more videos that I would have liked to have seen on the video but I realize that there is a limit. I just wish they would re-release \\"Sing Blue Silver\\" and \\"As the Lights Go Down\\".Enjoy this I know that I am!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great collection! About time ...","review":"I was a Duranie as a teenager in the 80s and have followed the band since then. Frankly, I am blown away by the criticism posted by others here. Unless you're a die-hard fan, you're not going to shy away from this collection because it doesn't include some lesser-known videos/songs. Most people buying this want to have the favorites they remember from junior high years, I think.It had to be a very difficult task narrowing down Duran Duran's videos into one collection. However, I think they did a great job selecting the most popular videos and many that haven't seen airtime in decades (When was the last time Union of the Snake was on any of the MTV/VH1 channels?)."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"greatest\\" title for a greatest band","review":"This video is one hour and forty five minutes of pure pleasure for all Duran Duran's fans. Me and the band were born the same year, I am a huge french fan(what is not really developped in my country...) and thanks to Amazon to have allowed me to see some videos of the band I never had the chance to see before! Nevertheless, interactivity misses a lot, interactivity or perhaps two or three words from the band miss a lot! But every fan of the band have to own this video, and that's why I give you this advice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Using the \\"hidden easter eggs\\" to see the remaining videos is gimmicky and useless. If you're having trouble finding them, simply use the \\"Title\\" selection feature on your dvd player and enter each number one at a time to cycle through everything (the first disc has 38 titles). The picture quality is shoddy. It is ridiculous not to have included ALL of their videos. Be warned: the 30 minute interview, lyrics, etc. are DVD-ROM only. It would have been cool to have had the band offer commentary on these groundbreaking (at the time) clips, but nothing. What would have been welcome are the concert film, \\"Sing Blue Silver\\", and the concept film, \\"Arena\\". The 18 minute \\"New Moon On Monday\\" is a nice surprise. Otherwise, buy at your own risk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD!","review":"Great DVD! A must-have for any hardcore Duran Duran fan. Only drawback is it comes on two discs so when I'm watching it in bed, I have to get up and switch it out. :P Besides that, awesome DVD and LOTS of bonus material!

Happy listening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bilungual music","review":"One of the best bilingual albums for kids ever. One of our favorite songs is \\"Magnolia\\", a tribute to a dancing magnolia tree in the style of the Beatles' Sargent Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. The pronunciation and lyrics are authentic and will help teach Spanish to the kids. An album both the parents and the children can listen to and enjoy. Tish Hinojsa includes her own children's trumpet and violin skills and neighborhood choirs in a charming touch. Even the liner notes were fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great songs even if you don't speak Spanish!","review":"We don't know more than a handful of Spanish words in our household but this cd is one of our favorites.

What he fails to do is show Church-approved, or even Church-approvable apparition sites. True, he is working in the American apparition milieu where Church-approved apparition sites are few and far between; but reading this book, one might come away with the impression that Marian Apparitions are laughable, at best. For a more counterbalanced look at the phenomena read about Fatima, a fully Church approved apparition. For the truly skeptical, I recommend \\"Encountering Mary\\" by Sandra L. Zimdars-Swartz, a remarkable book which both believers and skeptics can appreciate. However, the book in question delivers nothing but snide commentary at a phenomena which has brought countless millions to a life of greater holiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre review of Neural Networks","review":"Besides grammatical mistakes and obvious errors in translation, the book doesn't delve deep into the places it promises, and concentrates on analogies that play to the lay-est of laymen rather than focusing on the actual data and theories of neural networks. Chapters on neuroplasticity and feedback are worthwhile, but the book quickly derails onto a scene of neuroscientific generalism, which seems to be the popular fad among most brain books today, which seem to pass around the same cache of information on L-Dopa, homunculi, and Aplysia to take up a good 25% of 75% of the books in print. Good for an introduction to neural nets and semantic networks, but not a valuable reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about models of the brain and psychiatry","review":"This is one of those precious books I love for their clarity and density of real information. The author is a psychiatrist and a neuromimetic model enthusiast who tries to communicate his enthusiasm to the reader.

The version on the Crossroads Box Set is not complete.Key To The Highway is another Gem that appears on this CD.This in my mind along with Crossroads are the two best songs on the collection.Have You Ever Loved A Woman is very strong, and remains one of his songs he does in Concert to this day.Bottle Of Red Wine is another outstanding effort.Little Wing is included along with Let It Rain which is one of his finest songs ever.What we have here is a recording of Clapton at that time.This CD is pretty much for people like me who are collectors."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE VERSION","review":"I purchased this cd when it was first released and was very excited about the extra tracks this version have over Derek And The Dominos In Concert which was released on cd in the Eighties. After playing it and comparing it to the original Derek And The Dominos In Concert cd I was majorly dissappointed. The mixing on Live at the Fillmore puts Clapton up front of the soundstage making his contribution to the cd stand out. As for the rest of the band they sound like they are playing a block away. The cd has become known to myself and my friends as \\"Eric and the Dominos\\".On the original In Concert cd the band is tight and Eric is where is suppose to be - in the band and not a soloist.The music is awesome but the mixing on Live at the FillmoreI really bad. If you are looking for a live version of Derek and the Dominos, pick up Derek and the Dominos In Concert.Even though there are less tracks this version highlights the Band and not the Clapton the Soloist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric and Duane","review":"For Peter. Your information is incorrect. The best solo's are all mainly Allman. Duane does the best guitar work on \\"Bell Bottom Blues,\\" continues with is slide solo's on \\"Key To the Highway\\" and is even better on the first solo in \\"Have You Ever Loved A Woman,\\" which is Allman\\"s slide followed up by Eric's solo and finishes up with Duane's second slide solo. Mindy is correct that the best solo's are from Duane Allman. Let this be credit to Eric's practice of letting others handle some of the limelight with out any jealopusy. \\"Live at the Fillmore\\" is a great album which would have been better had Duane been there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derek and the Dominos: Live at the Fillmore","review":"I bought this set because of the rave reviews that went with it. And, because I had this snatch of memory from when I was young that I had wanted to buy this. Truthfully everyone, it's a disappointment. I have listened to it several times and while there are certainly songs that I like, and this is Clapton without all of the \\"maturity\\", the harmonies are usually bad (just shy of awful in some cases), the music does go on and it does, in hindsight, seem that they are in love with the new wa-wa pedal, amongst other sound enhancers.I know, Clapton's God. But, I'm an agnostic. Slowhand is great, and the young years are better than most of the older years for originality, but it's not smooth, if that's what you need from a CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Boring, bloated, overlong, repetitive half-baked arrangements of Clapton classics made even worse by Bobby Whitlock's horrible, intrusive over-the-top \\"backup\\" singing.2 stars for some nice guitar solos and drummer Jim Gordon's amazing work, but it is not worth the 29 dollars. Better you should buy \\"Wheels Of Fire\\" or \\"Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert\\" or \\"Layla.\\"Pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, but did he play?","review":"I am listen this wonderful record some thirty years after attending the(Friday early) show, where this recording comes from (well the series of shows anyway).After exiting the Fillmore, being unable to hear from the incredible volume, I ran into a friend on the late show line and all he wanted to know was \\" did he play?\\" That was enough said, and the question most everybody going to the show wanted to know. I too have reservations he'd play pop songs and sing way more than play. Well as we all can hear, HE PLAYED! These performances are way more coherent than I remember. The playing is clean and inventive. Short of the Allman Brothers, and maybe a very good Santana release, this is likely one of the definitive live recordings from the Filmore, at least for me, and not to be missed.Now, I know they recorded the J.Geils band's closing Filmore sets, and this I'd also like to hear again!Larry"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine addition to the Clapton catalogue","review":"Eric Clapton, Bobby Whitlock, Carl Radle and Jim Gordon play some truly memorable live blues rock on this fine double album.Clapton may not have had too high an opinion of himself as a singer at this point (he seems more comfortable playing his guitar), and his vocals do sound strained at times. But he does his best to compensate with a number of lengthy solos, several riveting ones, some good ones, and a few dull, misguided ones, too.Most of these live cuts are a very welcome addition to the Clapton legacy, though, especially the superb take on Big Bill Broonzy's \\"Key To The Highway\\", the rocking \\"Bottle Of Red Wine\\" and \\"Blues Power\\" (nice boogie piano by Whitlock), and the eerie \\"Crossroads\\".I can't imagine anyone who is into early Eric Clapton not liking this fine album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This two-CD set is awesome overall, but the first 2 songs on the first CD stand out. Got to Get Better in a Little While is my all time favorite Clapton song, and Why Does Love Got to be So Sad makes it a great half-hour of Clapton at his best. Have you ever loved a woman and Little Wing are highlights on this excellent 2-CD set"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton in all his pain, and all his glory.","review":"I generally agree that the Allmans Live at the Fillmore is probably the greatest live rock recording ever, but...Can you think of a better kick-it-off song than Got To Get Better In A Little While? This is virtuosity, top to bottom. We all know the pain EC was going thru with drugs and his love for Patti Harrison, and we know it inspired his playing at the time. But listen to Bobby Whitlock on keyboards, listen to Carl Radle on bass, listen to Jim Gordon on drums. They followed Clapton wherever he went musically and made it all come together.I've seen the man live in the late 80s and early 90s, and on a lot of videos for benefits and the like...and I would think any Clapton fan would agree that he has NEVER matched the outright emotional playing he achieved during these Fillmore shows.SteveS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton is God","review":"I got this album out last night mindful of the fact that its coming up to 40 years since those ominus signs started to appear on the concrete walls of a sleepy London town Clapton is God. Its hard not to wonder what this was all about unless though you have heard this album.Clapton was was at his peak during this period and his development as a guitarist was complete. He played with ease during these sets his voice also matched the time.Truly an anthem that is capable of transporting one right back to where it all started. Certainly a place I expect to keep going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clapton not as God but as a guitarist","review":"Clapton's first stab as a lead singer and it shows. Many of the songs have Clapton singing with Bobby Whitlock as \\"backing\\" vocals. But I did not purchase this album for Clapton's singing abilities. Clapton's guitar skills are second to none and it shows in this album. My personal favorite is Presence Of The Lord where Eric's guitar playing is blistering and he seems to be more comfortable in his lead singer role. The eighteen minute Let It Rain was a bit long but takes nothing away from the rest of this exceptional album. Other highlights include Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad and Key To The Highway. This is a must have album for any Clapton fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Do not buy this CD if you are expecting originals!","review":"This CD may be OK; I didn't bother to listen to it.Nowhere in the description here did it mention that it's a live recording done in Atlanta Georga in 1980. It says that on the sleeve of the CD though. I wanted the original recordings that I know and love; not a concert \\"live\\" recording that isn't anywhere near what I was expecting. Why was this omitted from the description?All is not lost however. I took the sleeves out, and threw the CD in the trash along with them, so now I have a wonderful (but expensive) extra blank case to put a CD in that features music I want to hear because it's original, done in a proper studio, and up to par soundwise.Slogging this dog off as genuine recordings is reprehensible, and I suspect I'm not the only one to get the wrong end of this particular stick, according to the sales ranking Amazon posted regarding this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, not reliable kewboard","review":"This keyboard is a little spoiled.

I put them in smoothies and to add flavor to soups as well. This one I tasted cold and it tasted like squash, nothing artificial and the texture was perfect. Very smooth and creamy which is one thing that I really love about it. Another thing I love is it being organic and GMO free. These are packed with nutrition perfect for growing babies. I did notice however though when I heated it up the taste changed which I found to be strange. Heated up it tasted like spaghettio's which was kind of a turn off to me. I dont know how the babies feel but I am sure they wont know the difference. I think that I will stick to buying cascadian farms frozen winter squash. That has a better taste when heated up. But for smoothies and soups, possibly even to put in bread to moisten I will be purchasing this from Earths Best."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken, moldy, and wet INSIDE the packaged shipping box.","review":"I opened the mailed box which was completely in tact and normal. When I opened it, immediately a smell overcame the entire kitchen. I cut the plastic bubble wrap off of the box of squash and noticed it wet and MOLDY!

Why would they send something like this for a BABY. My son was premature 30 weeks and has an allergy to protein along with reflux...I cannot imagine!

It has a window in the front to insert an identification or business card. It also has an adjustable carrying strap. It seems well made and should last a long time.

The storyline is confusing, poorly written, seemingly unmotivated, and, even if you wanted to forgive it, unfairly depressing, even in the supposedly happy ending.HATED IT.I'm so mad, because the reviews overall were pretty good, but no, this is a train-wreck. A depressing and boring and confusing train-wreck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the limits of randomness, casualty and freewill?","review":"Through a simple story, there is a sudden twist of fate at the moment to get into an elevator instead of another. This apparently insignificance may generate by itself a completely different chain of events and circumstances that can delineate your destiny.Without major pretensions and rigorous conceptual schemes, the picture maintains an effervescent rhythm and adroit script that will hold to your seat, due its intriguing premise.Fine direction by Peter Howitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very intriguing, one of my all time favs","review":"I loved this movie this first, second, third.... time I saw it. The story is so original and keeps you guessing until the very end. It really lent me a new perspective on life and how things can change (for the better or for the worse). Although it is a \\"Chic flick\\" I think anybody would enjoy the message. Superb acting and very funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"You look at you life, &question if everthing is really true.","review":"It's a movie that allows you to see that how you spend every second of the day can really determine what your life is all bought.

If you ever have those \\"what if's\\" happen in your life, then this movie is for you. It shows you what happens when fate and destiny take over. It's an amazing movie for all!

It is a movie I could pop into the VCR and view repeatedly. Great wardrobe and hairstyle on Paltrow! The only minor bother was the cheating boyfriend's(Lynch) incessant, nervous breathing(I caught this on the second viewing). I began to gasp for air when he was in a scene and it made me tense. This detail shouldn't keep one from watching an otherwise entertaining film. Clever lines and John Hannah's character is a cutie in this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gwyneth Paltrow shines once (or twice) again!","review":"A great film that really shows off Ms. Paltrow's gift for comedy and a British accent. Not many actesses today would be able to pull off playing the same character in two completely different situations at the same time.Chalk this one up as one of Ms. Paltrow's greatest performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Did anyone seriously not see the end of the movie from the beginning? Super predictible. Paltrow seems to rarely impress. I generally am not - watching films in the romantic comedy genre - however I recognize when a movie is romantic or comedic. This film was neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sliding Doors","review":"The character were shallow and uninteresting. I found the premise of the movie not worth the effort to keep the side by side story lines in focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"My very favorite movie!","review":"Sliding Doors is a very human drama/comedy. I love this movie because it is so real. Gwenyth Paltrow gives what I would consider to be the best performance of her career to date in this film. The music, storyline, and beautiful scenery truly make this a movie for all romantics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ukkk!--Gag me with a spoon!!","review":"Gwyneth Paltrow has got to be the most over-rated actress of all time. This is not an exaggeration. Why do people say her English accent is so good? I thought it was so embarassingly phoney, I could barely stand watching her. She also acted like she was high or stoned throughout the whole movie. Also, all those close-ups showed what ugly skin and plain facial features she really has. Nobody else in this movie was good enough to offset her horrendous acting and appearance. Overall, this film is a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of all the dumb movies...","review":"Good grief. No offense meant to any parties involved in this movie but quite honestly I could not stand it. My best friend watched it while in labor with her first baby, and thus the only reason I gave this movie the measly one star is because it helped her get her mind off of the pain. Otherwise I would say do not even bother with it.It sickens me that people must see other people's messed up lives in order to call it a romance. The story is miserable (i.e. the circumstances in which we supposedly must have to see the parallel lives), I have seen better acting done by second graders, and overall the whole plot is miserable. God forbid we should have something happy in a romance movie. After all, what would a romance be without lies, unfaithfulness and pain? If that is your idea of a great romance, then go for it and waste your money. Otherwise if you must see it, rent it and save some money for a better movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie doesn't deserve any stars!

Thats the only reason this is getting 1 star.What were you thinking, Gwyneth? And John Hannah - How embarassing for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I rented this movie as per a friend's suggestion. Now, I give a suggestion to the rest of the world - rent something else. From the start of the movie, Gwneyth Paltrow's phoney English accent made me cringe. Her live in lover is played by such a stereotypical clod and the story unfolds in a very telling matter from the word go. The actor which portrays Gwneyth's new love was great in Four Weddings and A Funeral and his accent and character in this movie was wonderful as well. As for the rest - all I can say is blech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I found this film to be extremely boring.

Finally, 5 years later, I saw the DVD on-sale and bought it to watch it again. After finishing it, I thought about life again and all it's infinite possibilities of the what if's.I know it's a movie, but there are some parallel truth even to our universe.

It stars the surprisingly bad actress Gwyneth Paltrow, who has just about messed up every movie that she has been in. But this movie is so bad I don't think Gwyneth can take all the credit herself, the writer and the director must take their fair share, for this really bad movie. The only good thing that I can say about it is that Paltrow's accent is really quite good, to bad you can't say the same for her acting."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie was a delightful surprise.","review":"Normally I am not a Paltrow fan, but agreed to watch the film and was quite pleased that I did..

The whole idea of the film had me intrigued, and from the first minute I knew I was going to like it. Gwyenth Paltrow is almost amazing as Helen, who gets her life split in two parts apart missing a train.I rate Sliding Doors 8 out of 10. It is a devine and charming peice of film that almost any viewer will enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious!!!","review":"This has a good cast, the direction is okay, and it obviously had a decent budget too. Even the concept is interesting. However, the script is quite possibly the worst I have ever heard and it renders the movie virtually unwatchable. The characters are totally unbelievable, and quite frankly, irritating. I could not understand why she would want to be with either of those twats. So,without a hint of hyberbole, this is easily the worst film I have seen since Xanadu. I absolutely hated it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sliding doors very insightful! Love It!","review":"This is a movie that I first saw when it came out back in the 90's. I never forgot it because of the impact just a few seconds had on one persons' life. It really clarified for me the value of time. It is something most people take for granted, and yet it is the one thing we can't replace or get back. Great story. Gwyneth Paltrow is excellent in this movie! Worth seeing. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A FEW SYNAPTIC MISSES, BUT STILL A VERY ENJOYABLE COMEDY","review":"The concept of SLIDING DOORS is hardly new, but there is an attempt to freshen things up a bit here. The acting is good, the dialogue is often quite witty, but the mechanics of the film are a bit clumsy. Paltrow's character, Helen, seems at times to be a fairly intelligent woman, and at others more than a little cognitively impaired, and that did get in the way of the film. It's still quite fun, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Good Movie!*","review":"This movie really gets you thinking about how things might be different in your life if you had or hadn't done something.It made me wonder,if only.A movie not like any other.Watch it more than once!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book, but really","review":"this book is a fun read but one detail really bothers me.

The title and brief summary captured our attention then we felt let down by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Withstands the test of time","review":"The first time I listened to this (on cassette), I met a beautiful woman. Four years later, we gave copies of the record to everyone in our wedding party. Now our son has the cd. This is the album that introduced me to Big Joe Turner, and while I now own virtually recording he made, this is the disc that gets played the most, 25 years later. It's the best late-night album I know--not as background music, but to listen to the way you'd listen to old friends. The recording is intimate, and while it's true that Joe and the Count make it sound as if the music is theirs, when Joe says, \\"Come on, Count,\\" and \\"Make it church-y,\\" he's inviting us in."},{"rating":"2","title":"just as i thought.......awesome","review":"the CD was awesome just as i was told. it did not disapoint great buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good, not normal Chick lit","review":"Not Normal Chick Lit because it was a little variation on boy meets girl but the characters were wonderful. You could relate to them. It was a good Read. Good for vacations, plane rides, or when you want sweet read."},{"rating":"1","title":"so darn confused!!","review":"This book wasn't for me.I loved it at the start, but then she added at least the stories of three other characters and that confused me so darn much! I didn't feel the connection between Dev and Daisy as I did with other books. Another problem I have is that she has a lot of plot ideas that just fade out, and that really frustrated me.Dont get me wrong, some secondary character storylines can be good, but they have to be woven well together, where as this one seemed a bit random .I wouldn't recommend this to someone who was looking for a simple, heart-thudding, tummy turning romance. It was quite plain in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"good stuff","review":"This book is one of my favourites of all time. Ok so its not the great literary masterpiece of the 20th century but its such easy reading and its so well done. It reads like a movie, a really good romantic comedy. Its laugh out loud funny and is an escape from the realities of life for a few hours. I always read this when i'm in a bad mood. It never fails to cheer me up and make me laugh. My favourite Jill Mansell, though its not the first one I've read. In essence this is good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Story","review":"This is a great way to waste an afternoon or two, I love jill Mansell!

This was a fun, enjoyable read. I did think she focused more on the relationships of the supporting characters more than the main character but it's not a complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only life were like a Jill Mansell novel!!!","review":"I have been laid off for six months and do not think I'd have maintained my sanity if I did not have my Kindle. I tend to read very serious memoirs or novels about, oh, the Holocaust for example. And when I'm totally wrung out from reading that type of book I will go to Jill Mansell for relief! I love her books. Everything always works out in the end, people are always where they should be and with whom they should be. The characters are so quirky and lovable...the perfect antidote for some of the horrible realities of life. A perfect escape!! Staying at Daisy's was just such a book. Even Clarissa made me laugh (you have to read the book to find out who Clarissa is!) Thank you Jill!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming","review":"Good story from a great author. I am new to Jill Mansell, but I really like the two books I've read so far. And am loving the one I'm reading now. If you like Sophie Kinsella this is right up your alley. Though just a tad more serious, Jill Mansell's books go down like candy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivable","review":"This review is really for Amazon and it's supplier but the supplier of this DVD has forgotten to pack MAIN FEATURE. Yes, that means I've received bonus DVD only and what Amazon offer is refund. Ordering from outside US cost considerably more and I do feel cheated, yet there is nothing I can do about this but place order again and pay for shipping again, for no fault of my own. I am very disappointed to say the least. Please note, I didn't want to give any star for this but I had no choice but to give one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, but incorrect version sent","review":"Now, I love the Tales of the City series of books, and the DVDs are almost better. Further Tales of the City volume 2 is much darker than the previous episodes -- with more sexuality and less character. But still it was great to see another episode.What spoiled it, though, was the DVD I got was completely without any booklet. There had been one in previous episodes, so that was disappointing. But the worst thing was that the default subtitles were French and were on by default. So you had to actually switch them off. And also, not that it matters much, but there seems to be no English subtitles -- at least not when I checked.Was despatched from Germany rather than the US, so that could be why. But hey, I ordered it from the US so why isn't it a US English version? Very strange.However, it was great to see more Tales of the City. I only wish the other books were made into TV series too. Please, Armistead? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Further Tale of the City","review":"A very poor sequel to the original \\"Tales of the City\\" Poor production values, poor directing, and just a generally cheap imitation of the world of Barbary Lane. Many of the ororiginal characters have been recast, and aren't nearly up to par as the original players. Briam, Michael Mouse, and Mona have all been recast. Thank heavens Laura Linney and Olympia Dukakis repeat their roles as MaryAnne Singleton and Mrs. Madrigal, which saves the movie from total obscurity."},{"rating":"2","title":"So-so conclusion","review":"I did enjoy seeing my favourite movie characters again, but the whole Jonestown story seemed to be a bit unconvincing. Still, the cast are brilliant and it was a good way to finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where's Mona?","review":"I just LOVED this entire Series but for the life of me I cannot understand why he has left Mona out of the last enstallment having her relocating to Seattle. It just doesn't make sense especially after Mona finds her real Father/Mother to be her own landlady AND she also finds her grandmother, so why would she skip town? I know she was kinda flaky but it was odd with her not being there. Her old lover D'orthea ends up with DeDe and it was also odd that D'or doesn't even mention anything about her old pal Mona. Her ommission was greatly missed, especially at the end with Mary Ann and Brian's wedding. Despite this I am such a Fan and only wish there was more. I just can't get enough. This DVD and the others in the series are superb and was happy to see it's full unedited content. I had absolutely no problems whatsoever with the quality of the dvd and had no problems with \\"Freezing\\" or \\"Skipping\\". It ran smooth from start to finish. All three Sets are a MUST HAVE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly mastered DVD","review":"Four starts for the content. Zero stars for the DVD mastering.Perhaps it's because they tried to stuff more than three hours worth of material onto 1 DVD, but like others, I too was unable to play this all the way through on my DVD player. The problems start right about at the start of episode 4, and just keep getting worse. But perhaps it's just bad mastering, because I had the same problem with the second, extras, DVD, which isn't nearly so full. It's a shame such a wonderful series is marred by a badly mastered disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two Copies, Both Corrupted","review":"I loved the books, loved the first two miniseries. But I have so far ordered two copies of this version and both would not play. As Further is my very favorite of the books, I can't begin to express my disappointment.

Two words: Epic Fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on \\"Babycakes\\"","review":"I have watched and own all three \\"Tales of The City\\" mini-series and have watched them all repeatedly. While the first is by far my favorite (as others have mentioned, the casting for the first series was flawless), I love them all. In \\"Further Tales...\\" I do find the whole Jim Jones storyline a stretch, as I did with the book and I find that so much time is spent with Prue that I end up missing the rest of the 28 Barbary Lane characters. But, all in all, \\"Further Tales...\\" is certainly better than most of what you see on television and a delight. I'm more than ready for mini-series #4, \\"Babycakes\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story, Bad DVD","review":"I love Tales of the City and I wish they would reissue a DVD set that actually works. I can not even watch it to the end. Like others, the DVD starts to constantly freeze and I have a very good DVD player.

The first story (\\"The Fabulous Sinkhole\\") was witty and lighthearted, yet exposed the hidden realities of being in this world via the objects in and the subjects surrounding the sinkhole. The characters' voices sound as if they could live on your street; the dialogue is natural and lively. The rest of the stories in this collection follow the same formula as above but just get weirder and funnier. A great book for any young adult who doesn't like to read fiction, yet loves horror movies, comic books and stories about low-rider zombies returned from the dead to slash and burn cultural stereotypes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved all but the ending","review":"Mr Nabhan took us on an extrardinary journey through St Francis county. Entertaining and educating on each page. Then the big let down in the epilogue, as he rejects everything St Francis stood for.

The music is terribly boring, since there are really only two good melodies in the full two + hours of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Word: Lifeless","review":"I bought this version of Sunset Boulevard to compare it to the L.A. version, and I hate to be harsh, but if this was the quality of performance for the stage production, it's no wonder the musical bombed.The songs were absolutely dead. It sounded like the whole cast was on valium. Many of the best lines and bits were gone (Most missed was the \\"temple virgin\\" lyric). I was most disappointed with the talented Patti LuPone, who has been in the business too long not to know better than to turn in such a mediocre effort.My only reason for giving this recording a single star was the young lady portraying Betty: the sole cast member who seemed to be trying desperately to save the show.I'm sorry if my review is somewhat scathing, and I realize not everyone will agree with me; but if I'm going to pay close to $30 for anything, I expect results.My recommendation is that if you are interested in Sunset Boulevard, you get the L.A. version instead. In my opinion it is far superior to this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunset Boulevard (1993 original London Cast)","review":"Patti Lupone is brilliant in this recording - makes all subsequent Norma Desmonds seem very lightweight.All the excitement and enthusiasm of an original recording is contained within."},{"rating":"2","title":"Golden \\"Sunset\\"","review":"With the revival of \\"Sunset Blvd.\\" making it's way through London, and prominent talk once again of making a movie of this musical, I thought it was time to revist \\"Sunset Blvd.\\", by way of its soundtracks. The 'World Premiere' recording is, by far, the best. LuPone can send chills down your spine with her magnificent vocals; drawing her audience into the fantasy world that defines Norma Desmond, without losing her importance or reducing her to 'comic relief'. Her supporting cast can hold their own against her, with a stand-out performance by Anderson, who brings the right ammount of innocence and deviousness (with a touch of wit and sarcasm) to his vocal performance. The only flaw is the edited version of the soundtrack. Unlike its American Premiere counterpart, the songs are not sung in their full length, while most of the dialogue has been scrapped , giving the sense that the whole project was rushed through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patti & Kevin - A dream come true","review":"I saw the Show in London with Patti & Kevin in the lead and I was thrilled to realise that their perfomance on the CD equal their live performance.

Patti LaPone is the ultimate Broadway star, having created the role of Evita. Her soaring versions of \\"As If We Never Said Goodbye\\", and \\"With One Look\\" are unmatched. Her power and vocal range soar! All of Norma's songs had to be drastically reduced in vocal range to accomodate Glen Close's lack of, (or nonexistent) singing ability. In fact, this DVD was unavailabe to the American market during the American run of the musical and was literally pulled from the shelves. Perhaps ALW didn't want the American audience to hear the masterwork of this production. Kevin Anderson, a brilliant actor, does not have the operatic quality of Alan Cambell in the U.S. cast, but he portrayed Joe Gillis with far more guts and passion. This is not for the lover's of Oklahoma of Showboat, but for lovers of more contemporary musicals, this one is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Essential for the Musicologist","review":"Though Blacking is sometimes given to high-minded philosophizing about man's innate musical nature, \\"How Musical is Man?\\" provides an important counter-argument to Western notions of musical ability and musicality.

Its unbriphilous director, Norman Jewison, seemed to try his best to make something of what he had to work with, but even a talent-oozing cast and a picturesque setting couldn't do much to deliver on what had sounded to me like an intriguing tale. Oh, well, maybe other people saw the emperor's clothes but I just saw his doodle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure in many respects","review":"Jane Fonda, whom I respect highly as an actress, cannot save this dud. Neither the score nor the cinematography is memorable. Many scenes revolve around the fact that Dr. Livingstone is a smoker, which is a very flimsy hook upon which to hang a film. This film did not hold my interest--at several points I was consciously bored and had to exert will-power to finish watching it. Moreover, the views of psychiatric practice and hypnosis are wholly unrealistic. It seems this film could not decide what to be, and certainly lacked the courage to demythologize its subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adaptation worth Seeing","review":"Agnes of God is an adaptation of the hit Broadway play from the 1970's. The film follows a two act structure, that alternates between scenes with Agnes and Mother Superior, and asides to the audience. The film tells the story of a court appointed psychiatrist that is assigned to investigate a suspect in a murder. The catch is that the murder occured inside a monastary and was committed by a youn nun named Agnes- that claims that she is pregnant through immaculate conception. The strongest part of the film was Jane Fonda's performance. The writing in the first act is very solid, and makes it clear that even though the psychiatrist is on an outward mission to discover teh truth about Agnes, the journey ends up beign about herself. The film loses some ground in the second act (which was a problem with the play as well). However, definetely an adaptation that is thought-provoking...in the same spirit as Oedipus Rex and Equus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange !!!","review":"For a novel about a very dirty, ugly conflict in WWII - this book is strangely woven with a humorous thread.

The last two characteristics make the book a little frustrating to read: Smith will not name names or criticize his former players or coaches, though if you are fan of Carolina basketball you will know the names to fill into the anecdotes and incidents he describes (e.g. J.R. Reid's suspension from the 1989 ACC tournament semifinal for missing curfew.) Nevertheless, it is far better than most other sports memoirs (i.e. he actually had a life off the court)and should broadly appeal to people not especially interested in basketball in general or Carolina in particular."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is the best book that I have ever read!

I'll take Bobby Knight throwing chairs and tantrums anyday. However, if you're from Carolina or a UNC alum, ignore this review and buy the book right away. You'll never notice the shortcomings.

The characters feel like caricatures fumbling around each other with never the right words for the situation they find themselves in. Most of the book is composed of awkward dialogue, with the characters either being too polite or too aggressive. Yes, Smith is trying to convey how different people of different backgrounds clash yet still try to get along, but for the reader's sake, it would have been nice to have a little more flow to the book. The book should have been titled _On Social Anxiety: When People Who Are Different Interact_, because that is its major theme. The thing is, we don't need a reminder of how different we all are. We're living that every day. We don't need to read a novel to realize that.Lastly, I don't know what all those positive newspaper reviews were reading, but this book was not funny -- at all. I didn't laugh a single time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly White Teeth","review":"I found this book lengthy, depressing, and the characters incredibly unlikeable. Smith infused White Teeth with humor and characters, that although flawed were always relateable. On Beauty is just not another White Teeth, and I did not like it at all nor did anyone else I know who enjoyed her debut novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely OK","review":"This is not a great book. Certainly don't rush to buy it on hard cover. The plot is somewhat disheveled, although some of the characters are well drawn. The most annoying thing about it is that Smith fails to understand and hence accurately render the African-American adolescents she depicts. Their language sounds constructed and forced. The prose also gets profuse at times. I don't recommend it. Buy Ishiguro's book, _Never Let Me Go_ instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-hyped","review":"I rushed out to buy this book based upon the terrific reviews it received, especially from the New York Times (both Sunday and daily editions). And I loved White Teeth. But this book absolutely made me cringe. I must admit I was unable to get past the first 150 pages. To get that far required a major amount of willpower... I kept waiting for it to get better, which it didn't.The portraits are so self-conscious and false. Not a single character rang even halfway true to me. And the dialogue...so phony that the author's not especially skilled hand, was evident everywhere. If the author thinks she understands the United States, even New England...she is wrong. One year at the Radcliffe Institute does not, obviously, an expert make.An homage to Forster's Howard End...I think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Just don't bother.It's seldom I quit reading a book I've started, but I wish I had quit trying on this one.Cartoon characters, no depth. Plot? Are you joking?Don't bother, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"Regrets","review":"I really regret that I actually brought the book, If you want to read it I suggest getting it from the library but even then I wouldn't waste my time, the book has some moments but all the characters are very flat and one-dimentional. Also they were very unbelievable and I couldn't warm to any of them and I don't know why this book is so long Smith could have cut the story in half and it would have still had the same effect- emptiness. Overall I found the book shallow and too try hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"This book was beautifully written and flawless if you ask me. It felt so real, as though it was a simple story that could happen anywhere rather than an orchestrated plot. I really enjoyed it more than White Teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down..I couldn't even finish the book!","review":"After the excellence of white teeth, this is a poor effort. First I don't think the author should try to write a book based on life in America because she clearly does not understand it. I don't know the basis of her research and I don't want to paint with a broad brush BUT, the children of academics and most middle-upper middle class black and well read people do not speak \\"ebonics\\". Most cannot even relate to the characters she miserably attempts to portray. I did not buy into the story or any of the characters. After a few chapters, I found myself annoyed by the baseless story, lame dialogue between the family members. I hope the author goes back to what she knows and does best - stories of characters based in England. Glad I didn't pay for this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad i had to give up after just 50 or so pages","review":"I cannot believe this book was nominated for a prize. I had to leave this book after giving it a few chances - it was just babbling and pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended for the writing alone","review":"This novel is a slice of several cultures I have little experience with: East Coast black urbanites, Ivy League university life, mixed-race families, London, art history and beat poetry. Many have criticized the story for its inauthentic dialogue and slow pacing. I can't speak for the dialogue except the words sound true to me though I do understand why others had problems with it. The apparent slower pacing worked well, I thought, because the prose was much more introspective. This book allows you to immerse yourself in each scene and each exchange of dialogue, and the added commentary is more like our own loose reflections on daily life, which give it a realism that others might find slow or irrelevant."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Boredom","review":"This was the first book I read by Zadie Smith. The hype around this young author and the mixed feelings reflected and expressed by most reviewers triggered my curiosity. So I started reading it with a sense of anticipation, however I was disappointed almost immediately.I think the story and all the characters in it are poorly developed. I always finish a book that I've started, even when I don't like it much, but I must admit that this was the first time ever that I really struggled to get to the end, it was so boring it often became soporific. It was a relief to turn the last page.On a more positive note, I do believe that the prose was very good and the style original. That's the only reason why I gave it 1 star. And that's also the reason why I'm going to give this author a second chance and shall read White Teeth soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced and Unbelievable","review":"The characters felt fake and forced. I think the author harped too much on ethnicity. It didnt seem to be a major them, but he just kept going about it. Also it really failed to keep my attention. There was really no point to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for the hype.","review":"From the accompanying reviews, I'm glad to see that I'm not the only person \\"On Beauty\\" left cold. The starred reviews! The alleged play on \\"Howard's End\\"! What are these reviewers falling for? The book did not engage me and I couldn't be bothered to finish. If the novel had been set in England, Zadie Smith might have better understood the types she was writing about. As it is, little rings true in \\"On Beauty\\". Ignore the fuss and read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"The story is weak and the characters meaningless. I never reached a point where I could relate to or sympathize with any of the characters. The story never really developed, it just seemed to wander without direction. Though Smith made a worthy effort to tie together multiple social issues, inter-racial relationships, contrasting classes and personal family/spousal conflict, she failed in the end. The book falls flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty dull","review":"i am very disappointed in this book. after all the rave reviews i read i was expecting much more. its just rather dull. the language is stilted so it sometimes hard to figure out what they are talking about. the characters are rather flat and the \\"plot\\" is just not intereting. i loved white teeth but could not get through her 2nd novel. i am barely making it through this and going to the book often feels like a chore that needs to be completed. she is clearly a gifted and intelligent person but with regard to this book ... \\"there is just no there, there\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughter and Sweet Sadness","review":"I liked this book very much. The author has an ear for dialogue that rings true in the American family and for the particular characters. There is great laughter at the beginning, a keen eye for interior reflection that is honest and insightful about cultural identity, and a movement toward the ultimate sweet sadness of their situation. I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging and thoughtful","review":"This novel condenses a variety of philosophies (and warnings) about how our culture values beauty, and considers what we are willing to trade to be close to it. I really enjoyed this novel -- the characters are complicated and interesting, and it was easy to be sympathetic too, yet disappointed in the characters. I thought the writing was impressive, as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Beauty","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. I had heard such rave reviews but it definitely was a book I struggled through and only finished since I bought it new and kept thinking I would find something redeeming in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good At All","review":"I can't believe this book got any good reviews. It is just plain awful. It looks like something that went from first draft to publishing with no editorial review in between. Her characterization of Americans and American speech patterns is ridiculous and quite annoying. Her American characters are caricatures -- for example why is Kiki obese? Oh, because women of color just get obese when they get older, no reason, no explanation, no delving into her character to understand why a sexy, happily-married woman would just balloon up to an unhealthy fatness. I really loved White Teeth. Ms. Smith should stick to writing about English people and their ways, and leave us alone.Finally, many of the newspaper reviewers talked about Howard's End and how it's such a reflection on it, etc. I didn't read Howards' End, so sorry, if that is what it takes to appreciate the book, than there should be something on the cover that says, \\"make sure you read Howard's End first.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"one star too many","review":"This claptrap would have never been published had the author not been black and female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"Truly, I wanted to read this book. I tend toward more non-fiction and had asked my manager at work for a recommendation - she passed along this book. I found it difficult to get into - though I did like some of the characterizations (ie, fall leaving and slamming the door on the way out) - it just overall seemed like her writing wasn't very well integrated - in terms of the style(s) of writing in the book and the uneven development of characters.I found the way the characters spoke to be distractingly unnatural - and found found the oblique physical descriptions of people (explicit for some characters, almost soft porn - and very vague for others) difficult to hook into. The drama and the sub plots - just not all worked out very well and in the end - not that interesting. I forced myself to finish it in the hopes it would improve - not sure I would bother with another of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't have been published if she were not already famous.","review":"Zadie Smith has talent, but this book is lacking as a novel and would not have been published if the same work was delivered by an unknown author. The lack of a story is pathetic. The character development is rather good, but there's literally no story, beyond reading about a sad family going through a hard time. Do not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"has potential","review":"Why did Howard and Kiki ever get married? How did all of their children go such different ways? Why, after 443 pages, do I not know or care? Zadie Smith has written some beautiful passages, surrounded by flat characters. Phew, and not to mention the unending snippets of sociopolitical commentary she drags us through without ever getting to a point, or a compelling concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did I just read that?","review":"DID I JUST READ THAT?Is what I kept saying to myself while reading this absolutely deliciously written book by Zadie Smith. Her characters are all bold and probably a little larger than life. Her dialogue is so witty and gritty. Her plot emerges slowly through these peoples' lives but it nevertheless moves. A terrific story about quirky people living in our time. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth reading","review":"I enjoyed On Beauty. It is a book set mostly in upper middle class academia with some forays into lower class life. The depiction of life in academia with all the infighting is very well done. There is a dynamic between liberal and conservative philosophies that I would have liked to see more of. A lot happens in this book. There is marriage trouble, a depiction of the life of a up and coming street artist and student life at a fictional school that is modelled after the Ivy Leagues. Although I enjoyed this book I found it to be uneven. For example the disintegration and perhaps resurgence of the marriage is very interesting but the life of Carl and his conclusions about the world of academia are difficult to believe in. However, this is a minor complaint about an overall enjoyable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite and self indulgent","review":"Our book club read it with disbelief and puzzlement: why the universal critical acclaim? The writing is stilted, the story tedious and plot absurd: all in all I couldn't care too much about any of the characters. If anything, it is similar to her meandering horrible first book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is excellent. Well written, engaging and enthralling-- I couldn't put it down. Left me with many new perspectives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes, but...","review":"After hearing several people suggest that this was indeed a good book, I made the purchase. This certainly wasn't one of the worst books I have ever read, but it is certainly very poorly written. As you read chapter after chapter, you are left wondering why exactly you are reading this book in the first place. I can't say I have ever read any other of Zadie Smith's works, but throughout the entire book, I couldn't help but feel like a 13-14 year old decided to write a book. You wanted to like the characters and find something interesting, but the book never delivers. I certainly regret making the purchase instead of borrowing the book from a friend or the library. If you are truly interested in reading this book, don't let me discourage you, but do not BUY the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Boring","review":"It was just that dry and boring I never really connected with any of the characters, I gave up reading about 3/4ths of the way through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black America? Southern?","review":"Other reviewers have covered most of what I consider problematic about this book. What bothered me most was that Kiki is a black, Southern woman with absolutely no connection to any black Southern woman I've known or seen. Other reviewers have criticized Smith for her inauthentic dialogue. The inauthenticity extends beyond the dialogue. Smith knows little to nothing about black Southerners. Her description of \\"soul food,\\" in the book is unrecognizable to any \\"soul food\\" emanating from the South. When she has Kiki reverting to her Southern roots, her dialogue, culture, etc. are markedly more Caribbean instead of Southern. The Belsey children speak slang that is Caribbean, not Southern. To some, this may be a minor point, but since Kiki's Florida roots are a central part of her character, that they weren't authentic is troubling.A sabbatical in New England does not make Smith an authority able to accurately critique American culture, especially black-American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was hugely disappointed with \\"On Beauty\\" after being blown away with Smith's debut \\"White Teeth\\". I was certain that she was the UK's new wunderkind.Many of the storylines lagged with soggy prose and inconsistent characterisation. Who are these people? We get to the end of this book not really knowing the essence of these characters. Too many of the characters are unlikeable. Not helpful for one who is desperately trying to like a book.I was also concerned with the amount of typos. I am a shameless stickler when it comes to this and was horrified to find so many mistakes. Where were the editors?It's not all bad, though. There are some beautifully written and hilarious moments throughout this book. The overall picture for me, however, was that of a boring effort and one which did not deserve to be shortlisted for the 2005 Man Booker Prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After having read \\"White Teeth\\" a few years ago, I was anticipating another novel of similar caliber. What a disappointment!While she acknowledges up front that it is written as an hommage to E.M. Forster- the storyline is needlessly convoluted in order to mirror the plot of \\"Howard's End\\". What's worse are the underdeveloped, frustratingly shallow and across the board uninteresting characters- at the end of the book the reader doesn't particularly care what happens to any of them. I gather the intent was to examine personal relationships through the lens of larger scale issues of class, race, gender and aesthetic- but to say that she falls short is a gross understatement. It just feels so contrived- the dialogue- the meandering plot- the lifeless characters- all of it. This is definitely not a novel that will transport you into the story. It was a complete waste of time to read (I am kicking myslf for buying it in hardback)-and such a let-down after having read Ms. Smith's other work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Lacking","review":"Zadie Smith may have bitten off more than she can chew with \\"On Beauty.\\" An examination of families, academia, race, class, infidelity, truth, and, ostensibly, beauty, the novel is wide ranging yet lacks a cohesive center. Smith relies heavily on dialogue that is unrealistic, clunky, and detracts from both the narrative threads and character development. Her grasps of American English is tenuous at best, especially her portrayal of \\"street\\" talk and even her use of academic language. Furthermore, her characters' voices lack consistency and constantly contradict themselves in tone and cadence. That said, the plot is fairly engaging, in particular the story line that follows Harold Belsey through a mid-life crisis. Perhaps in the future Smith should stick to a world that she knows and understands, as well as employ an adequate copy editor. For an intelligent and witty look at academic life and marital relationships, I heartily recommend Richard Russo's \\"Straight Man.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I don't like to put a book down, and the only reason I didn't toss this one aside is because it was a gift. What is all the hype about? The characters were stereotypical, and worse, even after 100 pages into the book, I couldn't have cared less about what happened to any of them. The author is far too judgemental of her characters. She forced her judgement of them so much on the reader that I was almost inclined to root for the ones she didn't like. But like I said, I couldn't bring myself to care for any of them. The author inserts too much of herself and her opinions into the book, thereby beating the reader over the head with her viewpoints about race, academia, culture, and family life. A superb author can win a reader over to his/her viewpoint in such a subtle way that the reader does not even know that he/she is being pulled in a certain direction. This author clearly prefers a crass sledgehammer approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where was Ms Smith's editor?","review":"First, this book is self indulgently long - her editor must have been afraid to ask her to cut some of the more boing bits. Second, the proofreader must have fallen asleep from the dullness - here are two examples of silly errors that should have been caught before going to press:p. 266 \\"specialist boutique that might have the cane with the carved handle which that Carlene had in mind.\\" - obviously, ms smith didn't know whether to use \\"which\\" or \\"that\\" so put both in!p. 287 \\"to laugh at the expensive pretension of bussing down Kingsmen\\" - look it up, please, \\"bussing\\" means \\"kissing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms Smith is Overated--Confusing Read","review":"This book was selected for my book club group. We gave it a grade overall of D. Ms Smith is overrated. I do not understand why critics are raving about her. Her writing was confusing. She does not fully develop her characters or explain the story. The character Jerome was in love with Victoria but were never explained how this came about and why it fell apart. Her use of English (American) language was crazy. She should have written about her home instead of a place she apparently does not understand or know how to write about. She never fully explains the feud of two main characters, Howard and Kipps. People who were minor characters became major players with no real purpose to the story. It was onfusing, overdone and not that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Beauty","review":"I did recieve this book. I did not order this book.

As did many reviewers, I enjoyed White Teeth for the author's brash, audacious style (with certain reservations). This review should be rated in yawns not stars- she is an author with prodigiously interesting images but who really struggles when it comes to investing her own heart into characters and plotlines. Too clever for her own good and the reliance on Howard's End is a misstep.

A poor tree gave it's life for this book and to say nothing of all the man hours that went into writing this junk. Dont buy this book save your money. Nothing rings true of the book. It was like she was writing about a group of people she had heard about but never met. About places she had read a little about but never visited.

Have only read On Beauty as I always try and read the Booker shortlist and how this novel can be nominated,let alone shortlisted is beyond me. Again it just seems to be a raving mess. I really want to like this author - she interviews well, is very beautiful, I definately admire her, but if this wins over Arthur and George and Never let me Go there is something seriously wrong ( although last years winner was rubbish too!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Write about what you know","review":"Zadie Smith knows little about life in a small liberal arts school in Massachusetts. After all, she is not even American and it appears that she has done little research on this subject matter. Characters did not seem realistic or believable. It seemed to me that she or her publisher wanted to market the book to an American audience so she made the book take place in the US, but that subject is not her expertise.I understand that this book was nominated for the Booker - I am starting to lose respect for the prize. It is not even well written. There is much better fiction out there - skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better under the original title: Howard's End","review":"As gifted a writer as Zadie Smith is, she disappoints in \\"On Beauty\\". Lifting a novel's entire structure from E.M Forster is not an \\"homage\\" - it is plagiarism. Translating another author's plot into present-day idiom is, at best, a sophomoric exercise. I expected better from this talented author.Do yourself a favor and ignore the hype that surrounds this book. Read the work in its original form, E.M. Forster's \\"Howard End\\".

Excuse me - while there are two hilarious scenes regarding academia (Zora's blackmail of the dean to gain admission to a class and a university faculty meeting) and one truly sad scene when an older faculty member goes back to visit his working class dad, there is nothing else to recommend reading 400+ pages about basically uninteresting, sometimes nasty folks - no matter what their color.

I finish most books and even picked this book up for the second time to give it a chance but I just don't have the patience to continue when there are so many good books I still have not read. Once again, I should have read the reviews on the jacket more carefully and I would have realized they were for her last book and none were for this book, always a dead giveaway.

It's a trap a lot of English people new to America fall into and it is jarring.The story is just a ghastly rehash of the usual academics-are-god type that has been written countless times, and it is done without gusto. There is a smugness to the tone of the writing that is also unattractive.

The story is weak, a reincarnated ghost of a good guy in the hood appears on the scene to take out all the gangsters involved in the burning of a church that had children in it(Pinch Me). The script is shook. No gore, just murder scenes that look like this film was pulled off by a highschool drama club with no props. You know how you rent a movie knowing someone wrote a bad review about it and you get it anyway, that was me (Dont make my mistake). Support Ice, Snoop, Joe and Pun but not with this one.

Well, not even the D-O double G's appearance in the film could make it worth watching. Bad acting, terrible camera work, and a nonexistent plot all contribute to the overall worthlessness of the film. Some parts of the film are funny because they are so poorly done-- example: Big Pun portrays a \\"gang boss\\", but he's still wearing a Big Pun T-shirt, and he always looks straight at the camera, obviously reading cue cards. If you see a copy of this, may God forbid your buying of it.

It is true, as others have noticed, that the author may be getting old. Where before, when my first impulse was \\"nobody talks that way\\" I could remind myself that English is not my native language and America not my home, in this book many dialogs are clearly contrived. Nevertheless, the thing that matters is how much Michener managed to put into them, and believe me, he still does.A point noone else commented on: The whole book, from beginning to end, is a royal slagging off of the one profession I despise most. So if you happen to be a lawyer, it may be you will not enjoy the book as much as I did - but especially then I recommend you to read it and try to take it to heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kept waiting for it to get better....","review":"\\"Recessional\\" was alot like the salad bar served nightly at \\"The Palms\\" - lots of choices with very little quality. I got the distinct impression that the story line of this shallow novel was only a vehicle for Michener's pontifications on subjects as diverse as Aids, Race Relations and Aging. There was very little character development, so it was difficult to care about any one in particular. But the biggest problem I had was the inattention to detail; detail which has made earlier Michener novels so captivating and entertaining. There are few Michener books I haven't read, so it it hard for me to suggest, but perhaps it is time for Mr. Michener to pack up his typewriter and enjoy the company of his peers in a \\"Palms\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed Michener Fan","review":"I have read and enjoyed nearly all James Michener's books so when I found \\"Recesional\\" at a flea market I thought I was in for yet another good read. I finished this book only because I felt compelled to say I read it through. The book is way below Michener's usual attention to detail, has a sappy storyline, several blatant inaccuracies and a reference to a \\"retard\\" I found disturbing for an author of this caliber. Definitely one for the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"agree with Kirkus","review":"The Kirkus review says it all. I wonder if Michener did more than preside over this book rather than write it himself. It seems driven by research his staff has unearthed about retirement homes, death and diseases.

It would get little attention if his name wasn't on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dud","review":"This is a book your boring granddaddy might have written.

I figured for $25 it would be a good case. It is worth about 10 bucks. One, it is not padded very well, and two, it only closes with a snap button, which makes it easy for someone to pop open, especially if you attach it to a belt-something to consider if you travel a lot. Anyway, I went to Best Buy and bought a nice padded case that fit the camera almost perfectly for $8.99, and has an interior pocket for an extra battery or mem. card. I suppose it is stylish, but the utility to cost ratio is not very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"Having watched this movie four times and being TIG fan, I still feel that the movie was unconvincing, poorly written, very raw in too many episodes.

He plays the piano relatively well and is faithful to his girlfriend. What else would a girl want to see in a movie?"},{"rating":"1","title":"An average film, but nothing special","review":"Thomas Griffin acts as a kind of Van Damme in this film, it's like a low-budget version of Hard target except not nearly as good ( because no Van-Damme or John Woo ). I am a fan of martial arts pictures and like most american karate films this one is poorly choreographed. Ok Griffin has cool moves ... . The only reason that I wanted to watch this was of Lance Henrikson as he is such a great villian ( see Hard target ). Overall an average film with about 5 kickiboxing scenes along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna see the tough guy!","review":"After his partner is tortured and killed, Terry decides enough is enough. For a rather [inexpensive] movie \\"Excessive Force\\" is awesome: Great cast, Great fight scenes, and some Great lines. Thomas Ian Griffith never took off as the action hero of the 90's, but with other memorable roles in Karate Kid 3 & Vampires, he proves he's not just another Perfect Weapon, or Stone Cold. If you like the kind of action flick that is usually on [a pay channel] around 3:00 AM, then check out \\"Excessive Force\\", you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good film despite flair for the melodramatic","review":"I enjoyed this film about a son who returns to Cuba in search of his mother, whom he's been separated from for over thirty years. Although the film is at times overly dramatic and plays like a soap opera, you still find yourself absorbed in the search. This is a road film and, as such, takes us on a journey. The shots of the Cuban villages and countryside are reason enough to watch.The ending is predictable, but that's okay because we like this kind of predictability. My only criticism is that the director could have handled it better. Basically, it was abrupt and lacked the required intimacy. Otherwise, a warm, heart-felt film with an incredible performance by Isabel Santos. Her performance is evocative of Lena Olin's in \\"The Unbearable Lightness of Being.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ideal Character for Suzanne Pleshette","review":"I thought Suzanne Pleshette was just wonderful in this movie. She is a Police Captain and she is assigned to clean up a station with a lot of corrupt cops. She is tough, but fair. Suzanne Pleshette is so pretty and classy, I really enjoyed it. This role just fits her so well. Even though she had to be hard as nails at times, she still had a sense of humor and she really became emotional at times due to the sadness of so much corruption. It is an excellent movie, the only thing I would have liked to have seen more of is her husband. I wish they would have spent a little more time on her relationship with him, but other than that it was great. If you are a fan of Suzanne Pleshette's this is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This is a very basic basket that works wonderful.

This not so much, when i looked at it right out of the box it looked very flimsy especially the clips on the bottom of the basket. Its first test was a 100 mile 2 day trip where we were hit with rain for two days straight, any exposed unpainted metal rusted in a day and i live in the high desert not by the ocean. Then on the second day i put a small nalgene and my set of rain gear in and the clip that holds the support leg to the basket broke and I had to fix it with some bailing wire and tape.

I have a bike with a quick-release front wheel, so I had to mount with the alternate hole in the support bar.

It's less bulky, and still holds quite a bit (of course not as much as a basket for the back!), but the legs that came with it can't be used with quick release front tires, which wasn't mentioned in the product description, and if it was, it's pretty hidden! you can buy special attachments at \\"your local bike shop\\" - so say the instructions, but i haven't bothered - part of the reason I bought it was because it was inexpensive. But even without the legs, it functions just fine, probably a little rattlier than it would have been with them, but it doesn't fall on the tire or anything.Overall, I'm a little disappointed, but with the selection I've seen, I'd honestly still buy this one again."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate description","review":"I just received this product. It is sturdy and should suffice; attaching leg struts to basket was quick and simple, and the handlebar brackets are just fine. The problem is that nowhere in the description does it specify that it only works for a particular type of front wheel hub. There is no warning about not fitting a \\"quick-release\\" assembly, or requiring a different type of hardware for that. Either make it clear that the basket will not work for certain types of front wheel assemblies, OR be kind enough to supply the alternative hardware and alternative instructions.

You have to remember the typical range of a bluetooth connection is only about 12-15m, no matter what devices you use. Contrary to other reviews, I have also paired these with a device that does not allow you to add a passkey code. Battery life is excellent, even after years of use. Headphones have held up well, but the head band (the part that goes over the top of your head) is not the most comfortable. Get these and get yourself free of those wires!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I use this headset for gaming on my PC.","review":"Overall I am satisfied with these headphones, but the lag is very bad for gaming. I have tried different sound cards, settings etc. But there is always a lag that seems to range from 1-2 seconds. The bluetooth \\"dongle\\" that you use to connect seems to have an impact on this because I have tried 3 and depending on the drivers, reduced the lag. I have also tried this same setup with a Jabra and these headphones perform much better.A huge drawback for Gaming is that you can't get the HD Audio (Stereo) if you want to use the Mic! This kills me. I can't listen to the audio of my game in Stereo if I want to be able to talk on the mic for voice communication with someone while I play. As far as I know this is the most expensive bluetooth headset like this out there. It's also the newest bluetooth standard I beleive. I find this very disappointing considering I can't find any non bluetooth options out there and this is the latest and greatest..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool product Poor quality 590A","review":"My initial impression was the sound quality was good but the workmanship was cheap. The cheapness was confirmed after about a month when the headphones stopped working and stopped taking a charge. Additionally, when speaking with Plantronics support I noticed a small crack on the union between the headband and the right earphone. Now, these headphones were never dropped and handled delicated since day one due to the noticably cheap quality.On the positive side Plantronics support seems first rate, the reason for the second star. Plantronics must be well aware of the problem because they went straight to processing a return. They are shipping me out a new unit in advance of me sending the old pair back. a much appreciated CS touch. hopfully the new batch has these issues fixed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product!!","review":"I've had my pair for four months now they look great and the sound isn't bad overall. But that's where it ends. My pair died and would not recharge and the hinges developed cracks since it has plastic hinges with steel pins holding them together. My friends pair also has cracks in his hinges and i am talking about 2 to 3 cracks. I sent them in and they told me that I should not keep them on the stand when not in use, Isn't that what the stand is for????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even think of using these for VOIP","review":"I bought these thinking I could use them for both Skype and my cell. Connects and works fine for cell use (although the annoying blue light flash needs to go). But this headset does NOT work for Skype and Plantronics is clear (AFTER you buy the headset, nowhere is this mentioned on the package or product listing) that Skype/VOIP is NOT supported. I'm a pretty techie guy (build my own PCs., water and phase-change cool them) and I tried everything, several BT stacks and 3 different USB and internal dongles. A one-hundred and fifty dollar stereo bluetooth headset will not work for VOIP? The cheapest mono headsets will work, but not this? Absolutely unacceptable for a higher-end headset and the shifty Plantronics people should make this clear on the packaging. I hope Amazon will change the product details to reflect this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Adapter Is NOT Universal!!!","review":"ATTENTION COMPUTER HEADSET USERS: Do not spend the extra money for the Universal Adapter. The adapter only works with the headphones not the microphone. If you must have this headset get the Plantronics Pulsar 590E and then some other bluetooth card instead. Or better yet, just get a headset with a wire and save yourself the money and the hassle. Bluetooth is overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as Lucious below ... doesn't work with Skype :-(","review":"<WARNING> It doesn't work with Skype <WARNING>I also bought this headseat thinking it would work between iTunes and Skype. It doesn't. By reading the product description, it seemed to be the case where it talks about \\"switch from listening to music when a call comes in\\". I read that thinking it meant a Skype call. What they didn't include was they mean a call coming in on your paired CELL PHONE. I'm not happy and feel duped. It should be extremely clear that it wasn't designed to work with Skype on your computer -- it doesn't so don't bother if your a Skype user."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!! - UPDATE","review":"I purchased 3 sets of these over Christmas for gifts (one for myself) and I have to say they are amazing!! Sound quality is fantastic and works a treat with my bluetooth phone (and I have an obscure VK4000!! anyone heard of that model? - there you have it!!) All in all, these rock!!UPDATE: It's now the end of 2008 and these units still look and sound as good as the day I bought them and I use them nigh on constantly! No fragility problems as most of the time I just sling them in my tote. Turning the adapter on and off can be a bit of a manicure wrecker, but that is really the only flaw I have been able to find."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics needs to be more concerned about customers","review":"Got the headset and paired it with my new computer. Could hear just fine, but the microphone was not picking up any sound. The documentation sent with the headset was useless as was the Plantronics web site. So I called and talked to a Platronics service representative. Told the representative the problem and was told he didn't know what was wrong, end of conversation. Put the headset back in the package and sent it back. Until Plantronics gets customer service people that do more than tell you they don't know and hang up, I won't be buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great","review":"Easy to link to both computer and telephone simultaneously. Computer audio cuts out when the phone rings. Works well with Skype. Comfortable to wear for extended periods. Audio adapter works very well with iPod.

Lots of background noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Lag made them unusable for me.","review":"As previously mentioned there is a lag of approx. .5 sec. I purchased these for use when practicing playing a guitar. Hitting a string and then hearing the sound .5 seconds later made my otherwise poor playing that much worse and made them unusable.I tried to test them as a headset with my HP bluetooth enabled notebook as well but was unable to get them to recognize each other and I finally gave up. I did not have this problem with another bluetooth headset I have.Tech. support at Plantronics was less than helpful. They insisted the lag was normal and typical of all wireless headphones.If all you need them for is to listen to music they may suffice. But consider the audio lag if you want them for any other purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product and very useful analog adapter!","review":"These stereo headphones have extremely good quality sound. They are very comfortable to wear and I have worn them for up to four hours. They are extremely easy to use and connect to my LG 9400 phone. The hard case to carry them and other equipment is excellent. The item that makes this the best value by far in a stereo bluetooth headset is the analog adapter. I use this to listen to music when I am using the computer and also to listen to my ipod shuffle. I can put the analog adapter in my pocket and clip the metal shuffle on my pocket and it works pefectly. Because of the adapter, this would be the only stereo headset that I would consider buying. The only negative that I have is the flashing light on the headset. It is a little distracting, but is a minor inconvenience. I strongly recommend this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Holy Moly! It didn't suck as bad as I had anticipated.","review":"Alright. My wife picked this out at the video store, and I failed to look to see what it was. We pop it in the old DVD player and out comes this crazy, Japanese, shot with a home video camera laiden, tv show. My first reaction was, \\"There is no way I am going to make it through this (...)\\" So, I sat and watched for a bit longer. The main characters show up and the horrific acting begins. From the get-go you can pick out who is going to win, who is going to die, and even who the crazy one is. Enter the \\"slashers.\\" I have to say that the \\"slashers\\" are the only reason I kept watching. After the movie ended, I was sitting there astonished at how much I liked it.

At least rent it and give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Expect Too Much and Be Surprised","review":"The acting is over-the-top. There are no surprises to be had with the movie. I picked the winner of this game show before they entered the \\"playing field\\" and soon figured out who the traitor would be. Still, it was very entertaining and different.

A real CRAPPER!!","review":"Let me start by saying I bought this movie according to the reviews. Everybody tried to tell me how great it was. Well it's not! I wish hell I stayed away. Let start with the plot it could have been good but they screwed it up. It about a Japanese reality show where contestants race for their life for big money while being chased by really silly characters. The acting was very weak and the quality of gore was just to fake. Not to mention the film quality was just like some home video style. No matter what people say about this just back away from this one because the hype does not fit the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year and that is why I like. The premise is one of the best I have seen and it has a good plot. The movie is about a Japanese game show where a group of six or seven people go into an arena with three serial killers and try to survive. The survivors win ten million dollars that they split, plus two million for every killer they kill. The game show is the world's most watched T.V. show and in the movie it is making its first appearance in America. The acting is not horrible but it is far from good. There are a few good actors in this movie but there also bad and mediocre actors as well. The death scenes are B-rate but are very good for the budget that the producer was on. Unless you are a fan of B-rate movies, don't buy this movie. If you are a fan of B-movies, go buy this movie because you will be laughing your head off. \\"Supercool\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a Rental","review":"Ok, so Renting movies isnt very well known anymore but still, I wouldnt rent this movie much less buy it.

The Magyars conquered Hungary about 800 AD and the venus goes back a few thousand years.I also noted every one of Hamilton's Hungarians was either shady, greedy, or both. Worst of all, her plot was filled with unlikely coincidences.I grew up in a Hungarian family and so I regret the author didn't take advantage of Hungarian culture. For example, Hungarian is the world's most pretty language but the author hardly mentioned it. The author also could have written more about Hungarian cuisine.Hungarian cold cuts and sausage have a very unusual flavor that is unlike anything else in the world. Outside Hungary very few people know the taste sensation of a good Hurka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie","review":"Another cannibal flick from Umberto Lenzi, this one is pretty bad. The only interesting thing is the extrodinary (authentic) footage of various jungle animals attacking and/or killing each other. The plot concerns an expedition going deep into the jungle (again) to find a missing sister. They come across a cult led by Ivan Rassimov, and they also encounter cannibals (although I can't remember how they fit into the story). As for the gore, it's pretty graphic, but it's also poorly-done and unpleasent. Most of the atrocities are actually kinda boring, especially for those who have seen Lenzi's superior cannibal classic Make Them Die Slowly. The sexually-sadistic scenes in that film were taken to absurd extremes; here they're badly filmed and drawn-out too long.The film looks and feels like it was thrown together in a few weeks. It may be of interest to bad-movie buffs, but even hardcore horror fans will be disappointed if expecting a quality production. One of Lenzi's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Italian Cannibal/Zombie movie.","review":"Here's another Italian cannibal movie and I continue to find there isn't much exciting about this genre. Again, we have mostly controversy over killing animals which I really don't find either disturbing or entertaining at all.I am also a little bored at seeing Kerman in another movie.There really was one scene where they could have taken the movie 'too far' but they held back.I was hoping they would take things too far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uuhh... to much footage, no realtion, weak in concept","review":"I bought it as additional collection for my recent \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\" and \\"Jungle Holocaust\\". But I didn't get anything exciting or at least different.This movie just inspired by Jim Jones's suicide cult in Guyana. Cannibal rites is just cosmetic. It even doesn't related to the story. The worst are, there are many animal killing and other movie footage. I even can recognize cannibal rites footage from Jungle Holocaust I own. Miserable!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore With A Twist","review":"Emerald Jungle, also known as Eaten Alive, by Umberto Lenzi, of Cannibal Ferox fame, offers up all the gore, flesh eating, and nude females that one expects from the Italian cannibal genre but this time the plot of the movie is a bit stranger, if not better, than usual. The basic plot outline of the film is this, a film is found by the dead boby of a cannibal living in New York, the film contains fotage of a womans long lost sister, the woman heads to the jungle in search for her sister only to find out that she has joined up with a religious cult seeking solitude in the jungle, whos leader feeds his followers drugs to obtain their loyalty. Where do the cannibals come in you ask? Well the cannibals have the cults village surrounded, killing and eating anyone who wonders out away from protection. I highly recomend this film to lovers of Italian gore films or gore lovers in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannibals With A Twist","review":"Emerald Jungle, also known as Eaten Alive, of the classic Italian cannibal genre was directed by Umberto Lenzi of Cannibal Ferox fame. It has all the blood and guts that we've come to love in our Italian films however this film has a twist which makes it different from the other films of this genre. The films focus is on a bizarre cult living in the jungle, who's leader feeds his followers drugs to obtain their complete faithfulness, and not on the cannibles who merely surround the cult waiting for members to venture out into the jungle away from protection. All in all this is a great film for gore fanatics like myself. No collection would be complete without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom of the Italian barrel","review":"This movie gets 2 stars only for it';s gore content. if you are a completest who needs to see every cannibal gore movie, then by all means check this out... just don't expect much.

His name is Jesse and he has his faults like all of us do. You know...stealing cars, assaulting people, killing police officers. This movie would lead us to believe that he is really a pretty good guy at heart. Jesse simply likes living a little closer to the edge than most. We follow him on the adventures he encounters while he is busy stalking an attractive young woman named Monica. He had romanced her for a few days while she was vacationing in Las Vegas and has decided that he is in love and has to have her. Is there any reason to care about Jesse and whether or not he finds the happiness and love he is looking for? The short answer would be...NO. \\"Breathless\\" is yet another in a very long list of movies with criminal protagonists who are selfish, violent and difficult to care about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing breathless about this loser....","review":"Ok...for you women (and men) who would enjoy seeing Richard Gere's naked [butt] and brief view of his genitals...this may be your cup of tea.

Although she is a beautiful young woman (at the time this was made)and she does have numerous topless scenes in the film, the horribly bad story line and her poor acting skills kill any erotic charge the director was attempting to accomplish here.

Ok, I agree he's probably only done 5 great films so finding 10 enough would be hard. But I think I could do it. \\"Breathless\\", however would not be included because it is one of the most boring and ridiculous films I have seen. Back in 1983 it hit the cinemas and people went and saw it because of Richard Gere's full frontal nudity.

I'd call it a case of style over substance but there's no discernible style here. Richard Gere's preening narcissistic punk is downright grating. You wonder what Valerie Kaprisky's architecture student sees in this jerk. But, then, Kaprisky's only real talent on display here is shedding her clothes.

There are really only three reasons to watch this film, however: 1) the music, 2) Valerie Kaprisky's boobs, and 3) the last scene in which Gere's character picks up a gun and is going to be ventilated by the LAPD.Gere plays a lowlife who conducts a crime spree from Las Vegas to L.A., including (accidently) killing a California Highway Patrol officer. Naturally, the more crimes he commits, the more the girl covers for him, lies for him, hides him, and participates in the offenses.Unfortunately, films like this just glorify the most negative type of behavior, and make it seem cool and sexy.

At times charming, confrontational, remorseful and frightening, Aileen constantly contradicts herself, at times repenting for her crimes and showing sympathy for her victim's families, and at other times maintaining her position as a victim of circumstance and society. So whereas the \\"Monster\\" film showed a clearer, more linear narrative of Aileen's life, this documentary leaves the viewer with far more questions than answers. A few of which are \\"Was Aileen really horrifically abused by her father?\\" \\"Did Aileen's first victim really rape and torture her?\\" \\"Does Aileen really want to be die?\\" The only question that seems to have a clear answer after watching this film is this one: \\"Is Aileen really insane?\\" The answer is clearly \\"yes\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved This Movie!","review":"3 Ninjas Kick Back kicked butt!

Also, Ill Al Scratch are by no means good rappers, as shown on \\"Ill's Solo\\", but Al Scratch is a tad better than Ill. See the first verse of \\"I'll Take Her\\" for a possibility of minor potential.In fact, \\"I'll Take Her\\" is the reason why this album went from 0 stars to 1. A clever use of one of EPMD's lines from their \\"Jane\\" combined with Brian McKnight's vocal makes for a good chorus. But that's not enough to prevent this tape from keeping my window cracked open."},{"rating":"1","title":"I loved these at first!!!","review":"My husband and I were a week away from getting married and still could not agree on our wedding band set. We came across these and instantly fell in love with them.. I ordered them right away and got them 2 days later. The color on the bands were perfect and the outside of the ring was smooth and beautiful.. It was exactly what we wanted.. We haev been married for 3 weeks today and we are so unhappy with the quality of these rings. The color is coming off of mine and is almost completely off my husbands and they are scratched.. I thought titanium was the strongest metal and that if wouldn't scratch... The seller is trying to work with us to make us happy..

I feel a real connection with the messages Mark Tompkins imparts, his themes of slowing down to live each moment, making your life count for something, moving through the moments of pain and disappointment, etc. His photographs that are paired with the poems are breathtaking and poignant. I can't recommend this enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read.","review":"I received the book as a gift and it now resides among my other collection on the coffee table. It's a wonderfully insightful look into the trials and tribulations of the human \\"condition\\" with photography that is both poignant and storytelling in itself. There's probably a little bit of us all in this book.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"One of the worst books I have ever read. A simplistic plot interspered with enough sex to mask the lack of depth, plot complexity, or character development leaves the reader thoroughly disappointed. However, if you enjoy sophomoric soap operas, you might like this book which is basically a soap opera in murder mystery book clothing. For the serious mystery reader, this is not your cup of tea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar Roses","review":"This book is really for the advanced sugar artist and there isn't anything wrong with that! Not all books can meet all needs and they shouldn't have too. I love this book as I love to make roses. These people are great detailed artist and make flowers that defy being called \\"not real\\"! For instance, one rose has 6 caylix pieces instead of the usual 5 and they go to the lengths to cut one extra and attach it! If this were a cook book, it would be \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" by Julia Child, volume one. The flowers are awsome and the photos are beautiful, just don't expect it to be for beginners. It is for the advanced rose maker. There are other flowers in the book, but roses dominate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sugar roses","review":"I like it very much because this book has printed the cutters, even if you can buy it you gonna be able to use these patterns to make you fondant flowers ,, the book has the instructions but I believe needs more pictures about the procedures to make you flowers"},{"rating":"2","title":"another wonderful design book....","review":"I have several of Alan Dunn's books as well as another book by these same authors. I like the realism in their designs. I give this a four mainly because I wish there were a few more explanations in the making of the flowers. There are lots of beautiful pictures of the completed designs. There are some photos of the in-process project. The photo of the in-process are kind of the same through-out the book though. The individual parts of each project that are different are not specifically photographed and included in the photos. I am not an expert at gumpaste making or design, but I am not new to it either. Sometimes its a bit hard to understand. Thats why I think the other photos would help. All in all a beautiful design book. I have page-marked some designs and just plan on making them however I can lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Icing roses bible","review":"More user friendly than Alan Dunn's flowers book.

I'd give it zero stars. While there are a few parts that are ok, there are some outrageous errors in it and it contradicts or misinterprets the teaching of the Church in a number of places. You can get good information elsewhere without these errors that will lead people astray. Read the real Catechism of the Catholic Church if you want to know the faith. And PS, contrary to the claims of this or any other supposedly Catholic book, the Second Vatican Council reaffirmed in its document Dei Verbum (see section 19), what the Church has always maintained: that the gospels are historically accurate, that they really teach what Jesus did and taught.

This time it's a Florida hurricane which starts the ball rolling, as various couples find the hurricane itself has completely wrecked the lives they had been living before the winds hit and overturned everything that made them the people they felt themselves to be. A Hiaasen book is always entertaining, and like most, this one ends happily as long as you aren't a really bad person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Category 2 Storm","review":"Hiaassen brings out Skink and Jim again in his novel Stormy Weather. This time, another bloody yahoo tourist has turned the destruction of a hurricane into a camcorder event. The characters are likeable, Skink is every bit as absurdly loveable as usual, and the imagery is superb. However, this novel lacked something. I'm not sure what, but it didn't pack the punch most Hiaasen books do for me. I'm used to reading a Hiaasen book and wanting to read it again immediately, yet this one didn't hold the same splendor. Also, as some of you know, in many books the epilogue wasn't printed. I wound up getting one of those copes, so until I tracked down the epilogue on the web, I was a tad confused about the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurricane aftermath...","review":"...adds up to a laugh riot. This book is quirkily hilarious, and very sharp. Even the most minor of characters in this wacky story is brought out in funny detail. The major players are both bizarre and believable, and their interactions are a storm in themselves. Yet it all makes a kind of wonderful sense.I liked this book so much I tell all my friends to read it, too. Don't shortchange yourself with an abridged audio version; you need every wry detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Escapism at its best .

It's impossible to even say what style of story this is. Murder, mayhem, escaped exotic animals, an ex-governor, psychos, crazies, losers, criminals........they ALL abound in this absolutely hysterically disturbing book. I loved it, it was like nothing I've ever read before, and now, I can't wait to read the rest of his books! There's nothing else to say, except that, if you're looking for something completely different, Carl Hiaasen has written it! Just read it people!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgive me, but I just can't resist anything by Carl Hiaasen","review":"I mean, I can't really give one of his books 5 stars, because somehow I think that accolade ought to be reserved for serious literary achievements, like Kavalier and Clay or Atonement. But, really, I love Hiaasen and just can't resist reading everything he writes. He's wacky, loony, impious, a total lunatic. I went to a book signing when Basket Case was released, and he's just as funny in person as he is on the printed page.Hiaasen is a full-speed ahead man when it comes to the use of similies; being a fellow author and a simile-lover myself, I treasure his gems and wish I could come up with even half as many that were as good as all of his, things like: 'She looked about as Latin as Goldie Hawn,' 'he blinked like a sleepy porch lizard,' ' he scratched at his Old Testament tattoos,' and 'he had about as much charisma as a bowl of cold oatmeal.'You gotta love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Author!!!!","review":"I love CARL HIAASEN. This is by far his best book. It even tops STRIPTEASE, and I loved that too. I would definatley recomend CARL HIAASEN to anyone who has a sense of humor. CARL HIAASEN, and also ELMORE ELONARD (who had nothing to do with the book, but i love anyway) are the greatest authors ever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear, loathing and humor in the aftermath of a hurricane","review":"If humor noir were art, this would be a Rembrandt. The book recounts the fictional exploits of the depraved and zany in the aftermath of South Florida's worst recent hurricane. Hiaasen is able to capure the utter shambles that one's life becomes in the wake of the storm, but does so with incredible artistry and and humor that has become a Hiaasen trademark. The character development is subpurb as is the yarn he weaves around the tale of those opportunists who attempt to profit by the advent of the hurricane at the expense of the victims. A terribly funny and well written book. The best Hiaasen Yet"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"The story was great to read interesting, comical, and eye opening. I really enjoyed reading it. Would have given it 5 stars but sometimes it would get confusing because it has so many characters. But every character is interesting and colorful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Weather","review":"This author was suggested to me because Hiaasen was supposed to be funny. To be fair it's probably rated poorly by me because it was very different than the stories I usually read. It had it's moments and it did keep me curious to end it.It wasn't very funny and it lacked substance. What was the point of everything?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So where are the funny bits then?","review":"OK, so it's a readable story and I cracked the occasional wry grin at some of the bizarre scenarios, but where are the belly laughs that the hype promised me? Perhaps it's a cultural thing and Hiaasen's humour doesn't cross the Atlantic very well? The book seemed to be packed full of in-jokes that only Americans will understand and it made me feel like my friends were talking about a party to which I wasn't invited. Sorry, but for satire and a good laugh, give me a Tom Sharpe book any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to care about","review":"Having read and enjoyed the author's young adult book Hoot, and looking for a light adult read, I picked up this book which has the reputation of being funny and light. Frankly, it was both of those things, but within a hundred pages, it became eminently easy to put down. I enjoy a diversion reading book periodically, and have some adult writers that meet those needs, Thomas Perry and Harold Adams to name two. This one didn't make it for me. It seemed to be a lot of: given a hurricane, one darn thing after another for a group of characters I didn't care enough about to see if they ever got tied together."},{"rating":"2","title":"vintage Hiaasen: Miami plagued with loonies, post-hurricane","review":"Carl Hiaasen's books fall largely in the domain of \\"if you've read one of them, you've read them all\\". This is especially true of the characterizations, but thankfully not the wacky story lines. And Hiaasen has a hiliarious way with words, which can sometimes be rather vulgar (yes, some folks might be offended).In Stormy Weather we have greedy out-of-towners and locals trying to make a fast buck after a hurricane wipes out half of Miami. Of course these folks are violent, crude, and more often than not do not get their way due to hilarious mishaps. Hiaasen is well-known for his hatred of crooked politicians, racists, polluters, and big business. And in Stormy Weather all these elements suffer rather badly, to no surprise.Bottom line: while it doesn't hold a candle to his classics (Skin Tight, Strip Tease), Stormy Weather stands firmly among Hiaasen's better works. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl Hiaison is the best.","review":"I love all of Carl Hiaison's books. Partly because he writes about the Florida I live in and love, even with all its quirks and crooks. His sense of humor matches mine so am always amused by the characters he writes about. Would it be so that we ever had a Governor with ethics such as Skink! The hurricane and the aftermath is much the same as Hurricane Andrew, when every cockroach from Florida and reprobates from other states came for the picking of anything they could get. Skink had the right idea. Even if you don't live in Florida, I think you will like this book and be able to compare it somewhat to where ever you live."},{"rating":"2","title":"music to get you started","review":"Supermarket by Stakka Bo is the best album by a Swedish dance/rap artist/group I own. Seriously this is a great album I remember seeing the video for \`Here we go again' on MTV Europe back in the 90's and well it stuck in my head. It has a great hook and a jumping beat.

Get this album if not for yourself then just to impress your friends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never too Late","review":"Dunbar has done what many writers attempt to do which is to capture a full range of the multifaceted African American. Not only does he relate to us with southern, comical, light hearted characters, but he also explores the heart and the intimacy fit for a Queen.

I rated the book on the basis of its content, which is complete. The presentation does not do justice to the work inside, thus a four-star rating. Were the book beautifully bound, and the paper of better quality -- then it would have been five stars for me. But buy the book, anyway. The content is exquisite and a true representation of the African peoples living in America, and, how they communicated with one another, done with humor and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful John Rutter Music","review":"I have been a fan of John Rutter since I first heard this recording on tape 25 years ago.

The first episode aired in color was #295, however the original tape no longer exists and they use a B&W kinescope for syndication.

If you're a Beatles fan, I'm sure you've already heard this so, just buy it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"given the terrible circumstances...","review":"The Beatles were on their last legs during the recording of this. Tensions were very high, and it reflects in the music. The music is undeveloped, and most of these songs were probably in its conception stages, but they're good songs nonetheless. Not the strongest Beatles album, and some songs are tainted by Phil Spector's wall of sound techniques and overproduction. In my opinion, The Long And Winding Road didn't need the strings, and it took away the emotion out of the song, and instead turning it into saccharine. No wonder Paul quit once he heard the master tapes!But \\"Across The Universe\\" is one of my all time favorite songs, and the rest of the songs are pretty good, so it's a 9 out of 10 for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of my favorite Beatles albums","review":"This album is purely fantastic! 'Two of Us' has to be one of my all time favorite songs by the Beatles. It tells the story of the early parts of Paul and Linda's relashionship. Even though John dubbed 'Dig a Pony' \\"(just) another peice of garbage\\" it's really is a great song, too. I think George wrote his best song with the Beatles on this album, 'For you Blue', just a great love song for his wife Pattie (who he later divorced). The album also shows the end of the Beatles, as in 'Let it Be' and 'The Long and Winding Road'. To anyone who's thinking of buying a good Beatles album: this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice - But not one of their best.","review":"Let it Be has quite a few nice tracks on it, but it doesn't quite come together properly. A nice album - if a little raw. And with some tracks that have simply nothing to recommend them. Don't make it one of your first priorities as a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let It Be","review":"By the time this album came out the Beatles broke up and were finished, and would never reunite again. The recording sessions for Let It Be were finished before 1970 and were recorded the same time during the sessions for the album, \\"Abbey Road\\". By 1969 The Beatles had wanted to get back to there roots like many other bands at the time. Let It Be is like the part two to Abbey Road being just as good, except for some reason Let It Be gets a really bad rap though its a good album.The album was mainly recorded live and some songs recorded on there famous rooftop peformance, the songs that were recorded live from that were, \\"I Dig A Pony\\", \\"One After 909\\", and \\"Get Back\\". Let It Be is filled with great songs and an album that should be bought by all Beatles fans everywhere so the fans can hear how it all ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was good but...","review":"It was good in sound quality but it was with the paper case which I didn't like very much...It would have been a lot better with the plastic casehowever the the music was great especially across the Universe was the one I could not find elsewhere..."},{"rating":"1","title":"B","review":"The whole thing feels like a B-side to me.

This is the version released when the Beatles were a group. It is the only one that counts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Stones Are This Good...and Better","review":"As the Beatles were releasing this album, and fading away into the self indulgent fare of their solo albums (Platic Ono Band? ugh), the Rolling Stones had yet to release their best work: Exile on Main Street. The Stones had much more staying power.As for Let It Be, it's not the Beatles worst work (Rubber Soul, Revolver, Mystery Tour and Sgt. Pepper were much worse) but it's also not as good as Abbey Road or A Hard Day's Night.Those who claim this album is \\"raw\\" and \\"emotional\\" are off base. It's far from raw with the overlay of Phil Spector. And given the fact the four Beatles were rarely in the studio together as this was being done, don't criticize Phil. Without him these would still be unspliced demo tapes. Let It Be, Get Back, and Long and Winding Road are good. Which brings up my final point. No wonder John disliked this album. He didn't contribute anything decent to it.If you're building your collection, focus on Abbey Road as the final album.2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beatles Were Circling The Drain","review":"The Beatles had run out of things to say musically, and they couldn't stand the sight of each other; hence you get this piece of dreck. Across the Universe is good and belongs on a Lennon album. The rest is crap. Summer of '67 produced the last great Beatles music, Sgt. Pepper. Abbey Road is perhaps the most overrated record iof all time. Name the great songs on Abbey Road. Something? The medley? Oh, Darling? Because? Please! All mediocre by Beatles standards. Paul was already doing his \\"granny music\\" as John called it, and John was sick of being a Beatle. They didn't have any more Sergeant Peppers in them. Like Hendrix and the Doors, they had run dry; their best music was behind them. This album just showcases that shortcoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even 'They' could blow it","review":"With the type of career they had it's easy to overlook this abomination but still it stains. No one really cares about Mcartney's emotional problems while recording this album. The guys really needed some curly fries, hot dogs and beer and a good listen to this album. Then they would have burnt the masters. I know people might want to flame me but I challenge any one person to tell me this is their favourite Beatles long player? or that this any more than 10% as good as Revolver. Look past your love for the artist and see this long player for what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps If I'd Seen The Movie","review":"But every artist is allowed a misstep or two.

If you really care about what this album SHOULD have sounded like, and what The Beatles had originally planned to release when they recorded the music for this set, look for the bootleg CD 'GET BACK' which is far superior to this. Now Capitol, GET WITH IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patchy, still decent","review":"\\"Let It Be\\" combines the simple with the sophisticated, and because of the former, and its patchwork nature, has been unfairly denigrated. The Beatles do the simple well, altho here the simple songs are admittedly sparse. Still, there is enough in total to make a decent album.The best songs are the lovely \\"Across the Universe\\" (John), the title cut (Paul), and the rocker \\"Get Back\\" (Paul). Altho Paul has said the instrumental and vocal excesses of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" annoyed him, this is still a great song, very evocative. George ships in with \\"For You Blue\\" and \\"I Me Mine.\\" Not his best work, but acceptable. Filler are \\"Maggie Mae\\" and Dig It,\\" but they are not to be taken seriously (literally; they are more attempts at humor, like \\"Why Don't We Do It on the Road\\"). \\"Two of Us\\" and \\"I Dig a Pony\\" are simple, but pretty and fun, respectively. \\"One After 909,\\" written ten years previously, shows a lack of sophistication, but is OK."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Final Album, Worth a Listen","review":"I can't say this is my favorite, nor the best, but I must say, it is up there. In my personal opinionl,Abbey Road should have been released last. It has a better sound to it. But hey, it wasn't, so get over it!I love the music on here, especially Across the Universe. But shouldn't Let it Be have been the first track, considering it was the title track? Just a thought..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sadness can generate Greatness.......","review":"Let It Be was one of the first portrait albums that clearly defined a group of men who were changing and exploring other avenues of music. This album reflects on the past while struggling to move into the future. Although the album is quite sad at times and depressing the music can carry the listener to a new realm. Although tracks like Two of Us, Maggie Mae and Dig It throw this album way off track, the album holds together fairly well. Many tracks have been reExplored such as One After 909 and Across the Universe. The Long and Winding Road, and Across the Universe are two tracks that would not have had the same emotional potentcy if they had not had Phil Spector's touch. Hard to believe Paul would object to his \\"tampering\\" of this beautiful number. In the end this album is therapy and joy, a timeless masterpiece for all to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"let it be-naked-personal rewiew-by 12 year old greg","review":"i agree with others, i think it is a fantastic album for a band that was about to split up!.....i recently boughtt the new beatles let it be...naked album, and the sound has defianatley improved.i hav been listning to it a lot recently, although it has a couple of the tracks missing.probaby my favourite tracks r one after 909, ive got a feeling,dig a pony,and get back.if you r quite a big beatles fan, then i would advise you to go out and buy this album.i reckon people hav highly underestimated this album way, i mean, let it be ballard is beautiful and fantastic(written about paul mccartneys mother, mary.)although john lennon is probably my favourite beatle.any way back to let it be.overall i fink it is an absouluteley superb album with some really decent songs on it.fankx for reading my review by the way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do.","review":"\\"Let it Be\\" was originally titled \\"Get Back\\" and was slated to be released prior to \\"Abbey Road.\\" But those plans were eventually canned, and they instead pushed the record to a spring 1970 release and named it after their concert film. This is quite possibly my least favorite Beatles album, but even a record as flawed as \\"Let it Be\\" has its incredible moments. We all know the title track and \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" both of which deservedly shot to No. 1 on the charts. But what makes this album worth a spin is Lennon's beautiful \\"Across the Universe\\" and George Harrison's \\"I Me Mine,\\" which, in my mind, are two underrated Beatles gems. The group went kaput the year this album came out, and while \\"Let it Be\\" sounds somewhat disjointed and unfinished (others even take aim at the production by Phil Spector), it's still has a couple of bright spots that remind us why they are the world's best pop group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disguised Gem","review":"Underneath the giant production done by Phil Spector is the orginal concept for \\"Let It Be\\": back to basics, straightforward rock and roll. This was supposed to have a live feel to it and it does, but Spector's production does take some of it away. Fortunately the songs are so good it doesn't matter. They may not be the Beatle's best, but the collection is filled with fun, breezy rock songs that don't try to amaze you, just entertain, which it does perfectly. Stand out tracks include \\"Across the Universe,\\" \\"I Me Mine,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"Get Back\\" and pretty much all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Horse Rules! Say 'Neigh' to Lemon & Da Mac Attack!","review":"Finally, someone who recognises George's major contribution to the Beatles. Mind you, I wish L & M had been a bit more tyrannical at the 'Let It Be' sessions and prevented Mr. Harrison from recording the abysmal 'I Me Mine'. A nostalgic cover version would have been more acceptable - and they went through a lot of classic rock n' roll workouts at the sessions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let It Be","review":"Released in 1970, a great farewell album for the Beatles. This is as close as they came to re-capturing the magic behind the early years. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Under-Appreciated Beatles' Album","review":"Any album with \\"Two of Us\\" on it has to be somewhat good. TOU is a great sentimental yet bouncy tune. The rest of the album is not bad either---\\"Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"Let It Be,\\" \\"Get Back,\\" and \\"I've Got A Feeling\\" are all solid. This album often gets a bad rap because the film of the same name documents the Beatles' breaking up because of ...Ono and ... John. But that aside, it is actually a good buy. Spring for it---you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Screwed up by Spector","review":"This CD would have been much better if Phil Spector wouldn't have came along. Actually, three of the Beatles (John, George, and Ringo) gave it to him to reproduce under the title \\"Let It Be\\" (Previously given to Glyn Johns to produce under the title \\"Get Back\\"). The finished product was on songs like The Long And Winding Road, Let It Be, and Across The Universe, drenched to death with an incredible amount of terrible over-bearing strings and choirs. For instance, has anybody heard The Long and Winding Road on Anthology 3? Except for John pathetic attempt at bass, it is a very good and simple song. With strings and choirs added, the song becomes more like The Long And Winding Overdub Manifesto. I can understand why Paul was so mad at him. If the album \\"Get Back\\" would have been released, I think it would have been a definite 5 star album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"OK, so Paul McCartney was angry at Phil Spector for allegedly ruining this album -- but don't believe it. He had a point about using his music without his permission, but he didn't have a point about the final product. This album is beautiful, provactive and fun: all in all, what one expects of the Beatles.But then, it isn't a typical Beatles album. It was made under the worst of conditions by a band which had become less a partnership and more a reluctant collaboration between four very different artists. But, unlike the White Album, this disc still manages to be consistent and balanced. Each member's contribution compliments the next, and Spector's production (albeit overdone on \\"Long and Winding Road) ties it all together. Don't let McCartney give this album a bad name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding album, not to be missed","review":"If this album had been released by a band of lesser stature than the Beatles (any other band), it would have been hailed as the band's greatest. Aside from three number one hits, the album contains the lesser known delights \\"Two of Us,\\" (with great John/Paul harmonizing) \\"I've Got a Feeling\\" (John's words here are especially interesting) and \\"Across the Universe\\" (in a different form than on Past Masters, 2). The thirty seconds or so each one gets of \\"Dig It\\" and \\"Maggie Mae\\" leave one wanting a full three minutes: they're so fun and joyful that you want more, much more. It's too bad more of \\"Dig It,\\" which one can hear on the Let It Be movie, was not released with the anthologies. This is not their best album, nor is it their last (Abbey Road was completed more than half a year after more than 96 percent of this one was recorded), but it is exceptional. Don't miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad pressing","review":"While the audio quality of the music on this album is outstanding, the pressing of these albums leaves a lot to be desired. I got two copies of the record, and both had popping and crackling between songs, and several songs had distortion in them that was not caused by the studio tape. Capitol Records needs to examine the pressing process to see what is the cause of these defects and correct the problem(s)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"The Beatles never sounded so awful. The production is terrible, the songs are mostly weak and underdeveloped. They were coming apart as a group when they made this and this album proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I've got a feeling\\" this is a great album","review":"Again, 8-10 great songs assembled together to form an almost perfect album. There are always 1 or 2 that keep them from being perfect, but they came so close so many times, how can any other group ever compete?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"After watching the Elvis '68 comeback dvd, one has to wonder if Paul's idea for thefilm Let it Be sprung from watching Elvis as ge launches himself back into music relevance.Similarities abound. The Elvis show was made for TV but unique then was its concept tobring a live stage show intimately close to a small audience while using the most basic ofinstruments available. Years later the practice would evolve into what we now call UNPLUGGED.\\"Let it be\\" bears the same effect but it was recreated for the big green. Paul's orginal ideabeing to show how the Beatles create music. Starting from a Beatles vague whisper in the headleading to to its conclusion, a finished work of art. It's reality TV, regressed to it's earliestand perhaps its best form. Their's was an amazing era, made ever more relevant now by a vacuumin today's music for quality that drives entire societies forward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Back,Jojo!","review":"This is the best song I've ever heard by the Beatles! My Mom and I sing it all the time! It's silly and has deep meaning at the same time, if you know how to find it. I'm a loner like Jojo, and I often wish I knew how to get back where I belong. Sweet Lorretta needs help! \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" are cool too. Unfortunately, I haven't heard the whole album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Album","review":"The last album by the Beatles is not their best, not is it their worst.

This album was their attempt to recapture their \\"roots\\" but they could not rekindle the innocence of bygone years. Only Billy Preston's keyboard work redeems this otherwise slapped-together effort. Put it this way: if this album had been a demo by some unknowns, no record company would have touched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished Business","review":"\\"Let It Be\\" is an amalgamation of choppy, incoherent pieces that just don't add up. The material on this album sounds like it came from the editing room floor at Abbey Road studios and that's where it should've stayed!On the brighter side, the singles versions of \\"The Long and Winding Road,\\" \\"Let It Be\\" and \\"Get Back\\" are far better than those on the album. As an aside, to this day, I'll never understand why they let the album version of \\"Get Back\\" end with Ringo saying \\"On behalf of the group, I hope we all passed the audition.\\" Sorry, I'm missing something here. Anyway, Beatles fans would do well to skip this album and get their 1967-1970 complilation album that included these and other great songs of that era.Given the overall weakness of \\"Let It Be,\\" I think the Beatles should've called it \\"Let It Alone.\\" Fans, take note."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is 90% trash.","review":"This is trash. You shouldn't blame it on Spector; it's the Beatles' fault. Let It Be is very overated. The instrumentation is over worked, and the lyrical concept is idiotic: give up on problems. Dig It is idiotic, 909 is idiotic, Maggie Mae is trash, and Get Back(Juju the monkey?) is a little dumb. In Dig A Pony, john tells us that you can syndicate any boat you row, and then repeats it as if it's some great piece of wisdom. There are two pieces of the song, and they don't link up at all.

And why is it not considered one of their classics? Help! Anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good","review":"I know this album isn't the greatest ever created, but it has some definite gems. John and Paul's harmonization on Two of Us is awesome. Across The Universe is, in my opinion, one of John's best. Let It Be sounds better in the single version, but it stands out as well. The Long and winding road is a great song, but Spector kind of ruined it. John's bizzare rocker Dig A Pony is good as well. As a nice ending, Get Back is a McCartney classic. Overall, this album is very good, but underrated.

One of the most tell-tale signs is John's asinine introduction to \\"Two Of Us\\", where he basically calls Linda a horse.But the album has some good music on it nonetheless. Although John considered the White Album to be a Beatles album with solo works on it, Let it Be and Abbey Road are also. George proved through his songs on Let it Be and Abbey Road that he had as much musical muscle as John and Paul, John was almost totally preoccupied by \\"Yukko\\", and had little remaining interest in the band, Paul was struggling to keep the Beatles together and Ringo was in the middle of the entire battle.All in all, Let it Be may not have the quality of Sgt.

Stephen King does know how to spin a tale (as we are reminded in seeing at least one of his books make it to the screen every year). The problem is there just is no story here. A scary movie? No, a very funny spoof of the alien genre duds perhaps. BUT, there are four really good reasons to sit through this otherwise forgetable bit of indigestion: Damien Lewis, Thomas Jane, Jason Lee, and Timothy Olyphant. They make the best of a scrawny script and play off each other very well. As for Donnie Wahlberg, Morgan Freeman and Tom Sizemore - well, maybe it was easy money.

She has watched it multiple times it is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brutalized the book","review":"This movie proves the thesis that Stephen King's books make terrible movies. Basically a retelling of the monster in the woods tale, the success of the book is in the complex and textured interweaving of five friends, all linked, all with extraordinary gifts. One is extraordinary; although the weakest in body and mind, he is the strongest in spirit. The movie misses all of this, and butcher's the ending. This is among King's masterworks, and the movie does it little justice. Morgan Freeman, usually a strong enough force to carry a script on his own shoulders, is wooden and stereotypic. It might take you longer, but I recommend that you spend a couple of days reading the book than trying to make sense of this hacked up and bland rendering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great but if you have time to kill, okay.","review":"I didn't really care for this movie but it's not the worst I have seen. If you liked the book, then you will probably feel the same as I do.The movie just misses way too much of the story and the ending is completely horrible. I watched this because I really liked the book and was hoping that this would be somewhat worthy but it is not. Why are so many movies that are made from Stephen King stories so off? His books are incredible (one of my favorite authors) but the movies are mostly flat. I think they miss out on the feelings that King displays so well in his characters.I'd recommend reading the book and skipping this movie all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical Stephen King","review":"This movie reminds me of almost all movies Stephen Kings been associated with--it starts great and is really interesting for the first third--barely holds your interest for the second third-and falls apart by the final third. As he too frequently does-there's a gifted \\"special\\" person who plays a significant role in the movies outcome. That doesn't ruin the movie--but the covert military operation which is headed by Morgan Freeman is a total waste and takes what little suspense is left in the movie and thows it out for good.The concept was good--some friends are isolated, and encounter a stranger who has a mysterious ailment--and that part of the story is quite entertaiining, but the ending is lame and ruins the initial story line. Suspense and horror are replaced by mayhem and firepower. Is it worth watching--sort of--but is it worth owning--no way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTING AT BEST","review":"If I had not read the book this movie would have made little or no sense at all, (not that it was very understandable even having read the book). A great book which could have been a great movie, but never achieved the promise of the cast, or story. I was really looking forward to the film being a \\"constant reader\\" as Mr. King calls us, to the conflict between good and evil, the Duddits connection (from watching the movie you have no idea of what the connection between him and the other boys/men was). The story line was choppy, trying to fill in the gaps with a few flashback scenes, you never really got the point that Mr. Gray had taken over one of the friends, (they had to have a character tell you this so you knew what was happening). The lack of detail in the second half of the movie was confusing, and the new ending was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have just read the book","review":"Dreamcatcher wasn't a horrible movie but maybe if I had read the book I would have gotten a better feel for the film. The film is long and drawn out and never really expalins what's going on. Jason Lee's performance is what saved the film for me. Kudos also go to Thomas Jane who just appeared in the vastly superior The Mist. I guess I will read the book and then view the film again. I would say the film is for die hard King fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the movie, but....","review":"the DVD froze up on us in the same spot each time we tried to play it.

I have been a Stephen King fan for years and have always made a point of reading his books before seeing any of the movies. I enjoyed the book, the story was great... I'm not sure what they screenplay writers read, but it was NOT the book. They got some of the basic plotline and such, but there was almost no character development (and where there was, it was wrong... totally different from the actual chracters in the book) and they must have been bored with their own work by the end, because what they put in for an ending was very simply made up. They missed the entire point of the book and went WAY off track. So if you like Stephen King, don't bother. If you like campy \\"B\\" movies and have never read a Stephen King book in your life... you may just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book, Lousy Movie","review":"Stephen King should pass up the money and not let his novels be made into movies. It never works out right. The one decent movie made from one of his books ( The Shining ), he hates.This movie is great for the brief period of time that it follows the novel. The first act where you are introduced to the characters could not have been done better. The casting is great as well as the initial build up of suspense. The problem is that when the aliens are finally introduced, the movie tries to go over the top with cliched military conspiraccies and surprise twists when a subtle hand is what is needed. The ending is the most rediculous thing I have ever seen.Don't waste your time or money on this. Check out the book from the library and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I get back the time I wasted watching this movie?","review":"Oh, Steven King wrote this? Well he should stick to the made-for-TV miniseries genre. This movie sucked. I mean really sucked.My reasons:1. No character motivation for about 2/3 of the many characters that they force us to watch.2. Horribly clichéd ending with the dying friend turning into a giant alien, and the fate of the world resting on a worm that dramatically pauses before jumping into a sewer.3. Poor visual effects. The particles were large and clumpy. The majority of the composites failed to match contrast levels. The explosions were horrible. I'm not even going into the design of the aliens...4. \\"Ass weasels\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Stephen, how could you let this happen?","review":"I loved this book, and I was bitterly disappointed by this half-assed retelling for the silver screen. Some people will probably say that I'm being unfair rating in comparison to the novel, but it's not true. I think I would've hated this movie even if I hadn't read the book. I actually had the misfortune of seeing it in the theater. I haven't watched the DVD version yet. There's supposed to be an alternate ending. I'll have to check it out, I suppose. I hope it's better then the one they used.The first hour or so is pretty good, but then it degenerates into a really sleazy gore, suspense flick. None of the really cool scenes from the book were used. Not even the really funny cafe scene where Mr. Gray murders the state trooper. It's just a low down dirty shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher, catches a nightmare","review":"I'm a huge fan of anything Stephan King, that being said I'm embarassed for him for having put his name on this movie. I've read the book and this movie is a huge disappointment. This movie has none of the depth or character developement of the book. You don't get a sense of the friendships, why they work, how or why they've lasted this long. The intorduction of the binding facgor of these friendships (the man child they saved a pre-teens)was sloppy at best, and pretentious at worst.If you haven't read the book then you might fine this movie (and I use the term losely) entertaining. But I highly doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heed the Warnings","review":"DreamCatcher is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. As a longtime Stephen King fan, I ignored the warnings. Fortunately, I didn't have to pay to see this dog! It is the most vulgar/graphic movie I have ever seen. Obviously it is made for the 8-12 yr. old set, as only they can appreciate flatulence, belching, gaping [...] wounds, slime, blood, guts and the sheer tastelessness of the movie. Should you actually persevere to the end, it turns very cartoonish and explains very little. A much better alien film, with suspense, is John Carpenter's \\"The Thing\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"I can't even descibe what was wrong with this one... You'll just have to see it to believe it. To be fair, I did watch it all the way through, and when the film was finished, I couldn't figure out what I had just witnessed. To say it was juvenile in scope would be an understatement. While I don't exactly care for the literature of Stephen King, I can't imagine how he could have been responsible for something like this. Kids, the bottom fell out on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I lied ... this movie actually gets zero stars, but this rating system wasn't built for movies as bad as this one, therefore it unofficially gets a 1. In fact, you can't even describe this movie as being bad. It would have to improve by about 800% just to become bad. At no point is this movie even close to being watchable. When I saw this movie, I had slept for 15 hours that day, and was all hyper due to being so well rested. However, it put me to sleep again in about 5 mins. The only reason I woke up was because of a loud farting sound, apparently caused by aliens crawling up people's butts. Then I stayed awake long enough to have the honor of seeing some kid pick up a dog turd. Afterwards, I forced myself back to sleep. Don't watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Dream.","review":"An absolute nightmare. A film filled with unecessary cruelty and poor storytelling.

The worst film of 2003."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen.","review":"I cannot believe this movie got made, with decent actors no less. Don't waste your time watching this movie, unless you enjoy senseless, annoying, and incredibly moronic writing. Movies produced using the works of Stephen King are typically quite awful. The only exceptions include movies that are based on short stories and movies that he himself did not have much to do with. This probably has something to do with the fact that he churns out mindless works one after another, much to the delight of his lowest common denominator audience.

The end is dumb."},{"rating":"1","title":"From someone who never read the original Stephen King Story","review":"This movie tries (unsuccessfully) to reproduce some of the best moments in Stand By Me, but the results are laughably atrocious. Still, I was all prepared to give it 2 stars, but then one of those \\"what were they thinking\\" moments happen. One of the characters picks up a gun, holds it like a phone, and says \\"Jonsey! I knew you would call!\\" ESP or not, that scene alone signaled the beginning of a mildly bad movie taking sharp turn into Crapsville. Most of the positive reviews found here are from people who have read the book, and can't help but bring that experience to their reviews. As a person who never read the book, and is reviewing the movie on it's own merits, I find it terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreamcatcher","review":"Ive been watching alot of King movies lately and I must say this has to be one of his worst films.

The idea was pretty good, alien comes, people die. Had it not been blogged down by so many plot holes and just plain goofy situations, it just might have been good. Morgan Freeman, who usually is lights out when it comes to acting, really screws up here. Attempting to play that token over the edge army guy, he slips about a billion times, i never bought it. The one scene where i pretty much gave up all hope in this movie pulling a comeback was when Thomas jane calls Jonesy on the gun...i mean that was just stupid, especially that Tom Sizemore was not the least bit weirded out. The end was weak, especially for Stephen King. I actually thought to myself before it happened, \\"What could be the worst possible way to end this movie?\\" and then that idea occured in the movie. Weak, pointless, and all out disappointing. So much more could have come from this movie, yet it took the low road and collapsed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poorest 2 Hour Adaptation of a Sci Fi Novel","review":"I read this book recently while traveling - like most Stephen King novels, the book holds the reader's attention - with sufficient descriptions, narratives and character development. Unfortunately, this adaptation significantly deviates from the story's plot, is not a true representation of how the tale is told in King's novel. In fact, there are several scenes that are not representative of anything in the novel and the distortion of a solid sci fi/horror story is very disappointing. If you've read the book I'm sure that you'll find yourself numerous times wanting to turn off the movie and retain your fond memories of a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"This was a great book and great movie!Fine acting, excellent direction and cinematography and an interesting horror/sc-fi storyline.Beware however, that people who did not read the book will become confused and not like the movie as they don't really understand what is going on, as evidenced by some of the reviews I have have read here."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it; stupid me.","review":"I was really looking forward to this movie, since Dreamcatcher is my favorite Stephen King novel. Kasden, Freeman, Sizemore...how could you go wrong. Well, I wish I had rented instead of purchased. The characters are very shallow in the movie, a byproduct of making a huge King novel into a two hour flick. The characters in the book are what makes the read so compelling. Without the depth of the characters the movie becomes a paint-by-numbers exercise.The aliens look slick in the film which is a plus. The acting is good by everyone involved. The rest of the film is thin.

Made the mistake of renting it on DVD and feel cheated out of $3.95 and the 2.5 hours of my life that I will never get back. I cringed at the dialogue throughout this movie. The acting was horrible. The delivery of lines was forced. The editing (or lack there of) was bad. The transitions between scenes were a laugh. Morgan Freeman's performance in particular was ridiculous and over the top. There was absolutely no suspense. Zero character development. You find yourself not caring about any of the characters and just hoping that they all die quickly to bring the movie to a swift end. No such luck. I sat for 2+ hours waiting for something to get better or to realize that I was missing out on something. I wasn't and you won't be either. Skip this movie. Rent Alien instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Split Personality","review":"To believe that I wasted over two hours watching this mess is not comforting to me. Usually when I see a movie with such good actors as Morgan Freeman and Jason Lee, I am drawn to it. Clearly this is not a film in which the actors can rise above the material. Is it a warm personal Steven King story like \\"Stand By Me?\\" Or is it a typical Steven King horror story? Who knows? To me it does not work either way. I thought that there might be something interesting about the relationship of the four main characters and the young man they befriended as children by standing up to bullies who were picking on him. No, we do not get that at all. And, the horror story was completely trite. Even the movie itself knows this, calling the monster \\"Ripley\\" after Sigourney Weaver's character in the \\"Alien\\" movies. But, trying to be two different things insured that neither worked. The ending? Makes little or no sense even within the context of fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This move is stupid","review":"Ok, stayed up until 1AM watching this piece of garbage last night, and boy, was it a waste of time!

It's a complete mess, and by the time you get to the end, you find yourself saying, \\"Oh, come on!

Yes, Duddits is played by ex-New Kid On The Block, Donnie Wahlberg. Considering how horrible his musical skills were, his acting is great.If you are still going to buy this DVD, check out the bonus feature that has an outtake of Owen, Duddits, and Henry in the car.

I found this movie to be quite entertaining. I think you would have to be pretty 'slow' to not understand the plot as it unfolded or perhaps just too busy eating popcorn to pay attention.When a movie can keep me up past my bedtime, I know it's a good movie and I couldn't turn this one off until it was over.

This movie was not at all like I expected it to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"is this a comedy???","review":"This has to be one of the strangest mainstream films ever made, but i'm not sure that was entirely intentional. The first part of the movie sets things up well - classic chiller you might say (strange virus, atmospeheric Maine woods). Why then did the producers decide to turn the rest of the film into a made for tv b-movie? Damian Lewis's possession is hilarious, but is this the intended effect? You're left in little doubt that the film makers must be having fun with the audience when the next part of the film plays like some dreaful Independence day type nonsense, with Morgan Freeman completely wasted - he feels tagged on. And after all this, watching the end credits would make you think you'd just been watching Ghostbusters. This is a dreaful but enjoyable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"King George's Condition","review":"This is an excellent film detailing a little known to most condition of the last king of England to rule the colonies in America. Although it takes some poetic license concerning events, treatment of the condition and some of its symptoms it is a very good movie. George III is fairly represented as a devoted family man who is generally liked by his subjects. The film is a little light in detailing his many interests and fairly depicting the depth of knowledge that he held in comparison to his predecessors. It also does not show the connection between the disease and some of its triggers such as the stress caused him by his son whom he loved as a son but hated as an air. I would recommend this film though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at how much I dislike this film . . .","review":"Lots of great British actors held prisoner in a boring story with terrible dialog.

My time would have been better spent watching funny cat videos on the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"And people think Charles is crazy...","review":"The Madness of King George details part of the reign of George III. The part the movie focuses on has to do with what happened when a hereditary disease that George had called porphiria made the otherwise frugal, conservative King do things like curse, kiss a woman not his wife, and beat his oldest son-George, the Prince of Wales.The late great Nigel Hawthorne is magnificent as George III. Helen Mirren is also very good as his wife-and the mother of Georges' 15 children Charlotte. Rupert Everett is very good as the future George IV (though it is weird to see an openly gay man playing a man kissing the breast of his \\"lover\\" who was really the secret wife of George) All in all a very well done movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Chop, Chop the King, the King!!!\\"","review":"All I can say is WOW! I was amazed when I rented this film and put this into my dvd player. The costumes, make up, and the acting are all SUPERB! I could tell that a lot of thought went into making this quality movie.Indeed I am a patriotic American and I do know that George III is to blame for our American Revolution, but I felt sympathetic towards the King in this film.Underneath the savage, rigid, and tempermental \\"insanity\\" of the King, George III did indeed have a heart and a conscious that can be seen in bits and pieces in many scenes. I actually found the Prince of Wales (Prince Regent) to be a ruthless snake that was King in \\"name only.\\"There are some great scenes and shots of Windsor Castle, the Houses of Parliament, and St Paul's Cathedral.

You will find his antics hilarious and yet pity him in the same instance, for how inaccurately his illness was treated for the times.I found the film to be suprisingly factual - even with the more endearing take on George's character/perspective. Ian Holm and Rupert Everret are both excellent, yet easy to detest in their roles as ruthless doctor and Prince, respectively. But my favorites in the film were Helen Mirren and Nigel Hawthorne's as the King and Queen - the fact that he never took a lover (historically) shines through in their roles, and makes them more charming British monarchs to watch for a change!Thoroughly enjoyed this film.... a sad story underneath, but a delight in its delivery."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"All I can say is that you must get this movie.

The costumes and sets are great and Sir Nigel Hawthorne really carries the movie with his wonderful performance.The film starts slow - v e r y s l o w - and I almost shut it off. What surprised me after seeing this movie, was that it was more a drama than a comedy. There is nothing in the dialogue that is interesting, or poetic, or transcendent, or makes you think.

Mediocre video mode, from the very start makes it look like the cheapest soap opera. What is worse, bottom line absolutely everything in the movie really ends up reaching the level of the cheapest soap opera you might be able to think of. Arquette's explosion at the end is indeed the only 10 seconds worth watching as another reviewer said, there's really nothing else worth the time and money. Given the [...] bucks I had to pay for the tape, that makes those the 10 most expensive seconds of movie material I've paid for in my life.

In my opinion, this book marks a refreshing change in the landscape of religion. Too often we have heard devout believers say those who part with particular religious beliefs are 'hiding a sin', or simply in denial, and/or remark on their belief that it is impossible to find happiness without faith in a particular flavor of doctrine.

The Lord never forces anyone to follow Him. Nor is it at all surprising that apostates can often find a fulfilling life without Him. After all, the Bible recognizes that sin is pleasurable (Hebrews 11:25)--that is, for a season. Finally, the book is woefully incomplete in that it totally ignores those who fall away for whatever reason but then return to active practice of the Faith.

I would have to say this is my favorite book, too. I discovered the hardcover version in a used bookstore; bought it for about $5. It seems to be worth a lot more than that; I was lucky. Since I re-read it a lot, I bought the softcover version so I wouldn't wear the hardcover. This book, about a boy that lives in Troy during the Trojan War, really seems to put the reader back in time. Good, realistic characters bring the story to life. I tried to find more books by this author, but to no avail. This may have been the only work he did. If you are interested in this time period, I highly recommend it as a way to experience the past, in addition to history books on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just 4 stars???","review":"This book just happens to be my all time favorite book, and surprisingly enough, I too have been in contact with this fine piece of work by my High School English teacher.It takes place in an ancient war between the Agean, the Trojan War. It combines both fiction and facts quite well, and the way author imagined his own views of these ancient characters such as Achilles was pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find book!","review":"This book has been out of print for quite some time, but I was lucky enough to have had a teacher in high school that made numerous xerox copies of it.

Also, music instrumentation is quite organic, intimate, folkie, hooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seasons Continue.","review":"Continuing his set of albums devoted to the four seasons, McCutcheon put together SUMMERSONGS. Like the other albums in the series, SUMMERSONGS celebrates many of the great things about summer but relived from a child's perspective. From the old \\"Swimming Hole\\" to playing with some \\"Mud\\" on the ground. \\"Riding My Bike\\" or visiting with the \\"Ice Cream Man\\". These are the things that kids do, see, and experience during the summer. My favorite song on the album is \\"Meteors/The Perseid\\"--it's an enchanting song about the beauty of the night sky and what goes on up by the stars. I recommend this as a great album that families can enjoy together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars is Not Enough!","review":"Amazingly enough, I discovere Summersongs in a friend's car on the way to a conference in Charlottesville about two years ago. I loved it then, and I just recently bought a copy of my own. I LOVE the song about Mud. I've seen John McCutcheon so many times now that he knows me by name and I always make a point of talking to him after his concerts. I even have his autograph. All in all, I'd say buy this album. It is perfect for anybody who enjoys summer, or even hates summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the good reviews","review":"In short, don't believe all the things that other reviewers on Amazon are saying about this amp. I've had it for about 3 years, and it is not worth it. If you are new to electric guitar, you may think that the Spider sounds good, but if you have had experience with amps you will know that it's no good. It sounds digital and cheesy. There is absolutely no warmth to the sound at all. This amp only sounds good to the untrained ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"the line 6 beast! :]","review":"well, this is my opinion i absolutley love it, its so versatile, i own this and a bugera 333xl the bugera still sounds better just because of the warmth of the tubes, but thi is the best for any beginner guitar player, id recommend it for anyone! :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shark saw, dovetail type","review":"This is my second of these saws. Excellent product! I use it at my woodworking business on a regualr basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product (limited uses)","review":"This is a good saw, but I really don't have too many uses for it. I think someone else said - how often to you need to cut a dowel from a smooth surface? For what it is, it is really excellent though - sharp blade, very flexible, etc. Every time that I do grab for it, I am not disappointed. Cutting on the pull stroke seems to give extra control."},{"rating":"2","title":"impulse buy","review":"I needed to cut a few oak thresholds that were worn out and needed to be replaced. I could have used my mitre saw but I happened to stumble upon this saw. This was purely an impulse purchase.After taking the time of reading several reviews offered on this product I realized that it would be worth checking out for the twelve dollar price.I can confirm from my own experience that this should be considered a disposable saw, as I'm writing this review there is a replacement blade 10-2204 that costs 'almost' exactly as the complete saw - that's indicative of how cheesy the black plastic handle is on this \\"Shark Saw\\". I find that to be quite silly.This saw cut three thresholds very much to my satisfaction, although I noticed that it did become a bit more dull after four cuts(I screwed one up)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine cheap Saw","review":"It's not exciting, but you'll never have to worry about it. This saw does a fine job, cuts smoothly enough, and can be thrown away when it dulls. For the price it is a fine addition to the shop. Just don't confuse it with a premium tool. I have used it to clean up several through tenons and dowels and it's still sharp. I'm satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Tool","review":"Wow, this worked great to trim my door jambs when installing my new wood floor. Lightweight and VERY sharp!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Westernized Japanese saw","review":"I have a number of moderately priced Japanese handsaws that I find are absolutely invaluable in traditional Western woodworking. The thin kerfs and double-cut teeth cut through wood amazingly fast, and the technique- cutting on the pull stroke- makes it exceptionally easy to follow a pencil line.This flexible cutoff saw has recently earned a place in my tool bag. The traditional double-cut design means you can cut on either side of the blade without scratching adjacent surfaces, unlike Western saws, which have teeth set to one side and can only be used on one side.Not only will this saw cut protruding dowels about as quickly as it takes to think about it, it does it better than any power tool you can imagine. What kind of power tool could you used to trim a dowel in the middle of an oak floor, after all? With a price less than a package of blades for a Sawzall, it's a bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for those tight spots...","review":"I agree with most everyone else here...this is a great saw for the money. I have a dovetail saw, that I have used for years so I mostly use this little saw for trimming dowels and making wooden hinges. It is so easy to get an accurate cut and stop on the bottom cut line that I have quit using the bandsaw to make hinges. The blade, when sharp of course, cuts thru even the hardest hardwoods and leaves a very clean cut. Cleanup with chisel and file is almost totally eliminated. New blades are as cheap as paying to have it sharpened so there is no reason to have a dull saw. Recommend this one highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spenco Bacpacker insoles","review":"Worked great for my 14 year old son camping/hiking.Hiked 57 miles in 11 days and never got a blister or sore feet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Support","review":"Spenco comes out on top, after trying numerous insoles, including custom! I find them excellent for everyday wear and a couple weeks hiking in Denali Nat. Park was much easier too. Be sure to take the \\"issue\\" insole out of your shoe unless you need it for a spacer. These inserts will make the shoe fit nice and snug. I've about recovered from plantar fasciitis, but when it was its worst, these insoles saved the day. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A big Western with a stupendous music score.","review":"I loved this movie as a kid when I saw it in the theatre back in 1958 or 1959 and I still love it. The movie score by Jerome Morass is absolutely magnificent. Gregory Peck plays a pacifist Easterner who's trying to avoid getting caught up in the land dispute his fiance's (Carol Baker) family is having with a local clan. His shallow fiance and her father (Charles Bickford) interpret his unwillingness to fight as a sign of weakness. Charlton Heston and the beautiful Jean Simmons are fine in their roles. Burl Ives won an Oscar for his portrayal of Rufus Hennesey, the leader of a very large extended family. Last, but not least, Chuck Connors (of the Rifleman TV series) turns in his finest film performance. A big movie with big stars made by a big-time director (William Wyler who won best director Oscars for Ben-Hur and The Best Years of Our Lives). A fine film with a good message about the futility of fighting in order to resolve conflicts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Country","review":"This is an excellent movie, and one that I know will be appreciated by anyone who likes Westerns.

All of my other DVD's work fine.The Big Country"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely stunning music. Peck and Heston in their prime","review":"Clearly, the most enduring \\"character\\" of this larger than life western is the score by Jerome Moross. Regularly named as one of the ten best movie scores of all time, it's hard to imagine that it lost the Oscar in 1958 for Best Score to \\"The Old Man and the Sea!\\" Who remembers the music to THAT??????Peck and Heston are in their primes here, and Heston courageously took a role that didn't make him heroic every minute..a much more complex and conflicted character than most he has played. Gregory Peck's style and grace were never more evident than in this role.For 1958, the female roles in this movie were ahead of their time. Their roles drive the story, they are not just ornamentation along with the big skies and canyons.But again, the star of this movie is the incredible score. If you can find the boxed set soundtrack release, covet it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent drama of the west.","review":"Jean Simmons is brilliant in this excellent western.

The problems are with using aditional feature like pause, stop, start, etc. Maybe it is just my DVD player although I have never had trouble with any other DVD or Blu-ray. I had several interuptions when trying to watch the movie and every time I paused or stopped the movie I had to start over from the beginning. Pushing resume or play started at the beginning.

This had to have been copied by high school students, no professional could have done this poor of a job.I have this movie on VHS, on two tapes, and it looks like they copied it from the VHS rather than the original movie stock. The background fades in and out just enough to be noticeable, obviously someone didn't turn off the security feature all the way.

A ranking Academy member acknowledged several years ago that The Big Country received a non-digital, \\"completely photochemical\\" restoration for its 2008 50th anniversary debut {credit: Lincoln Spector/bayflicksdotnet}. Perhaps it is safe to assume that the restoration credit on the Blu-ray and the 2008 restoration are mostly one in the same.

I keep it to 3 times a week, usually as a lunch meal for them, so they digest it fully before dinner time. No one's ever had a tummy ache from it and they slowly chew away at their pieces for a long, happy hour. One note to humans: wash your hands carefully and thoroughly after handling these.

Not for adults, not for children.....not even for those so desperate for distraction on a dull Saturday night that they would consider deliberate pain and suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPER FUNNY MOVIE","review":"This movie was so funny that you would laugh until you pass out.The special effects where super great. I liked it when the babies started beating people up. The cast was also great.

It's ideas like that make crappy movies. Don't see this movie it'll be the worst movie you'll ever see.

This movie totally sucked. Not at all what I expected. Why anyone would want to put themselves through this torture is beyond me. I learned my lesson the hard way a few years ago when I picked this garbage up from the \\"bargain bin\\" at a local video store. Please..at this point I think Id pay someone to get this movie off of my hands. Thats how bad it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, terrible, pathetic, and for little kids!","review":"What in the world was going on with the minds of the makers of this film? To me, it's obvious that this film was made for very young children. I felt embarrassed that I saw it in the first place. You'd think that a live-action movie of toddlers would be one of the best theatrical movies ever. How can anyone older than 8 enjoy this film? It's complete GARBAGE! The only reason I gave it one star is the fact that this is a live-action 'Rugrats', and also because you shouldn't really expect much from a film that's aimed at 5 year olds. However, they still should have aimed more toward a general audience instead of little kids only. So unless you need some entertainment for 5 year olds, I'm sure it would be anybody's best interests to leave this crap alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"How I hate this stupid movie","review":"Babies can talk? give me a break.

I felt cheated out of my money after I saw this movie in the theater with my kids. My kids couldn't even wait for it to end. Two thumbs way down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbed by the violence against adults","review":"This is another one of those, \\"Adults are dumb, kids are smart.\\" movies. I was disturbed by all the violent acts the kids did against the adults who I didn't think were all that evil to warrant the attacks. This theme has been done before in Home Alone, but in that, we're talking about two robbers. The kids got meals, a place to stay and toys galore but somehow that was all evil. The kids had their moments and I'm not sure how they got the kids to do it. Unfortunately, with all the special effects, the kids really may not have been doing it. If you want to see a cute kid movie, try Willow. That little girl has the cutest spontaneous expressions that you know weren't manufactured by a computer.Parents: skip this unless you like the idea of your kid karate chopping you if you try to make him/her go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie rates with teh worst MST3K films","review":"This is horrible trash. Baby Geniuses has got to be among the worst films I have ever seen. The \\"slapstick\\" comedy is unrealistic and just plain unfunny. The plot is unbelieveable and underdeveloped. It makes you think about whatever the parents who let their childern star in this movie are on. All in all, if MST3K was still on, this movie would be on its hit list in teh next few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Written Disgust in 120 Words","review":"\\"Baby Geniuses\\" represents the second lowest point in the late Bob Clark's directorial career, right behind \\"Superbabies\\". It's a terrible idea on paper, and its quality didn't change in its filming execution. The film tells me that it's alright for toddlers (not babies as the title mislead) to perform implausible acts in situations made for them, dumbing down their apparent danger and fatality which should appalled many parents. The film failed for its odd schizophrenic humor: it has many witty retorts too complicated for kids to understand, and physical gags too idiotic for reasonable adults to accept; the film alienates my inner child and my current adulthood. When the toddlers constantly laugh in this movie, I felt nothing but anguish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another movie to entertain yourself...","review":"The previews of this movie made it look halarious. It was anything but. Actually it was just a bunch of mumbo jumbo about nothing. I thought the kid was cute when he was trying on different outfits and dancing around...especially when he put on the white polyester suit and did his \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" dance. But even then, the computer generated like moves cut it down. This movie was hardly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acute but worthless movie.","review":"This movie had it's great moments like when the parents were changing the two kids diapers that was funny.

'nuff said about the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest piece of \\"diaper gravy\\" of 1999.","review":"There is so much wrong with this movie. For one thing, the babies' mouths DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT move in sync with what they are saying. A couple of times, the adult actors' voices do not go with what they are saying, either. This was a major annoyance in the movie. It would not have been so bad if they just had the babies do their actions and have voice-overs without their lips moving (like Homeward Bound, a 5-star movie). But no, the movie is ruined. Buy and be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched beyond comprehension","review":"One truly wonders how movies such as this get made, and how respectable actresses like Kathleen Turner somehow convince themselves that taking roles such as this are actually good career moves.This is truly dreadful stuff. If someone you love suggests renting this movie to watch at home, I would say it is high time to give your relationship a serious re-evaluation.This garbage is angling for a spot on my list of the 10 worst movies I have ever had this misfortune to see. Burning every copy of this film would be doing humanity a favor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diaper gravy is right","review":"This is one of the most embarassingly awful movies I have ever seen. It makes the movies watched on MST3K look like cinematic masterpieces. I work at a video store and have seen several people on different ocassions actually BUY this movie! I wanted to punch them out and put some sort of sense into them. If you buy this movie for your kid because he likes it, you are making a mistake. It is rubbish like this that makes kids shoot other kids. Buy them a good family movie like E.T. or PINNOCHIO. ANY thing but this TERRIBLE MOVIE. Bob Clark makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles. They say the phrase \\"Diaper Gravy\\" not once, not twice, but THREE TIMES in this movie, as if the first time wasn't enough. This movie should be deleted from mankind's memory. Just DON'T BUY THIS EVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Geniuses cost me some brain cells","review":"I can't believe that this movie had such a great cast, what were they all thinking when they decided to appear in this unintelligent, stupid film. Nothing about this film was good. I don't even think little kids would enjoy this crap. It's a bad rip-off of \\"Look Who's Talking.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash","review":"This movie is horrible, I mean for a comedy it isn't even funny. They aren't even babies there toddlers, I mean come on folks, my two younger brothers didn't even like this movie. How can people even compare this to the Rugrats. If you want a movie to entertain your kids or yourself rent any other movie than this. I highly recommend not wasting your money on even renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LASTS FOREVER!","review":"I just bought a new pair of these coveralls for my dad this Christmas.

The recipient thought they were better than others they had gotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"I wanted to like this product. After all, the aesthetic is great. Unfortunately it is poorly designed, mainly for one reason: the rear wheels are too close together and thus interfere with my daughter's feet when she's trying to walk.Yes, yes, I know that technically she's supposed to sit in the seat and \\"scoot\\". However, kids will likely want to do both and they can't.It would have been easy to design this product for both uses. The rear axle could have been made as wide as the font axle. Or better yet, include two rear axles in the packaging and let the parent choose which to employ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made cheaply.","review":"The screw that holds the handle bar did not fit since the holes where not aligned.

Every time she tried to push with her legs, her heels got caught on the back tires. And the seat is really far away for the target age. I don't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of Fun","review":"I bought this for my 20-month-old daughter as a pre-requisite to a tricycle. She LOVES it! It took her a little while to get used to the right motions to \\"scoot about\\" but once she did, she has enjoyed it more and more.What I like about it:1. The adjustable seat allows the right comfort level for my daughter who is petite.2. It's easy to assemble; it took me 15 minutes to assemble this--all by myself. And that includes going to get the necessary tools.3. It's durable; my daughter has ridden this lots and lots, and it requires little re-adjusting.4. It teaches children coordination and focus.5. It's great fun for my daughter!What I don't like: This is a new way for my daughter to terrorize our cats!Prepare for the smiles and the giggles. This is a great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprisingly sturdy","review":"My kid is a physical one. He got this as a present at his first birthday. It was by far his favorite gift and has played with it nearly daily for almost a year (has been great inside the house and out). He recently has taken to standing on it, which of course we try to stop. Still, he has never toppled over on it even with all of his 28 pounds on the bar between the front wheels. He has also balanced himself precariously on the center bar while holding the handle bars or a piece of furniture and has stood on the seat like Curious George. The one and only time he toppled it over was as he drove it off the steep side of our patio that is about 6 or 8 inches tall. Luckily it was into the grass and he was only scared, not hurt. I'm amazed by how well balanced this bike is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandmother for the first time","review":"My Grandson loves this scooter. He is on the tall side for 2 1/2 and this scooter is still a good size for him. The steering mechanism works well so staying on a curved sidewalk is no problem. It is sturdy but still light weight. The ONLY problem (and thank goodness) the wheel base is too wide to go down a Little Tykes slide. Yes my little dare devil thought that would be big fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"My 20 month old son loves this toy! He can stay with the big boys now! He wants to ride it all the time. Easy to assemble. So far no problems with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scoot About toy!","review":"I was a little skeptical about this when I bought it, since a number of reviews complained of the fitting of the parts together during assembly. I had no problem and it went together quickly and fit easily....I am guessing you need to have at least fundamental mechanical ability. Sturdy and well built and great for the just learning to walk toddler!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Gift","review":"I bought this for my 17 month old grand daughter she loves it. Perfect size and there are no pedals to get in the way. Great toy for little ones to learn coordination--moving forward, backward and turning."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Joy!","review":"My now 18 month old grandson flies around the house forward and backward. He mastered steering and pushing with his feet on day one at 17 months and way prefers it to a trike with pedals at this point in his locomotive skills!My husband put it together in about 20 easy minutes. There are so many pieces and parts I would have been overwhelmed at attempting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun take on a classic for toddlers!","review":"We first bought the Radio Flyer classic tricycle... and then realized our daughter isn't tall enough for the pedals yet. So we purchased the scoot-about, and it's GREAT! We love the classic Radio Flyer details, and it's very durable. The ability to adjust the seat height is great, because it means our tall toddler (20 mos) has been able to use it for several months and still has plenty of time left. She loves to scoot along, and to coast on the driveway and rest her feet on that front bar.All in all, very pleased with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun first trike","review":"This is such a cute little tricycle. My 2yr old seems to enjoy it. I like that it has an adjustable seat, and it was pretty easy to put together. He has short legs, so he should be able to use it for awhile. If your child has long legs, his/her heels may hit the back wheels while scooting around."},{"rating":"1","title":"heels keep hitting the rear wheels","review":"My son has been using this for close to 5 months now and he's had the same problem from day 1 - his heels keep hitting the rear wheels. I didn't really mind so much when he was just starting to walk but now that he's running around, he has learned to take baby steps while using it so his heels won't hit the rear wheels."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned mine","review":"Unfortunately, we had to return this bike. I assembled it and I have assembled many toys, but all 4 wheels would not sit on the ground. One wheel was never touching the ground. I called radio flyer, they were very nice by the way, and they re-sent me some parts and the problem still existed. I even had my father try, who is a boat builder by trade, and he had the same problem. Aside from this problem, the steering was very stiff and the wheels did not move freely enough, thus my son quickly lost interest. He was just shy of 2 at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"threewheels","review":"Fun was marked 4 because my grandson just turned 2 and cannot quite grasp how to get his feet/legs to move the bike. Educational..same reason as the first. However he knows it is red. He loves making the bell work. Very sturdy. Very well made. Overall a 4 again only because he hasn't used it that much by himself. He does however love to be pushed.Great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they test this?","review":"I agree with some other reviewers that this bike is poorly designed. Our daughter has the same problem of her feet hitting the back wheels when she tries to scoot. Some of the features are nice, like the adjustable height of the seat, the easy turning of the wheels using the handlebar, and she loves to ring the bell, but it is too frustrating for her to ride on this toy because her range of motion is limited by the wheels. She ends up trying to compensate by making the bike scoot backward. Not how it was intended to be used. It's a good looking bike, but the function is very poorly designed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"I bought this for my grandaughter's second birthday. It was too small for her and she isn't very large for her age. The quality was good and she liked the bell but was not able to ride it without her knees bumping into the handlebars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - POS","review":"This kids scootter/bike is a major pos.

RENT before you Buy ! !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of the flying guillotine","review":"One of the impeccable movies by Jimmy Wang Yu. It shows great kungfu skills, some of which are actual fights from the actor himself - a black belt karate expert.Amazon should import more of such movies which are now limited for viewing as a Malaysian company has bought the orginals from the owners.Also films by David Chiang/Ti Lung/Yueh Hua- Jimmy's successors, have further brought kungfu to a new era - more realistic punches and gore - Vengeance, The Heroic ones, New One-Armed Swordsman, Deadly Duo, Water Margin, etc.Cheers to Amazon for improving its film range. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your $$$","review":"I would have given this title 5 stars (I love the old-school kung fu classics!) except for one problem-the DVD would not play past a certain point (about 30 minutes into the film!)

Hope this review is helpful to my fellow kung fu fans out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just watch it","review":"Creative fight scenes and likable characters.

Can't say enough so I will leave it at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of its generation","review":"Great film for its generation!!! A remake today, with all the new, state-of-the-art visual effects would do this movie some justice. The villain is on point, while the hero is crafty. Good film to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Master of the Flying Guillotine","review":"I think any one who is interested in Kung Fu/ Martial Arts movies really MUST see this movie! It's got it all...the blind master of the flying guillotine (what a title!) out for revenge, the one armed martial arts teacher, who is the subject of said revenge and a fantastic martial arts tournament that feels like a precursor to Final Combat.A friend turned me on to this movie years ago, and we watched via a crappy vhs tape copy, so I was real happy to see it come out on DVD. The production value is on the cheap, and the dialogue dubbing certainly veers towards ridiculous (making it all the more fun!), but I bet you any thing that you are gonna wanna watch it over and over again! Highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story telling book to share with toddlers","review":"I'm a children's librarian and this is one of my favorite storytelling treats. It's utter nonsense, but the rhythm of the verse and the fun animals carry the day. Everyone loves chiming \\"Skunka Tanka, Skunka Tanka, Tanka Tanka Skunk!\\" My only advice: practice it a couple times before performing it before an audience. It can be tricky saying some of the alliterative lines, but they are so worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and GOOD for little kids","review":"I purchased this book to read to preschool kids to increase their understanding of word segmentation and rhythm, which it does.

It is not intended to be a police handbook - it is the cultural context of a tragic event as seen by two journalists who worked on the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this one.","review":"This book was very disappointing. Whilst it did give an overall feeling of Milat's background and the kind of person he is, the books is written in the language of the socioeconomic class of the people involved (bottom of the ladder), which after a few chapters is very irritating.The lack of forensic detail you would expect in this genre is sorely missing, and my overall feeling was that I would have been much better informed by simply reading the newspapers at the time.Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty painful","review":"There's one dance number in here that looks like it was choreographed by Salvador Dali on a $10 budget... and I can watch it over and over... but the rest of the movie is terrible. Maybe it's poor subtitling, but the jokes are thin and the plot is dull. I have a huge affinity for Bollywood and I admit my standards are pretty forgiving, but this one is really weak.It's such a shame because that one dance scene is so awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"iPod nano, A hit or horrible product?","review":"I have owned an iPod mini for about 5 months now, and when the nano came out I was considering selling my mini on ebay and then buying a nano.

The iPod mini is durable I dropped mine on brik pavers and it only has 3 scrates and it works perferct and it wasn't in a case it dropped because it fell out of the belt clip that came with it.

I do have to agree that it is VERY VERY FRAGILE! It's different than the older one, not talking about scratches at all, since that's reasonable. The LCD screen on the iPod Nano is absolutely the most fragile I've seen in electronics, mainly because it is SO thin. You cannot put ANY pressure onto the LCD screen, not even an accidental bump, it will ruin the screen with lines just like that! And yes, you cannot even drop it a foot above on anything, it will once again ruin the LCD screen. The iPod itself will be fine, it'll play no problem, and no scratches or damage on the surface of the iPod, but the LCD screen is done. Other than that, I LOVE the iPod Nano.

They were unwilling to make any exception or provide discounts on a replacement, \\"...our warranty clearly states...from the date of purchase...\\".

Think of this as a disposable purchase that will only last as long as the warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ipod yet !!!!!!","review":"Let me start off by saying that the only reason i gave this 4 stars is that ist does not include necessary things like a wall charger adapter. I have been through all the ipods that apple has released, and let me tell you, this is the best one. It is slim and stylish, and with 4 gigs of space a real stunner being so small. Sound quality is great since it has a flash drive and it doesn't skip around either. Don't forget that it also includes a nice velvety free case. And don't listen to all those people saying it breaks to easily...i have had mine for a while, and as long as you don't rough around with it it probably won't break. However it dos scrach easily so i suggest keeping on the plasticy cover that comes with it because it works just fine and at the same time protects the ipod.

If you turn off EQ and turn off the backlight the most you can expect is 7 hours. When Apple talks about this kind of playtime they means you never turn the machine off instead put it on play until it runs down in 12 or 14 hours. When you turn off your machine and put it back on, rewind the machine or shuffle it the battery goes downhill. There is no truth in advertising. However, with this said the machine is a delight, the sound is clear and I would not trade it. I keep a clear cover over the screen to protect it from scratching. I hope this helps.

I called apple, mailed it back and received a replacement. The SECOND replacement, did not work properly, I sent it back. I received replacement number 3, its dead, it does nothing. I have called customer service numerous times, and they have tried to reset it, I switched cables, I have tried everything they have suggested to me, its still dead. The customer service I have received is appalling, I have been 'disconnected' a number of times. I wish I could return the whole thing and get my money back!!! DONT DO ITI would also like to add I purchased the ipod in February, I expect to be given a new one this month (June) so every month I get a new IPOD that ultimately breaks, its infuriating and ridiculous.

This is the second one in a row I've had with this problem. And I've seen a lot of feedback on this in their forum. I think the problem is in the software, and so that holds out some hope that Apple may have a fix for it. In the meantime, I just stop and restart when that happens.I mostly listen to audiobooks; and the iPod nano is otherwise great for this purpose. In particular, I exploit very frequently the ability to re-position myself (down to the second) within the current book at any time.

In other words, NO GAPLESS PLAYBACK. Instead you get a split second of silence interrupting tracks that should run together without any disturbance.Completely unforgivable for a 5th generation product from the Market Leader!Bad Apple!GaryP.S. The MP3 format has a flaw which means some silence is always present at the end of a song. But the popular LAME encoding method for MP3s embeds a value containing the proper length of the track into the file so that the decoder can tell when the file should be cut and the next mp3 in sequence should start playing.

Apple claims \\"up to\\" 14 hours, so I can't fault them. Just be aware fooling with it will drain the battery faster, and you'll need an adapter or a computer with USB hookup to charge it again.I'm sure some people are hardcore and have their ipod hooked up to their computer every day, so it won't be a problem for most.The battery issue is just something to keep in mind if you take it on a trip.other than that, even though the screen is small, I like being able to put pictures on it.

I refuse to send it in for a battery replacement so that the same thing can occur once again next year. I think that I will just purchase the Zune which has so much more to offer than the Ipod and I will advise all others to do the same.

This material scratches even when wiping with a soft cotton t-shirt. The result is a device that looks as though it has been abused and neglected. I had only peeled off the protective cover and wiped the grease marks away when I noticed the first scratches across the whole length of the front. Damned annoying.Apple have an issue with this device and they need to fix it. Why should I be compelled to nuy a case that makes the player larger than it needs to be and why can't I put it, naked, in my pocket as advertised by Mr Jobs or wear it next to clothing?My advice, go and look at a display device in a store and make sure it is one which has the protective cover removed.

Well, I think they suck because they don't deliver.

Of course, it's NOT the ipod to watch movies on because the screen is so small, but even the video ipods have smaller screens. If you're gonna watch a movie, watch it on a TV.Everyone wishes for an everlasting battery, but this battery is not bad.

I'm rarely this pleased with purchases. Simply put, this iPod is superior in every way. Prehaps most importantly is the Nano's weight and size. Looking at pictures doesn't do it justice, you have to really hold one in your hand to realize its true size. I found the lighter weight was a noticable improvement over the Mini when I'm out running. Additionally the battery life is superior and the screen is sharper and brighter (not to mention being in color.) While I had read some warnings about the ease of scratching the screen I've yet to have this happen. Additionally the price of these Nano's is higher than the Mini's they're replacing.

It usually runs out of juice in the 6-7 hour range. Not a show-stopper since I'm not an ultra-marathoner (yet - ha!), but disappointing in light of everything else it offers.

Truly one of the best albums I've ever bought, and the liner notes are pretty decent. (Great picture of him with his ride on the cover). Buy it with confidence.

Even the out-of-print \\"40 Greatest Hits\\" double set doesn't do him justice. Go ahead and get the 10-c.d. \\"Complete Hank Williams.\\" He's worth it! Besides, prices are firming up, the set won't always be available, and you can leave it to your descendents. To them, it'll be like listening to Abraham Lincoln or George Washington."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thornton's Talking Critters","review":"Burgess was the model for talking animal stories. His characters use good English, are modeled on real behavior of the beast in question, and there is a minimal plotline. Mostly written for what is now about a first to third grade level, the stories are a good 'read aloud' for pre-schoolers as well. Move on from these to Wind in the Willows (Grahame), Wainscot Weasel, or Brian Jacques' Redwall series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better early, than late","review":"When I ordered this two-book combo, I had already read a copy of the first volume. This set was actually bought in order to replace it after a \\"water-damage incident.\\" I also wanted to read the second volume, to find out what the rest of the story was. With this set, you might as well have both books. But if you don't, I prefer the first over the second.I'll just state that part, if not most, of the second half could have been left unwritten. As one of the short stories says, Sherlock himself would write 'dry', actionless accounts, and this seems to have happened in \\"The Memoirs Of Sherlock Holmes.\\" This is somewhat remedied in a m\\"made for T.V.\\" series- starring Jeremy Brett- which makes any storyline changes seem light-handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sherlock Holmes Entire Series","review":"Best series I've purchased!

Brand New in plastic wrap, split into two paperback compilations in hardbox, shipped promptly, couldn't be happier!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great stories but....","review":"I bought the Kindle addition. Of couse the stories are great and i would rate 5-star but the text is filled with type errors. One other reviewer wrote there are no typos, but there are many. I own a hard copy of all of stories so it is easy for me to check. I didn't notice it at first, probably because of the many Britsh words and usages, but now it has become quite annoying.Also someone wrote there is no index. There is but it isn't the easiest to get toThe text to speech is terrible.Like I said, great stories. The price is right but look for a differnt version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete But Not Great","review":"I purchased this EXACT same copy for $20 @ Barnes & Noble last summer... it is definitely a handsome book, but not worth anything near the $110 list price on here! I doubt the cover is genuine leather and the embossing is already beginning to peel on my copy; even though I read it often, I was hoping it would stand up to wear and tear a little better than it has. There are also several typos and very annoying \\"fixes\\" to a few of the Canon inconsistencies, such as the changing of the dates in Wisteria Lodge from 1892 to 1895.This is a great starter for someone who wants to read the complete short stories/novels, and does spruce up the bookshelf, but not the greatest or most accurate version. Besides that, the small print was hellish on my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Omne ignotum pro magnifico","review":"The adventures of Sherlock Holmes are as exiting as they are mysterious. This collection of them is nicely packaged into two volumes. The first volume of this collection contains \\"A Study in Scarlet\\", \\"The Sign of Four\\", \\"Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes\\", and \\"The Hound of Baskervilles\\". All of these parts contain many plot twists and ingenious observations by Sherlock Holmes. Alongside him is Dr. Watson who catalogues these accounts in first person. The books go through the introduction of Watson and Holmes, to the revealing of Holmes' drug addiction, ending with Watson's marriage, while solving what seems to be the smallest, least important crimes. These grow into the most insidious plots. This is a great read that could be read again and again. It is a must have in any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need glasses?

I first read The Complete Sherlock Holmes when I was 8 (not difficult reading and very enjoyable) and have been an afficionado ever since.

A must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bantam Books","review":"Just bought a book by Bantam Books. Probably the worst printed book I have ever purchased. Printed words so close to the binding you can barely read them.

It was great fun then, and I still enjoy reading things like how Watson discovers Holmes is unaware that the earth goes about the sun. Holmes says the knowledge is useless to him, and he will endevor to forget it, and he likens the mind to an attic wherein, upon reaching some fullness, something must be removed if something else is to be added. And the relative values of the items must be evaluated. The collection would be a nice gift instead of another video game or DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Kindle ready","review":"It was encouraging to see a complete Sherlock Holmes set on Kindle. But although it is readable, Kindle makes frequent mistakes about location and reverts to other books when moving from chapter to chapter in one selection. I gave up trying to read when it would inexplicably made a hyperspace leap to another unnamed book or short story and require careful searching to find the actual volume and page I had just been reading. This Kindle edition needs to be fixed or junked. It ain't worth even a buck as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Of course it's great. It's Sherlock Holmes.","review":"We all know that these are the best detective stories ever, so I'll contain my review to this book.It is the only one volume edition.

These are often published separately, but this Doubleday edition contains every one of them in one package.If you're really into measuring footprints and analyzing cigarette ash then this is the book you need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great content, but poor formatting for Kindle","review":"I love Sherlock Holmes, and thought this would be a great thing at a great price.Trouble is, it doesn't look all that great on the Kindle. They don't use typesetter's quotes (smart quotes), and so it looks more like an old DOS screen than a book, especially given how much dialog is in these books. Other books on the Kindle look a lot better.If you care about your ebooks looking like books, don't get this edition.I recommend this edition instead:The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Collection of all his adventures; 9 Volumes in one Book)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A gift","review":"This book was a gift for my son-in-law, and he was thrilled to receive it before a recent road trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent condition, cheap price","review":"This is I would say one of the best deals.

Not an issue for me, but the print is small."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reasonably priced Holmes Collection","review":"Anyone who is at least moderately interested in mystery stories should make an effort to make themself familiar with Sherlock Holmes. It is widely known that Holmes is one of the best fictional detectives ever, but it it surprising how many people have not actually read any of his stories. The Gramercy Books edtion of the Complete Sherlock Holmes (ISBN 0517220784) is probably the best deal as it is the cheapest hardcover edition I have been able to find (Holmes deserves hardcover). This is definitely a book that any self-respecting mystery lover will locate on his shelf. One small note is that the print is a little on the small side (newspaper size) and is in two columns, but this merely allows the book to avoid being an oversized monstrosity like some other editions are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Reader plus a great writer; what more could you ask?","review":"Recently I had the pleasure of listening to an audio cd of The Complete Sherlock Holmes (Classics Fiction) by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and sold by: pbshopus through Amazon.com and read by David Timson. You can turn this on and sit back with closed eyes and you are almost there. His voice characterizations are a great addition to the stories.

And the value of all four novels and all the short stories for under a buck is ridiculous. However, the number of typos here is outrageous, and it's particularly off-putting here because of the exquisite craft of the writing. There were several instances in the first few stories I read where a series of typos changed the meaning of the story, causing me to go back and re-read. The exact kind of irritating experience I don't want when I'm reading purely for pleasure. Why can't someone simply proofread and correct the Kindle version before it's published? I am sure they've sold a thousand Kindle versions of this book. If Amazon charged $1.49 instead of $.99, they could pay some smarty-pants grad student $500 to proofread and I bet they'd have lost very few sales.

The good thing about this collection that is that it brings together a wide array of the stories---long and short.

Yes, UNREADABLE. There is another book of the complete Sherlock Holmes and it is CHEAPER. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GET THE PAPERBACK.Sir Arthur Conan Doyle deserves much better than this and so do you, his patient, yet victimized readers. Something like this needs a spit on the ground.

When I read the first story- A Study in Scarlet, which is a classic in itself, I was simply fascinated. Many of the stories have minimum violence and are solved with the simplest ease by the Master. His deductions are drawn from what seems to us as obvious, but we could never dream of ever ataining such high powers of observation.

(And I think it likely that the 2nd viewing was just to make sure that I hadn't missed any redeeming qualities that the film didn't appear to have.) The high point for me was when one of the characters couldn't pronounce Durango. The rest of the movie was so bad I've blocked most of it out. Just chalk it up to an hour and a half of my life that I'll never get back.Sorry I can't give a more detailed review, but that just gives you an idea of how lame this movie is.

It is clear that Mr. Miles' lacks an understanding of certain basic hermeneutic and exegetical principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous!","review":"I loved this book and I came here to find more books similar in style to Mile's book. Miles' analyzes the life of Christ and why God allowed Christ to be crucified. Or, since Christ was God, why Christ allowed himself to be crucified! Israel is under rule by the Romans and is awaiting the Messiah--however when the Messiah comes, He brings a new covenant with the Lord. Instead of guaranteeing Israel victory over its enemies, God breaks this promise and instead delivers the entire world victory over death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Look at Christ through fresh eyes","review":"Jack Miles really explored Jesus Christ as a person in a fresh and interesting way in this book. I believe both Christians and unbelievers can read this book with an open mind and come away having investigated a real Jesus not caught up in the dogmatic religious views as if Jesus never lived in a real time and place and had human experiences both bad and good. Miles does a great job breaking down the scriptures and examining them for what took place and eaximing Jesus as a real flesh and blood person in great detail.He uses the gospels as if they were 100% true to examine Christ as literary character. It was an enlightening read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imaginative and thought-provoking","review":"I tried to read this same author's \\"God: A Biography\\" and for some reason found it heavy going ... but this seemed much shorter, and in fact I couldn't put it down.As someone who preaches, I appreciate the talent that Miles has to take scripture and ask \\"why did it happen this way, and not some other way?\\" His insight into what it really meant for Jesus to die for our sins, and in some sense to atone for them, and why his father asked Jesus to suffer, is a brilliant perspective on a subject that can so easily be reduced to pious platitudes. God's relationship with us isn't a simple thing sometimes, and the usual explanations just often won't do.I don't think you need to hold this to a standard of orthodox theology (which isn't its goal), but instead to a standard of whether it is a resource helpful for someone trying to come to terms with some of scripture's contradictions.

I find that for most students, if they will take the time to read the lesson well, do all of the problems, and then rework any problems they miss then they will achieve a high degree of mastery of the material at hand.The greatest advantage of Saxon Math is that each lesson provides practice not only for the new problems but also built-in review for every kind of problem the student has previously encountered. Math 54 is no exception to the rule that Saxon Math texts help students learn math well. After Math 54, all of my kids who have taken it were definitely ready to move on to the next level.In general, Saxon Math, including Math 54, is highly recommended. It is especially ideal for homeschooling families."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This is a great book for primary math. The lessons are easy to follow. The daily practice problems build upon prior lessons, creating the reptitive learning the younger learners need.

Instead of seeing simple, common terminology such as \\"add\\" or \\"subtract\\", I saw \\"some, some more\\" and \\"larger, smaller, difference\\". What this book has done is take basic concepts that are familiar to nine-year-olds and convoluted them, apparently trying to make simple tasks even easier. With books like these, which fail to use standard terminology, it's no wonder that America's youth is struggling with math skills. Addition and subtraction are basic skills that all students must know, and this book is doing our bright kids a disservice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit","review":"I popped off the top filter cover, unscrewed the two covers and the filters popped right into place!

The Honeymooners had been my favorite TV show for years but I found it silly and boring as did my husband. It mainly centered about Jackie Gleason playing all the characters he was famous for- all in one episode. Even Art Carney wasn't funny.

One major flaw with \\"The Honeymooners\\" is that the show is so darn BORING! You can predict the story and outcome right away.The tiresome lines and stilted phrases are bad enough, but the dreaded \\"homminas\\" are extremely annoying.

In \\"Straw Men\\" the author returns to the exquisitely intricate plotting and tormented, morally ambiguous characters that made the first book so great. There's a nice plot twist reminiscent of \\"L.A. Confidential\\" (the movie version, not the book), and a subtle but ever-present erotic tension simmering beneath the surface of the story. Jim Christensen is one of the few protagonists in mystery genre who really comes off as an authentic ordinary person. Smart, but not too smart, and far from masterful. He's a genuine soccer dad with coffee stains on his tie who struggles to cope with with the perplexing mysteries of everyday life, as well as the occasional crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Simple","review":"'Straw Men' is a disappointingly simple book. Mr. Smith guides the reader along a predictable and sometimes aggravatingly obvious path throughout the story. The clues in this mystery novel leave nothing for the reader to deduce on their own.There is no reason you'll need your brain for this read. Everything will be throughly explained to you and that is what is so sad about it. You are treated like a obtuse three year-old.If don't think it's suspicious when a beat cop has a $50k Mercedes SUV as a second vehicle, this book might be a good challenge for you.

Nonetheless, he had a considerable influence on later jazz trumpet players, including Donald Byrd, Lee Morgan, Booker Little, Freddie Hubbard, Valery Ponomarev, and Wynton Marsalis.I am not a big fan of \\"With Strings\\" albums, but this one ranks with the \\"With Strings Albums of Chet Baker, Charlie Parker & Paul Desmond.There is no need to name the songs; Amazon has already given a full set of samples on this site. They are all ballads, & what more can I say.

He died tragically in an auto accident."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Bread Jazz","review":"These \\"with strings\\" albums were designed to appeal to the larger white audience and, sadly, they generally worked. They gave the buyer the feeling that they were really \\"with it\\" by buying an album by a true Jazz star. But it was and remains an illusion. Hefti's schamltzy arrangements eviscerate the Jazz elements from the music, rendering it an anomalous, dessicated mush. The two stars I give it are for Brownie who shines through even against the overwhelming obstacle of these arrangements.

If this exact book had been written by someone with less potential, I'd probably have enjoyed it more -- but I bought it being familiar with Stross' track record on his later novels, and was expecting more than I got.The book's biggest flaw, besides an incomprehensible political situation with warring clans of merchants, is that so much of the story comes from exposition. Rather than having his characters really experience the world, and the story being shown rather than told, the characters spout huge blocks of expository dialogue, so they end up telling you more than showing you.I'd say stay away from this one. It's not horrible, but it's not interesting enough to try and slog through the dialogue and the politics to try to find the nuggets of good story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too close to what he hates","review":"One of the enjoyments I have of reading fantasy is that you often get a view that is different from yours.

Put him on one side of the teeter-totter and the worst Neocon on the other and they will balance it perfectly.He doesn't even bother to hide some names. It is a biased portrait of the worst of Dubya's gang. Lord know, there is little need for such exaggeration. It carries it to the point that you want to see Stross water-boarded.The writing starts out well. The premise is interesting. Then, like so many overreaching series, it falls apart.

As a divorcee I don't think she is obsessing about her divorce; it is something that changes a person and she is reflecting that change. What Miriam is obbessed with is her own smarts. It is very odd to me that she is alternately very intelligent or very dumb. And she does have a supernatural ability to avoid potentially life threatening situations.The world is different and well developed. The interesection between the two isn't great. The romance was too sudden for my tastes, but makes sense. I am looking forward to the next book in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising start, but next books get worse and worse","review":"Good idea, but stereotypical characters, and way too much repitition of themes in the following books. There are much better series to start reading. Throughout the book I was intrigued but nothing lives up to its potential."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big mess","review":"The author tells a good story but really needs to work harder. Even the main characters lack definition, and their personalities drift something awful. Some conversations make no sense except from the author's perspective - he alone knows what's going on. Alas, it is a good story, but the price in reader suffering is very high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a whole book","review":"I can't believe anyone would rate this well. It is not a story, it is a portion of a story. 300 loosely packed pages later, Mr. Stross stops the story so that he can sell the next volume for another $7 (or $17 hardcover).It is a sad state of affairs that he can so rest on his laurels as to put this lackluster effort forward.Wait for the combined volume a few years from now, maybe then it will be a worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning: Seriesbait Ahead","review":"While The Family Trade is unabashedly the gateway drug for a longer series, it is also a nice little trip. The beginning is a bit exposition-heavy, but the premise is intriguing and well executed. Once the action gets going the book is almost impossible to put down. I won't bother to summarize the plot - there are plenty of other summaries on this page. Suffice to say that I would recommend this book to anyone who wants a good time and doesn't mind getting hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine work from Stross","review":"Stross' homage to Zelazny explores the concept of parallel worlds. I've just finished it, and it left me really wanting to read the other 5 books of the series (of which 3 more are currently in print.)For me, a fan of Zelazny's Amber, this was a fresh take on old favorates, with protagonists of more human scope... but it still involves Machiavellian family politics and Stross' usual 'ultra-current' technological and business perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE GREATEST SERIES TO COME OUT OF THE 90's","review":"Darien Lambert (Dale Midkiff) was a Time Cop from the future who went back in the past to send fugitives back to there own time.

These two Red Ryder films deserve better.Stagecoach to Denver is from a soft 16mm dupe print which has some segments that are very dark. However, it will suffice for viewing on a small, regular television screen. Don't bother watching on an HD screen.Homesteaders of Paradise Valley is from a substandard 16mm dupe print which is soft but has much surface noise and flickering white horizontal lines. Also, some outdoor scenes are very dark. The soundtrack has an intermittent hum. Overall, this is fair to poor.These are available on Amazon for $2.60 with shipping. I think that is too much. If you can find this at a Dollar store, it is worth a dollar but not more.

After a little over a year the lamp failed. The original lamp lasted 3 years. Amazon would not stand behind the product, giving only a one year warranty and neither would Samsung. Samsung gives only 90 days. I believe all warranties giving such a minimal time frame for replacement are ridiculous. Great companies like Sears especially the Craftsman line would give you a direct replacement no questions asked, insuring repeat business.

You should be certified by a major agency like PADI or NAUI before diving i.e. you get their manuals as part of their training which tells you most of the things you need to know. The rest comes from practise and more advanced training.

The filter itself looks the same, but if you looked inside the fitting, they sprayed the black paint inside the thread and sealing areas. How do I know if the paint is not spray inside the filter element? I used magnifying glass to look inside, it seems it does have some black paint. I believe this is wrong, gasoline can melt the paint and cause injector clog up. When I looked at my old filter, both ends had no paint covering the fittings as well as in the thread area.Unless Fram can tell me I am wrong. I will advice reader a zero star for Fram gas filters!!

Here they omited the background the photo had & replaced it with white. Who's idea was it anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just kind of weak","review":"So I guess I was a little gullible for placing any stock in the whole \\"most frightening novel ever\\" stuff that is plastered all over the cover of this book. Like another review noted, there is the \\"germ\\" of a good, and frightening, book here. But is never really develops.It is also a little difficult to look past Simmions' disparaging description of the citizens and culture of India. Before beginning the book, I was aware that \\"Calcutta as a nexus of evil\\" was to be one of the major premises of the story. Still, I expected the author to approach that notion with more sophistication than simply portraying India and Indians as uncivilized and inferior.I purchased this book because I enjoyed one of Simmons' other works, Hyperion. Song of Kali was no where near as good. It was easy to read. The plot developed at a suitable pace. It simply didn't amount to much."},{"rating":"2","title":"National Geographic crossed with Pure Evil","review":"Reading this excellent book, I was swept by the wordly grandeur of exotic (though corrupt and crude) Calcutta, India; and I was swept by the horror and mystery of pure evil as well.This book reads like a real-life story of a professional man who travels to a far away land and encounters the truly evil. The writing is top-notch and conjures up pictures quite deftly. This is a great horror novel. It'll keep you on the edge of your seat and you won't be able to put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was blown away by Dan Simmons' Hyperion series (and I'm not a sci-fi fan), so I was eagerly anticipating this book after reading all the rapturous reviews. I didn't find it scary, just gross - and, overall, terribly sad. It paints a horrible picture of Calcutta, with filth, vermin, death and disease everywhere.It probably says more about me that I have no problem whatsoever believing in vampires, ESP, monsters, ancient gods come to life, etc., but I just can't see why anyone would bring their infant to such a nasty place! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"More Pulp Than Poetry","review":"After all the raves for Simmons' supposedly finely crafted prose, I expected something quite poetic--ala Rushdie. But Simmons' style is a lot closer to Elmore Leonard than I expected. More pulp than poetry. Frankly, I found his writing pedestrian. If you consider the unimaginative M. Night Shyamalan to be an engaging director of horror films, Simmons might bring the night terror you're looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"The book is extremely predictable and the story is just one cliché after another. One extra star for good depiction of the city."},{"rating":"2","title":"An original work of horror","review":"First off, be warned, Simmons can be extremely graphic. This is not a book for the faint of heart. He spares no expense in depicting some truly vile and horrific images. Some of the passages are extremely vivid and disturbing. I think, at times, Simmons is overly explicit in some of his descriptions, which is the only complaint I have with this book.That being said, this is, overall an excellent book. I was hooked within the first few pages. His writing is straightforward, and strongly evocative. I have never been to Calcutta, or any place like it, yet I had no problem envisioning it Simmons has a talent for making the reader feel for and fear for his characters, something that is lacking in most books of this genre.This is one of the most original horror books you will ever read. I recommend this book, and as I have read the entire Hyperion series, anything else written by Simmons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertainingly quick read, but a new edition is needed, badly.","review":"I have never encountered a paperback book of any kind, fiction or non-fiction, that had as many punctuation and spelling errors as this one. It actually became distracting at times. That being said, the story is a decently written novel about India and how it is the worst place in the entire world. I'm looking forward to exploring more about India, partly to figure out what the hell Dan Simmons' problem was with the place. From the one page \\"prologue\\", it is clear that Simmons is virulently hateful of India.I was told it was one of the scariest novels ever written. While it has managed to haunt my thoughts, I believe that is a result more out of wonder if India is really as evil as it is in the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I was quite satisfied with \\"Summer of night\\" (while the ending wasn't that great, the writing was excellent, suspense never faded) so I had some high expectations of his work 'Song of Kali'.What a disappointment this book is. All characters are cardboard-like (one would think Simmons would have at least some character development, maybe not an a lá King, but 300+ pages obviously didn't allow him to do that? I felt there is more character development in any of the S. King's short stories @ 15-20 pages) and the dialogue is painfully boring and stiff.The plot is \\"ok\\", only at a first glance, but the way he tries to get deeper into it (or the lack of it!) leaves much to be desired. I felt like Mr Simmons had a great idea but got tired of it along the way, and sent the first draft to the editor and later the publisher company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What It Proclaims To Be","review":"I picked up Song of Kali because it was tauted as being a horror novel. It clearly was not. It was a novel about a city with a very seedy and violent nature, but it was not a horror novel. I personally feel robbed that it was advertised as such and obviously wasn't.If you want to read a novel about Calcutta and the underbelly of its society, then by all means read this novel. But, don't expect too much. What little plot there was could be seen coming from miles away. My advice would be to buy a used copy or get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected too much","review":"I had high expectations about this book, somehow driven by the good reviews.But it didn't took long before I began turning pages thinking \\"maybe it's now this is gonna warm up\\", just to find out it didn't. And it never did.Except for some curiosities about the indian way of life/culture and the description of Calcuta, the story doesn't have more to hook the reader. I felt disapointed at the end and felt this is a book I wouldn't spend money on if I could turn back time. Consider yourself advised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well Written and Crafted Story. Engrossing.","review":"I discovered this book by Harlan Ellison's recommendation in his documentary. I was expecting much more of a fantasy element, and not so much of a crime/mystery genre, but Song of Kali made up for it in a well told and well written story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great atmospheric horror","review":"This book takes you on a trip straight into the hellhole that is Calcutta. Although the book has some great supernatural elements (quite reminiscent of Lovecraft), it is the real life occurrences that are most creepy. Simmons depicts the utter depravity and morbidity of Calcutta with such verve, such immediacy, that you feel as if you are with him in the dark alleys and crowded plazas, surround by scarred and diseased beggars and knowing that one more murder in this city wouldn't make one hell of a difference. If you like quick, intense horror then give this book a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuck with me for years!","review":"One of the most disturbing books I've ever read. You'll feel the heat and smell the stench of Calcutta. Dan Simmons really takes you there. Just like the Goddess Kali, it's horrifying and yet too fascinating to just look away. Just like the hero you'll walk into the trap of your own free will and discover too late that you're hooked into something really nasty. Too amazingly good to be a first novel. He won a Fantasy award for it. If you like horror, you've got to check this out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great setting, shaky plot","review":"The strength of this book is its stunning power of setting: the misery and festering evil that is this version of Calcutta. The scenes live and breathe and are vicarious fun to drift through - just like a movie.However, the hero is extremely unlikable, constantly exploding like a five year-old prone to tantrums and impulsive behavior. Also, the plot has real credibility problems. Why did the hero take his wife and baby to such an awful place as Calcutta? He knew he was inconveniencing his wife (a math professor who had work to do), and he also knew that she, while Indian, was not steeped in the right culture to serve as an effective interpreter and guide for him.Why? Well, obviously to put them in danger as a clumsy plot device. Ultimately, the plot problems capsize the interest of the setting. I wouldn't recommend this one unless you want to try a library copy first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good depiction of urban poverty and spiritual terror","review":"If you are intersted in this book, DO NOT READ THE REVIEWS BELOW. The reviews below give away MAJOR plot points and ruined my reading of what would have been a suspenseful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Dan Simmons rocks","review":"Dan Simmons manages to take the tourist fears of third world countries and make them palatable enough that you not only sympathize with these people, you never want to travel to the places that they travel.This book is a rich textured trip into hell-on-earth as the poverty and decay slowly overwhelm the narrator and his wife. The caste system, drug dealers and apologists all work together to create an eerie hopeless desperation that the main character can only deny by the barest shred of rationalization.I am only giving this book 4 stars because the ending is stupid (it's an urban legend for chrissakes) but the trip there is just too horrifying to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and silly","review":"SONG OF KALI is a combination of non-sensical plot choices (ex. the protagonist decides to bring his infant daughter from the US to India on a short business trip; the \\"rationale\\" given for this is so pathetically feeble, the author might just as well SAY \\"so the baby can be placed in danger for plot purposes\\"), repellant characters (particularly the protagonist, who's foolish, mean-spirited, rude, self-absorbed, racist... 300 pages spent with this jerk felt like a long, LONG time), fantasy/horror elements that don't manage to get off the ground, and storytelling that's heavy-handed and simple-minded. The whole novel comes across as if the author hated Calcutta so much during his brief visit to the city that he felt compelled to glorify his \\"ick! ick! ICK!\\" reaction by turning that reaction into a one-dimensional novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary? Ha!","review":"To all those people saying how incredibly frightening this book is: You must get scared VERY easily. I was only bored. Nothing happened in this book for so long. At one point some guy with glasses and lots of pimples tells a l-o-n-g story that FINALLY reveals a dead man being brought back to life. And what scary stuff does this dead man do? Nothing. He just walks away. End of chapter.I am totally mystified what anyone would find frightening or unsettling about this book. This is the Blair Witch Project of the literary world--lots of great reviews and then it turns out to be nothing. Go read The Exorcist or The Shining if you want something spooky. Those of you thought THIS book was, try Little Red Riding Hood next--it has a very frightening wolf in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism, or just ignorance?","review":"Wow... worst book ever written. It's depiction of one of India's holiest cities and it's inhabitants is deluded at best, and diabolically racist at it's worst. Not to mention how many Hindus (myself included) his depiction of our beloved Goddess, Kali Ma... Hindus definitely don't sacrifice people to Kali... most Hindus are at the very least semi-vegetarians. Disgusting anti-religious sentiment and racist hatred is what summarizes this book best.Jai Sri Kali Mata!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever read!","review":"Where can I begin to descibe how awful this book was? How about that they murder the main characters baby in Calcutta to smuggle jewels in it Or that the author goes into an agonizing long description of stealing a bloated foul smelling corpse that was a drowning death. Or The long drawn out tale about a Hindu Goddess named Kali who wants human blood as an offering. Yuck!! That is the best way to descibe this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this 0 stars if possible. The worst book I ever read this year.","review":"I have never read A dan simmons book before, I'm never going to read another book by him. The fact that this won the World Fantasy Award is more disturbing to me than the novel itself. I found the novel really xenophobic and meanly racist. Never going to read any of this racist author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"rebuttal to the sony hater","review":"It's amazing how anyone could rate this package as one star. Have you listened to the music, man? This is a fine representation of Duke's Columbia recordings, and guess what ... it's actually affordable, as opposed to RCA's mammoth 18-CD compilation. As to the other points about how the label hasn't preserved Ellington's heritage ... where were you last year when they released several of Duke's best albums with fantastic pictures, excellent essays and interesting bonus tracks. (Ellington Meets Count Basie, Ellington at Newport 1956 and the Anatomy of a Murder soundtrack are three fine examples of what I'm talking about.) Get with the program and stop grinding your ax. And for anyone looking for a solid representation of this great composer and bandleader's work with the Columbia label, this is a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another slipshod job by Sony/Columbia Legacy","review":"It hurts not to give every Duke Ellington collection a rave review. But somebody needs to take Sony to task for its poor packaging of jazz giants. While the music here is mostly fine, it's another pick-and-choose collection that leaves out so many essentials of each period.Sony didn't have the guts to follow RCA's lead on The Duke and produce a comprehensive and complete set of the master's recordings from their vaults. Now I guess we have to wait until the bicentennial.Sony should just get out of the jazz business. They stink. Their representations of Count Basie's classic recordings are a travesty. To date, Teddy Wilson's best dates remain unreleased. I could go on and on. Jazz aficianados know the score.The only artists they've represented well are Miles Davis and Billie Holiday. Why? They sell. Therein lies the whole big Sony lie. They don't care about the historical significance of the music. They only care about the bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Record From Two Amazing Musicians","review":"I agree with the other reviewers, these guys were great and they never got the recognition they deserved.

As a parent what do you do when you realize your own child is a psychotic killer? The mother in this story is as true a character as I've ever seen and is put in a terrible position where she has to choose between doing the right thing and protecting many or protecting her own child. I won't give away the ending, but it's well worth the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professionalism in Acting","review":"Acting at it's best. So well written and So well performed. Outstanding movie with and outstanding ending. Recommend to all. It was written and performed for the stage and brought to the screen. Many of the orignal performers from the stage such as Nancy Kelly and Patty McCormack lead an all star cast. Eileen Heckart personifies a distraught mother who has lost her only child as she consumes drink after drink in an intoxicating paranoia against Rhoda as she searches for the truth of the death of her son. I always like Eileen, she played a terffic part in the Fugitve episodes with David Janssen as nun on her way to renounce her vows. 2-Part Episode: Angels Travel on Lonely Roads. And Rhoda, well she is just the perfect little thing, I love her to death!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Twisted Daughter","review":"Patty McCormack is THE BAD SEED. This is a twisted and shocking tale. Whatever you do, do not trade a basket full of kisses for as basket full of hugs with Patty McCormack. You may just get more than you bargained for. McCormack gives a chilling and incredibly detached performance as a sweet child whose vividly demented aspirations of obtaining simple possessions of others reap horrific acts on her part.Nancy Kelly as her mom and Eileen Heckart as the mother of one of her victims both give emotionally gripping and heart wrenching performances.Composer Alex North brilliantly put \\"Au Claire de la Lune\\" to effective use as McCormack played this piece on the piano throughout the film raising the tune to demented proportions. It is totally nerve racking."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little girl you love to hate","review":"The girl in this movie is the poster child for the lack of child discipline in the world.This film was obviously a stage play converted to film, as the actor blocking and set layout - as well as the styles and primary dialog of the main characters are done as if to an audience. But its just such a great story about an evil little girl, you tend to ignore the faults of the film itself.I have to say that the performance by the little girl is just fantastic - the way her countenance changes in an instant when she doesn't get her way. That was one talented girl, and this is a classic film -- one that my wife and I rent every once in a while (partly to remind ourselves how great our kids are)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie but goodie!","review":"I saw this movie about 50 years ago as a child. It has a poignant ending and very interesting subject matter. Not only is a good movie to watch for the theme, it is interesting due to the \\"old\\" ways they do some of the things at the end of the movie to introduce actors. A must to see for those who love old movies and interesting themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Seed---So Evolved for it's Time!","review":"The acting in this movie, the script, the raw emotion and the chilling horrific tale of a child killer were brilliant and so far ahead of it's time.

A must have in any movie collection as an original and classic horror w/out the insulting grafics of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good But Not Perfect","review":"At the beginning of the tape, there is a blank screen for a couple of seconds...I contacted the seller, but they never responded back...Overall, it is a good tape"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not stand the test of time","review":"A child murderer must have seemed chilling in the 50's but this film does not inspire much fear today. A little girl (supposedly born with psychopathic genes) goes out and kills people while her mother initially refuses to believe that her daughter is capable of such acts. Once the mother accepts that her daughter is indeed a killer, she battles her emotions over what to do. The characters in the film were ridiculous (creepy maintenance man, nosy and clueless landlady, the child's husband, the (drunk) victim's mother stood out the most The head scratching behavior exhibited from these characters killed any realistic drama the film might have sought the viewer to feel. Would not recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avert Your Ears","review":"Despite the Oscar nominations and Golden Globe wins, THE BAD SEED has not aged all that well. It was adapted from a Broadway play taken from a best-selling novel that remains largely stage-bound with lots of expository material left to reveal plot and character. The acting honors are well-deserved, especially young Patty McCormack as the murderous brat but Nancy Kelly's raspy whine is hard to take, inevitably reaching a near-howl as the story unfolds. Just when I was ready to hit the 'stop' button, the grieving, drunken mom played marvelously with a tinge of humor by Eileen Heckart showed up--twice--thank goodness. Does anyone see a potential tv sitcom here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Really Bad Seed","review":"I saw this movie on late night tv as a kid... a little cute blond girl... prim and proper with pigtails, white socks and patent leather shoes... oh so Disney... NOT! When I first saw it it was spooky... including the absolutely surprising ending. Now, as an adult, it goes far beyond that. It's a brilliant movie! for a movie made in the fifties it's a 3-Dimensional movie covering a lot of ground. Is this cute little unfeeling killer carrying a genetic code that dooms her? Is this science, a bad-to-the-bone child murderer or just a brat without boundaries? And the final thought... does God step in? Heavy duty stuff. And after the movie, when the credits are rolling there's a post-script scene that tips it's hat to the censor board... Helluvah movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"High Definition It Isn't!","review":"With all the reviews of THE BAD SEED already posted here, it doesn't seem necessary to add any more comments about the film itself. However, if you're thinking of \\"upgrading\\" your DVD of this movie to Blu-ray, don't bother. The picture quality on this disc, as a previous viewer noted, is substandard for ANY format. All the things you would expect from a good Blu-ray edition, such as finely detailed images and remarkable clarity and contrast, are totally missing with this release. It's also worth noting that the DVD was presented in a standard version, while the Blu-ray is in widescreen 1:85:1. This might seem to be an improvement, but all indications are that the picture area has simply been enlarged to fill the screen. Many scenes seem rather awkwardly framed, with the actors' heads almost cut off at the top. Sad to say it, but I think this was a low-budget rush job to get the disc out in time for Halloween. Very disappointing, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Seed","review":"An eight year old girl--a quintessenial psychopath--kills a schoolmate, an old woman, an apartment janitor and prompts the suicide of her dispairing mother before fate intervenes bringing this \\"bad seed\\" to her own premature finish. Rhoda, the most remarkable 8 year old child. There is a matureness about her that is desturbing in a child. The direction of this movie is remarkable in that much is skillfully left to the imagination of the viewer, while at the same time leaving no doubt in your mind as to the actions. This movie has an excellent story, well told and with a strong impact. Timeless, and worth having in your library."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive wicked child","review":"If you love horror films and psychological drama, you must see this film. Melodramatic performances are over-the-top.

This is an old movie that provides the opportunity to see some actors such as Peter Graves and Eileen Brennan early in their careers but the star is Patty McCormack who was introduced in this movie. PM plays a Rhoda who is so sweet and engratiating it makes your teeth curl, but she is a murderer and no one has caught on to this by the end of the movie. Great movie and always wanted to live in that apartment. The movie is certainly different that regular fair and made me want to know more about Christine's background and when PM was caught."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Play's the Thing!","review":"The stage version of \\"The Bad Seed\\" was brilliant with an equally brilliant ending.The movie is much too stagey, a bit too Broadwayesque in its presentation, that is, practically filming a stage show with all its limitations, including the stage-acting..a tad pompous.

I expect it to show up on Mystery Science Theater 3000 any day now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad & tedious Seed","review":"The movie's too long for the material it wants to go through, and the beginning's tedium of mainstream 1950's American family values is pretty awful to watch. There really is only one set in the whole picture and the characters are always talking up a storm, as there is a very tedious script. It's interesting to hear some of the idiotic beliefs people had about psychology 50 or so years ago. Also some dime store psychology/biology about some people just having a bad gene which makes them do horrible things.All of the characters are guilty of overacting, but much more than anyone else of the times. Contains quite an overabundance of tedious melodrama. The cast expressed such flat acting you'd think them catatonic schizophrenics.It's not worth the watch if you're bored or hate these kinds of movies.It also hasn't aged very, I wouldn't recommend the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bad Seed","review":"after i got a defective one and sent it back and amazon sent me another one to replace it (which i never recieved ) i phoned amazon and they shipped me another for the one that i didnt get i am pleased that amazon is concerned for their customers and am pleased overall"},{"rating":"1","title":"melodrama to whip up fear of genetic determinism","review":"This is a crude plug for genetic determinism of a sociopathic child murderer. While some of the details of the plot are frightening - a child committing savage acts for the most mundane of motives - the one-sided assumption that it is purely because of \\"bad genes\\" ruined the experience for me. Sure, I admit my bias for a combination of genetic temperament with environment to explain who we become, so my revulsion is personal.

I normally skip right over black and whites, but decided to give this one a try. Surprisingly good movie. It dragged in some areas, but the acting was good and the story was intriguing...made you wonder how much she'd get away with.The disclaimer at the end is funny to read given today's culture.

It is my favorite movie and is a billion times better and scarier than modern day films. This story is interesting and keeps you on the edge of your seat. I f I were to advise you to see any movie in the whole world, this would be it. I am not selling this movie, so don't think I am just trying to get you to buy it. In my opinion, I just definitly DO NOT think that ANYBODY will EVER create a movie than this one. Rent it, buy it, borrow it, whatever, but you have GOT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nancy Kelly deserves more credit!","review":"Like most of the film's reviewers, I think that \\"The Bad Seed\\" is simply terrific, an under-appreciated gem that is truly unique. But I'm sick of all the criticisms of Nancy Kelly's \\"melodramatic\\" performance as Christine. Yes, it may be a little camped-up, but isn't that true of all the actors in the movie, and indeed of the 1950s in general? I've watched the film several times now, and it was only during my most recent viewing that I realised just how good Kelly's performance is: poignant, emotional, and entirely believable. Indeed, the film is as much Christine's story as it is Rhoda's, and perhaps more so, for it is the torment of the MOTHER that drives the plot.Anyway, that's enough of me singing Kelly's praises... ALL elements of the film are simply outstanding!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of it's time.","review":"The Bad Seed, in itself a masterpiece of horror and emotional turmoil, was not, when released, a movie with subjects spoken of then.Long before Columbine, this perfect monster reared her indignant and amoral head. It is one of those movies that your family made sure you saw growing up, and will stick with you always.Straight from Broadway, the same cast members dazzle you.My all time favorite dramatic scene is Eileen Eckhart's brilliant and poignant performance. For her performance alone see the film.Jeffrey L Link"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rhoda, not Christine. Christine (Nancy Kelly) is the mother.","review":"This is an excellent campy film. Patty McCormack as Rhoda, the metal-coveting, classmate-drowning, janitor-burning murderous 8-year old, gives a chilling performance. Nancy Kelly was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Christine Penmark, Rhoda's mother and owner of demented genes. Nods for Best Supporting Actresses were also given to Patty McCormack and Eileen Heckart. (All three lost but Heckart did win a Golden Globe award for her performance as the distraught mother of one of Rhoda's victims.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"How much would u give this movie, a basketfull of hugs.","review":"The Bad Seed is a classic movie that can now be enjoyed over and over again thanks to the magic of video. As a thriller, this rates tops as a serial killer little girl continues her quest for toys, killing anything that gets in her way. Rhoda is the perfect little girl who demands the best from herself and others. Her building super is on to her ways and taunts and teases her in a delightfull way. The cast is top notch and the mother can be a little overdramatic, but the story is compelling and riviting. This movie was played many years ago on free TV then disappeared. How great to see it back on Cable, or better yet to watch it over and over on videotape. A great way to spend an evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY SCAREY!!!","review":"Have always loved this movie. I was about 7 when I saw this. There really were not any ratings available at the theaters back then. Will never be compared to anything else, it's one of a kind! The movie was delivered promptly and in perfect condition. I would buy from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Good Son","review":"Although the Good Son was an extremely good rewrite and remake of the Bad Seed. You can never disregard the simplicity of how excellent a movie can stand the test of time without all the extra added things done to movies in the present date. One of those sit down and shut up movies. Saw many times as a child and glad to see others can enjoy it as much as I did now that it is available on DVD. Check it out. A total Cult Classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twaddle","review":"The only good (and lucid) portions of this plotless, characterless, poorly written novel are the portions the author plagiarized from A.M. Maugham's Harry of Monmouth, John Cowper Powys's Owen Glendower, and H.F. Hutchinson's Henry the Fifth. The rest of it, the author's creation, is so bad it's almost funny: a character who has eyes \\"UNDER high cheekbones\\" is also able to ride a ways, relating the sad tale of an early love, while carrying an arrow through his upper arm. Another character, on the eve of Agincourt, listens to the king relating the sad tale of an early love. Other such choice moments abound. Save your time and read Harry of Monmouth and Owen Glendower -- they're light-years above this idiotic twaddle. And did the author..... really ... have ... to use all..... those ..... ellipses ...? ...This would get a negative star, if that were an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"When I can get Maurice singing the leads of more than one song...it is a BONUS deal!Omega Man and Above and Beyond...Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bee Gees' best album in years.","review":"Despite its unfortunate title, \\"Size Isn't Everything\\" is one of the best albums the Bee Gees have ever recorded. The array of musical styles is nothing short of astonishing, from the irresistible uptempo pop of \\"Above and Beyond\\" to the insistent beat of \\"Fallen Angel\\" to the pervasive eeriness of \\"Haunted House.\\" If I had to find fault, it would be with Barry's out-of-control screeching on \\"Paying the Price of Love\\" and the overlong \\"How to Fall in Love Pt. 1\\" (I hope there's not a part two). But these are minor complaints; for the most part, \\"Size\\" confirms that the Bee Gees are (still) a giant talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did I wait so long to find this album?","review":"I stumbled on this CD less than a month ago and it's now in my CD player almost constantly. Some songs I loved from the first listen (Fallen Angel, Paying the Price of Love, Kiss of Life) and some took a bit longer to grow on me (especially Heart Like Mine) for some reason, but I now love every single one of them. The entire collection is so beautiful, I'm almost afraid to listen to other Bee Gee albums for fear that they won't measure up. Especially wonderful are the two songs with Maurice singing lead (Omega Man & Above and Beyond), as he is sometimes lost in the mix of Barry and Robin's leads. Just enough of their incredible, unmatched harmonies and this album is a perfect example of why this trio has stood the test of time. Highly recommended to any lover of great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"buddy holly lives- 20 greatest hits","review":"This is the best buddy holly greatest hits collection.

When money and power are put on the table even the innocent will be disregarded. I didn't exactly like the way the film was done with little character development but it is a film that's true to reality and that should be respected above all else. These kinds of cases are common amongst disabled children and seeking justice for these kids doesn't always happen. Sometimes they end up even worse than their condition. It's sick that there are those who take advantage of children for their own pleasure but this movie shines a light on to that reality. I do think the film skips a lot of story that could have been written in by the idea of the film is understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oscar worthy","review":"This movie is so powerful and had me in tears before the first 30 mins were over. It's not a movie to watch with the family, but it's so moving that it's a must see for anyone over 18. The acting was so fantastic, the plot was engrossing.... it's beyond words to describe how extremely moving this movie is.The only thing I don't like about the movie really has nothing to do with the movie it's self but the true events that happened as in how these men were allowed to go free after this happened to these defenseless children. I cried when poor Min-Soo took his life at the end, but given the situation, I cnt say that I blame him. He got justice for him and his brother when a system that is supposed to have his best interest at heart failed him. It's a movie you will be watching from beginning to end with tears in your eyes. It really is a fantastic movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"She left a legacy","review":"A Lantern in Her Hand is a wonderful account of pioneer life and details about our heritage.

I especially liked Aldrich's discription of prairie life and \\"the way things were\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my most loved books","review":"I read this book when I was 12 or 13, perhaps younger. I loved this story so much I'm sure I read it a dozen times or more as a kid. And it was so memorable that I've never forgotten it. No longer having my original copy, I ordered it again recently from Amazon so I could re-read it. I was surprised at the negative reviews, but can only conclude that if you read this for the first time as an adult, perhaps the magic isn't quite the same. I think it's sad that someone can't appreciate this story, but I think it was well enough written, and the magic was in the detail and the story. I'm not sure if kids today would appreciate the story line, but in 1960 when I first read it, it obviously made quite an impression on me. I gave the book to my daughter when she was 12 or so, and she loved it as much as I did and has also remembered the story vividly now that she's an adult. I'd still recommend it for young girls in particular, perhaps in the age range of 9 to 13 or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book from childhood!","review":"I read this book thirty years ago and can still remember how deeply it affected me.

The story line is ageless. I have been trying to find a copy of it to buy for years. I read this book several times in grammer school, (about 35 years ago) and I have never forgotten it. The story always touched me....a beautiful lady, who could have married into wealth and luxury, but instead chose true love. She lived to realize all her dreams through her children. The story never fails to bring tears to my eyes. I can't wait to receive my copy and read it again and again!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lifetime Affect","review":"When I read this book as a young girl, I had no idea how much it would influence my life and my views of people in need. I see each person with potential for greatness. It doesn't matter if the skill is just to make someone smile everyday, that's the power of one person. Bess Street Aldrich overcame much adversity when she lost her husband when her children were very small. Her sensitivity comes across in her books for others who face life struggles and their attempt to making a better life for their family. I recommend this book for all persons. It only serves to help one understand the kinship we all have with one another, in serving to benefit the whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insights about life that still apply.","review":"Recently had a family reunion in Nebraska to return ashes of a family member. This book was suggested because it would give one a real feel as to what life was like for the early pioneer families.The book was a bit silly at first; but as the young lady matured so did her actions and speech. I ended up enjoying it very much and enjoying the insights about life and family that still apply."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-worn story about a woman's life..","review":"Bess Aldrich's \\"Lantern in Her Hand\\" is about 75 years old now. It tells the story of one woman named Abby Deal, and her life from a young girl to an elderly grandmother. It seems stuck in its time, as Abby acts like an \\"old fashioned\\" woman, but I suppose I can't expect differently. The story moves slowly, and it tells of how Nebraska became settled. Typical grandmother-granddaughter subplot where they leave in two different worlds, and typical subplot about another granddaughter who is just like Abby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book had been recommended to me, and it seemed like it would be good when I read the introduction, but after three times of starting and trying to finish this book, I decided it just wasn't worth it. It may have some events that are significant and add to the story with the sense that should go along with them, but somehow, this book bored me and seemed very flat and detached from any real feeling. When I was reading it, I couldn't feel the story and could not relate to Abbie, maybe because few of her feelings were aptly expressed in the story. The only thing I could really feel was the inevitable rushing of time and Abbie's fear of death,who snatches people away. It may be a good book to other people, especially those who can stand to finish it, but it just didn't keep my attention, and I can usually tolerate some slowness in a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I think that \\"A lantern in Her Hand\\" is a very good book.

The story begins with an old woman telling of her life when she was a little girl up until her husband was thrown from a horse and killed. She tells of a gift her mother gave her, a string of pearls from Ireland, that her husband sold and then bought back many years later. She tells of love and faith and how a family continues to get along even in troubled times.My brother and I both read this book in high school. He did a book report on it. It is really excellent reading, and should be read by anyone who enjoys historical novels. This book was based on a true-life story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopes and Dreams of Girlhood and Life","review":"This is the story of a young girl who dreamed big dreams and had great hopes of her life. Instead of her life fulfilling her dreams, however, she spent her days baking bread, piecing quilts, and taking care of children. Her children eventually accomplished the great things Abbie had hoped to do, but they seemed to care little for the life Abbie herself had led. It was a disappointing book for me, but it aptly brought to life the hopes and dreams of a young girl, and how real life prevents her from living her dreams. It did inspire me to analyze my dreams, to see if they are realistic, and to consider whether God might have other plans. Good dreams may need to be exchanged for what is best for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A learning experience for all readers","review":"I have read this book in eighth grade. I loved this book, and thought is was interesting, fun, and exciting. This book starts when Abbie is around eight years old and ends when she is eighty years old. By reading this book, you can watch her grow up. You will encounter happy, sad, and frustrating times in her life. This book can be easily related to women. Marriage, having babies, and doing the house work. I strongly recommend this book to any young reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Book.

In a time of escapism, A YEAR IN THE MAINE WOODS is my drug of choice. Most of Mr. Heinrich's books are delightful, they are always educational, as well as entertaining. The format of short chapters makes them timely for evening in-bed company, and they rarely repeat information, which is rare in most nature chronicles which are organized as month-by-month tomes. I have read this book so many times, that I cannot count them, and although I have read a few of Mr Heinrich's books, this particular one remains in my mind as the most engaging.If there is one fault, it would only be that I wish I had a hardcover with illustrations and fine paper, but beyond that, this book is escapist perfection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Nature","review":"Heinrich writes about his observations of Maine's animals and plants from winter silences to spring's new growth. It ranges from lyrical descriptions of wild flowers to more than you want to know about decaying carcasses attracting carrion eaters.I enjoyed reading it while parked in an RV in a Maine campground. My little window on the woods was so limited, making me appreciate his insights and trained eye. Sometimes he is philosophical, and at other times mundane (justifying why he doesn't wash his dishes more often)."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-congratulatory ego trip","review":"Heinrich obviously wants us to think of him as the modern Thoreau, but his thoughts are far shallower and less interesting. Furthermore Thoreau saw no need to ostentatiously parade his specialized knowledge before his readers, as Heinrich does. The specifying of 6 different kinds of warbler calls heard on a particular morning does not add to the atmosphere or enjoyment for almost anyone - but it DOES impress you with how much Heinrich knows about bird calls. Much of the book is in the same vein - paragraph after paragraph written not to instruct or entertain, but to impress. There are better choices out there by writers who are more impressed with their surroundings and less impressed with themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching Grass Grow","review":"This is a diary written by a biologist familiar with the names of trees, insects, birds, leaf types, etc. If the reader is also familiar with these terms, the book might be of interest. For me, it was a bunch of terms that I wasn't familiar with, and nothing in the writing made me want to look them up.Why was the author in the Maine woods for a year? The reader is not told until half way through the book. Nothing happens except changes in weather, seasons, and migrations. Even when the author shows enthusiam about something, the reader is not brought in on the excitement, so the overall impression for me was, \\"So what?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life, Simple Life","review":"A must for any outdoor and simple living buff who have forgotten that the simple life does not also mean the easy life.

Too many times when you think of Cher, you think of kooky hair and outrageous outfits and don't take her very seriously. Playing a mother always seems to bring out the softer, human side of her. She and Wynnona Ryder were incredible together. The movie was humorous but very realistic in portraying the difficult teenage years and the problems of both mother and daughter and how they eventually learn to \\"like\\" and even understand each other a little. The scene where Cher is at the hospital bed of the little girl telling her all about bringing her home from the hospital made me cry.

It outclasses so many of the tasteless flicks of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unlikely addition to my favorites list","review":"I came across this movie while channel surfing and though I didn't expect to, I fell in love with it. It is sweet, entertaining, romantic, and the acting is very believable, especially from Winona Ryder as Charlotte.

Great track selection, nice liner notes, cool pictures and previously unreleased tracks that don't sound like they should have remained unreleased.While they were influencing everyone from Kiss to the Sex Pistols, the Dolls in their time were just all about high-energy, fun rock and roll with more than a hint of danger and swagger.Unfortunately, despite the otherwise faultless track selection, \\"Give Her a Great Big Kiss\\" and \\"Showdown\\" are inexplicably left off, forcing me to keep my old cassette version of \\"Night of the Living Dolls.\\" Those are two of my favorite NY Dolls songs ever, so I have to deduct one star. Still, this is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat it for the money!","review":"For a mere $60.99 (nearly $20 less than at Musician's Friend and about half the MSRP) at Amazon.com, this mixer is your best bet. It has the cost of an entry-level mixer without the bleeding and fragile faders, 2-band EQ, and utter lack of scratch features that one normally finds on entry-level mixers. The faders are tough yet sensitive, with no sound bleeding. The 3-band EQ, crossfader-style cuing, and mic EQ add great functionality to this mixer. The hamster switch and crossfader slope are a nice touch if you're ever feeling a bit hip-hop or want to cut up some beats. I was originally going to get a DM950 and just upgrade in a few months, but at this price, why bother? I recommend this mixer to every startup DJ, whether you're aiming for scratch, trance, jungle, Baroque, whatever. This is an excellent mixer that doesn't sacrifice quality, though it definitely won't break the bank. I will definitely continue to buy Numark products!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid mixer","review":"I've had this mixer for 5 or 6 years - it's now somewhat outdated but still works great. I originally bought it to practice being a radio dj but since I don't do that now, this mixer has been sitting around collecting dust. I was recently going to sell it until I discovered a cool alternate use for it: I have my Sansa Fuze MP3 player connected to it and MP3's sound quite analog through this mixer, even better and more alive than through my big Sherwood receiver. This thing is great as a headphone amp - I actually forget that I'm listening to compressed music files. Additionally, I've never had any technical issues with this mixer and it's extremely easy to use (no computer involved!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"the botton line is that is this is a great value for a mixer. It's my first one, but I've used others. And I have to say, this has great functionality, seems quite durable, and is both functional and simple. For my purposes (just playing records when I DJ - no scratching, etc), it gets the job done. I can't speak to anything outside of that. I like the controls, and the cue fader is great and profoundly simple (something I think is missing from many larger, more expensive mixers).I would say that the one and only drawback is that it does not have XLR or 1/4\\" outputs - only RCA, which is a problem some places. But you can always get cables to convert RCA to your preferred format. Also works great w/an iPod and monster cables."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD made me \\"Totally Lose Control\\"","review":"I saw Chipper Dove Live this past summer in NJ with my girl friend, and what a show they put on.

Hilary Swank as a boxer? Yea, sure. It just didn't cut it with me. Women's boxing is not a serious sport, more like professional wrestling than boxing. This film would have been much better if Clint Eastwood trained a male character. Then you could take it seriously. By the end of the flick, when Clint Eastwood kills Hilary Swank with a lethal injection because she is paralyzed and want's to die, it gave mercy killing a new meaning. Mercy of the viewer for bringing this joke of a movie to an end and letting us out of the theatre. I doubt the people giving this flick good ratings know much about boxing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the hype?","review":"Aside from being beautifully shot, this film took a 180 degree turn about halfway through and went from inspired to the other side of insipid.

While his whole career from an artistic sense has been pure downhill since The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly, Million Dollar Baby marks a new low point for the former macho man. A three disc special edition for this slop? Who are they kidding? Do they think this is The Battle of Algiers?The sad fact is that while the quality of world filmmaking continues to increase, Hollywood films continue to get worse and worse, stifled by corporate and union bureaucracies and a total lack of original thought. Million Dollar Baby was not even one of the ten best films of 2004, but it earned the best pic prize because the Oscars are not so much a measure of artistic merit as they are a shameless self-promotion vehicle. It hasn't been this bad since the 1960s, when dreadful flics like Tom Jones and Oliver won the big prize."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Are Full Screen DVD's Even Made???","review":"O.K., I have not seen this movie yet but will plunk down by hard earned bucks as soon as it's released on the 12th of July.

I don't get it, you might as well stick to Video tape which made the huge, ripping off the public, mistake of turning out 95% of the factory tapes in pan and scan.

I can't say it is the movie I liked the most...but it is SO well acted...so well directed...and the story, although seemingly contrived worked for me. Swank has proved that she is in a class all by herself, with her second Oscar and quite possibly the best female performance I can EVER remember...it is the subtleties of her portrayal that makes this performance work...

There are not enough positive words in the dictionary to describe this beautiful and timeless masterpiece. Every other movie made should be downgraded by one star when compared to this movie!It is about life. It is about death. It is also a comedy in places. But most of all it is about the love between these three characters and what an undying love between human beings can motivate someone to do.This is a timeless masterpiece from a master storyteller, performed by three timeless actors who became immortal by their role in bringing this story to the big screen.I have seen thousands of movies but this may be the best movie I have ever seen!

Million Dollar Baby is the story of Maggie, a too-old undertrained wannabe boxer who after a great deal of effort (if not talent) convinces Eastwood's Frankie Dunn to train her. The reluctant Dunn does not want to train a girl, but his friend (Freeman) helps convince him. The result is a bond between Maggie and Frankie that is unshakeable. The film changes heartily a little over midway through, and I do not wish to give any of it away, but I will say that it evokes emotions that no movie in recent years has been able to produce. This is a great movie about people who want something better than what they've got, and through hard work, they get it, for a while. This is what American Filmmaking should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning","review":"Inspirational, moving and emotional ! Clint Eastwood takes us on a emotional roller coaster together with Hilary Swank stunning performance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Sentimental","review":"A friend asked me recently if I liked boxing movies, and was surprised when I said yes. But this isn't a boxing movie. It's an ode to Clint Eastwood's self-image. Clint is a great comic actor; he's funny whether he's getting beaten or beating some poor fool to a pulp. In this droning fraud, he does neither. Instead he quotes the poetry of William Butler Yeats. I like poetry and I like boxing, but this is just pretentiousness on the part of an aging actor who has begun to take himself too seriously as a tough guy. Equally pretentious is the performance of Morgan Freeman as God... (or was that another movie...?). In fact the only quality bit in Million Dollar Baby is the performance of Hillary swank, which is almost good enough to save the project. To class this sentimental escape with such great boxing movies as Raging Bull or Cinderella Man is a disgrace and an outrage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"For me, this was sort of a waste of 2 hours. Some of the things were predictable, but I wasn't sure how it was all going to play out. I just couldn't connect with the characters all that much. I have really tried to like Hilary Swank as an actress, but for some reason I just haven't found her in a role that seems to capture an emotional captivating role.Clint Eastwood is always great, and so is Morgan Freeman they were great in this film. This was a touching story, but I feel it could have been more gripping for me with a different leading female, or some background music, I don't really recall any, and I just watched it last night.There are many positive reviews, and to many this probably was a good film, I just didn't feel it.At least I just had it as a rental from Net-Flix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very predictable- May contain spoilers","review":"This film had its moments, but mostly, it was predictable and very unrealistic. What happened to her in the ring during her last fight is illegal and there is absolutetly no way in hell they would allow the other fighter to win that fight, as was mentioned by the white trash mother. I watch boxing and I was appalled at that scene. It pretty much ruined the movie for me from that point on. It could have been a good movie but instead it chose to go cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knocked the Wind Out of Me","review":"Million Dollar Baby is not only a movie about boxing, but even more, it is about humanity. A hard-shelled boxing trainer (Eastwood)is turned to jelly by the tragic and shocking events that happen in the life of a boxer (Swank). Eastwood, the director, gives one of his most-versatile performances, and Swank is captivating. You will likely think about this movie for days. Best movie I've seen in some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Academy Award Winners","review":"Well, you have Clint, Morgan and Hillary. How can you beat that. You can't!!! What a great film.

Clint Eastwood has put his best into it as he dose all his movies. A must see and own movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"First part very good but second not so","review":"This film has two parts which have different qualities. In the first part there is the excellent account of a young woman boxer who wants to become a champion and is looking for a fine trainer to teach her. After much hesitation, Frankie (Clint Eastwood) accepts to be her mentor and her talent and stubborness coupled with fine coaching lead her to the top class of women's box. The second part is about the sensitive issue of euthanasia and although Eastwood tries his best the film can not be compared to the Spanish The Sea Inside which is head and soulders above it in terms of realism, acting and emotional weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant Movie, Terrible DVD","review":"For a film with 3 different releases (2-disc wide, 2-disc full, and 2-disk+soundtrack digipack) its bizarre and unfortunate they are such sub-par releases. The 2-discs come with a very basic outer clamshell package, no chapter list insert is included, no outer cardboard sleeve is included, and only 3 extra features (That are interesting, but did it really need 2 discs?) and comes with NO commentaries. On top of that the DVD has a very poor animorphic wide screen transfer (come on WB this is a huge release, you couldn't get it right?). Its too bad really, because this is a truly amazing film that deserved an amazing DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably depressing","review":"At the end of this movie, I felt so bad I hardly wanted to go on. This movie has great acting, but the story is horrifically macabre. I cannot understand that a movie that celebrates the evil within people and the abandonment of one's morals received such accolades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Million Dollar boo-boo","review":"I like Clint Eastwood and his movies for the most part. However, this multiple-Oscar winning film was very disappointing.I went into it not knowing anything about it except what was obvious from the DVD cover (female boxer) and the Oscar buzz...So, Clint brings the same gravelly voice he used in 1986's \\"Heartbreak Ridge\\", Hilary Swank brings an irritating drawl as well as an irritating character personality, and Morgan Freeman tags along and they all win Oscars.Not only was the movie a big downer, which normally is OK - they don't all have to be Disneyesque - but along the way I felt manipulated through some of it as it went off on tangents.Worst of all, I think, is the rather sudden development of an over-aged waitress into some type of boxing phenom - when we all know it really takes a lot more hard work, dedication, training, and luck to have that kind of success.Still, it was a well-made professional movie, and some people rate it a knock-out. I'm throwing in the towel."},{"rating":"1","title":"million dollar baby","review":"I was very disappointed,when the dvd arrived I had paid extra to get it in a hurry so my terminally ill father in law could enjoy it for christmas but firstly, the dvd box arrived damaged with no time to send for a replacement then it wouldn't play!

Yes, pretty good acting and excellent fight scenes but it looked like something that would have happened 100 years ago. That is, of course, if women were fighting then. The whole idea of a \\"dirty fighter\\" hitting someone after the bell rings is an anachronism. Hillary and Morgan were OK but Clint should hang it up. Either that, or he should go back to Dirty Harry movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo.","review":"I have noticed a few negative reviews of this movie on Amazon, and although I hate to admit this, I cannot help but pass judgement on anybody who says this movie lacked something. Those who have mentioned that not enough information was provided on the relationship between Frankie and his daughter, have missed the point entirely, or have gotten so used to movies that spell everything out for their audience, that they have lost the ability to think during a picture.This film is guaranteed to trigger profound thought in its viewers, or should I say, in those viewers capable of profound thought. It is inspiring and motivating, and it shows just how much is possible when, instead of feeling sorry for ourselves and our difficulties, we commit to a dream and don't let anything stop us from pursuing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clint's best movie","review":"Only the Unforgiven comes close to this dark, and sad story. Clint Eastwood as a director has consistantly gone for tradgedy in his directorial choices and this is not exception. As Clint says in the commentary: \\"Man this script is a downer, but it's gorgeous.\\" Yes to both observations, but it's not entirely without hope. It won best picture, best actress for Hilary Swank, best supporting actor for Morgan Freeman and best director for Clint Eastwood and absolutely deservedly so. One of the most emotional, believable and well acted movies I've seen in years. It's a poignant tale of moral courage and the sometimes awful choices we are compelled to make in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Movie!","review":"Leave expectations out the door and you'll come out really touched by this simple story. I didn't think I would be that touched by the movie but there I was in the theatre almost crying my eyes out. The humanity of the characters and their need for connection pushed this movie above just being a \\"boxing drama\\". I can't say much about the story without giving something away, but I will say that Hilary Swank, Clint Eastwood, and Morgan Freeman did an incredible job in this movie. Beautiful performances from each that doesn't feel forced. This movie is definitely a \\"must see\\". I think this is probably one of the best films about love I've ever seen. A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"no suspenson of disbelief","review":"There is not a single important issue in this plot that could have moved forward without the writer and director making impossibly false choices. Maggie's progress , especially in light of her background; the incredible rule breaking in the championship match that go almost unmentioned; the results of the match, (vaguely referred to), that would actually be the exact opposite; are just few of the items that will be absurd to discerning viewers. Even looking at this as a fantasy, (which reviewers don't seem to be doing), there is no way to accept so much that would never have occurred in the real world. Fantastic situations must be accompanied by believeable explanations. This film uses no explanation, but rather more fantasy, to explain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I liked this movie - it was captivating and the story really kept my interest. I am not a boxing fan so I was concerned with whether I could be in to this movie or not. The movie had boxing in it, but that was not the real storyline. I would watch this one again and thought it is good enough to pay regular price. I have watched it more than once already and the only reason for the minus 1 star is that repeat watches have some areas where I got a little bored - not significant, but a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiration mixed with Melancholy","review":"This was great movie that started as a model for inspiration to all those who feel they are trapped in rut of poverty. Hilary Swank does a tremendous job portraying a red-neck trailer-trash that is trying to break the cycle of poverty and sees herself doing the only thing she knows how to do, fight.The ever intimidating Clint Eastwood play the reluctant boxing trainer that regrets not taking previous fighters to the next level and sees Swank as \\"just a girl\\" and Eastwood does not train girls. After Swank's character will just not give up Eastwood finally gives in and becomes one of the biggest thorns in Eastwood's side.The ending is emotional and brings in a sense of melancholy that never fades. This film was a great portrayal of the trials and tribulations that come from rising from the depths of poverty mixed with the risks of boxing. Great Film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HD-DVD is crystal clear","review":"I saw this one in the theater, then bought the standard DVD.

Either story it's trying to tell could be interesting, but the first story lacks a proper ending, and the second story is poorly developed.The movie is framed by a narrative device that ends up being extremely contrived. At one point, the narrator has to magically be present to observe something going on so he can narrate about it, when there's no reason for him to be present, and then he seems to teleport back to another location. This movie is overall poorly conceived, and the fact that it won best picture is more indicative of the invalidity of the Academy's opinion than it is of the quality of this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until the end, then very depressing","review":"We figured someone would die in this film (an old timer or something), but didn't expect what we got.It's extemely depressing.

I say this because of the terrible evil that it is clearly trying to promote, namely the murder of anybody who is physically handicapped in some way.

And although the acting is very good (the 2 stars), the story is troubleing. Admittedly, I'm a \\"happy ending\\" kind of guy, but there was nothing redeeeming about the way this movie ends. Are we to believe that we are no different than pets being put to sleep at the local shelter? Dunn suffers no consequences for his actions in ending Maggie's life nor does the boxer who broke her neck. Maggie's battles accomplished nothing beyond scars, broken bones and in the end, a broken neck. So much time is devoted to Dunn's broken relationship with his daughter, but we never learn why the relationship was estranged.

Everything works in this one, the story, the actors, and the directing. Highly recommend.Loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Introspective, Dark, and Unforgetable","review":"This film will shake the viewer to the bone. It is so well crafted, acted, and the story works on many different levels. The three characters who are the primary focus in the film each represent an incomplete person who believes, through this sport, that life \\"is\\" boxing and through it an individual can achieve whatever they can stand and strive to achieve.Clint Eastwood has created classic film. Hillary Swank captured the essence of who she portayed in the film and Morgan Freeman ties it all together.It takes the viewer on an unforgetable journey in the lives of the three characters and does it so well.The camera work, the performances, the story are worth seeing. See it, feel it, and talk about it but don't give anything away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Million Dollar Disappointment","review":"After waiting over a week to avoid paying for the high cost of shipping, my DVD arrived. I settled in with my popcorn and pepsi to watch my movie that same evening. I popped it into my DVD player and it said \\"loading, loading, loading\\" and then finally, \\"bad disk\\". This is my second unhappy experience with Amazon. I shipped the disk back and decided to instead purchase the DVD at the video store. Not only was it $6.00 cheaper (not including the shipping!) but when I popped it into my DVD player, it actually loaded and played! And it had a second disk of special trailers included! The good thing is that you were able to credit my account after only a week which I appreciate. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda anyone?","review":"THis movie is nothing but pro-euthanasia propoganda. Anyone with a serious disability should be angry. I will never watch another movie directed by Eastwood or starring Hillary Swank."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give it -1000 stars if I could!","review":"I have learned my lesson. If Paul Haggis wrote the script than the movie is wortheless (\\"Crash\\" also sucks!). Yes, this movie belongs to my list of decadent pseudo-intelectual entertainment. Let's start translating the movie. First it presents us a character that always wins. When the character supposedly loses it's because someone else cheated. This is a shameful manipulation trying to appeal to all the losers that believe that success is easy. But since losers never really get anywhere the final victory is not achieved. This is part of the manipulation because the losers watching the movie have to identify with it.For me art is supposed to inspire people. Where is that inspiration in this movie? Where is it trying to lead us? The objective of the movie is just to give people an aspirin to make them feel better about their own sad lives.The only good thing is that Mr. Haggis will be able to get that house in beverly hills that he always dreamed about."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont get it...","review":"...as in, i dont like it; before this one, every movie from eastwood seems to me, not only well made, but great and sofisticated, i really like what this guy is able to make, but in this case the story seems to much to tell just a few things, and (probably is just me) the all movie seems to be about nothing, a not very new story, with nothing new to tell, in a very old way... anyway, the thing is still better than most releases, but i feel it felt short considering all it had going for it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clint has done better!","review":"I saw the movie Million Dollar Baby with my girlfriend mostly because my sister said it was absolutely one of the best movies she had ever seen. I still am trying to see what she saw. This movie is a real sleeper. The movie is very predictable. The ending makes absolutely no sense and is very unrealistic. I have seen a lot of Clint Eastwoods movies and this is one of the few that I can say does not live up to his potential. This movie is more or less a female version of the much better movie \\"Rocky\\" Rocky had a real underdog story behind it.The characters in this movie could have A LOT more depth. The story ends with quite a few things left unexplained. In Rocky, you actually wanted him to win and you found yourself pulling for him all the way. This story really never truly gives you that feeling. I have talked to co-workers who have seen this movie and they feel the same way. If you want a good, root for the underdog movie, stick with Rocky. He knocks this movie out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Depressing","review":"We had high hopes going into this movie, as Clint Eastwood has proven himself to be a great director.

I love Clint, but this one really didn't do anything for me. I saw every plot twist coming a mile away. I like Hilary Swank, but this character was also a big cliche and not worthy of her talent. Ditto Morgan Freeman. Sorry, Clint, not a winner in my book. Better luck next time.For a GREAT film on the same topic, try \\"The Sea Inside\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's so great about Hilary Swank?","review":"Million Dollar Baby is slow, boring, and not worth Oscar gold. Hilary Swank is not that good of an actress, I find her unbearable to watch. Morgan Freeman always seems to play the same character but to my surprise Clint Eastwood is quite good in this film, his acting has never been better. The story and pace of the film is what leaves me disappointed. I just couldn't get into this weeper, oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Women should not box period","review":"I didn't feel that the film connected on an emotional level, and that it was more like watching stock characters in action. Hillary Swank is very good, but her character moves from amateur boxer to championship contender while showing practically nothing in between. Clint failed to impress me with his performance (and I'm a Clint fan), and Morgan Freeman continues to be highly overrated. The second half drags considerably, and I felt the whole third act to be very manipulative."},{"rating":"1","title":"plodding cliche","review":"Another boxing as metaphor for life film. The supporting actors can't act. The story goes nowhere. The characters aren't developed (all we know about Eastwood's character is that he must be really smart because he reads Yeats) and the villains are like cartoons. Morgan Freeman is once again typecast--his all knowing, pedantic monologue attempst to buoy a vapid script.This film won an Oscar?! Am I missing something here?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth watching!","review":"I really enjoyed this movie as well. And I thought the acting was superb. Hilary Swank in particular does a great job. Morgan Freeman is narrating in this movie, which will remind you a bit about Shawshank Redemption. This is definitely a classic, well worth watching.Maggie is a really strong character, who rises above her family and manages to box despite the odds being stacked against her. I should also say that Clint Eastwood did a great job playing her trainer, mentor and perhaps Father figure at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Morgan Freeman finally gets an Oscar!","review":"FINALLY!! My, is this overdue or what?! Morgan Freeman elevates any movie that he is in and graces the screen with his presence and wonderful performances. He now joins the ranks of other Oscar-worthy Afircan American men like Sydney Poitier, Denzel Washington, and Jamie Foxx. Kudos to the Academy for recognizing Freeman at long last. He is truly a treasure and I, for one, look forward to even greater performances from him in the future. They got it right tonite at the 77th Annual Academy Awards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS ADVERTISED!!","review":"I recieved this film in a timely fashion but it was NOT the WIDESCREEN EDITION as advertised and pictured here on Amazon.

I'm Not happy, and probably wont order anything from anyone other than Amazon directly from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"Great movie!! If you are an Eastwood fan you have to watch it. If you are a extremely sensitive people, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well done if predictable","review":"It is somewhat amusing to read some of the criticisms of the movie on here.... some criticize Eastwood's \\"Right Wing Conservative politics\\" in the film, while just as many complain that he is pushing \\"liberal values\\"... makes you wonder how many people still form their own opinions and views on things today and how many are simply programmed by the media to express the views they have.The film was well done overall despite it's predictability and overshadows of \\"Shawshank Redemption\\" stylization.In fact is it interesting to see the same formula Clint has used in his last 5 films.... he has a certain 5-point formula he has used identically in Unforgiven and all his other recent films.But it is a formula that works for him.This is worth seeing but it not the sort of DVD I would add to my collection to watch over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie. Period.","review":"I watched this movie because my wife insisted I would like it. I must have been wearing earplugs when this was receiving Academy rewards because I didn't remember hearing about it before, but I watched it a few weeks ago (Nov. '05) and loved it.The story was somewhat predictable at times, however, at no point was it boring. Hilary Swank and Clint Eastwood had great chemistry, but one must also remember Morgan Freeman too. The three of them really gave fantastic performances. It is true, this is a sad story, but it was also encouraging to see a story of an underprivilged woman succeed in making people around her take notice of her and embrace her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Work","review":"Very nice film and Clint Eastwood's best work. Noteworthy performances by both Swank and Freeman earned them their most deserved Oscars; however, I'm not so sure about Best Picture. I still think Ray should have been the winner on that.Nonetheless, the performances in this movie were well done without being overdramatic. I found the trailer trash relatives to be a bit too caricature, but the intimate \\"father-daughter\\" like moments between Swank and Eastwood were very touching without being overdone.Worthwhile movie and Eastwood's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story","review":"I loved this movie, even though it had me in tears at the end. Great performances, and wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misleading title, awesome movie!","review":"I can't add anything to the editorial review above. It says it all. I laughed, I cried. I don't know if you'd like this movie if you hate boxing, but then again, you might! It's just a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only they were all this good...","review":"The tale itself is pretty simple, but a well-written script and a group of incredibly gifted actors move this from what could have been melodrama to something special.While it looks initially like a \\"boxing movie,\\" it obviously becomes more than that. You've got 3 characters, each with their own somewhat tortured past, all searching for something. The magic of this film comes when they join forces, so to speak, to try to attain a shared goal.Hilary Swank is more than deserving of the Oscar she won for her role, as is Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood could have easily taken that honor, too. The interplay between Eastwood and Freeman is so natural that it hardly feels like acting, and the same goes for his scenes with Hilary Swank.Fantastic film, one that everyone should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like Boxing?

I saw it again with my wife and it struck me again, her too. We cried aloud and wept. At first, I was afraid to watch this film because I was disappointed with the way Eastwood just missed with the talent in 'Mystic River'. He dead-centered this one from every angle and distance. It is one of the most engaging films I've ever encountered. This is a real story excellently done by Eastwood, Swink and Freeman. The Oscars are well-earned and well-deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing ,Disappointing Movie !!!!","review":"With all the Murder Madness and Mayhem in the News I cannot help but believe we have become so De-sensitized ....that a Movie like this would be receiving Rave reviews and talk of Major Accolades !!! !!!THE EMPEROR IS NAKED ...what is wrong with everyone, this movie is so outrageously unbelievable ...I respect Clint Eastwood and I admire Morgan freemans work as a actor but this Movie is utter Rubbish !!!..There are some places in our Souls that are reserved for the most damaging effects on our senses ..a place that we can retreat too in times of absolute unexplainable Madness ..but that is in REALITY I do not need to be taken there by a Movie ...after all ladies and gentlemen this is a ILLUSION a Story being read to us visually by the director with a cast of Characters ..if we ever reach the point in our minds eye that we cannot differenciate between what real and whats a illusion then we are really on a downword slide ."},{"rating":"1","title":"smash mouth boredom","review":"A very dark, but curiously shallow movie.

First good things happen, then bad things happen. I kept watching, thinking that soon I would begin to like one of the characters and be drawn into the story. Didn't happen. Beyond learning a little bit about boxing and the boxing world, this movie was a waste of time. And I usually like Clint Eastwood....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decieved","review":"I bought this DVD, sight unseen, purely on the strength of this movie's reviews. BIG mistake. Watching this movie was first interesting, then depressing, then boring. Look, I'm a simple person. I watch movies for entertainment. If I want to be depressed, I can simply turn to CNN. This movie was simply miserable. It created more questions than it answered (What caused Eastwood's rift with his family?), it was unrealistic (are referees REALLY blind?) and it dragged on for entirely too long. I 'm not saying that some of the performances weren't excellant, Hillary Swank in particular did very well. But the movie itself just wasn't that interesting. I certainly wouldn't watch it again, and that's a pretty fair indication of how interesting a movie is. Don't buy into the hype.

It's one of the only movies i can watch over and over again without getting sick of it. This movie will leave you smiling for days and days, because of the great love story between Kate and Doug, and believe me, listening to Joe Cocker will never ever be the same. this ultimate romentic comedy will rock your world: you'll laugh a lot, cry a little and fall in love all over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't turn this movie off.

Absolutely.Dig it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE AT FIRST SIGHT","review":"D B Sweeney knocks Moira Kelly right off her feet the very first time he sees her and the rest just has to be watched as this is truely a love story in a win-win situation. I've watched it over and over and love it more each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Film","review":"The Cutting Edge was a wonderful combination of comedy and romance with both actors displaying a sense for comical flair and believable sexual tension. Although somewhat predictable, this movie does not give in so quickly to the characters obvious attraction, and allows it to unfold naturally, sticking close to how I believe Kate and Doug, had they been real, would behave. When first deciding to watch the movie I was somewhat sceptical but was pleasantly surprised by both director and the actors ability to light up the screen with a funny script that so easily could have ended up in the wrong hands. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good movie thats not too taxing. Its definately one of my faves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie to feel good with.","review":"I rented this movie on a WHIM because I am a shoot-em up and gunsmoke lover. I found myself engrossed in the highs and lows , one liners and super acting displayed in this movie for a very enjoyable evening of entertainment. It kept my interest to the very last. I guess I'm just a sucker for love in the movies. I went on line and ordered the movie for my collection. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie, you will not be sorry. In some ways it's very much like A Christmas Card or A special Night, both of which I also bought.There is no need to cover the story line as others have done a far better job than I could have."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I loved this movie.

Maybe they just didnt want the movie to be way too long, but come on, give the audiance some credit here.If this had been the review for the VHS maybe I would have been kinder, but the low low qualit of the DVD just killed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"I'm female and didn't like this movie. I was expecting lots of ice skating stunts, but there weren't many. Most of the movie focused on the \\"love\\" story between the two main characters. \\"Love\\" is in quotation marks because it was not a believeable love story: the two characters were very different and neither was likeable. The female's sudden, inexplicable transformation from nasty to sweet is likewise unbelieveable (but predictable). Additionally, the movie was full of unappealing cliches: the female constantly nagging the hapless male, random women fawning all over the male (even though he's nothing to write home about), tough guy getting in touch with his sensitive \\"inner self,\\" and on and on. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Family Movie","review":"This movie has many scenes where the leading man is in and out if bed with numerous women.

But the language used in places is inexcusable. I can handle, but don't like the occasional cuss word, (which, speech being the index of the mind, is the usual way low class people express themselves). Be that as it may, I absolutely detest hearing the name of God used loosely or in cursing. It adds nothing to a movie, but subtracts from it. Such blasphemy is comfortable only to people who are perishing, and devils.Joe Brenner"},{"rating":"1","title":"B-Grade Everything","review":"This is one of those films you find yourself laughing at--not because it's got good humor in it, but because of all the things it does wrong. The script is corny, the acting poor, and the story line trite and uninvolving.They don't even show any extended figure skating scenes, which would have at least added a nice note as that is always fun to watch.The dialogue between the two leads is supposed to be snappy, but with the wooden way they deliver it, it's just dopey (I'm surprised these two actors ever worked again after this film came out...) The two skaters bicker non-stop through the whole movie and then are supposed to fall in love at the end, though I didn't buy it for a minute. They are both unlikeable, as characters and as actors, so I didn't care what happened to them in the end...unless they would have fallen through the ice, which would have ended this dull ice skating movie on the proper note."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches stacked on cliches piled on cliches","review":"Unlikeable one-dimensional characters (rich female snob/down and out blue-collar guy), poor directing (no real skating sequences), wooden acting, unbelieveable story and cliche after cliche after cliche.

Decent so-called \\"chick flick\\" but overall dull, emotionless, uninspiring, and unoriginal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Having done figure skating for many years of my life, I was looking forward to seeing a movie about the sport, but this one definitely failed to deliver. When it origianlly premiered in the movie theaters back in 1992, I was 12 and thought it was the best thing since sliced bread, so about 10 years later I decided to buy it on DVD. That was definitely a mistake! This movie lacks a lot of the sophistication that an adult viewer may appreciate. After seeing it again as an adult I realize how unrealistic, over dramatic and predictable this film is. I mean to start with, how and why did an Olympic level pairs skater become partners with an injured hockey player to begin with? In real life that would obviously never happen. The movie has a few funny moments, however it's very cheezy. Truly a disappointment. If you insist on seeing this movie, I would highly recommend renting it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE movie","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this movie but didn't.

The ending was not any good either.This is the worst movie I have seen in a while. If I could I would give it no stars, but htat is not possible.

It's perfect lazy viewing material--cute guy, bitchy girl, both attracted to each other combined with the bitchy, competitive, graceful world of competitive ice skating. The Olympic setting still resonates today, and the politically-fraught relationships between skaters rings true given all that we've seen go on in the real world. I love D.B.

I had never even heard of it before. I saw it on Friday, rented it on Monday, and have not stopped thinking about it since. The acting is superb and the skating sequences are incredible. You actually believe that the actors are doing the skating. This is a very funny, romantic, and heart-warming film that is free of violence(save the occasional slapshot), sex, and excessive profanity. It just goes to show you that a PG movie can be great. My favorite scene is the drinking scene. Its so cute and very funny. Anyone who has not seen this movie, you will do yourself a great favor to go rent it now!-if for no other reason, then for the dreamy stare you have after it's over as you rewind it to watch it again.

Sweeney (\\"Doug Dorsey\\") and Moira Kelly (\\"Kate Moseley\\") light up the screen in this charming movie about a hockey player and a snotty figure skater who are made partners in pairs figure skating after his hockey career comes to a premature hault when he suffers an eye injury, and she can't seem to keep a partner due to her overwhelmingly sardonic attitude. Doug and Kate are polar opposites, and certainly are not a match made in heaven as they begin training together for competitive figure skating, which hopefully includes a spot in the Winter Olympics. But as the days pass, and the months pass, their harshness towards each other turns into a little something more... Funny, sweet and a great movie for anyone, especially anyone who has ever had angry chemistry with someone. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the movie, but anamorphic widescreen was horrible!","review":"This movie was one of my all time favorites.

It was extremely dark and the widescreen didn't cut it for me as this is a movie with a lot of movement in it and I'd like to see more screen for that.

The author is outstanding on technical detail for the most part. His information on technological advances needs improvement. I look forward to seeing more information on the use of GPS mapping of crash scenes as well as better information on interviewing techniques in the next edition.

Running words together, along with his aggressive devotion to the sense of smell, make areas of this quite readable. The disjointed story lines are just too muddled overall, in my opinion (and I am a fan of Dos Passos in general).Put simply, I expected too much after enjoying 'Three Soldiers' and 'USA'. It just moves.......too......slow.....zzzzzz"},{"rating":"2","title":"a gem of a novel on life in New York","review":"Manhattan Transfer presents the good, the bad and the ugly side of life in New York. Money seems to be the driving force behind everybody's lives and love is hard to come by. However, even the failure to realise one's goals does not deter one from hanging on in New York, as Bud does. It is, after all, the 'center of things.' It is in the end Jimmy, who emerges as the man who dares to rebel aganst the 'getting and spending' life that the city promises. The various vignettes that Dos Passos offers somehow tie up, as they all have common concerns, concerns that centre around the great American Dream. What Dos Passos really wants to reveal is the hollowness of this dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I dunno...pretty far.\\"","review":"The prose style presented in Manhattan Transfer is fresh and unorthodox, two characteristics that all great literature must contain.The narrator of the novel is an eavesdropper who chooses his subjects at will. You are able to spend three pages with a subject, then not hear from the subject until scores of pages later, if at all.Manhattan Transfer serves as a history book, but not the standard type. You actually get to feel, hear, taste and smell what it was like to be in NYC during the early half of the 20th century. Most history books cite landmark events, but Manhattan Transfer records the life of the people living rather than the events the people were involved in.John Dos Passos is one of the most overlooked, underappreciated American writers of the 20th century. I highly recommend this book to everyone. You must visit NYC to fully appreciate the book, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"An in-depth look at human nature by a truly great modernist","review":"THis often overlooked work by an often overlooked member of the Lost Generation is a true classic. Although it pales in comparison to Dos Passos' \\"U.S.A.\\" trilogy, this is a great look at mankind in the early twentieth century in its own right, as well as an early predecessor of \\"U.S.A.\\" Using his unique style of writing Dos Passos tells the tale of one man's journey to New York, and then proceeds to conntinue the story through the eyes of every single person he meets, and everyone they meet.

The main character, McMurphy, fakes insanity and is put in a mental asylum, where a battle of wills starts immediately between him and nurse Ratched. The movie is about freedom. In nurse Ratched's opinion, being free is a crime; in McMurphy's opinion, being free is the only way to be.McMurphy must be Jack Nicholson's best role, and the other actors are outstanding as well. The movie is very atmospheric; a certain nervousness can be felt throughout it.See it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DESPERATE SANITY AMIDST MADNESS","review":"Based on Ken Kesey's 1962 memoirish novel, the resulting movie's a timeless metaphor for the human condition.Sterling performances by the entire cast mesh perfectly under Milos Foreman's precise direction.

This certainly isn't the greatest DVD technically, with mediocre sound and picture quality. But that does nothing against the simple genious of this movie. Jack Nicholson is excellent, simply wonderful. The best role I've seen him in, and I've seen him in a lot of damn roles. This was such a disturbing movie, and the cast was great. Danny Devito and Christopher Loyd were great. Of course, nurse ratchet is one of the coldest and most infuriating characters I've seen in a movie. Rarely am I really so touched and distrubed by a movie, but this really touched me unimaginably. I really don't care if people think this movie is inappropriate for children (I am 13) I think for children to be kept in a bubble, isolated from the cruelty of the world, is one of the greatest sins to be commited. Show this to kids like us, we will understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest","review":"Great Movie - a classic. Product arrived in a timely manner and in good condition.

Yes, there are some funny parts, some feel good moments and there are also some parts that are so real and gut wrenching you can't stand it.

He faces the worst work/institution situation when he meets demoralized patients subject to the command of Nurse Radchitt. Mcmurphy protrayed by Jack Nicolson exerts his indivualisam which the Mental institute will not accept and proceeds to plan any and all manners to to defeat him by taking away his freedom of thought and willpower. This film is truly a masterpiece of instruction in the procedures of an institute/corporation of controlling a human being by taking away their dignity.The surprise element of this film is that not only does Mcmurphy regain his dignity, but the Native Americans make a magnificent statement about their Honor & Dignity as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excelent film","review":"this film, without doubt, deserved the academy's praidse in 1975. like other favorites of mine, this film deals with the treatment of those who are seen as \\"different\\". the directing was stunningly artistic, and casting jack nichlson was brilient! i would reccomend this to anyone who likes artistic, thought provocing film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the all-time greats!!!","review":"Cuckoos nest is one of the all time best every made.

Jack Nicholson gives his greatest performance. Also the roles enacted by Danny De Vito and especially Louise Fletcher are remarkable.It is a story about how Nicholson gets caught up in the little world of Louise Fletcher's institution and thus ultimately pays the price of trying to break the rules.It is a reflection of how society 'good-intentionally' breaks the one who does not fall in line and follow the herd.Thus it has been with most great leaders like Christ who are broken down for not conforming when are alive and then worshiped when they are gone. It is a really bold movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Jack Nicholson delivers the best performance I have ever seen in this masterpiece. The supporting actors and actresses are excellent as well. The film's comedy keeps the entertainment value high throughout, although the underlying themes are anything but humorous. Many classic scenes abound, such as the fishing trip, the basketball game, and one of the best endings in cinematic history. I found myself more and more emotionally involved with the characters as the film progressed, with the ending provoking a deep emotional experience not achieved by many other films. If you're a fan of character development, great performances, and psychologically impacting films, \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a must-see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Powerful","review":"This film has an all-star cast and a great director Milos Forman. Jack Nicholson is superb as the loud mouth McMurphy. Louise Fletcher plays in my opinion one of the most evil characters ever to grace the silver screen.

This film is excellent and the ending and story are powerfull."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotionally Provocative Piece","review":"The edition is fairly generous with it's bonus material.It doesn't stretch for eight hours, but the commentary is interesting.

It's not the same Jack from \\"Chinatown\\", \\"The Shining\\", or Tim Burton's \\"Batman\\". \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\" is a turning point in his career and it solidifies his versatility as an actor.

Film acting really doesn't get much better than this. Jack's performance is so strong, it even makes Louise Fletcher's performance as Big Nurse (called Nurse Ratched in the film) seem much better than it really is. (That Fletcher won the Oscar for this film is testimony to the film's narrative potency since she is not that talented an actress, as her subsequent career has revealed. One wonders how much better the film would have been with a real actress of the caliber of Geraldine Paige or Collen Dewhurst, who incidentally turned the role down, playing Big Nurse.)The supporting cast is particulary memorable in this film. A truly seminal film of the 1970s."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"I'm a fan of Milos Forman. Make that a big fan. My mom's like oh you have to see this movie.

This film follows McMurphy's tumultuous stay at a mental hospital and his clash with its head nurse, Nurse Ratchet.Jack Nicholson delivers perhaps his greatest and most memorable performance as the rowdy McMurphy. All of the other patients on the ward are also played very well.This movie is both sad, funny, and intellectually provocative.

The only reason that it gets any stars at all is that I could hear it like radio and I like Rock Hudson as well as Barbara Carrera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth buying","review":"This cd has some awesome trance-inducing synth lines in it, and some very solid tracks. Favourites include 'mooonchild', 'dont save us from the flames' and 'teen angst'. The way the tracks alternate between ulrich schnauss style dream-like washes suddenly to rise to a drum infested crecendo really gets me going. my only reason for not giving this cd a 5 star rating is that i find the tracks to be fairly linear, unlike ulrich schnauss's tracks which are really progressive, these tracks seem to find one killer riff (for want of a better word) and stick with it, looping it through different levels of energy. however it works, so i really cant complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully beautiful: Best of 2005... best in a long time!","review":"Take the best of Sigur Ros and Godspeed You Black Emperor, pour all your soul into it, and you have nothing less but M83's painfully beautiful masterpiece, \\"Before the Dawn Heals Us\\". Founding M83 member Anthony Gonzalez starts a solo track with this album, showing us what the human spirit is capable of conceiving. He can make you cry tears of joy or sadness equally, with a production that is going to stand the test of time.There is no song better than the others in this production. The whole album stands firm as a rock, ready to be listened to millions of times, to be interpreted and reinterpreted without fear. Simply put, \\"Before the Dawn Heals Us\\" is by far one of the best albums in a long time, and becomes the first one in my Best of 2005 list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lyulka","review":"They are romantics who can put love into anything. Even brains in Tina's hair. They explode and keep it burning until the end.No matter how much you try, it is hard to capture this music in a single motion, it always seems to blast by like a very strong wind from the ocean (this is not a cheesy poem). And when it is done with you, you feel a little reborn, a little more aware of the world. The associations that come with this music are increddible. It is all very beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"At risk of redundancy...","review":"This album is just mindblowing. I can't decide if it's better than Dead Cities because they evoke entirely different moods for me, but I'll be surprised if an album comes out this year that I enjoy more.Also, in response to the reviewer who said M83 was entirely electronic, in interviews, they (he?) frequently reference using guitars, organs, etc. so I'm not sure that the whole album is synths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambient Prococateur","review":"French ambient provocateur Anthony Gonzalez trades the elegant white noise of Dead Cities, Red Seas & Lost Ghosts for a more pompous adventure with Before the Dawn Heals Us. Gonzalez's soundscapes were once contained and mimetic: songs with titles such as \\"Birds\\" and \\"On a White Lake, Near a Green Mountain\\" contained a hint of what was to come. The songs on Before the Dawn Heals Us become the soundtrack to an imagined concept: a particularly harrowing night in the life of what, from the titles, may well be a vampire. Or a drug addict. Or someone who just can't sleep. It's hard to know from the music, which features much synthetic choral manipulation and dissonant guitars. The best bits are the spoken word interludes, especially on the beautifully conceived and executed \\"Car Chase Terror!\\", which is all that and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord is this awful","review":"I liked \\"Dead Cities...\\", but this is truly terrible. M83's taken the ambient and noisy extremes of that album and cranked them up horribly. All the ambient parts on \\"Before the Dawn...\\" are embarassingly cheesy and boring, and the noisy parts are just irritating.Picture what some red-blooded American NASCAR fan would think of if you say \\"some French dude with a synthesizer\\", and you have the awful cliche just perfectly. But Jean-Michel Jarre wouldn't have put out something this wanktastic twenty years ago, why put up with it now?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"M83 has done it again, but this time in a different way. This album carries just as much power and love as Dead Cities, but hits you harder. M83 decided to run somewhere else with their talents; although you can clearly hear \\"M83\\" there is a touch of something new. Each song carries through with a huge amount of emotion. The First track starts off with a beautiful synth and female voice which instantly sets the mood for the album, from there it is all over; you won't be able to stop listening. I previewed the Mp3s and then purchased this album the day is arrived!! it was just that good. I would recommend this album to ANYONE. Whether you are a Classical listener or rock; you will be able to appreciate this recent explosion by M83."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hagar's Lost Voyage","review":"This TV special could have been great- but was not.

This Russian-French produced game has the most unstable copy protection scheme I've ever seen. The original dual-layer DVD disc has the Tages protection encoded in the disc. The game loads up about once every 30 tries because the copy protection is unable to detect that the original retail DVD is in your drive. You will be frustrated and then angry!The few times it has loaded the game is okay- a little quirky but okay.I bought it because the free download demo worked fine and it was fairly fun- even with the software bugs and crashes.I cannot recommend the retail version- the copy protection is a serious and infuriating slap at the gaming public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, terrible implementation.","review":"Maps are awful, and the minimap is just as bad. The enemies are spaces on a grid (nearly) and they gain levels with you!! I hate this, because you don't get stronger and move on to another area with harder enemies - the same exact enemies just get harder with you. Thus you could run around in circles killing zombies for 8 hours, get to level 30, and still whenever you go ANYWHERE the enemies match your level... zzzzz."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good all around bino for the money","review":"This K-M best seller is a good compromise between the low end and the really high end models by Zeiss, Fujinon, and Nikon. Feels real good,although the porro prism design is not a small lightweight model,if you are seeking same. Good rubber coating,easy focus wheel (check its function), and relatively flat field via the hybrid plastic glass aspheric element.Decent light transmission. This is a \\"genuine article\\" good binocular you are likely to enjoy and use for every day and even for some backyard astronomy. I liked mine a lot before it got swiped and may buy replacement of the same kind,to add to my bino collection. The vinyl case is cheesy but that can be upgraded for twenty bucks or so. I did not care for the 10 power K-M as much,namely more distortion and heavier."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a teacher sees it","review":"I had the pleasure of reading reviews of this title before buying the product. Unfortunately the reviews I read did not clarify my mind about the product and I ordered it anyway, I was under the wrong impression that this dvd will create interest in various topics of physics among my students. However, to my utter dismay, the video is for those students who want to learn the subject without a teacher and to me it looks like a dry presentation of a very interesting subject. I would be useful only for those who wish to study the subject of physics at home without the help or guidance of a teacher.-drheracoaching"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Cute Little Stories","review":"I found this in a used book store and it peaked my curiosity. I hadn't read anything by Huxley at the time so I had nothing to compare it to but it was oddly cute. The stories were not by far his best works but the characters were oddly lovable despite their sometimes bizarre personality quirks and I did find myself sucked in just by that fact.It's an interesting read if you like Huxley because it's somewhat off the beaten path for him. There's no real social commentary in it but it is still an amusing little collection of stories. The last story in the collection however was quite dull and pointless. I will say that much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of Thelonious Sphere Monk","review":"I thought this live recording was just amazing.

It was a great holster; I only replaced it because the elastic siding was wearing out & making my blackberry slide out much too easily. I dropped it on several occasions because it would slide out of the case. But it took it over 2 years of daily wear to get to that point - so I considered it a really good product & ordered another one. This time the price was about a third of what I had initially paid. Unfortunately - the quality is definitely sub-par. After less than 3 months, the clip feels loose & the inside covering is peeling apart in 2 places and exposing my blackberry to a gummy residue. At the price - it's not worth sending it back. I would have rather paid more & gotten a quality product like I did the first time.

I sent an e-mail to customer service and it was another 2 days before they responded. They did fix the mistake, quickly sending the correct item and a return label for the incorrect item. The case itself is great; very secure.One caution, I have been keeping my Pearl in the case full time for about a week and I'm now noticing a dark spot on the screen where the magnetic closure may have affected the screen's pixels. My recommendation would be to keep the pearl in the case as little as possible (only when it's on your belt)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice case, CHEAP belt clip","review":"I purchased 2 of these and they both suffered the same fate: a broken belt clip. The belt clip snapped off when I bumped the holster (bound to happen when you're wearing it on your side).

This case is really sleek looking and I love the fact that it automatically puts the BlackBerry into sleep mode. My first one lasted almost a year before the swivel clip broke off. My second one was ordered April 28, and here it is June 27 and the clip already broke. I told my brother about this excellent holster and he is already on his third one in 6 months.I love the functionality and style of this holster, but it seems the quality is not there in the way the clip attaches to the case.

Smaller web-based vendors can be iffy, but the case arrived when it was supposed to, and it was packaged very well for shipping.I was very pleased with the quality of the case, first off. The leather is soft and well-stitched. It fits the phone very snugly without making it impossible to get the phone in and out. I like the vertical style cases more than the horizontal, and the swivelling belt clip is very sturdy. The flap is easy to open with one hand, and it doesn't interfere with accessing the phone.The case also uses the magnets to put the phone into standby, which saves battery life and talk time. The design is obviously for the Pearl, as it leaves all the important jacks and ports accessible while the phone is still in the case.You can't go wrong with this case if you need a basic, well-crafted, good quality case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy!","review":"I purchased this product and it was great for about a month. The other day I was getting out of my car and the clip broke off from my belt. The phone fell into the street and was destroyed by oncoming traffic.

If your looking for durability look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in less than a month, don't waste your time or $$$$$","review":"Not worth the money. Under normal use, wearing it on my belt :-) duh, it broke in less than a month. The plastic pin that allows you to swivel the holster is the weak link.

My children are not at all captivated by the video, and although they are in the age range for this and the other products, they are so far beyond the level of these videos that they have no interest in watching them.

So, the video shows a hundred pictures of cows without ever showing the word \\"cow\\", or naming them, or the sound they make (or anything else about them)...just picture after picture set to classical music.

My daughter who sits in total rapture at a Baby Einstein video cried after the first 5 mintues. I think it would have been nicer to see many more animals (which babies love) rather than tons of shots of a tractor and farm equipment.

The character, Declan, is a bit whiny, but, Rose is delightful. The thing that bothers me the most is the book cover. Most people probably don't think the cover of the book matters, but, sometimes it's what sparks your first interest. If I hadn't read the synopsis, I would not have purchased this book. The cover gives the reader the impression that this book is of lower grade. Also, the cover actor is not attractive and doesn't even remotely resemble the description of the character in the book.

What better fantasy than a mystery hero who is every woman's dream man. Declan fits the bill. And Rose, in spite of a free spirit and strong convictions just can't help herself.

Reagan was the later. This biography is of a man who came from rural Illinois, grew up with a dreamer alcoholic father, became the man of the house while still a teenager, and made his own way from Illinois to California to the White House. Like his ideological soulmate, Margaret Thatcher, Reagan rescued the American economy after the hyper-inflation of the 1970's.

(Both have passed away.) Trombonist Ray is heard in many big band recordings where he has done solo work, but in this album he gets to solo more extensively with a small group. Ray has often been compared to Bill Harris, but he has never been regarded as a great jazz trombonist. But who cares? He certainly is a respected trombonist and person. He doesn't embarrass himself doing these solo spots.This is a pleasant listening selection of numbers supported by Jimmie Rowles, piano; John Heard, bass; and Shelley Mann, drums. This a pretty formidable group. Zoot and Ray perform adequately while keeping the selections light and controlled. Nothing wild here. Great album to play if you're holding a dinner party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very eccentric Fantastique, other selections fine","review":"Leonard Bernstein made many fine recordings, but this is not one of them. The bells in the Witches' Sabbath are really ugly...almost dissonant and way too high in notes. Too bad they didn't use bells that more closely resembled funeral tolls. And the March to the Scaffold, my favorite part of the Symphonie, sounds terrible. The Ball is okay. Overall, the whole thing sounds like Bernstein set out to make this recording sound unique. I have not heard Bernstein's earlier attempt at the Fantastique, but they say that it was much better. Previn and the LSO do a good job with Harold in Italy and the Overtures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh Yeah...","review":"Vince Guaraldi is one of my all time favorites, and this CD is what I would personally call \\"Saturday morning cleaning music\\" only meaning it is light, gets your feet to moving...takes your cares away and you can just be-bop around the house to it.Anyone who likes the Latin beat will certainly enjoy this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this book from Michaels for $19.99, so it is definitely a deal here on amazon! But, let me warn you..there are some pretty layouts but there isn't a lot of explaination for techniques used. This may be for a more advanced scrapbooker who already knows how to do certain things but for me, I wanted some tutorials. I also found it to be quite annoying that the author repeated word for word some blurb about finding inspiration in her neighborhood. I felt like she was just trying to fill up space and insult the reader. The book could have used a lot more variety toward the last chapters when they brought in more elements to the pages. I don't consider patterned paper an extra element. It seemed like each layout was just patterned paper, stamps, and sticker letters. That's not very exciting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The title of this book drew me in. Scrapbook pages with limited supplies appeal to me because I like clean, simple pages. The guest scrapbookers create some beautiful, inspirational pages. The authors pages, however, fall short. Her photographs fail to capture meaningful moments in a creative and artistic way. Too many mediocre photos clutter the pages. There's nothing to draw me in and capture my interest.Actual design instruction is limited. Helpful little tips are scattered throughout the book, but that little bit is not enough to justify purchasing this book.

You can forgive the directors for wanting to force their ideas in the original release, it is their prerogative, and they offered a good work there; but why \\"force\\" again here?

I don't want to insult people here but if you can't work out what is going on without the voice over then you really aren't paying attention. The delicious ambiguity in the is he/isn't he a Rep still has me confused (even though Ridley Scott said he was). Ford's acting is superb, you can tell what he is thibking just by reading his face. Unless the theatrical release has all the extras that are criminally missing from this DVD DO NOT purchase it in preference to the ditrectors cut. Scott knew what he was doing, Harrison knew what he was doing when he deliberatly managled the voice overs, everyone knew what they were doing apart from the studio execs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Cinematography","review":"An amazing sci-fi movie that demonstrates alot of depth not only through its storyline, but also through its images. Ridley Scott's use of \\"selective focus\\" is amazing during one of the most powerful scenes in the movie - a scene between Rutger Hauer and the actor who played his maker. Superb!As well, the special effects put alot of todays CG animated movies to shame.

Here are the reasons you should see the offical version instead of the director's cut (spoilers ahead):1.They made Deckerd a replicant in this version. Now you don't have anyone to cheer for. 2.They cut the happy ending. I mean come on...Ridley Scott thought that was a good thing? 3. The voice-overs gave the film a great Maltese Falcon feel.

He has never seen Blade Runner, which is awful. So please, just release the thing. It is keeping us in agonies. Put us out of our misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Made","review":"I can't believe I didn't turn this movie off. I was waiting for something to happen, but nothing happened in the whole movie. It was a waste of my 2 hours and my $1 to rent it. The dvd is awful. Its got no special features, the menus are about as pretty as Christopher Lloyd in one flew over the Cuckoo's Nest. There was no plot to this movie, there was no action in this movie, there was no sex in this movie. So what's so good about it? I don't know. It was awful. Harrison Ford had about as much testosterone as the Olsen Twins. The evil man was an idiot and the naked woman was about as ugly as Whoopie Goldburg. Everybody on the internet rants and raves about this garbage so I figured I'd watch it. This is not a classic. I could have wrote this script in 5 minutes. I'm going to go watch Show Down in Little Tokyo now."},{"rating":"1","title":"why did you change the original?????","review":"The original work is in my top 10 movies of all time.

But this movie has other weaknesses. First the FX which set the mood has lost much of its power to impress, granted that can't be helped, but its still a fact. The not so subtle Japan bashing, from a time when Japan was seen as our #1 threat, seems as corny today as a Red Scare movie from the \`50s. Last the endless philosophizing by beings, that don't exist, and probably never will, on the subject of \\"are skin jobs human\\".

Take my advise... stay away from this Directors Cut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Options please.","review":"I give this a 1-star rating for Director's Cut. The original version rated 5 stars. The DC removed much vital information, like the background to the exchange when Decker is picked up to be forced back into work as a BR. The DC also inserted an idiotic scene of a unicorn trapsing through a glade - looked like it was lifted directly from \\"Legend.\\"I would venture that some preponderance of the intelligentsia expressing preference for the DC saw the OV first, thus they have already been exposed to the background info before seeing the DC. If you see the DC first, good luck. I wouldn't recommend seeing the DC at all. The OV is one of my favorite films. I resent that people who feel they know what the rest of the population's tastes \\"should\\" be have determined which version we may view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment over the original","review":"I bought the directors cut knowing it was different than the original, but it had been so long since I had seen the original I really couldn't figure out what was different. I looked at the box and saw that the narration had been taken out. What were they thinking?!? That is key to the movie! I agree without the narration it makes the directors cut pretty much a whole new movie, but to me, a movie very much lacking in depth. You go along for the ride not really knowing exactly what is going on except for the fact that you have seen the original so you are already clued in. It's like watching a movie with the volume turned off half the time. Boo for the director's cut. Release the original on DVD ...... please."},{"rating":"2","title":"HD VERSION IS A KNOCK OUT!!!","review":"Watched the HD DVD version from the UK. I have to say it is nothing short of spectacular! The detail, amazing, the sound, enveloping, utilizing the TRUE HD format. Was not able to find any dirt or edge enhancements. Ridley did a great job restoring his vision; even some minor fixes and CGI throughout the movie. I highly recommend it for any Blade Runner fan...Don't know about the Blu-ray version but suspect it will look just as good since the print is probably from the same master.The 2nd disc DANGEROUS DAYS is not in HD only regular dvd. The disc runs almost 4 hours covering many of the production aspects of the movie. This set does not come with the extra 3 discs. Will have to wait for the US version on the 18th."},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless Sci-Fi Noir experience","review":"Well worth having, a directors cut by Ridley Scott himself, is worthy of a high award for true movie magic. With a dreary imagery of a future Los Angeles/Hong Kong mix, repleat with rain and a booze soaked detective, the new cut is a classic imagery of Filme Noir with a Science Fiction base, and a well made adaption of Phillip K. Dick's original work. The new version works on several levels, to include a Unicorn scene that ties in with the new ending, that develops and refines the underlying theme and character development. This is one of my top-shelf, A-list movies, and every time I view it, I find myself thinking on it for several days afterwords. A must have for the connoiseur."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not agree with the director","review":"I first saw this movie on VHS in 1982 and was totally blown away with such a daring futuristic movie, for me the voice over of Harrison Ford told the underlining story, it was very important in my opinion. Without his comentary how the heck would you know about (\\"gutter talk a mish mash of english spanish german what have you?\\") Deckard explains this, other wise how could he be a blade runner and not know the city speak? In the directors cut you have no idea what the heck is going on, as friends virgin veiwers I have tested this with close friends, all prefer the original version! Need I say more Ridley? Ok the trees at the very end are a bit lame but without the commentary the film is lost on so many people in my humble opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treat for fans of the movie","review":"The 5-disc special edition, in the shape of Deckard's briefcase, is great for everyone who is a fan of the original novel, and/or all the versions of this movie and how they relate to the interpretation of the story. The package contents are put together very well in the \\"briefcase\\", and who wouldn't love the chrome \\"origami\\" unicorn?? Fun packaging and content.I think at around $60 this is a steal. Five versions of the movie (including the messianic \\"Final Cut\\"), several documentaries including a new 3.5hour one, some art, and a few cool toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, quality versions of Blade Runner","review":"I had been waiting for the Blu-Ray versions of Blade Runner. Lots of commentary and well worth the price of entry. I particularly like that this compilation has the original screenplay version with Harrison Ford's voiceover. I'm one of the few, apparently, who thinks that is the best version. When I watch one of the other versions, I always miss Harrison Ford's voice guiding me along. I also like it's happy ending. In this set there is a European voiceover version that has longer action sequences. That's the best version of all, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't like it as well as the original.","review":"The Director's cut doesn't have the stuff that the original has. The commentary by Harrison Ford makes the movie more then just a special effects movie. It gave the movie a heart and soul that most flicks just don't have. More so, having read the book, I find the commentary put more of what the author wanted it to be. I find the ending was cut short. I miss his comment on the Officer in charge, I think it leaves the movie naked. Understand that I have the movie and I like it. Just not as well as the one that I saw at the show. I'm full of awe at the picture. I still find DVD so much like being at the movies. It's one of the best Sci-Fi movies of all time., but get me the original movie version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby with the Bathwater","review":"The obviously contrived \\"Hollywood ending\\" of the original version (which I have and treasure) was its major (and, arguably, only) flaw.

It had an entirely different feel to the move. The voice over explained many of the things that perhaps the director thought should have been self-explanitory. I think that Harrison Ford's flat delivery of the voice-over emphasizeed the idea the he was a burned out cop. I really did not get that in the non-voiced-over version. One man's trash is another man's treasure.Although, I was not extremely interested in the other versons of the movie, I think that it is important to include them as part of the whole Blade Runner saga.

All I can say is that this movie continues to amaze me the more I watch it. Special effects done over 20 years ago were optics and models, and they appear just as crisp and clean as anything computer generated would appear now. I can't believe how the images constantly jump off the screen at me, and the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack is just as amazing as the visuals.My only complaint is that the movie starts playing with a default Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack when I pop it in my player, and I have to manually use a pop-up menu to choose the Dolby TrueHD soundtrack. It seems that with lossless soundtracks being the default standard for 99.99% of Blu-ray releases that the TrueHD soundtrack would be the first one to start playing on any machine (as all Blu-ray machines can down-mix that soundtrack to standard Dolby Digital for receivers that don't support TrueHD)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motion Picture is great; the DVD was faulty","review":"I love the movie, let's get that right up front. The fact that the DVD pack came with the documentary was gravy, but definitely a plus. Now I realize that I was getting the DVD for a good price and that corners might be cut somewhere, however it was somewhat telling that when I first opened the plastic case housing the discs, the actual plastic DVD case tore as if it were paper! No big deal, it's just a case, right? So I was able to watch the movie and loved it. However, the second DVD (the one with the documentary) would not play. After examining it, it definitely appears to be faulty as the physical DVD appears cloudy. I tried the disc in multiple players without luck.While I am still happy to own the movie, I would be hesitant to order from the same supplier a second time not knowing where they source their movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films ever made","review":"Cutting edge future scope never before seen.

I've seen it a couple dozen times since its release in the early-eighties and this is one that I never grow tired of. The Director's Cut is exactly what the name implies \\"A Cut\\".

It had been many years since I last watched an earlier cut of this film on VHS. This film has made an awesome transformation, especially in terms of audio and visual remastering. I had no problems with this DVD format. Many parties have been writing about errors concerning a disc within their box set of Blade Runner; this concern does not apply to this DVD release. There are several cuts (releases or versions) of this film, and any Blade Runner fan is surely to have their favorite; the Final Cut is my favorite. Despite the addition and subtraction of particular storyboard elements, this \\"Final Cut\\" is seemless in it's production. In fact, I was so engaged in the mastery of the \\"Final Cut\\" that I couldn't recall what had been changed from so many years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sci-fi film!!!","review":"Bladerunner: The Directors Cut can lay claim to this. It is has the brilliant visuals which you'd normally expect from director Ridley Scott combined with an excellent soundtrack by Vangelis. Good script, acting and special effects.This 'Cut' of the film is more in the way of what the director intended it to be as opposed to what the executives/studios wanted. The narration and 'happy ending' that spoilt the original release have thankfully been removed. This makes for a more intelligent and thought provoking film.This DVD release is good. Picture quality is fine, but could be better. Audio - Dolby Digital 2.0 - does the job. It does lack the extras that you'd expect from many new releases these days, but with a film this good extras aren't that important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definetely worth the buy","review":"First off I'd like to say I love Blade Runner; both versions, but I still think Director's cut is much better ( deeper, more atmosphere, mystic ). The movie, overally, is a sci-fi masterpiece, one of the bestest, without doubt. The dark atmosphere makes the movie so enjoyable, and quite sad thou', because it shows masterfully the human emotions; and androids, and what the future could be. Dark, dirty, clouded, wasted...So to the story. It tells a story of a retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, who is chosen back to his job; to take another droid-hunt. ( This is not action -movie, so I thought, but I wasn't disappointed; this is better like it is ) So he takes the job, and you'll see what happens. The story is multiple, and hard to understand at first ( maybe easier for those who have readed the book ), but it makes it re-watchable. I've seen it many many times, and I'm going to see it many times to come.\\"...what is life?... it vanishes like tears in rain...\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"BLADE RUNNER-VOICE OVER.","review":"ITS A PITY THAT THE DVD EDITION ONLY HAS THE DIRECTORS CUT.

As for the ending of the original, the final words gave the audiance something to ponder vs. the Director's cut which left the audiance wondering, wondering what happened to the film \\"Blade Runner\\"!

I don't know why people ruin a perfectly good film, because it was perfect as it was. No art form is ever 'perfect' per say, but it's more like c'est la vie. With so much editing, you lose the flavor of the spontaneity of the moment, which created so much of the great fireworks/special effects.

What happened to one of the coolest endings with Harrion Ford saying, \\"I don't know how much time we have...but then again who does?\\" and he drives off in a beautiful serene view with Sean Young. Instead we simply see Ford entering an elevator with Sean Young and slamming the door...WEAK! Save your money. This version isn't even worth renting. Without the narration, this movie feels 3 hours long. The ending leaves you feeling like...what? I'm not even going to mention the Unicorn.

Certainly we are heading that way with the extermination of animals in the wild. Will there come a time when what we call \\"robots\\" will be as human-like as those in the movie? Who knows. Will the climate on earth become as rotten as seen in the movie? Will people leave Earth to find a better life? SO many questions were raised in this movie.

I like getting into Deckard's mind, and the original version does just that.This is classic Science-Fiction meets Cop and Baddies. It is way cool and awesome!I am so happy to have found the original version! I would go to game and comic book conventions, they sometimes sell movies, but they never had a DVD copy. Now I have it!

They did as little as they could to transfer this movie to DVD. The picture quality is mediocre. Film scratches are easily seen zipping by during the opening sequence, and throughout the film. A distinct background hiss is clearly audible, no doubt due to the transfer from 1982 analog recording. It is sad they did nothing to remove or dampen the hiss. The sound and picture quality really pales when you compare it to a more modern DVD such as \\"T2\\". Otherwise, a terrific movie to get lost in when all the lights are out, and the neighbors are quiet. The DVD is double-sided. It contains the Widescreen version on one side, and the \\"standard\\" pan & scan on the other. For the sci-fi fan, a must-have DVD for your collection. Worth the low price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"beware of the included dvd","review":"Overall excellent package, but be aware that the disc containing the excellent making of documentary is not on Blu-Ray but on a DVD. Whilst the Blu-Ray's are region free, the DVD is not, and I had trouble playing the DVD over here in Australia (region 4). Really I think this is rather poor, as the package is advertised as Blu-Ray, and the \\"5-Disc Collectors Edition\\" statement would be expected to mean 5 Blu-Ray discs, not 4 Blu-Rays and 1 DVD. I do not care that the content, the making of documentary, is in standard def, but see no reason why it still could not and should not have been put on a Blu-Ray disc.

Dick. The Blade Runners were formed due to an Off-World mutiny by human like robots called replicants. Blade Runners functioned to annihilate the replicants, a process called retirement. The story revolves around the ex-Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is forced to rejoin and help retire four replicants. However, these replicants are of a new model called Nexus 6, which are far superior to the previous models. The Nexus 6 have a safety mechanism that automatically retires the replicant after four years. As a result, they have returned in order to prevent their retirement. Blade Runner provides a superior cinematic opportunity for suspense and reflection over existentialism, which is delivered with both brute force and gentle touch."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unsurpassed classic","review":"A great concept, fantastic film full of atmosphere. The music, direction, acting and effects are captivating. It only (or will be) dated by its Los Angeles 2019 tag.

Team that with some beautiful jazzy background music and I am a goner. BLADE RUNNER has a mother lode of these mood inducers, and all of the silhouettey, shadowy sci-fi special effects a person could want. I have also always been a sucker for 1940s pompadour hairdos especially when worn by Replicants in the Future. This movie is a feast for the senses. Harrison Ford and Sean Young are Young and Ford and young and beautiful--more perfection to add to the futuristic landscape. I am waiting for the jury to return on which DVD is the best to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"An utterly profound journey through the dark side of man.","review":"This movie was absolutely astounding. The setting was incredibly mesmerizing (there's a reason it's been copied over and over again, most recently by Fifth element and Dark City). Furthermore, the story explores the darker side of humankind through the treatment of replicants as machines and through the behavior of the replicants as they become desperate. A must watch for anyone who acknowledges that humans are not the blithe shells hollywood portrays them to be. The unicorn vision is essential to understanding deckard's identity, and if you were too dumb to catch on to that you probably had to get a 12 year old to post your review for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner","review":"Sharp and great color; this is a classic and in Blue Ray it really shines!!!

While the removal of the voice over from Harrison Ford no doubt pleased Ridley Scott and the film critics, it lost a considerable amount of clarity.

Give me the original film any day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Directors Cut falls from height of original","review":"The Directors Cut without the voice-overs of the original movie does not provide the morality play characteristics of original. I have watched the original movie about 20 times and have been fascinated with the deepth of emotion that it brings to the screen with so little in the way of dialogue, but without the voice-overs much of this is lost. I watched the directors cut once and enjoyed the scenery but not much more. Amazon should find some copies of the original to sell."},{"rating":"1","title":"No voice-overs makes Blade Runner turn Slient","review":"The DC of Blade Runner lacks the seedy 1940's PI tone that was set with Ford's voice overs.

Its highly stylized version of a 2019 Los Angeles, which is fantastically conceived and realized, became the source of inspiration for countless other, mostly lesser, sci-fi movies.What makes \\"Blade Runner\\" so remarkable is that its spectacular production design is not the only outstanding achievement. The film has an exciting, multi-layered story and a terrific cast. Also worth noting is the highly supportive music by the Greek composer Vangelis.\\"Blade Runner\\" is one of those rare films that actually improve with each viewing, because there is always something new to discover. The film shows no sign of aging, which is also extremely unusual for a film with many special-effects. If Ridley Scott had never made another movie, his place in film history would nonetheless have been secured."},{"rating":"2","title":"They may be different but they have their own qualities","review":"I really like how Blade Runner has an old fifties detective sense about it but is still set in the future. You notice this with the over voice provided by Deckard, but at the same time the removal of the over voice gives the movie more to think about. The unicorn vision was kind of creative because we all have our little random thoughts that come from the back of our mind, but it was a little corny. Even though it's not as appealing as a unicorn it would have made more sense for it to be a sheep since the story was based on \\"DO Androds Dream of Electric Sheep\\" where Deckard owns an artificial sheep.

Mix that with fantastic attention to detail in every scene and outstanding acting (has Rutger ever done a better job?), the film is one to be viewed over and over. Top 10.The 4-version package is a wonderful plus. While the changes in the final cut to the director's are few, there are a couple nice touches that help define the characters just that much more.

Yes, the visuals are stunning (especially for early 80s fx) and the concept is interesting, but the plot is paper-thin and utterly predictable, there is no suspense to be found anywhere, and the Vangelis soundtrack is intrusive, inappropriate, and tacky. The wonderfully talented Harrison Ford gives as good a performance as the \\"look exhausted, now look scared, now look exhausted again\\" direction allows, but are we really supposed to believe that he'd fall for an utterly unattractive Sean Young?

The voice over gave insight into what was happening that is not revealed by just watching the movie. And now in the movie where Deckard used to be narating, it's just silence. What's the point. I only watched about 10 minutes of the Director's Cut version and then I shut it off.Blade Runner used to be one of my favorite movies. I would have put it as a 5 Star rating in the original version. I will never watch it as the Directors Cut. I hope to be able to find an original copy.I hope Ridley Scott doesn't ruin Alien or Aliens like he did Blade Runner."},{"rating":"1","title":"quadrouple + dip","review":"enough is enough stop ripping off customers how many times can one polish a film which was so much better than et...and yet we have seen it all before"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad film with excellent comment","review":"It is amazing that so many people voted for this film, so overwhelming that I thought it must be given a try. If only judging from the cover design and the year it was taken, I would never buy it. It turned out to be so boring and dull after about 10 mins of starting.The director was successful in making a good start, but failed to make a good development and entangled in slow paced acting & dialogue in dark & disgusting environment and so on.To rent before buying is my advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie's not good!","review":"I didn't like Blade Runner at all.

This short novel grabs the reader from the beginning and won't let go until the story is over. I couldn't put it down. To translate that to the screen, Ridley Scott appropriately added a voice over narration to help explain the development of the story. In his director's cut, he removed this voice over and made it all but impossible to truly understand what is happening in the story. I love this movie, but refuse to buy... ...the Director's Cut. Even though I know the story, the film is just not complete without the narration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Any Other Compilation DVD Set","review":"Okay, so I'm a big \\"Blade Runner\\" fan.

I'm talkingabout the Matrix collection. The Star Wars collection. The Die Hardcollection. You get the drift.Simply put, the different versions of the movie are included. Plus youget some cool artwork cards. Plus you get a replica of the unicorn.Plus you get a model of the car. AND you even get the V-K case! I meanthis is truly a collector's set.As far as the movie, I have always preferred the theatrical release. Butif you like the Director's Cut or the Final Cut, that's okay...becauseyou get them all!

When I saw Blade Runner, I was in awe. It was much better than I could ever had imagined. The storyline was original and addicting, and the characters were one of a kind. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is definitely my favorite character and he brings the whole DVD together, summing up the story with his line \\"I want more life.\\" He was able to say things that were meant to be creepy and menacing, but that actually made me laugh, particularly when he yelled \\"That hurt!\\" to Deckard, who hit Batty in the head twice with a metal beam. Blade Runner is a definite must-have for people who love sci-fi, unexpected twists in a movie, and villains who are able to make your skin crawl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why don't they do a Special Edition of this?????????","review":"Everyone else is doing it, why not Blade Runner!Where's the Special Platinum Collector's Extended Director's Editorial Criterion Collection Super Duper Edition of this CLASSIC film?Heck, even George Lucas has given in and started releasing the Star Wars movies (the new ones, of course) on DVD.This DVD is terrible. It was among the first releases on the new DVD format, and by contemporary standards, it's just awful. No remastered audio or video. No special features.

You will not be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best. Film. Ever.","review":"In my not so humble opinion, this film made by the master director Sir Ridley Scott, is the most perfect piece of cinema ever put together. Every aspect of the production brought their A+++ game. From set design, to costumes, to lighting, to model work and special effects, to the acting, to the score, to the direction... perfection. Even thirty years later it remains an undated masterpiece. My all time favorite film. And I have a lot of favorite films. In the Final Cut of Blade Runner Ridley fixed the only shot that took me out of the amazing experience, a dove flying up towards a bright blue sky, intercut in the middle of a pouring rain at nighttime end scene. Problem fixed = Perfect film. Perfect I says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two versions of Workprint","review":"I received my Blade Runner set this past week. I put in Disc 1, the Final Cut, and I think I got the Workprint instead. I also reviewed Disc 5 and it seemed to be the same as Disc 1.Disc 1 contains a version where there is no opening credits, but just the dictionary definition of Replicant. This is the workprint version, correct????I know this has been a problem in the past (wrong editions on discs) but I thought this was resolved.I called Warner Brothers and they are sending me the correct disc for the Final Cut, at no charge.We'll see what happens...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Film Quality for Disc 3 but duplicate Disc 5","review":"The Blu Ray version of Blade Runner is amazing, at least for the theatrical releases. Unfortunately there seems to be a bad run on the disc sets. My first set was missing the final cut edition of the movie. It had a duplicate workprint disc with the disc 1 label. After arranging a an exchange, I just received a second set with the same problem. Apparently others are facing the same problems as well. If you order the set be sure to check disc one and five to see if they are the same discs. One can compare the two discs for similarities. Disc five has one commentary line and has a poorer screen quality than the other editions. Disc one is supposed to be a high quality edition which disc five is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"New release sets the tone of mystery.","review":"The Director's Cut of Blade Runner returns the sense of mystery to the film. Too much explanation is not a good thing, can you imagine if 2001 A Space Odessey had a voice-over narration? I can remember everyone having an opinion about what that monolith really represented. In this film, the very obscurity of the plot line lends an air of other-worldly substance, that narration made it more of just another detective story. Another thing, I can remember a review way back when stating that the film had be cut almost a full hour, I had expected that this version would have restored a lot of that time, what's the scoop?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and groundbreaking visuals - almost sterile plot.","review":"A visually stunning masterpiece of science fiction which has truly earned its lofty place in this genre. It's only failing being it's lack of a human touch, for lack of a better word. It has a certain cold sterile nature that leaves the viewer disconnected from the characters, and at a loss to feel anything for them or the world they inhabit - except for a mild throbbing depression. Also, as far as the DVD is concerned, the \\"production notes\\" mentioned as a special feature are nothing more than a list of the actors, their pictures and film credits. Very disappointing especially considering the place this film takes in it's genre's history. One would have thought they would have had more to show it's many fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sure thing.","review":"I have seen hundreds of movies, from every genre exploited, and I can say that this is hands down my favorite. Don't go into this however, thinking that it is action, or you will be disappointed. Ridly Scott's slow-paced masterpiece is for the thinking man. To truely understand this films sole and purpose, will require hours of thought and multiple viewings. A safe buy even if you've never seen it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"An under-rated science fiction classic.","review":"This movie is a masterpiece. The dark, rainy atmosphere of the future LA completely overwhelms the viewer. The story is also very dark and thought provoking. Harrison Ford puts in one of his best performances. Another thing I like about this movie is that its not afraid to take risks, avoiding the conventional plot turns. It doesn't spell out everything for the viewer. It may not appear to the typical action fan, but those people who take the time to appreciate this fine film at a deeper level will be rewarded. I can watch this film over and over again. A must-buy DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original....","review":"I would like to start out by saying the majority of Mr. Scott's films are works of art (e.g., Gladiator). I managed to see (Uncut, on TV) The Director's Cut version of \\"Bladerunner\\", and the original version of \\"Bladerunner\\", uncut as well. Being quite frank, THE ORIGINAL WAS DEFINITELY BETTER THAN THE CUT. The director's cut was best left unmade. The narration helped to understand the storyline, and the happy ending should have been left in. Seriously, WHO CARES if it was bad? It gave a good idea on how the movie SHOULD have ended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back 'voice-over narration'!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I'm afraid this movie has been ruined,like George Lucas's 'Star Wars' remake,with the add-ins,that weren't there in the movies first presentation.

I purposely give this a one 'star' because of the deletation of the narration,and please get rid of that 'Unicorn',please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the Final Cut version instead","review":"There are three different versions of Bladerunner, which can create a lot of confusion for people. Each version is edited differently, with different scenes, different effects, and even a different story.The most entertaining, intelligent, visually beautiful, definitive version is Ridley Scott's director's cut, also known as \\"Bladerunner: The Final Cut\\". That version is available on remastered DVD so don't spend your money on anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The studio did it right the first time!","review":"Ridley Scott is more into visuals than dialog and plot. This much he has admitted in counless interviews.By removing the narration, he leaves the viewer with a lot of pretty pictures and not much else.Even worse, we don't even have the option of buying the original (and superior) version.Bad enough that this adaptation bears little to no resemblance the the Phillip K. Dick novel (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) it proports to be based on. At least the original was an entertaining film by it's own rights. Now it lacks any narrative flow or explanation.

HOWEVER, one thing most reviewers seem to overlook regarding the Director's cut is that we already know the film and are familiar with the general film noire approach to the story, character interaction, development, and so on.Classic film noire often needs narration. Even if Ford initially narrated poorly on purpose, it kind of fits in with the character. Besides which, the D Cut does nothing to replace the narration, so there are great gobs of panoramic dead air, with maybe a bit of background music. It becomes a struggle to stay focused. I tested this with two of my Media Studies sections, and the narration kept the most audience attention hands down, not to mention a keener grasp of the film.I think a perfect marriage would be to include the extra footage, the D cut ending, and selected portions of the narration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this DVD","review":"If you don't already own it, rent this DVD instead and wait (& pray) for the 3-Disc version to come out. This is a first-generation barebones DVD without any features.

Otherwise it would be 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but some quibbles","review":"It is great to finally be able to get disks with all these different versions, but a few things need to be noted: (1) the only way to get the Workprint version is in this 5-disk set packed into a \\"briefcase\\" and which also includes a bunch of \\"memorabilia\\" and other junk and wasted packaging. It would be nice if they'd just put out the disks without the other stuff. (2) The only way to get any of the older versions is in either the 4-disk or 5-disk sets. It would be nice if they made the older versions (basically disk 3) available separately for those who only want one of the older cuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is about time, but way too expensive!","review":"I have for years been trying to get my hands on a DVD copy of the original 1982 cut as my VHS tape is worn out and it was a master. How anybody could like the Director's cut is beyond me. Give me the original movie. The Decker voice over to me gives it that film noir quality of an old Sam Spade movie. I wish that the 1982 version was released by itself, but now I have to fork over big bucks just to own the original in DVD. I have never read the book that the movie was based on as I could care less as I just like movies for my escapism and only read non-fiction. I could only give this a 4 stars as the price is too high and it includes the directors cut. I have never met anybody who likes that cut but reading the post here I guess there is just no accounting for taste. To each his own I guess. Can't wait to see the original on my big screen surround sound system."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, but you get very little besides the movie","review":"The audio and video looks fine in this version, but I was disappointed that this \\"final cut\\" version does not have the Harrison Ford narration (which I like though many don't).

I love mostly all his movie with few exceptions, this is one of them. I rented this movie thinking it would be thrilling, considering it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Harrison Ford. Don't get me wrong, the movie is very visually impressive and is well-directed, but the plot is plain out weird and boring. I felt like I was falling asleep at some parts and then waking up fifteen minutes later not knowing what had happened. I never did fall asleep, it just felt like that. It is worth watching for special effects and direction, but the plot and story is really boring and confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Blade Runner is a moving work of art - a dynamic painting.

The lighting and set design were meant to evoke '40s Film Noir but now remind me of an over-produced MTV video. The acting is of the less-will-seem-like-more-when-it-really-isn't school that Robert DeNiro inspired.

Too many nuances that there was just no way you are going to pick up were omitted when the voice overs were cut, that is unless you were a mind reader.

Disc 1, labeled as \\"The Final Cut\\" was in fact, the Workprint disc - the Final Cut disc was entirely omitted from the set! Due to numerous reports on Amazon and in other forums, it makes me think that this error must affect thousands of units but only a few of the purchases are returned either due to consumer ignorance or laziness. This same manufacturing error has been reported since the release of the collector's edition and it is still not corrected - I suppose it is cheaper to replace a few discs for those who take the time to complain than to recall the faulty lot of sets with possible errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT CLEAR THAT THIS IS THE DIRECTOR'S CUT","review":"It is very unclear from the description that this is the so called director's cut, which is much different than the original theatrical release.

Without the narrative insight delivered by Harrison Ford's character, this version falls flat. Boring.I'd always thought Ridley Scott was brilliant but I question his choices (and taste) on this release version. I guess it's a good thing the studio intervened on the theater release.I was fooled into buying this director's cut version having no idea it had been so altered, thinking it was the same movie with extra scenes.

Ridley Scott was quoted at saying he did a quick edit for this dvd release and has plans to do a better job for a more complete (one would presume special edition) release.I too bought this, drooling in anticipation of the director's cut of one of my most beloved films. While I do believe that the lack of narration improves the film (although this never really bothered me all that much, perhaps because my first several viewings were when I was a kid), the bad editing means you should wait for a better DVD release."},{"rating":"2","title":"blade runner is the shiznit!","review":"i want to start off by saying that ridley scott is the man! that said, this is one of the best sci-fi movies out there. with very convincing acting, a moody soundtrack and a story that i still don't understand, it makes for a very engrossing movie. it is a dark, disturbing movie (especially when harrison ford caps darrel hannah and she spazes out on the floor), and i recommend it to anyone who likes movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHEN WILL WARNER BROS.

It is just poetically beautiful in its settings, soul-fully sublime in its content, stylishly sensuous in its interpretation of the script, with striking imageries one can never forget. It is more than art. It is a piece of work that resembles the struggle of mankind. This is the movie that must be shown to our children in the future, and Ridley's message will certainly stay immortal. (Perhaps this is the only movie ever made that has substance, and artistically it encompasses all philosophies and cultures.) A true masterpiece!!! (Buy this film for private collection, it's just as precious as a diamond.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was good in it's time.","review":"I watched this movie about a month ago. I thought it was really slow at getting to the plot and it drug out between the action. I think it could have been an excellent movie if it would have got my attention faster. It was worth seeing Harrison Ford in an early movie but that was basically it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Version Please!","review":"As others here have said, why just the director's cut? Where is the original with the voice over? I like them both, but prefer the voice over version. Why hasn't the original with voice over come out on DVD? Why not put both versions on this one? For that reason alone this DVD gets 1 star. Which is sad, because this is definitely a 4 or 5 star movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"I generally love Ridley Scott's work and the original theatrical release of Blade Runner is by far the more emotionally evocative of the two versions. My only hope of buying a DVD of this movie is if they bring out an Ultimate Edition that includes both versions... Until the Ultimate Edition is released, I'll hold on tight to my VHS copy of the original. There is hope that this may happen since Ridley Scott's Legend Ultimate Edition has been released. This disk includes both the original release and a director's cut. This would make sense for the studio since those people that bought the stripped-down sterile director's cut would also buy the new disk... You know, if I could watch and compare both versions, I might start to appreciate some of [the] critique. Who knows?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner 5 Disc HD-DVD","review":"Blade Runner in HD format is quite possibly one of the best transfers to date and in my opinion is a must have. 5 Star Picture and Audio quality - Great Price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie, visually fantastic with big package of goodies","review":"No need to review the film. Yes, it's amazing.I was very impressed with just how much is in the five disc set. There is more in there than you could imagine. You get all the previous releases in HD as well! And, since it's HD, all three of those previous releases fit on one disk. Pretty cool.If only Emperor Lucas would come down from his ivory tower and give us the original Star Wars movies in an HD format.The visual quality of the HD version is unbelievable. I endured this movie on VHS. It looked like it was filmed in fog. It was obviously way ahead of the current technology. HD does this film proud.Now it looks as good as it really was all along.Kudos to Philip Dick for such a compelling story. Can you believe he wrote that in the late 60's? What a wonderfully insightful imagination?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good effort but lacks in many ways","review":"The original release with the voiceover at least made this movie interesting. Without it I am sad to say it is just a slow moving peice of eyecandy. The voiceover though hotly debated was one of the main ingredients that gave this film it's Noir feel.Also by trying to add to the additional idea that Deckard could be a replicant totally killed whatever effect had been built up throughout the movie.The short story was much better ....The DVD itself is subpar and has no extra's of note."},{"rating":"1","title":"The directors cut STINKS!","review":"Sorry Ridley, but that is the fact. The words directors cut are 100% correct; the theatrical release was 122 minutes and the directors cut is 117 minutes. First of all is this verison 5.1? If so I don't see it. What a waste. This [expensive] verison is the same piece of junk dvd that I have left on the store racks for the past 2 years. No 5.1 & no theatrical = No sale. Plus the theatrical is Much better. The directors cut reaks! Hey ridley thanks but you can keep the stupid unicorn scene!Here is how much I loath this movie I consider Bladerunner to be one of the best Scifi every made I own over 400 dvds and I refuse to by anything but the theatical release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Never having seen the movie (or at least remembering it), I bought the dvd because I hear of it being one of the great science fiction movies. The movie is slow without much plot and character development, and contains entirely too little action for a movie of it's theme. The music I think is terrible - I wished someone would've rescored the whole movie. The art direction is very good although some special effects are less than par (too often you see cars suspended from cables). The dvd is about as bare as you can get, containing basically no extras - even the \\"jump to a scene\\" option only gives about 9 \\"jumping in\\" places, about every 3-6 chapters. It should at least have the theatrical trailer which is standard on nearly all dvds. I find the fact that the dvd contained both the standard and widescreen versions to be a plus though. Even if you like the movie, you will find much lacking from the dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Final Cut not included, labeled as such but incorrect","review":"The problem with the collection is that the disk labelled Final Cut is not the real Final cut.

This movie is mentioned so many times every where and from everyone... so I finally rented it last night. Ok..... now, what is so great about this movie?!! It nearly bored me to death! I love movies and I'm not that picky but this has got to be the worst sci fi movies I have ever seen(I'm huge fan of sci fi and horror films by the way), and talk about over hype!

While technically marvelous and full of visual invention (it does use noir influences effectively), the story drags on endlessly and the characters, especially Ford's, remain aloof, uninteresting, and frustrating. As an exercise in style, it has undoubted appeal, but it must be heavily criticized at the screenplay level. When a story is in service to the visuals, it reflects a lack of confidence at the narrative level. I have never found Ford to be an appealing actor (he is far too bland to be a commanding leading man), but at no other time has his character been so devoid of passion or insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overrated movie in history?","review":"To the above statement I would have to say yes. If I were to go over every film made I'd be hard pressed to find one that's more overrated. Ok, the movie has cool special effects and music. I bought the soundtrack and can get the special effects jolt I need from Lord of the Rings or some other such vehicle. I have no idea why time and time again I see glowing reviews for this very unpleasant movie. There's nothing compelling or likable that I can find in either the characters of the dialogue. Which version would I recommend of the original or the director's? Neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"best sci fi movir ever","review":"This is the greatest scifi movie of all time, even beating out star wars, Ridley Scotts greatest cinematic achievement.

Give back the orignal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The director doesn't make the cut","review":"You would think directors would stand behind their work to ensure that the movie original was uncut. Some of the finest parts at the end, including the epilogue, were removed. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Overhyped Sci-Fi Film Ever","review":"Okay, I'll admit it, Blade Runner wasn't a terrible movie, but it wasn't a classic either. In fact it was actually a flop at the box office when it came out. Given the special effects are marvelous, and the acting is pretty good, but as far as the story goes, this movie really doesn't have too much to offer. I mean, basically Harrison Ford just runs around and kills andriods that have escaped so they can be free? What the heck, it sounds like he's the bad guy to me, but yet the robots are supposed to be the villians. I just didn't think this movie was that great, so if you're looking for a real Sci-Fi flick, go get The Thing or Terminator 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for the electric sheep...","review":"Okay, on its own merits this is an okay film, but the fact that it completely bastardizes Philip K. Dick's wonderful Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the novel upon which it was based, more or less totally ruined it for me. Virtually all of the rich layers of reality, religious allegory, and *many* significant plot points were completely absent from the film. One of the main characters, Jack Isidore, was entirely eliminated, and the shared messianic experiences and electronic animals were also gone. Also, Rick was married in the novel.If you're going to see this, you should definitely read the novel as well--it's a much richer experience.Neat-o special effects, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"another remaster still no Dolby5.1","review":"Don't be fooled by the word Dolby in the product description. If you look at the technical section you'll find that although encoded for Dolby digital the audio is still only the original 2 channel stereo and only contains left-right tracks. This movie cries out for an audio remastering to at least 5.1 discreet. I can't vouch for the supposed transfer improvement since I already on the previous director's cut and don't need another one. If this is released in HD (whatever the format) without the addition of an audio remix it would be a travesty. And if anyone involved with the movie ever reads this stuff (doubtful)... When the audio does get remix please no hack jobs. Upgrading to 5.1 is great only if the time is taken and the money spent to do it right. Better no 5.1 than one that sounds like it doesn't go with the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The first Blu-Ray disc I ever bought","review":"The Blade Runner five disc complete collectors edition was the first Blu-Ray disc(s) that I ever bought. At the time (January '08) Blu-Ray prices were still pretty steep, but this collection was about the same price as a regular Blu-Ray single disc. So being a fan of the film it was not a hard choice for me to make. The collection is by far the greatest package that I have ever gotten. There are five discs, one which is just a documentary (Dangerous Days) chronicling the entire creation of the film. The other discs are different iterations of the same film, but they have their differences. Either way they all have just about the best transfers (especially \\"The Final Cut\\") that I have seen on Blu-Ray and I currently own fifteen discs. This buy is somewhat of a no brainer for a owner of a Blu-Ray player especially if they are a Blade Runner fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice!","review":"I've seen \\"Blade Runner\\" at least 50 times since my first viewing at the \\"ole Neptune Theater on 45th\\" in Seattle back in 1982-83.(the exact date escapes me)I've never seen it look as good as it does on Blu-ray! The 1080p resolution made it seem like I was watching it for the first time all over again! There were myriad little details that I had never seen before, graffiti on the walls and so forth, that makes me very glad to have upgraded my 27\\" Standard Definition TV to a 50\\" 1080p DLP TV. Hi-Def ROCKS! I'm a fan of the original cut with Mr. Ford's voice-over narration and I've had several copies on VHS but never in widescreen. Now, to have all the versions available in one set is a dream come true. Don't even get me started on how good the audio is! I have to upgrade to a home theater receiver that supports Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD audio now or I'll never be happy!

As a fan of Cyberpunk novels (Neuromancer, Snow Crash, etc.), I have been told many times that I should see this movie. Now I have, and I must say I wish that I hadn't. Movies like Strange Days, The Matrix, or even 5th Element are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Cure For Insomnia","review":"First off I really love Sci-Fi movies and have tried to watch this 3 times now and have fallen asleep everytime. My god this movie was so boring it couldnt hold my interest. I loved Alien and the second one (Aliens) even more although I am well aware Ridley Scott did not direct that one. This movie is perfect in one respect and that sleep disorder clinics could definitely use it as a cure for insomnia. Now thats the perfect way to re- release a 20 year old movie for the umpeenth time."},{"rating":"1","title":"most over rated sci-fi movie ever!","review":"i don't understand why this movie is regarded as a masterpiece? i've fallen asleep every time i have attempted to watch it. the story is boring. one man hunts down escaped prisoners. whopee. nothing we haven't seen in 40 other movies. the twist is that they are all robots. wow. the \\"mystery\\" of whether harrison ford is a replicant or not is not compelling. maybe it's because harrison ford's acting is so wooden and boring that i just assumed he's been a robot his entire career. the only good thing about this movie is the production design. however even that gets boring and monotonous. everything is in the dark. how about a daylight scene to contrast it with all of the dark? BORING SNOOZFEST. if you want a good ridley scott sci fi movie, rent ALIEN, even though that is really a horror movie. still, the characters are more interesting and the story more engaging than this over rated piece of crapola."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. Ridley Scott in an overrated hack. Terrible score. Awful set design. Horrible script. Dull acting. Had the feel of a student film. I didn't like it at all. Just my opinion.

Guess what, its still in the package and will never be opened in my house. The original Theatrical Release is the one and only Blade Runner. You cannot imagine how Harrison Ford's narration adds depth to this movie. The Director's Cut is such a let down and I'm can't beleive Ripley Scott took it off the video versions. When will the Theatrical Cut be released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess--even with the \\"do over\\"","review":"Admittedly, I'm a fan of the book... The film, however, No. When they finally gave Ridley Scott the chance at a \\"director's cut\\" edition he should have done the world a favor and put it through a shredder.

The film depicts a society where value of human life is very low. The technical gimmick of this film is the use of made-to-order disposable human laborers (with built in expiration dates). When there's a sensitive or dangerous job to be done--make a few slaves, give them the memories and training they need to do the job, and dump them in the recycle when the job is done. But what if they want more out of life... or just a few more years of it? This film is not exactly family viewing, and it's too nasty to keep in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"a very dark film","review":"I've seen all the versions of this film and, for some reason, really want to like it. Unfortunately, most of the movie takes place in dark rooms, intended to symbolize, perhaps, a dark future but serves only to underscore the unreality of the film. Any real person going into any of the rooms in this film would open the drapes or turn on a light. It is like the technical director is about 14 years old.And it is slow, possibly so that we don't miss the product placement.I know this is supposed to be noirish, but noir films always clip right along. This drones along with a David Lynch obscurity (again, think 14 year old). I think if I were stoned as I watched it I might think it was deep. But, unfortunately, I wasn't, so I just wish they'd turn the lights on."},{"rating":"1","title":"blade Runner Fainal Cut","review":"My mother wanted to give me something special for Christmas this year so I suggested this DVD as this is my favorite movie.

I bought The Final Cut on DVD but when I saw this on sale on Amazon, I had to get it. I first saw this movie with my father when I was 8 years old and was mesmerized by the visuals and story. Ridley Scott is a genius and visionary. I couldn't tell you how thrilled I was when I finally saw it on hi-definition. My jaw just dropped with every detail and sound. The blu-ray set had all versions of the movie. I liked the voice-over version because it gave some insight from Deckard's perspective. Overall, I was pleased with the movie and would recommend it to all aficionados."},{"rating":"1","title":"This set STILL contains the wrong blu-ray disc","review":"I purchased this Blu-Ray set on 10 December 2009 and this set still contains the wrong disc. Instead of the correct disc 1: \\"the final cut\\" it contains a duplicate copy of disc 5: \\"the workprint\\" instead. Keep in mind this disc 1 is still labeled \\"the final cut\\" despite its contents. I would have assumed that after all this time Warner Brothers would have fixed it, but they haven't. Amazon needs to get with it as well and at the very least include a note and the number to call with every shipment of this set.Fortunately, the \\"most helpful\\" one-star review here at Amazon contained the 800 number for the Warner Brothers hotline to replace the disc (1-800-553-6937), and after 2 minutes and 31 seconds on the phone, Warner Brothers is going to ship me a replacement (correct) \\"final cut\\" in about 2 weeks. Hopefully they'll get the type of disc right as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workprint Version, not Final Cut","review":"Agree with another reviewer on this. The so-called Final Cut version on disc 1 is only the Workprint version. Key point is that although the packaging says that the Final Cut has TrueHD and also French 5.1DD, these do not even show up in the menu as options on the Final Cut disc. Have compared the 2 discs and they are identical, even down to the running time.

Can't get enough of those... It would be nice if, say, the original voiceover on the non-director's cut was available on a seperate audio channel, or if the non-director's cut was on the other side of the DVD. The movie is, of course, a masterpiece that looks beautiful in the DVD format. If that's all you want, the DVD is perfect. However, if you're a Blade Runner fan or simply love the extras on DVDs, you'll feel like I do; that there is so much more that could have been added to this DVD: like deleted scenes or a \\"making of\\" feature or even a couple of original movie trailers... but no, just some \\"interactive menus\\"... disappointing..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointing Transfer","review":"This DVD is a terrible video transfer. I hope some time in the future this great movie gets the attention it really deserves - A DVD set with BOTH versions of the movie, some good extras, directors commentary, and a decent transfer. This is a very poor presentation for an extraordinary movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible but the Original is Better!","review":"The only movie I was required to see during my Greek Mythology class at Harvard. The professor thought so highly of this film that a whole class was tested on how Roy Batty was the classic Greek tragic hero. A wonderful story of what it means to be alive. I love this movie more than I can say, it is a masterpiece, the only movie I have ever owned in every format."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner the way it was meant to be seen.","review":"I recently bought a DVD player and this was one of the first DVDs on my wish list. I really like the director's cut of this film and the DVD version is much better than the VHS DirCut. This is a really great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for its Time...","review":"Correction to davisi211@aol.com, Ridley Scott directed the movie. Phillip K. Dick wrote the book \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\". The movie was done along the lines of the book, dark and moody. For its release, 1982, it was a great movie even with the narration. The directors cut, of course put it over. A True Classic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't be fooled, original is best","review":"Ridley is a great director, but Bud Yorkin (who produced the film and defends the now-missing voice-over) was integral to the greatness of this film, which depends HUGELY on the voice-over. Don't be fooled! This film is better, much better, in the original version. The scenes which are supposed to leave one wondering whether Deckard is also a replicant are lame and stupid - they add zero to the narrative and are precisely as Yorkin loabeled them: a cheat. Not only a cheat, but one which adds nothing to the story.On the other hand, the best line of the ENTIRE film is in the voice-over, where Deckard sums up why (for heaven's sake why?) would the murderous killer spare Deckard in the end? It is stupid and untethered without it. Those who forgive this vital piece's absence are surely remembering the original, and so know the answer. For the love of heaven bring back the original in Blu-ray!) and shun this lousy second effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome set - lousy shipping","review":"We love this box set. Just very disappointed with the shipping. Paid extra to overnight the item, but it did not arrive. Had to go down to FedEx location 30 minutes drive away and wait in a line the Saturday before christmas to get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BladeRunner Final Cut Review","review":"Blade Runner - The Final Cut (Two-Disc Special Edition)I have watched the entire collection and enjoyed it thoroughly. The commentary is a bit dry and really only for those who like watching the History Channel (I do) but it gives the background to what the director was trying to convey and the struggle involved in making the movie. Blade Runner was a film ahead of its time and it spawned a generation of film makers that were inspired by its darker vision of the future. The movie was loosely based on the book \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\\" and was endorsed and enjoyed by the book's creator.One question that this version answers is the question, \\"Is Deckard an android as well?\\" To find the answer to that question you have to get this DVD and watch the commentaries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathing new life into a classic film","review":"The picture on the HD-DVD is just breathtaking. The audio is fantastic as well. This movie doesn't look like something that was filmed 25 years ago. If it wasn't for the fact that Harrison Ford looks so much younger, you would think that this was a newer movie.Obviously, it is a great film with dark sci-fi themes that was way ahead of its time. But seeing how mind-blowing the special effects look in HD just makes this a totally new film.I can't recommend this movie highly enough. In fact if you don't have one of the HD formats (I have both) you should upgrade simply to enjoy this film as it should be enjoyed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More then more of the same","review":"I will not write the synopsis of the movie \\"Blade Runner\\" as this 5 disk Blu Ray pack contains all 4 official versions of this cult Future Noir (film noir in SF setting). I will also not describe how impressive it is to see the 2007 version in 1080p High Definition and hear Vangelis in HD sound, all stored on Disk 1. It is interesting to know however that the other 3 versions are all on a single disk. Thus offering an additional 9 hours of extra's on the other 3 disks!A must have set, certainly given the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade Runner - A Classic","review":"The Collector's edition provides everything you might remotely want to know about this classic film.The Blu-ray video transfer is razor sharp and the surround sound is compelling.The only thing that could have added to the Collector's edition would be if the producers of the Collector's addition could have persuaded Harrison Ford to provide an audio commentary track."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it!","review":"Although I'm a Harrison Ford Fanatic, I simply hated this movie.

I don't understand how people love this movie. It's boring and stupid. Also the acting is terrible. Harrison Ford at his worst!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My least favorite film ever.","review":"I find this film unbearable. The acting is very sub-par. Harrison Ford isn't good . The dialogue is forced and trite. The character development is non-existent. At no point in the film did I care what was going on. I wanted a giant asteroid to obliterate everyone so the film would end. Also...why, oh WHY, is Rutger Hauer running around in his boxers and slamming his head through walls?! It doesn't make sense, nor is it even slightly entertaining.I have never been so angry after watching a film. It put me in a bad mood for the rest of the day. _Blade Runner_ is probably the least entertaining film ever made. I would rather have an anvil dropped on me than be subjected to this film again. Avoid this film (as well as another horrible \\"classic,\\" _Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb_) at all costs.(sidenote: the special effects are quite good)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Run a Blade through Ridley Scott for making this crap","review":"Harrison Ford becomes a screen legend off of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and then he does this futuristic toilet of a movie. The story didn't make any sense and it was just a bad movie, you shouldn't combine film noir with sc-fi, no Maltese Falcon with the Jetsons, or it just didn't work with this movie. Ridley Scott directs great films like Gladiator and Alien,then directs this wasteland of a flick that shouldn't be apart of the future with or without flying cars. any one who think this is better than Star Wars than get the hell off Amazon. Hollywood Homocide might treat you to better Harrison Ford films. If you want good futuristic movies rent Minority Report or I, Robot. Make a better future by getting rid of \\"BAD RUNNER\\" Harrison, don't think less of you because this crap you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Sci-Fi (?) Film","review":"A foreboding tale about the future or are many elements present in over-crowded cities and environmentally challenged planet today? A classic Harrison Ford shows the figurative and literal dark side of survival and how we value our humanity; striking a balance between what's demanded of us to endure in society, the price of human greed, and how much we value the interactions that define us."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING QUALITY !","review":"The video and audio on this DVD are truly amazing. Easily the best restoration since the BOND films.The documentary is as good as that of Ridley's other films (GLADIATOR, ALIEN, BLACK HAWK DOWN), in other words, the best of any DVD out there.I'm not really a BLADE RUNNER freak like so many people but with editions like this (at more than reasonable prices), who can say no ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bladerunner geek's dream","review":"Alternate versions of the movie, hours of documentary and commentaries, deleted scenes...what more can I ask for.

Parts of the most beautiful poetic statements were left out and replaced with mood more mood and more mood. The marketing people have created a product where there should not have been one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I guess I just don't get it. I've seen lots of cheesy 80's sci-fi movies but I never thought to classify them as masterpieces. Aside from the out-dated effects and crappy acting, it didn't even make sense. I have a hard time sympathizing with a ROBOT. Great, it has feelings. By that standard Short Circuit is a filmmaking masterpiece too. IRobot made a statement about society, but I don't see that here. You want to see a filmmaking masterpiece from the 80's? Go watch Conan the Barbarian. If you can't see how well that film was made then don't tell me I'm close minded because I can't see the greatness of this cheese-fest. People need to grow up. It's a cheesy 80's flick. Just cause you like it, doesn't mean it's the greatest movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's based on a Philip K. Dick's story, but it's too old to be great","review":"I was excited to see this movie. A fan of Minority Report, the Adjustment Bureau, and Total Recall, I was sure this film (which was also famous for its time) would have been mind bending and take me to new imaginative places. Instead, it was very boring. Admittedly, the film was made in 1982 and my loss of interest may simply be that the effects and imagined future is 30 years old; still, I expected to find the same quality of suspense and newness in this film as in others based on Dick's writings. After the first 30 minutes, it was hard to keep interested. I hope newer dramatizations of Dick's stories will be more entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"I AM SO DISSAPOINTED","review":"I had such high hopes for this release. I had never seen Bladerunner and when the HD release came out I knew it was time to experience one of the so called \\"best movies of all time\\". I dont know what is going on with most of these reviewers... This movie is simply not good. It's dark, confusing every step of the way and nothing is resolved at the end. A purchase i wish i could take back. Obviously I am in the minority here, but IMO... Pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks!","review":"I read that this was the greatest sci-fi movie ever made. I love sci-fi but this movie sucked! People say it has \\"intensely packed action\\". It almost put me to sleep. The themes could have made a good movie but this is a disjointed mess. It takes place where the sun doesn't shine, literally, and it rains all the time. Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer do OK with the script they're given. The writing and directing are the problem. It's VERY SLOW! Wanna buy my copy? Total Recall and iRobot draw the good points from this movie. Get those instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"The director's cut doesn't even compare to the theatrical version; it lacks everything that made this move great! Wait for the original version to be released and save your money. If I could give you my Directors cut, I would. It's going in the trash when the theatrical version is released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cut too much","review":"I have seen the original a couple of times and thought the final cut would improve on the original....wrong.To me the most important scene was when Harrison Fords tries to come to terms with the last moment and death of the replicant Roy. Also , cutting the last scene with Rachel in a \\"greener\\" world was a disappointment . It was at least a 4 star in the original. Will not watch this \\"Final Cut\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridley Scott's Changes Ruined a Great Movie","review":"This has always been one of my favorite old sci-fi movies. But in the \\"Final Cut\\" version Ridley Scott removed almost all of Harrison Ford's narration. This totally killed the retro film-noir vibe that the original movie had, which was one of my favorite things about it. As someone who's seen this movie many times, I can say that that the most memorable lines in the film for me, were in the narration.So if you're a fan of the original Blade Runner, I wouldn't recommend renting this version; you'll be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Always loved this movie, but when my VHS broke I replaced it with this wonderful 4-disk DVD set with tons of versions AND extras!!! Soooo worth buying!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lucky me....","review":"Obviously, the movie's great. Classic, and with five discs of material at this price, how can you go wrong? However, my problem's not with the quality of the movie, the blue ray encoding, etc., but instead the delivered product. After waiting a week due to backorder, I found a beat-up, dirty, puffy envelope in my mailbox. Upon opening, I pulled out the movie I'd been eagerly anticipating. Blue plastic chips spilled everywhere, the case shattered at every corner. Packed in a puny bubble wrap envelope. Amazon, you can do better than this. What happened to all the comfortable, safe, brown boxes you used to send even the smallest products in???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bluray vid/audio is perfect, movie is meh","review":"The detail in the shots is incredible. I would have trouble telling how old this movie is.I bought this bluray without having watched it before, though, and I only feel \\"meh\\". I think it assumes too much prior knowledge about the world. If I had known that this was after a nuclear war and that most people had already fled Earth, it would make a bit more sense why this world sucks (I had trouble suspending disbelief with the fact that LA will be in constant rain in 8 years...). The final 30 minutes of this movie are too slow. We see Harrison Ford dangling from a rooftop for what feels like an eternity.I usually prefer lighter-fare movies and leave the serious stuff to TV shows, which have time to develop everything (ie, The Wire)."},{"rating":"1","title":"disturbing, boring, and depressing","review":"I'm a Harrison Ford fan, and was dissapointed in and depressed by this film. The plot, doalog, and action were glacial. The ceaseless rain, 2019 LA smog, gloom, hyper-stimulation, and overcrowding were depressing; and I didnt care much whether Ford found the \\"Replicants\\" or not. The Hollywood formula guaranteed he would, with suitable travail. The film's special visual effects were well done for the time, and added to my depression. I wondered if the directors / produceers meant this to be a visual morality play about our current overpopulation / media overstimulation / and ecological shifts in California. If so, it didnt make much impression on our society.I wound up skipping ahead on the downloaded CD to see what happened. I will not watch this film again or buy the CD.

I bought it based on you people's reviews.

You'll notice this in the opening credits, which are fuzzy and occasionally bump up and down. Is this a film that needs to be restored? If so, somebody please do it. 3. Extra features - where were they? For all its faults, \\"Blade Runner\\" is a work of art, and deserves DVD extras at least as impressive as those of \\"Fight Club\\", perhaps even the full \\"Brazil\\" treatment.

I came away feeling pretty much the same, but what is worse than not liking the movie is the DVD is such poor quality.

I would give this DVD a zero star if I could. The soul of the movie is gone. I'm a believer that androids with this level of ability have as much right to live as humans. The fact that we think they are our slaves and property with no rights is outragous. Equal rights for machines are coming in the near future and a man-machine war for equal rights is ahead (see Terminator I/II).
