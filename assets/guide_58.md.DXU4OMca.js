They have many adventures and misadventures as they try to elude the Wehrmacht and reach their friendly lines which have collapsed and are in retreat toward the sea.

It had these horribly done animations, and the narration skips between Redford and another guy, it's very weird.And, while I expected with Redford narrating it would probably be 'environmentally preachy,' I must say it really was over the top (and I'm a Sierra Club member!) -- still, I guess can't complain about that.

I watched half the disc and couldn't make it through... put it on eBay and got it out of here.

They also do some really cool shots of people rafting down the rive. Especially some first person pov on a raft which get hits with water. Really impressive in 3D. They also do some nice overlays of older photos of the canyon which they slowly reveal the current day reality of the same location. Kind of like a slow dissolve of the older photo. The director also provide some great shots from a helicopter which are amazing. Truly a great disc. My only grip, and it is small, the graphics in the opening sequence is a bit cheesy. Also when they do a PIP with people in interviews the digital frame they put around people is distracting. Otherwise definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good nature film","review":"Grand Canyon is a decent 3D nature film that explores the Canyon in 3D with good coverage.

Most of the picture is set back too deeply that it strains the eyes to watch. Some scenes, primarily in the beginning, have bubbles that move about the screen, but as they get closer they separate into a split image that hurts the eyes allot to watch. We cannot even watch the intro because of this. The movie is great except for the depth level being too much. If you have a television that will allow you to adjust the depth level you might be alright, but the DVD options do not offer this ability to adjust. Good movie, bad 3D. Very unexpected from IMAX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hippie tree-hugger sermon...","review":"With everything that went into producing this, i expected this to be great, but it was one long \\"give us all your $$$\\" sermon.

You know something is truly magical and amazing when it not only has all the adults in the room on the edge of their seats with mouths half agape, but a bunch of 7- and 8-year-olds in exactly the same position. Not only that, but the film's powerful message, perfectly chosen and choreographed soundtrack, and absolutely breathtaking cinematography were not lost on anyone - the kids wanted to go to the Grand Canyon and save the river afterwards. My son still talks about it nearly a year and a half later. If I could give this film more than five stars, I would. Neither you (nor your children)will be disappointed in this amazing show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"This has several fabulous panoramic scenes filmed with IMAX cameras. But much of the rest is a mix of political statement in search of a story line or perhaps a story line in search of a political statement. What might have been???

This video didn't come close to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I saw this in the Imax theater when it was first released.... a lot of people walked out in the first fifteen minutes.... It was loud, and mainly pop music which seem to get louder during the action scenes.

This film in IMAX 3D is absolutely gorgeous! The scenes have great depth to them and do an excellent job of drawing the viewer in and providing an immersive experience, which is what any good film is supposed to do...particularly a 3D film.

A few good genuine 3d scenes, like point of view on the rapids, but I'm repulsed by the obvious artificial 3d shots, once I notice them I can't un-notice them! And many scenes are 2d. It's also a limited film about water conservation, hopefully we will get a true 3d treatment for the Grand Canyon some day. I watched this once, where as I watch Imax Under the Sea 3d once a week. I also recommend 'The Ultimate Wave Tahiti 3d' instead, it's 100 times better and cheap also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average 3D but narrative is typical brainwashed Liberal PC","review":"This movie has some lovely panoramic scenes in 3D. It is not in the least bit entertaining and is best watched with the audio turned off. It should have been narrated by Al Bore.

If we're not destroying all rivers, it's the rocks, if it's not that it's the ozone, if it's not that it's...... endless whining.There's more footage of the people whining about the river than there is of the canyon. Even then the speech is hard to distinguish over the background sound while the 3D effect is good in places it is mostly quite ordinary.If you want to feel like YOU are wholly and personally responsible for the entire planet buy this title, if you want to see the Grand Canyon, give it a wide bearth.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring propaganda","review":"We saw this at our local Science Center Imax Theatre. We have seen many wonderful 3-D movies there. This was average 3-D footage and the content was boring and nothing but environmental preaching. I was upset that we had gone there for a fun outing and I walked out feeling like I was \\"taken\\". Since I don't live in the area that was filmed, I have no idea whether there is any substance to the producers' claims, but I don't like walking in to something like this without knowing it. We haven't been to another Imax film there since this experience. It was draqgy (like so many Redford films). There are so many other wonderful 3D or Blue Ray movies out there (with wonderful scenes of nature), I would certainly not recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless beauty","review":"I fell in love with Tania Maria when I first purchased this album in the early 1980s and played it non-stop until someone stole it!

At a push, I'd say Nega is the one I put on repeat the most. I feel a dear old friend has returned, now I have replaced my old vinyl with this CD - even though I had to purchase it abroad as it's not available on AmazonUK. I don't have a sophisticated music system to comment on whether the sound on CD is better than vinyl, I'm just happy to hear the tunes of Come With Me echo through my home again!

Good variety of the many sounds of rock and roll, and Edgar takes the challenge of putting his voice in a match with a guitar. Must listen, this stuff really ROCKS! Also, keep playin' that rock n roll (Edgar Winter's White Trash) tells the story of how Edgar got his big chance while Johnny was already famous, and it shows his passion for Rock n Roll.

I also prefer storylines not solely based on adultery. I know that probably doesn't mean a lot to some people out there, but Tristan's relationship with both Iseults was in some way adulterous and I have a lot of trouble admiring a hero who sees marriage as political only. Or maybe has so little control over his emotions that he stays in love with a woman he can't have. Definitely not my favorite Sutcliff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"It is not too often that you would run across two women called Iseult.That, however, is what Tristan does.

This one is actually my favourite Dostoevski book. It has absolutely everything - compulsive plot, great characters, moral lessons and as clear a depiction of the differences between good and evil as I've ever read. The book covers the life of a father and his three sons. This Karamazov family could stand up against any evil modern day villains any day. They are greedy and depraved and we the readers get to see into their innermost souls and determine what drives them. Dostoevski's books are psychological stories as much as anything else though, so we also get to see into the innermost recesses of each of their souls. And don't look for any nice summing up of the plot in a Dostoevsky book - they always leave the reader with more questions than answers. Awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest novel of all time?","review":"I think so, is there an author alive who can match wits with the Former and Indisputable One, I doubt it.

You must read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Delirium","review":"Of course, this is THE novel.There are many important chapters, like \\"The Grand Inquisitor\\", but nobody ever mentions \\"Delirium\\".

Like any good novel, the theme's of the present are masterfully woven and presented. I especially enjoyed the heaviness of the book's theological and philosophical quandaries. The characters are believable and evoke pathos, the realistic dialog can often be hilarious, and there is this almost Nietzschean delight in the rational dismantling of religious sentiments. Don't get me wrong, Dostoevsky ultimately intended to give religion (particularly Eastern Christianity) a powerful and existential justification, but he does this alongside an ingenious and heartfelt ridicule of the very faith he supports in the end. I find this kind of heavy clashing of dissonant world views both difficult and cathartic to read.

Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor's critique of humanity is one of the most insightful and powerful critiques ever written. Eric Fromm revisits these and similar ideas in his Escape from Freedom. This novel is full of insights and shows Dostoevsky not only to be a great novel but also great thinker. Readers of this novel will encounter a multitude of ideas. This novel covers the philosophy of religion, psychology, faith, freedom, nihilism, existentialism, and many, many other topics. This is a novel that I expect to return to many times in the future.

The Brothers Karamazov is often times claimed to be the best book ever written. Though I wouldn't say that, I would definitely say that it is in the top 10.The value of the book is not so much in the syntax or literary style with which it is written, but in the meaning of the stories told. It is full of Eastern Orthodox Theology (Dostoevsky, despite all of his short comings, was a fanatical EO). The continual themes focused upon most heavily in this work are forgiveness, mercy, compassion despite revenge, and the reality of God, the Incarnation, and life after death.I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels lost in a see of secularism and sadness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best fiction I have ever read.","review":"My friend told me that this novel was Einstein's favorite, so I picked it up to see what it was all about. It is a very soul-searching book. The characters are very complex (to the point that they are simple) and real.

Nice and quiet, too. It is also very conservative on ink consumption and the 6 individual ink tanks make it very nice for printing a bunch of prints with a high percentage of one color (close-up of a bright yellow tulip).

Novel excerpts are often tricky to present out of context, and often fall flat, but these selections, especially from The Grapes of Wrath, Tortilla Flat, and East of Eden are powerful pieces of literature, booming with the resonance of Steinbeck's voice. A book such as this is ideal for the traveler, casual reader, or initiate to John Steinbeck, and will most likely be the stepping stone for some to his complete works. A special bonus to this book is Steinbeck's Nobel Prize Acceptance Speech, discussing the responsibilities of a writer--one more testimony to his depth and brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware -- none of the works included are complete","review":"The product description says \\"A collection of Steinbeck's work.\\" It fails to say \\"excerpts from Steinbeck novels.\\" In other words it does any of his complete novels -- just parts selected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never have so many trees died for so little reason","review":"I owe Mr Clarke a debt of gratitude.

The biggest problem with this book is its utter lack of focus. The book is about a distinct, highly technical subject and yet the author subjects the reader to constant barrages of pointless quotations, humorless jokes, entire pages of brainteasers and puzzles that are only marginally applicable to anything in the text, yet all of which manage to break up and confuse the text. You could shave a solid hundred pages off the book and still have a book that better prepares you for your CNE exams than this one does in its current form. All of this, and the included software bites!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It *could've* been a good book...but it's not.","review":"There are two types of CNE students in this world: Those that love this book and those that loathe it. I was severely disappointed to find that, although the cover of the book tells you that the official Novell courses are inside, they're not in any specific order! I don't know about the rest of you, but I take one test at a time...and that's how I'd like to study for them. There's an index at the back that tells you which pages to read to follow Novell's cirriculum for a specific course, but it's 10 pages here, 5 pages there, 2 or 3 pages here, 30 pages there...on and on and the the material may span 1000 pages or more. I don't understand the thinking when putting this book together. I bought it at another store and returned it. My time is too valuable than to subject myself to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Technical Manual I Have Seen To Date","review":"Just finished a LAN Class, where I had to buy books on NT, Cisco, MS-DOS and Novell. Got through all the other books with no problem. Then my instructor saved the best (worst) for last. I get nauseated trying to learn anything from the text in this book. I can stand to read about two pages in a row at any given time and then I have to close it and take a break. Today is my last day of class and I haven't finished this book yet and don't believe I will. The only good thing about it is that it is very thick and dense and will make a nice backstop when I go to the pistol range and shoot it full of holes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book if you know how to use it!","review":"Mr. Clarke definitely knows his stuff when it comes to intranetware, but the book is about 600 pages of fluff. If you are looking to study the key points, use appendix B. It summarizes all the key points to the Novell Course Objectives and tells you what pages within the book to read. I strictly read these pages and bypassed all the 'fluff'. Using this method you should have no problem knocking out one exam a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but needs serious editing","review":"I'm currently using this book in a 7 month CNE course and have read almost every page--twice. Clarke's style is engaging and encouraging for the novice but he's not for everyone. He succeeds in making a highly technical subject lively reading. Alas, CNE initiates must also internalize this material for Novell's exam and their careers' sake. That's where the tradeoff comes in: lively reading for organization. Outlining Clarke has been the only way for me to organize and learn this material for the exam. Organization is sacrificed for cleverness however and the book really needs a seasoned editor to help organize it. There's also the usual bushel-basket of typos and grammatical mistakes found in computer books. But otherwise a fine way to study for the exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"Mr. Clarke really knows what he is doing. He does not bore people with technical talk, but keeps them interested with jokes and other such motivaters.I got my CNE with this book and his other Core Tech book.

This comforter is very warm. It retains body heat for a while. If I get out of bed in the morning, get the kids off to school, eat breakfast, and climb back into bed... it's still warm!

For reasons no one at Samsung can identify, my laptop no longer recognizes my MP3 player. I spent an hour on tech support with Samsung, and the end result was the tech throwing his hands up in exasperation, mailing me a new driver disk, and telling me to try that. I received the disk and tried to reinstall the drivers, but the computer still does not recognize the device. I tried installing the player on two other machines and had the same problem.A follow-up call to Samsung resulted with the basic response that I should just buy a new player.If you like truly awful support, I highly recommend Samsung's products. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy","review":"I used this player for approximately 30 hours. To get those 30 hours of music, it required at least 12-16 hours of maintenance, research on the web and re-adding files to the player.Though, never mentioned in any documentation I found, the player's software is extrememly sensitive to the order in which you disconnect the player from your USB port and close the desktop software. This problem eventually locked the player into a mode I can not break it out of. When powered on, the red light never goes off and the player responds to nothing.I've purchased a new Rio player and love it. I didn't have the patience to make any more of a time investment into a player with minimal funtionality and a limited storage capacity.

Each time there's been a problem, Samsung has been reasonable about exchanging the unit for a new one, that is until the warranty ran out last month! Now I'm on my own! The battery latch is not designed well at all, and mine broke after a 1 foot fall. Also, the headphone jack isn't well soddered so the stereo sound keeps kicking in and out. And don't think you can get your YEPP player fixed if something does go wrong after your warranty expires, their \\"service\\" department simply replaces defective units under warranty and recommends that you buy another one if anything goes wrong afterwards!

When one of these so-called \\"engineers\\" told me \\"well, we get at least 8 phone calls a day with this problem\\" I knew I was dealing with a product that was NOT finalized when it was thrown out onto the market.

The story is contrived and implausible, and the acting is so overwrought you wonder if the director was on the set.

(He can thank Olivier for his one passable effort.) The lead is a ranting crybaby of the sort now familiar. He knows how the affairs of the world should be run, but can't be bothered to treat people with civility and maintain his own life with responsibility and dignity. He is, in short, the model enfant terrible of the post-WWII Left, whose battle cry was aptly put by Jim Morrison (himself in the same mold), \\"We want the world and we want it now.\\"There should have been a sequal in which the lead becomes prime minister of such-and-such country and turns it into a squalid, barbaric socialist paradise.

(The kids actually put their comments in much more direct English)The book uses metaphorical language as well as direct insturction to help children who have specific fears (phobias.) In the story, a more experienced child, Knowsis, helps another child, Terry deal with her fears of the circus. Knowsis teaches Terry to access feelings of confidence and contentment.

The story hinges on the abilities of Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power to tell two different stories with equal conviction. Their performances and the story are anchored by the fussy, but brilliant barrister played by Charles Laughton. Wilder does an excellent job weaving the story without telegraphing the plot twists that accompany an Agatha Christie mystery. The only fault I find with the film is the pacing. The movie takes a little long to get started, how the defendant met his wife is not really important to the story. Then the ending concludes incredibly quickly. Followed a year later by \\"Anatomy of a Murder\\" these two classics can hold their own against any recent court room drama without needing any special forgiveness from the audience for their age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witness for the Prosecution","review":"Can't beat a Charles Laughton performance directed by Billy Wilder, not to mention Marlene Dietrich and Tyrone Power and Elsa Lenchester.

VERY happy that the set came with both the valance and the diaper stacker - great that we didn't have to purchase those as well. My only drawback is that I wish that it came with two fitted sheets instead of one so we would have a matching back-up (although you can purchase another sheet for around $10.00.)

By the time you get to the end, you feel like you knew it all along, except that I didn't. I kept changing my mind about who the murderer was. There are some funny characters, a little romance and a good amount of threat. The primary setting for this mystery is an Episcopal church. It helps if you are an Anglican, or at least a Catholic or Lutheran. But there is always the dictionary for words like vestry, rector, eucharist and so forth. I would like to know Page Hawthorne, the main character. The police detectives, Roy Merton and Leona Vesba are a total kick. I hope we see them in more mysteries from Compton."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gritty and wise mystery","review":"If you like mysteries with interesting characters, action and plenty of food for thought, this is the book for you! The plot revolves around a divorced mother of two, who is on the large staff of an Episcopal Church (The Holy Comforter), which happens to be the church of choice for many of the richest and most prominent citizens of a large (midwestern?)city. The facade of Christian righteousness and social distinction is shattered when one of the priests turns up brutally murdered. What appears to be a standard mystery is lifted high above the average by Compton's grasp of the social politics of religion and the pitfalls of privilege. Don't think the book is only for Episcopalians or avowed Christians -- anyone can learn from the author's incisive observations on human nature.

Which i did and after staying on hold for a hour they hung up on me!!Get an epson. comparable prices for better quality...that is what i did and am glad i did it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It prints... but it could be better","review":"The main drawback of this printer is Canon's design for getting ink to the print head. Because the ink has to seep through a sponge to get to the print head, the amount of ink flow is limited. For instance, if you were to print something that had, say, heavy black in one area, it would print okay for the first few lines, but much more than that and it'll start leaving blank streaks across your paper where there wasn't enough ink to feed the print head... effectively ruining your print. Also, it seems that the print heads get dirty quickly, as I have to run the print head cleaning program about once every two weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"BJC 3000 printer is a tremendous value","review":"I think some of the reviews for this printer are misleading. For the money, this is a terrific printer. It is very versatile and prints at a nice speed with exceptional resolution for a 1440 dpi inkjet printer. Higher resolution for most people is not needed because their eyes are not that good. This printer does a very acceptible job on photos and can not be beat for nice clear crisp text. You can spend three or four time the money on other printers and not get what you get with a BJC 3000. Canon consistently produces fine products. Worth every dollar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little printer!","review":"I've used HP Deskjet printers for years and just recently decided to upgrade. My son needs a color printer so he got the HP-693c and I bought a Canon BJC-3000. My biggest complaint about the HP's was the single color cartridge - run out of one color and you have to throw the entire cartridge away. Not so with the BJC-3000.I've had good results with the graphics and printed some photo-quality images using Kodak InkJet photo paper. You have to do some adjustments of the settings to get things right, but the results are very good once that is done.The major complaint I have is the noise coming out of this thing! It isn't bad while printing, but during initialization and after printer a few sheets, it goes into a mode where it sounds like it is coming apart. All ink jet printers do this, but this one is especially noisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"MICHELLE DEVLIN WEAVES A STORY LIKE NO ONE ELSE!","review":"I was caught up by the main character, Ali, from page one.This book portrays a woman desperately trying to save herself from demons she has fought for many years.

Ali maintains a sense of humor throughout her ordeals, and the reader can't help but be on her cheering team. WAY TO GO, Ms. Devlin! This is a book sure to help other people seek the treatment they need in order to deal with their own experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mysterious origins of Danish Punk Rock revealed at last","review":"Tim Bradford takes us on a mystical journey through the now-disappeared \\"underground rivers\\" of London, all of which have been filled in or paved over in the last few centuries. Well, I guess the journey is mostly just drunken, not really mystical at all. There are a lot of sharp insights about London and about how landscapes change, and a few simply amusing tales of the weirdos Bradford encounters as he walks London's winding streets. And there are lots of great random digressions.This book is a bit more enjoyable if you know London well and can envision the bits Bradford describes. Having a good map of London also enhances the fun, but is not necessary. I suppose this falls into the category of \\"travelogue\\" but is far more clever (in a McSweeneys kind of way) and far less pretentious than many (e.g,. Theroux)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but certainly not for those looking for in depth info","review":"I was disappointed in this book. From the cover, it looked like a warm, sensual look at the art of women loving women. Unfortunately, the text is full of rather unattractive illustrations and descriptions that are both over-simplified and out-dated. I admit this book may be helpful for someone who is clueless...but for those of us that have performed some of the things in the book, it seemed sadly lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesbianism For Dummies?","review":"This book is fairly useless, unless you have no idea what a lesbian is and you don't have the internet.

Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Updated, but not very good","review":"It's good the author updated her book, which was pretty old ...( It came out before I was even legal!), but I don't think it's very good.

Tells you about everything, but not how to do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring,boring,boring","review":"This book read more like a colege textbook than a story of love andsexy relationships. It was written as if told to you by your mother orsister and not by a lover. In stead of being written in chapters ofconcise information about lesbian love it was written a through z asan encyclopedia. It was truly boring and contained little that a manwho was interested in this subject would want to spend his moneyon. .... The text was infomative but it had all been toldbefore. The text was on a ninth grade level and did not even do a goodjob of informing you about it's subjects. This book was a totaldisappointment in every sense. I found absolutely nothing new here.... The author should read Woman; now there is a book writtenwith style and humor that tells you everything you ever wanted to knowabout women, their bodies and how they work and tick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone interested in the topic","review":"I had resisted buying this book for some time because I felt that I was well acquainted with the subject matter already.

I have recommended this book to my Lesbian friends and they have found it as useful and informative as I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Simplistic","review":"This book was very disappointing. I found it to be very simplistic and dull. It only covers the basics. This would be a good guide for someone that has absolutly no idea what lesbianism is or how two women could be intimate. I feel as if the obvious was overstated and that readers would be better off looking else where if they are wanting a book with a little bit of flavor and variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate look at Deaf culture","review":"I am a Sign Language interpreter and my boyfriend of two years is Deaf. I read this book for a Deaf culture class and was fascinated by it. Written from a very Deaf perspective, this book is full of things that hearing people never think of but which I see nearly every day in both my personal and professional life.This book should be read by anyone who has a Deaf child. It's a real eye-opener. Parents of Deaf children seldom get the kind of help they need at an early enough stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very graphic murder/mystery","review":"I have both the book and audiobook and this is a very graphic murder/mystery story that takes place in Alaska. An FBI agent is sent to Ketchikan to investigate the murder of a G-man along with several other unsolved murders. His sidekick (who is played hilariously well by Josh Thompson in the audio version) predictably gets into trouble, which adds to the mess. Then further add a beautiful heiress to a fishing fleet. I found this story to be very fast-paced and a combination of the old Hawaii Five 0 with stoic \\"just the facts ma'am\\" from Dragnet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grow Old Along With Me","review":"This book caught my eye because of a phrase my mother often recited because her mother (my grandmother) had recited it to her on occasion.

I have found the poems to be particularly touching - a glimpse of what I have to look forward to!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very practical and helpful","review":"This book, while concentrating on landscape photography, can be used as an intro guide for all kinds of digital work. Easy to use format allows you to work through a project while introducing you to techniques you can then explore further on your own. I've recommended it to several people, including a couple of very experienced film photographers, and everyone has found it to be a good resource.Note that this book doesn't explain PhotoShop or other photo editing programs, though it incorporates them, but is organized by project or function that the photographer wants to accomplish. If you want a tutorial on photo-editing programs, this book will not meet this purpose. I do think the book is very accessible to beginners, and that it has something to offer to all digital photographers. I believe the clarity of the writing and the step by step format of the book make this possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never played the Video game","review":"I watched part of the Movie in a hotel and decide it was good enough to watch the whole movie so I bought it.

Tim Olyphant is very good as a stoic, very disciplined hitman. I think he tends to be a bit stiff in his delivery anyway (sorry Tim) and in this case it plays right into the character. Olga Kurylenko steals every scene she's in. Her costuming is outstanding and her acting makes a believeable Hooker and bad guy girlfriend. Well produced and directed, the action sequences are tight and exciting, the explosions semi-believeable. I did a rewind - slo-mo at least twice because of jaw-droppers. The movie felt a tad long. But not so long as to make me feel uncomfortable. So I think Hitman is a very good action flick with As or Bs in every category. Four out of five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the gamers","review":"If you loved the game you'll enjoy the movie, it got all the great stuff from the game in it and many scenes feel like home.

You have a hitman (the sexy #47) who has been trained from childhood to be the best at what he does. Trained to hold his breath, shoot anything that moves from any distance, armed with sexy weapons and a barcode (tattooed beautifully in his scalp), along with an air of calm (that would make anyone scared who he faces), he is the perfect killing machine and running for his life. Determined to protect Nika, a prostitute to the President of Russia, from who else (her lover), #47 goes about the task of fighting the bad guys and righting what he thinks are wrongs. With a Interpol Cop on his heels, he attempts to uncover the truth about why someone he thought he killed wants him dead and what the whole thing is about.

It was definitely worth renting on a Sunday afternoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"great action","review":"Olyphant is terrific as a hitman turned good guy who protects the mistress of a crime lord type. the action is phenomenal ranging from snipers to hand-to-hand combat. the movie is fast paced throughout with a great ending. great action movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, 4 stars for keeping it interesting.","review":"4 stars for 3 bucks. Well, main character kept me interested, I didn't play the game so had nothing but boredom to help me pick this one. I believe if they took the lead from the first and made a real effort then a sequel could be a blockbuster. Honestly, I enjoyed this better than MI3 as I am tired of watching cruise trying to play a bad ass.Movie had me guessing about the main character, could figure out a bit as it progressed, tells me the plot was solid enough to carry it. Love the supporting actress choice, she was the chocolate on his vanilla, the tang in the lemonade.Worth a rent without making you leave all logic in another room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitman movie not a bad flick.","review":"Hadn't heard about this movie when it originally came out. Bought a used version on Amazon. I was pleasantly surprised that it was a pretty good movie. Took me a while to recognize where I had seen the lead character before.

SO IF YOU PLAY THE GAME AND WATCHING THE MOVIE WITH SOMEONE WHO HASNT THEN THEY WILL ASK YOU A LOT OF THINGS.but if they do make another movie then they need to show more of who he is and make it realy close to the story line in the game but make it work for the movies.OVER ALLi would rent this movie even if you play the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good game, bad movie (unexpected!)","review":"The character Codename 47 was suprisingly deep in the game (at least surprising regarding video games today), with extra points for lack of emotion and being cloned (unlike the movie). The love interest was a stupid addition and detracted from potential uniqueness of the movie, reducing it to formula.I played every one of the games, good and bad, and I can say for certain that I'm not a fanboi but that this movie completely missed the boat. Even worse than the Max Payne movie, which is surprising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on the game? Absurd","review":"The object of the Hitman games is to overcome obstacles, discover secrets, and complete a mission without hurting anyone but the chosen target. If you complete the mission silently, the way it should be completed, you get the rating at the end of \\"Silent Assasin,\\" which is the most coveted rating. If you fire a gun your rating is degraded. You will be downgraded to something like amateur. If you kill a lot of people you will get the rating \\"Mass Murderer\\" or \\"serial killer\\" or some other unfavorable rating. If you get bad ratings, you do not get several rewards you can earn.This movie is nothing but a blood fest. The \\"Hitman\\" is indeed a mass murdererer. This movie not only fails the game, it is repulsive, bloody, and the plot is as thin as the Hitman's hairline.Pure Garbage.If you want a real action story with Historical Background, read:Black Triangle"},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie using scenes from a TV series in an desperate attempt to give it life.....and it failed","review":"The Hitman movie was a waste and a slap in the face to the video gamer series.Personally, I don't like movies that take cut scenes from another show to help build a story. The cut scenes came from the series DARK ANGEL in which kids from the future were genetically engineered fighting machines with barcodes on their back. Was this just based of laziness on the producer's part or what? Again, Video Game owners should be mad.Well, they played quite a few cut scenes of this in an attempt to give it substance.No story, very little plot.Not worth a rental."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was...meh","review":"This movie actually looked like a video game movie.

That being said, there was no way I could have known just how bad this movie was. This was \\"Plan 9 from Outer space\\" for action flicks. Timothy Olyphant's acting makes Keanu Reeves look like Anthony Hopkins and the writing is so bad that I couldn't decide which was worse, the embarrassingly terrible dialog or the cheesy and sophomoric 'action' scenes. It was as if a 14 year old boy wrote it for a remedial English class. And got an F. The only way I would watch this again is if I were stuck on a spaceship in deep space with two sarcastic robots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total primitive","review":"There are countless errors in the movie related to portraying the Russians. These errors are evident for everybody who knows Russian language and basics about Russian military. I'm not even talking about spoken Russian language in the movie, which could be OK for the English-speakers only. The uniforms, inscriptions, places, etc. are all wrong. Could one imagine an action movie with CIA agents where the letter \\"C\\" will be reversed like the Russian letter \\"S\\" on the backs of FSB agents? From mine point of view, the movie is a comedy rather than an action or a triller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Its a great movie loved it alot of action from the beginning it was awesome my bf saw it n he liked it alot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Movie!","review":"Olyphant is a bit underrated in his appeal as an action hero.

He is after the very people who are after him. He wants answers as to why they are after him in St. Petersberg, Russia. The only person he can trust is Nika (Olga Kurylenko), a woman with a dragon tattoo by her eye and runs down to her cheek.Ever get the idea Timothy Olyphant should do the old Clint eastwood \\"Dirty Harry\\" movies?I can see why Olga Kurylenko was chosen for her role inQuantum of Solace [Blu-ray] (2008).Option of Language: English, Spanish.

I really identified with Timothy Olyphant's character \\"47\\". His focused and unyielding pursuit of his target is heroic in technique and execution. 47's ability to acknowledge yet evade the seduction of female interest Nika Boronina, played by Olga Kurylenko, was a pleasant twist on the typical plot and aided in the development and understanding of the no compromise mind set of the character. His proactive and offensive use of automatic weapons is admirable while his political understanding of covert missions allows him to effectively interface with Interpol and Moscow CIA field agents to his advantage. If there ever was a Hollywood covert affairs field agent training model this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Action","review":"I didn't get a chance to see this movie in the theater, but I was very thrilled when it came out.

My low expectations were presumptive and extremely flawed.The action and the interactions between 47 and the woman were surprising in a GOOD way. I was glad to see that they kept the character of 47 stoic and job-oriented, even when being straddled by a gorgeous woman: not typical if you ask me!This film is definitely worth checking out: dvd rental at a minimum!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw a definite difference in video quality between this and DVD","review":"We're slowly moving along to Blu Ray, replacing DVD's when the price is right and during one lightning deal the price was right for Hitman.

It provided plenty of room for her to play, plus my husband and I got in with her for a while and there was room for a couple more people lol. Perfect depth for a smaller child, and is about waist high when sitting for your average hight adult. Do try to set it up on level ground, or one side can be significantly deeper than the other if the ground is unleveled.

The movie excells in it's realism and depicition of integral human traits of love, jelousy, vanity and evil.

It is the lighthearted story of flapper Alice Fontaine and wealthy playboy Nicholas Crawford. Alice wants to become an actress and she crashes Nicholas Bradford's party in order to meet producer Tyler Bradford. Eventually, through Nick's help, she does.Nick is taken with Alice, and their relationship, which starts out as fancy-free, soon becomes more than that. Though most of the story is fun to read, the last part of the book turns serious, as Alice and Nick realize that Tyler Bradford, an important figure in both their lives by now, is involved in serious crime. How will this crisis end?This book was fun to read. Standout scenes include Alice's promotional bubble bath outside Gimbels; and Nick and Alice's moolit rooftop picnic, complete with strawberries and champagne, (an intensely romantic scene).

(Even small Tess is a bit of a simp.) Robinson has created a story where every character is selfish, myopic, and unsympathetic. Yes, human.Yet through these flawed characters, Robinson paints a disturbing and very accurate picture of the ravages of divorce, remarriage, step children, blended families and in-laws. Through her adept prose we navigate amid the tangle of recrimination, fault finding, self justification, betrayal, malice, and irony: divorce in today's society.This is a sobering book. The ending is too pat, too unlikely; but it is the only false step in an otherwise absorbing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bad Seed Part 2","review":"The star of this terribly boring book is a young spoiled child named Amanda.

My surmise is that an upgrade in Service Pack disrupted the settings. A NIC card with self-diagnostics really helps too - it could have had more specific info on this area.

Joy Division and Nick Cave, among many others, were seminal groups around this time.For me, Room of Lights by Crime & the City Solution is a quintessential and intelligent example from that era.

After using this product for a month I can't understand how these reviews came about.Firstly, I am disappointed at the build quality of this product. The silver paintwork is already peeling off. I thought considering the cost of this product that it was made of metal. The silver panels along the side are silver painted plastic.Apart from the build quality, shaving takes a long time to complete as you need to pass the shaver head 10-20 times over your face. The worst part of the shave being around the neck.The \\"Powercomb\\" technology does absolutely nothing.The cost of this product does not equate to quality and I could have gotten the same shave experience with a much cheaper product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for the neck - ok for the face","review":"I've had this for 4 months and should have returned it after the trial period. It is just worthless at shaving neck hair. Even if I shaved twice a day, it doesn't even touch them. I have to pass over and over again to get any and then my skin is quite irritated. My only success with this razor on my neck is to use the beard trimmer which has it's own issues.It works just fine on the face but nothing special. I still have to take a few passes. It does seem well constructed and packaged well. I wish my original Norelco had as nice of a case. I was hoping the Braun would do a superior job on my neck but I'm sad to say, it is far worse. I'll have to keep looking for something that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Significantly better than 5000 series","review":"I am a long time Braun shaver user. I had recently bought a replacement blade and foil for my 2-year old 5000 series shaver. The foil tore and scratched me after only about a month of use, so I decided to upgrade to the 8000 series.I'm getting a much closer and smoother (less irritation) shave with the 8000. I can tell because my \\"5:00 shadow\\" is much reduced from before. The other advantages are:1) Much quieter than the 5000 series2) Shaver runs off the battery so you don't have to keep it plugged in like the 5000 series. My 5000 series shaver ran noticeably faster (and better) when plugged in even though it could run un-plugged. This was true from day 1, so had nothing to do with a worn out battery.3) Battery indicator so you know when to rechargeConclusion: You are getting much better performance if you upgrade to an 8000 series shaver and it is worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch - this thing bites","review":"Good shave but be careful - it cut me twice. It has two foil heads and flat part between them that is supposed to cut long hairs. I twice got cut by this. Braun was great about sending my $$ back. I'm back to norelco.

My latest razors have been Norelcos and then almost ten years ago I bought a Braun 5520 and currently I use them alternately. I prefer the 5520 slightly over the Norelco because the cutters last much longer. I bought a Braun 8975 recently so I could leave it at my vacation house. It Seemed to have the same cutters as the series 7 w/o the questionable cleaning system.After 2 months I'm disappointed in the short usage time of the battery......I get 5 shaves only before I have to recharge and I've discharged it completely twice already.Also, it does not cut any closer than my 5520 which incidentally gives me about two weeks of shaving before I must recharge it. I'm sorry I got the 8975. It seems very cheaply constructed and a real disappointment.

I also don't understand why some people say it does. I use an electric because you don't have to take the time to lather up, shave, and rinse. This razor is one of the best I've found overall. The shave is close after a few passes, depending on where you're shaving. It doesn't seem to do very well on the neck, but I've yet to see an electric that does. Sometimes going across rather than up and down allows it to do a better job. The 360 is a little louder than previous rotary shavers I've used, but it is not noticibly noisy. It keeps a good charge and charges fairly quickly. Overall, it's probably the best everyday shaver I've had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Review","review":"Greetings, I have used rotary razors for my entire shaving life. I'm 39, Caucasian with pretty heavy facial hair. I finally broke down and bought the Braun 8975 and have used it for a couple of months now every day. I am very unhappy with the razor for the following reasons: (1) the razor cannot shave my face closely; (2) the hair which is shaved turns to powder within the mechanism and slowly dumps out on me while I'm shaving; (3) the charge does not last more than 4-5 uses of maybe 5 minutes per use; (4) the razor is far noisier than a rotary; (5) the clipper configuration is very awkward and nearly useless.Just my two cents.

If I skip a day, it is about as effective as a shoe. It definitely cannot get to those hairs that lay close to the skin regardless of the technique I use.

I have used electric shavers for years. The sonic shaver was nice, but since i am in the military and deploy, the head gets all gunked up without the cleaning station...and no one will ship the alcohol containing cleaner to Afghanistan or Iraq. So, i had to switch.One thing that is great is the gillette blade technology. It really makes a difference. I first had the 360 complete that had the same gillette blades and loved that one...but, i also left it in a tent in Kuwait. So, my one priority for buying a new razor was having that same technology.The other great thing is the charge indicator. It gets really cold in Afghanistan and the last thing i want to do is walk through the snow twice to go back and retrieve a power cord.Overall a great shaver. I would definately reccomend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"8975 Braun Shaver","review":"Shipping and receipt of article excellent. This is my second braum the last one was 20 years old.

Nevertheless it speaks to the heart of the golfer who is wondering why, despite earnest intent and enormous effort, his golf game isn't improving perceptibly.Did Eisenberg break eighty?

I'd advise some digging around to be sure you're actually getting a box set from Victor Entertainment and not a bootleg if you are sensitive to such things.I've liked the music of Cowboy Bebop since I saw my first episode, and I saw this as a convenient way to get a fair portion of the soundtracks.

Awesome to play with your windows down in your car... kind of makes you in the feel good mood that the whole series brings to you.

Then, the story tied in and well shouldn't it be the other way around? I think the music is great for an anime series! (Kind of like how Please Teacher! did for me hehe)The reason I NEEDED to finalize my decision to buy this box set is the beginning song for the Cowboy Bebop movie \\"Ask DNA\\" and of course the series finale music... the ending for the whole series (the last song played) just made me cry...Get it! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome music","review":"Bought this set for my boyfriend for Christmas.

These magazine files were much more affordable, yet are well constructed and sturdy enough to hold around 20-25 pounds of magazines per file without busting at the seams. They fit comfortably on our bookcase in the office, so the materials are easily referenced whenever needed.

Tall glasses don't fit anywhere, same with deep cereal or salad bowls, unless you can get away with only putting 3 in there. The silverware basket came apart when I was carrying it to the drawer to put away, and clean flatware went all over the floor. My husband epoxyed the thing together so it wouldn't happen again.

Sure, the motorized movements of the camera when controlled via the desktop aren't that smooth, but it was actually smoother than I expected. It also makes minimal noise when it moves which is nice. The photo quality is pretty good and is on par with the Quickcam 4000 that I also have. Price is a little steep, but couldn't wait for Logitech to put out another mail-in rebate.

At $5 apeice, I had replaced around 12 of my incandescent globes over the course of a year, when they started failing. Over the course of two years, most of the 12 globe bulbs, and several of the other Feit electric CFL bulbs (I would estimate about 20 bulbs total!) have failed.

It's the most serious saga.3: It's the centerpiece of the protoculture plot.4: The Masters and their bioroids were the coolest bad guys.5: The humans have the coolest uniforms of the three generations, especially the helmets.6: I'm also partial to the tragic ending, where the good guys lose - badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't even know what to say","review":"First of all, buy this cd.

It can be very dry in a lot of places as well, not something that just captures you and wants you to continue reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hear the Cuckoo singing ...","review":"When I first read Hancock, immediately after the quite ludicrous Zacariah Sitchin, I thought he was onto someting interesting and original. At least, for the first two thirds of the book he doesn't insult the readers' intelligence the way Sitchin does, and he seems to have actually done some research. Unfortunately from there on it goes over the top with ridiculous claims, bad logic, wrong science and history, fractured arguments and a general descent in intellectual quality. This is a pity because Hancock can write quite well and if he had remained disciplined and plausible might have said something genuinely though-provoking. I guess he'll make a lot of money from the ignorant, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suckers","review":"About 6000 years ago there was explosion of knowledge across the globe. Erich VanDaniken claims it could have come from aliens in \\"chariots of the gods\\". Now, we have Graham Hancock who says this knowledge must have been 'given to the world by a lost civilation', of wich he knows nothing about and rarely writes about. Whom this \\"3rd party\\" civilization is, was, or how it happened isnt mentioned either. A real suckers book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more evidence","review":"I am shocked by the number of positive reviews of this book. People in this country must have extremly little background in science if they believe the thesis of this book. If anyone had done research on any of Hancock's claims, they would know that he makes entirely illogical and unscientific arguments. Future readers- don't waste your time with this pretend science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Story","review":"Not an academic work, to be sure, yet full of explanations. A combination of Paddington the Bear Abroad, Astrology and Who Shot JFK? In other words, it is a book whose central figure has lots of exciting travels, becomes obsessed with measurements, and eventually lapses into paranoiac disillusionment. Which just goes to show that talking bears from Lima, interested in the necessity of star movements, but in severe need of professional medical help, do not make good witnesses, but are nevertheless quite funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Review By Trotta","review":"This book is class! it changed me totally it tells you about our forgotten past and reveals plenty of secrets but some of the secrets are quite hard to come to terms with such as the worlds gonna end by 2012 AD,the worst thing is that he backs up every thing with concrete evidence. See You All in Hell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fingerprints Of The Gods","review":"This volume is fascinating. Graham Hancock points out interesting details showing similarities between several ancient civilizations. Uncanny! ET eat your heart out. It looks like we may have done it all ourselves but with the wobble of our planet we get periodic opportunities to start over and to leave a bit of evidence of our existance to those coming after us.

What impressed me the most was the use of mythology to re-create the story of pre history. Respecting our ancient forbears enough to believe their tales is an unusual position for modern man.This book led me to others like \\"Hamlet's Mill\\" ( long out of print but well worth tracking down). Also read Flem-Ath's \\"When the sky Fell\\" and Colin Wilson's \\"From Atlantis to the Sphinx\\" for more on this most fascinating and maybe timely subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"An educational outlook that entertains.","review":"Armchair Egyptologists - this one is for you. You could read a steamer trunk full of dusty chronicles and still not glean the knowledge available from this single offering. Graham Hancock's handling of precessive numbers, alone, is worth the price of admission. 'Fingerprints of the Gods' entertains as well as educates. One would be hard pressed to remain unchanged after reading this compelling book. Too bad it remains out-of-print in hardback!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abolutely Enthralling! 10 Plus ++","review":"Excellent! I'm not well versed in such things as our ancient past, but this book made me feel as if I had all the understanding in the world.

I had read the Sign and the Seal some years a back and Hancock has out done himself with this one. A classic! The first two chapters read like a Dan Brown novel, and had me appetized for more. It reminded me somewhat of Von Dankien's Chariots of the Gods, but it is a much more scientific and well researched work, taking data and theories from renowned sources, together with hands on field work.Also his wife Saantha must be credited for her stunning and relevant pictures.Hancock will figure prominently as a source and inspiration in my own upcoming essays and book on the existence of the antediluvian Giants.If you want to understand more about the prehistoric world...what happened BEFORE the Egyptians and the Olmecs/Mayas/Incas etc..read this book as a primer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prove it...","review":"This is a very interesting book...the theories are fascinating. However, they are, in my opinion, based on bad science. I find it hard to believe that this Antedeluvian civilation vanished without a trace...I understand that the \\"flash frozen\\" prehistoric animals that are so prominent in this book were, in fact, not \\"flash frozen\\". They were, as it turns out, contained in glaciers, etc. not unlike many other ancient species. My most serious criticism, however, is with the shifting crust theory. Having done my research, the shifting crust, or earth crustal displacement, sounds very much like apocalyptic theory that, as is usually the case, cannot be proved or disproved. I don't know...maybe the Aztecs had it right and we're living on borrowed time...personally, I'm not selling my mutual funds!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"What a great book.

Can\`t go wrong with this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting writing, very plausible evidence.","review":"I have read this book a few months ago and it had made me go and buy more of Mr. hancock's works.In this book, Mr. Hancock presents evidence of the existence of an ancient civilisation that was wiped out by a natural disaster. He suggests that the most likely event that could cause the end of the civilisation was a meteorite or comet impact, however he does state that there might have been other causes, such as a very violent global storm or earthquake. For more on that issue, I strongly recommend \\"The Coming Global Superstorm\\" by Art Bell and Whitley Strieber.In spite of the rather more scientific and dry issues discussed in the book, the work itself does not have the feel of a textbook, on the contrary, it is very exciting and engulfing - I found it hard to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inthralling epic, giving rise to thought and wonder!","review":"Finger Prints of the Gods by Graham Hancock is an excellent piece of work. Graham takes you on an interesting journey on a search for signs(finger prints) of advanced ancient civilization.

Since then I've explored Graham Hancock's all the other works about the same subject. I'm glad I discovered them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hancock lacks insight and knowledge.","review":"The topics covered in the book are nothing new - who built the Great Pyramid and how, pyramids and huge stone monuments in South America, Hapgood's theory of shifting of earth crust, etc. They have been covered before, and covered more effectively.What's most unfortunate about this rehash is that Mr. Hancock does not seem to possess enough technical or scientific knowledge to speculate and ask intelligent questions on any of the things he sees on his extensive (must have been expensive, too) trips. All he does is to repeat what's been speculated in the past, without offering any new perspective. When he muses about ancient myths, he doesn't offer any poetic inspiration either, the way Joseph Campbell did. It's plain that he is indeed interested in these topics, but if you look for his answers to these enigmas, there is none. The whole thing should have been a travelogue, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half way I got bored.","review":"This book is not for the average reader.

He is a intellectually dishonest charlatan of this age and will be proved thus in years to come as we learn more about the mysteries (of the topics discussed and) around the earth and the universe. Then we will have more like him as we move ahead!His Cataclysm obsession is epic.

Like many reviewers, I was impressed by the \\"evidence\\" quoted in the book and the detailed references. But sadly Hancock's research seems to break down when those references are critically investigated. Finally, I am puzzled by the comments about the quality of the writing. I found it plodding, burdened by whimsical speculation and pointless introspection. Many times I wondered what the manuscript looked like before the editors went to work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Thesis!","review":"Author Graham Hancock, through \\"Fingerprints Of The Gods\\" and his other genre specific books, asks the fundamental archaeological questions never before presented for public consideration.This book offers a complete thesis so as to complement, augment, and even change contemporary theories concerning the ancient history of mankind. If read with an open mind, this book has the potential to spark the research of a new breed of archaeological investigators determined to \\"fill in the gaps\\" of mankind's vague history.This book will absolutely stimulate your cusiosity into the origins of ancient human history. Hancock's endnotes and research reference notes alone are worth the price of the book.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Guess work!","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book. That being said, I found the authors traveling around the world and speculating on old fables to be quite annoying. The author does very little to back up his speculations with any documentation or fact. Maybe I'm old school, but I can do without guess work. Give me some fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hancock Visits the Temple of His Mind","review":"Hancock's book contains intriguing detail, but I just have to wonder about some of his assertions. The pyramids at Giza are certainly magnificent examples of ancient architecture. But, is the brilliance in their execution an example of extraterrestrial intervention in human events? Hancock provides numerous mathematical relationships to support his theories, but the question is: did the ancient Egyptians think as Hancock does? And, does the evidence which Hancock cites truly prove that ET visited ancient Egypt? Books such as this one serve as an important lesson to inquiring, intelligent minds: Belief can be the deciding factor in the \\"truth\\" one manages to see--a condition to which we are all susceptible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This book will definitely peak your interest if you have an open mind.

On the other hand, he seems to have had an idea and made all facts fit it, disregarding other input or other interpretations.Also, he has used a number of fiction writers tricks to make those ideas come through (like finding a \\"badie\\" - in this case, archeologists to- get sympathy for his ideas).Anyway, he does point to some unexplained archeology misterys, which haven't been well explained, so it may be worth reading for those not particularly keen on dry history reading. On the whole though, it is the kind of book that that just makes its author wealthier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps deserves one and a half stars","review":"Perhaps this book deserves one and a half or even two stars - not for Hancock's silly nonsense about continents charging round but because he does put his finger on some genuinely unexplained mysteries. Compared to Sitchin's \\"Twelth Planet\\" - which is a positive insult to the human mind - it is a scholarly work, but still at bottom incoherent, unscientific and full of absurdities. The trouble with even the best fringe science writers is that they are, at best, better at pointing to holes in conventional theories (including evolution) than putting up anything better (or experimentally verifiable) themselves. If you like science-fiction, read some good honest science-fiction by Larry Niven etc., which doesn't pretend to be anything more than fiction.

It is a great Literary work, considering his theory changes from one book to the next and at will to suit his purpose. He claims to be an amateur and yet I will admit the theory is interesting yet the facts he chose to prove it are as unfounded as the mysteries he chose to disprove.

The author, Graham Hancock, has visited the sites of ancient civilizations in Egypt, Peru, China, Easter Island, and such, and has found evidence of similar and very advanced methods of construction, mathematics, and water management as well as parallel legends that originated at these far-flung places."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable and honest expository","review":"One thing that distinguishes Grahm Hancock's book from the likes of a work such as \\"World's in Collision\\" is that Hancock garners support for his theories from well respected scientists in geology and astronomy. Heck, he even has Einstien backing him up on a major point. This is not to say scientists are little christs, as Hancock takes many pot-shots at their irrational dogma, and unfounded conclusions throughout the book.The evidence he brings forth is basically irrefutable proof that an advanced civilization has slipped past conventional archeologies radar. He'll take you on a long journey, studying megaliths in ancient america to egpyt. He'll analyize ancient maps that have some GROUND SHAKING implications(litterally hehe).He analyizes the symbolism and parallels of many ancient myths regarding catastrophies, and suggests that perhaps these common themes, these megaliths were meant to give a message to us in the future, of earth's impending disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open minds will be blown away","review":"If your mind is already made up about the origins of human civilization, and you rigidly refuse to believe anything beyond what you were taught in fourth grade history, please do not read this book.If, however, you are open to the idea that there is something more out there, that the conventional wisdom is sometimes just convention and not wisdom, don't miss this book. Hancock writes an incredible, believable story, backed up with much scientific research and indisputible empirical evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a joke book","review":"Please remember that Hancock is first and foremost a journalist. His scholarly credentials on ancient archaeology are highly questionable and his theories have been laughed out of academic circles.There is absolutely no evidence to support his assumptions, and enough has been written to refute Hancock that I won't try here except to say that this book is sure to appeal to those who want to believe and who are unfamiliar with the facts of anthropology and archaeology. The idea that ancient man had any help -- much less access to higher technology -- flies in the face of every dig in the Middle East and mocks the thousands of hard-working archaeologists engaged in legitimate work.Keep this one in the Joke Book stack because it doesn't deserve any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Nonsense","review":"When will the gullible learn?

Ease of squeeze diminishes as size increases and fruit becomes firmer. An older, drier orange would be almost impossible for Hulk Hogan to get a drop out of. A small, juicy lime would be a whiz for an arthritic grandma.Our objections are, the enamel peels off where the juice contacts it most strongly and repeatedly, so that bits of paint fall in your food preparations; the acid in the juice attacks the bare aluminum and causes pitting; waxy coatings from the fruit which build up on the inside surfaces of the juicers attract dirt and mildew and are virtually impossible to remove; and finally, the pin that holds the pieces together is steel and rusts.Although these juicers get the juice out, we're now looking for an all stainless steel model with long enough handles so it doesn't take a lot of strength to juice a lemon, and doesn't shed paint and collect crud that can't be removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hinge Broke first day.","review":"The device worked well for the first couple of limes that I squeezed.

I never really watched one before and was quickly hooked onto the story itself.

The best that such a novel can do is to imagine the person as he / she might have been, filling in the lacunae that history leaves us. This can do as much for us in imagining the past as history does.This novel is told from the point of view of a servant of Anne Boleyn. She accompanies Anne back home from court after her courtship with Henry Percy is abruptly broken off, and remains with her throughout her life. The story is not entirely historically accurate, but I have rarely seen Anne Boleyn so plausibly brought to life. One of the most interesting angles is that Lofts has Anne argue that she has been perfectly virtuous: she never even kissed Henry until he claimed that he wasn't married. Anne's possible reactions to her sister Mary are also very well done.Well worth reading and pondering for anyone interested in the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product, took forever to arrive!!","review":"Good Product, took forever to arrive!!

Do they contain the ancient Hall of Records? Ah, for those answers you'll need to read Clark & Agnew's book. The Union of the Polarity, revealed for the first time in over 6 thousands years in their book, puts all the pieces into place.Once you finish Hancock's work, you must complete your journey by reading \\"The Ark of Millions of Years.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A well researched work.","review":"For you who wish to study further on texts , I recommend 'The Ancient Egyptian Pyamid Ttexts' by RO Faulkner (new publishers>Aris & Phillips) and 'The Egyptian Miracle, an introduction to the wisdom of the temple' by RA Schwaller de Lubicz, published by Inner Traditions International. If you can not read French, and can not wait for the English version of his 'Temple de L'homme', this book is the recommended alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets and choices","review":"In a culture that prizes family and breeding, the most important legacy is the bloodline, or the family tree. Sometimes something startling comes to light when a person like Caroline starts to probe the past, and we are reminded that those dry, half-forgotten names in the family Bible were once breathing, passionate humans making choices and mistakes, just like ourselves.This book tells the story of Caroline and her secrets and dilemmas, and yes, the subject of abortion is one of the issues. But Dr. Moser lets her characters hold the opinions and make the decisions on this heated topic. Both pro and con are here, but each character's choice is based on what he or she believes in and values. The narrative will wrap you in warm Southern surroundings, and the secrets will keep you enthralled, both in guessing what they are and in wondering how they can be resolved.It might leave you wishing you had a Great-Aunt Kathleen of your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterfeit Legacy","review":"While this book is a page turner, my objection to this book is the suthor's heavy-handed approach of the abortion issue. This is not apparent in the beginning of the book but becomes so the farther one reads the book. I was NOT expecting it from this book by the descriptions that I had read. It is rather disingenuous of the author to hit the reader over the head with a 2X4 concerning her views on abortion without being \\"up front\\" about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!

One year later -- just after the warranty expired, the printer started making loud snapping sounds, like plastic being broken. At that same time, the printer started jamming and stopped printing. (I see that other people writing reviews have had the exact same experience.)While the printer worked for the first year, it constantly crumpled the corners of envelopes, creating a very unprofessional appearance. This, too, appears to be a common problem with this printer.I had an earlier version of this printer that lasted well for a number of years. However, in this model, the manufacturer appears to have cut corners and created a product that, in my opinion, is junk. Given the quick failure, I may end up suing the manufacturer to get my money back.I'll be replacing the computer today with something more reliable.

I also called the repair store that had worked on my previous 2 printers. The repair man recommended this printer. He was right on the money.

I set it up and it worked fine. I have had it for 6 months. About once every 2 or 3 weeks this machine suddenly reads \\"No Paper\\" though there is paper in it and it is not jammed. There is a plastic clicking sound about 6 times in a row then the red light. If I power it down, then back up, stick my hand in the tray and scream curse words it might start working eventually. So far the shaking the printer, turning it off, sticking my hand in the tray and clicking things around while screaming expletives has worked, but yesterday it stopped working and none of this seems to help.Not enough of a problem for you? It curls the pages as I print them so that any document more than 4 pages long gets jammed if you do not pull the pages out and babysit it.Grossly overpriced for such a crappy mess.

About two week later, not receiving the replacement, I called back and they said they had to verify the address. Another two week or so went by, still not receiving the replacement, I called and again they wanted to verify address again. Then again, still not receiving the replacement, so I called and for the third time they again needed to verify the address. I demanded to talk to the manager. He promised to send the replacement overnight; and I received the printer within two days. Unfortunately the replacement did not work either -- the paper kept being jam every single time!

The quality of the output is fine but I have constantly had to clean the drum (done easily, admittedly). The two worst features are its inability to print envelopes--at least five creases per envelope on every try--and the print/copy output comes out very curled and winds up on the floor. This printer appears unable to copy/print more than ten pages without pushing it into a messy pile or all the way onto the floor. And did I mention the high degree of curling of the output (I did, but I will do it again). As a small business I will not buy a Brother printer-assuming they all share these faults (admittedly could be wrong). I will search another company's product line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this item","review":"Unfortunately, the stone came off the second day i wore it.This was a surprise and upset.Thank you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons of quality information about operating a Haunted House.","review":"This book provides excellent information about operating a haunted attraction. It covers more than just effects. Planning, location, safety, advertising, and other important subjects are covered. The production value of the book is lower than I expected; that's why I only give it 4 out of 5 stars. The artwork is simple but adequate. However, the quality and amount of information makes this book well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spootacular!!!!!!!","review":"A great book for the motivated home haunter, great ideas and scenes that can be built on a budget. Your not going to put any haunted house out of business, but you will be the hit of the neighborhood. You need to have a creative mind to go along with the concepts presented, this a guide not a by the numbers book. If you are like me and work on Halloween projects all year round, you will enjoy this book. If you want so some cute wood cutouts to put in the yard, this book is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic instructional book at best.","review":"Very basic book that MAY be helpful to a home haunter, but if you serious about producing a haunted attraction, this book will be of little help to you. The book's drawings are simplistic and the description of props is somewhat vague, however, there are some basic technics that can utilized to create certain effects. The book's discussion of the finances of a haunted attraction is very limited and unimaginative. The use of actors to replace mechanical activation of effects is prominent in this book which leads me to believe that the authors financial skills are lacking( Labor cost & insurance are monumental hurdles in any haunted attraction). In general I would reccommend that you save your money on this one, the internet provides most of information in the book \\"free for the asking\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"You've got to be kidding me","review":"I just wasted abou 30 bucks on this book. i hope I can getit back too. If you are serious about wanting to make a haunted house that is scary, don' buy this. I think this book is for people that ar trying to make their house look cool on halloween or whatever. It talks about running an actual haunted house event, but like I say, if you are serious, this is just not even helpful. The most important aspects of operating a haunted house are just outlined briefly in the book. Most of the book concentrates on building props and masks. It dosen't even make sense on most of it. Why wouldn't someone just buy masks and create the haunted house like they wanted too? i found ONE idea out of the whole book i liked. As far as knowing how to get one started I'm right where I began. In my opinion, you just have to try to get a haunted house in order by your own insticts, because I learnt the hard way, books can't do it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not What I Expected, BUT WHAT A SURPRISE!","review":"I expected this book to cover government conspiracies and it did, to some degree, but not how I expected. I read some of the other reviews and was disappointed at how close-minded people are. Bob talks a lot about what's REALLY happening and how we, as spirits, can prepare for what is about to happen. I've read many spiritual self-help books and I think this falls under that category, but WOW! It's like nothing I've read. If you're a close-minded tobacco-chewing/truck driver/hill-billy who doesn't believe in anything \\"spiritual\\" or mind-opening, then don't bother. You won't get it. (I could almost hear the cud being chewed as I was reading some of the poor reviews of this book.) If you're a self-help junkie, this will COMPLETELY BLOW YOU AWAY!

Is there a devious secret government? Yes, but you'll find a lot more accurate info elsewhere on these subjects.

After lots of research, my wife and I decided on the Smooth 5.0 for four reasons: it's stable, quiet, reasonably priced, and doesn't have any unnecessary bells & whistles.Smooth is one of the best brands out there for consumer treadmills. Other brands (Precor, LifeFitness) are geared towards commercial use (i.e. gyms). Granted, these treadmills are more durable and able to withstand much more use, but you also pay 3 or 4 times more.The 5.0 is just as stable and even more quiet than the high-end treadmills I use at my work gym. While the belt length & width are a few inches shorter than the commercial counterparts, I really haven't even noticed.The clincher: the 5.0 also folds up easily for storage and has a great warranty.

Finding deeper significance in popular films is always interesting, even if I do not end up agreeing with the author. It stimulates thought and makes me appreciate my favorite films even more; sometimes it pushes me to like films I did not like previously. I think this book is very interesting. I guess it comes down to having an open mind. Also, it is just plain naive to believe that a film can't have deeper meaning just because it was produced as entertainment. Finally, I don't think it is necessary to insult the author just because one disagrees with his views. As an Amazon customer, I don't find that helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elvis Cinema and Popular Culture","review":"Save your money! This author can't be serious! I laughed through most of what he thinks is a serious topic. I have never read such psychobabble in my life. Throughout the entire book he is hung up on the same 2 subjects which are certainly part of the dumb Elvis movies but nothing that any reasonable person would take seriously. The movies were meant to be just fun & nothing more. There is no underlying message in any of those movies. Except for Jailhouse Rock & King Creole, the movies are about the same, just meant for young kids to be entertained by a good looking guy who can sing. This author is just trying to impress readers with his supposed knowledge & his vocabularly. If he sees underlying sexual perversion in an Elvis movie, I'd hate to see how he reacts to the movies of today! He needs to get a life, some movies are just meant for one thing only - entertainment.

There are some highlights, and the long progressive epic is interesting, but again, lackluster when compared with Stardust We Are or The Truth Will Set You Free.

The other selections are truly outstanding and this is indeed a priceless collection.I just hope we don't have to wait another twenty years to see more SUPREMES DVDs in the market. Maybe the next release should be the TCB and GIT television specials with The Temptations which have never been available before.

The acting was so horribly melodramatic, while at the same time completely emotionless. And every single concert appears to be in exactly the same venue, with the same 10 fans.

Typical boy meets snake, snake bites boy, boy dies type story, but with the added twist of genetically engineered snake DNA. It's mixed with spider DNA!\\"HOLD THE PHONE\\" I hear you say. Yes that's correct. Snake and spider DNA, together at last. Like I said, the idea was interesting (please don't misunderstand me. I said interesting, not good.), but the writing style was just terrible. At times I had to re-read sections, just trying to understand it.If you're a hardcore snake fan, buy this book.

'Jumpin Jumpin' gave me an instant headache. Thats until I heard it on CD and not on the radio.I've got to hand it to Destiny's Child. Their production values are the best in the industry. As for their voices, well, they tend to get screechy, but when theyre good, they are excellent and totally in-sync. 'Jumpin' is a song that grows on you, and this CD single is definitely worth buying because it contains so many remixes, though I do prefer the original version to any of the remixes. I recently saw the group at Guavaween in Ybor City, and they were rather dull on stage, though they did try. And guess which song they performed the best? This one! This is an exceptional hip-hop-pop recording, and a must-have for any Destiny lover. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your ingredients.","review":"I cannot recommend this product. I've learned to go to the manufacturer's website and check the ingredients because they don't list them on Amazon. Everyone's body is different, so I recommend that you only begin supplements one at a time so that you can tell how your body is reacting to it. Since I started taking this about a month ago, my joints ache. I feel very stiff and wake up during the night in pain - Very unusual for me. Also, I have less energy and sometimes have numbness in my extremities - like when your limbs \\"go to sleep\\". I seem to feel hungry more than usual.

One of the most enticing features is the price. Very cheap game, but still provides hours of entertainment. It isn't the next RollerCoaster Tycoon, mind you, but it's somewhere up there. The game does take up a lot of computer resources, and mine is jerky, but that doesn't limit the fun very much. The only other thing is that you have to first buy certain buildings to get newer ones, and when you start new levels, it gets boring having to do it over again. Along those lines, if you decide to upgrade a building and you get rid of the old one, you have to buy it again because you can't have newer buildings unless you currently have the older one.Other than these things, I find this game very entertaining with little surprises here and there. I would definetly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun game for fellow tycoon lovers.","review":"Although nowhere as good as Rollercoaster Tycoon, this game, with a few good patches, and some added scenarios, could be a winner. The makers of this game could learn a few things from Chris Sawyer, but they're on the right track. It's another game that you can play for hours, and the best thing is, is that you don't even have to know how to ski to play the game! For the price, it's not a waste of time.

You can build lifts,gondolas,and much more. the grahics are awsome. The game is very cheap. If you don't like it you are not throwing away a lot of money. In easy mode you start out with 50,000 dollars. You can spend it fast if you are gredy.

This game, however, is not nearly as good as RCT. I hated it! The little hand was really hard to control and there didn't really seem to be a purpose to the game. What you had to do was build buildings, and most of the buildings required a less expensive building on the resort to be built before the building you wanted could be built. You couldn't look in the buildings or anything. Save your money on this one, it's not worth spending on. Buy something that can let you have more control, if that's what you like. This is only a good game if you want to just see the little buildings placed around and watch skiers ski, but you can't build much yourself or anything. I think Roller Coaster Tycoon, or The Sims, or Sim City would all be better alternatives to Ski Resort Tycoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This game is way too limited.

You can even play god and change the shape of the mountains!There are many great features of the game, such as a rating as to how good your ski resort is (eg. 5 star rating) plus many graphs to keep you on top of finances and other statistics.If you like management titles, get it - and if you like skiing, check it out too.

Once I got it started, the software runned very, very slow, sometimes it would freeze! When I got the game to start to work (after about a hour) the game ended up being no fun! You can build things (but limited quanities) then I just gave up and felt like I wanted to return the software, but I couldn't because I had already opened the box, and it came with no warrenty card.

Personally I wouldnt reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Sims Out There","review":"I bought this game with the expectation of it being like Roller Coaster Tycoon. I was wrong.In Roller Coaster Tycoon there are many campaigns at different parks you can do. You get new rides and stuff through R&D.; I expected the same in this game.

My only complaint, and this would not deter me from buying this DVD, is the pace of the music is faster in this delivery than the original LP recordings.

The armband is a really good design with a great neopreme pocket flap to help keep your Ipod dry but the huge problem with the carrier is the feaux leather/vinyl. From the moment I bought the carrier, I knew this would be a problem. The vinyl is extremely brittle and easily torn. I thought that if I was careful with the carrier it would last (It was cheap enough for a few months of good use, which was fine for me)...I thought wrong. The design issue is that they used this terrible vinyl in the loop that holds the armband to itself. That is the point that gets the most stress during use!The first time I tried to adjust it during a jog, it was history. I was not putting undo pressure, stress, or abusing it in anyway.

Macsoft support is nil, in-fact there is a patch for this game and all three locations linked on the Macsoft webpage to down load the patch are dead.

The graphics are surprisingly good. Some people have said that the campaign is too short but playing it through on hard it's by no means a short game, as far as I can remember the AOM campaign is longer than those from any of the AOE 3 and expansions packs.

It is now a constant joy to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exquisite voice but the arrangements are a little flat","review":"Sometimes one doesn't like a particular song or CD not because its not good music or a good performance but, rather, because it's not their cup of tea. Maureen McGovern has one of the most melodic voices among those in her category i.e. Barbra Streisand, Linda Eder. Most of her work really hits the mark. But this one drags for me. It's lounge music (which I like) that ends up in the background rather than on centerstage. Piano solos are fine but need some luster if there are no other instruments. This is one of those CD's I'll end up giving away, hopefully to someone who can appreciate the tempo and concept here."},{"rating":"1","title":"mouse anatomy book","review":"This is one of only 2 mouse anatomy books I know of.

I called back three times and three different customer service reps told me this, and vonage's customer service center in India does not seem to have a canned speech to address this so it was useless.But, I like the machine so much for its speed, relative lack of jams and the amount paper it saves on the duplexing function, that I got an online fax provider and kept the machine despite the problems.

The close-ups are of the beautiful costumes the women are wearing...just watch and you'll see this.

Who would think a one year old could be so attached to a certain item or character? well, she is! She hugs and snuggles and wrestles with her big Pooh all the time. Pooh will be with us forever, I am sure. The quality seems top notch and durability has been great so far. I hope he holds up for many years to come. I highly recommend this! At first, I hesitated, thinking it was just another stuffed animal, not knowing how much fun it would be for a little one. If you love Pooh, go for the gusto and get this big one. Your child will love him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mommy's gift to her big boy!!!","review":"My son's birthday was this past weekend and the best gift he received was from me. When he wakes up, he points to his Pooh bear an starts squeezing its tummy so it can say something. My son is just one year old and he has been all about Pooh since his birth. I hope he will continue to enjoy it for the years to come. I'm considering getting him the entire gang. So far I found Tigger and Eeyore but no Piglet. I guess the search will continue on. I would recommend this bear to any parent whose child loves Pooh.

Good size and weight to the comb. It's a sturdy comb and I don't expect to lose any tines pulling out tough knots.

Would highly recommend to someone needing a basic comb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent comb at a good price","review":"Got it for my girlfriend after she broke her last comb.

I see these claims advertised on combs and it seems like a gimmick to me. The plastic is somewhat cheap feeling and after a long time of use it did break a little but was still usable. I ended up losing mine though and bought a different brand. Also the design is not very visually appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comb","review":"Great comb - the two-toned blended colors are more like a gradient shift in colors from opaque black to the translucent color not tortoise shelled like the picture. It is still nice looking though; I got an aqua and a purple one randomly. I bought them for the nice colors, and I definitely got two good ones. I have hair that will seriously tangle and snarl on itself because it's really fine. This comb goes through wet hair without causing knots or ripping at the strands. The tines of the comb do not have sharp edges, so it does not scratch the scalp. I am very pleased with the quality of these combs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, terrible comb","review":"Do not buy this comb! It is brittle, cheap plastic that broke the first time I dropped it.

The plastic ring holding the comb to the manufacturer's packaging was broken in several pieces, leaving me to believe this was not well cared for in the warehouse.

I love Amazon, and it's only a $5 comb, but this is was not acceptable quality control and I feel this particular item purchased was a waste of my money!It is also a brittle plastic, and I would not have purchased if seen in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within a week :(","review":"I wasn't expected this inexpensive comb to last forever at the price when I added it to my cart to meet my $25 shipping minimum, but when combing my wet curly hair it snapped in half within a week after buying.

They are really great teachers. The way that they describe how to do the moves were clear and gave me new perspective. We had a lot of fun. I gave it four stars because I wanted there to be more on the DVD. I was upset when it was done. Amar is awsome. She is so good. So this is a very good DVD. I suggest it. And I'm glad that it can spice up my desert living conditions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great for moves, but not for workout","review":"You do really learn the hip movements easily, and the girls look great with their trendy little outfits, but this IS NOT a workout video! They teach a small dance routine that's similar to some sort of line dance, where you actually turn after each completion. This is difficult for beginners, as 3/4 of the time you are turned away from the television. In addition, as many other views have stated, there is not enough workout content to make this dvd worth my while. I've had great success with the Island Girl Hula DVD's which teach many similar hip movements at a slow pace while also providing a great workout."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun addition to the belly-fitness library","review":"This is a fun and easy video that teaches simple moves and an easy-to-follow choreography to pop music. It is suitable for bellydance beginners and hobbyists. It is not however a professional choreography or a bellydance training video. If you buy it for what it is, you'll enjoy the heck out of it.Amar and Kaeshi are stars of the bellydance world and they certainly know their stuff. While there are many belly-fitness videos out there, you can't go wrong with these two professionals.This video has high production values and mine came with an extra CD of contemporary/techno belly dance music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kathy Smith is better","review":"The instruction is good and the tips on how to incorporate the simple routine into a 4 step dance is okay which earn the dvd a 1 from me, but overall, I found the workout slow and simplistic with no sweat whatsoever.

It is in the Latin American school of angry social science, but is little informed by fact. Much of what it says is correct, but is also well known.

It is therefore often simply wrong.

He begins the book as a serious wastrel and ends the book still not up to my standards of hero. I just never bought that Willie would be drawn to a man who kidnapped her, humiliated her in front of a bunch of strangers, and then allows her to become a servant in his home. I'm sorry, but I just did not get the attraction. Sure, he was cute, but there have to be better men out there.Despite my problems with the \\"hero\\" of \\"The Viscount's Bawdy Bargain,\\" it did have some nice moments and some fun characters, especially the Cyprians turned chambermaids, the alleged poisoner turned chef, and the pugilist turned valet. These saved the book from the donation bin before I had finished it.Overall, not my favorite hero or book. I'm willing to give Connie Lane another shot, but this book is definitely not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Procol Harum live at Union Chapel","review":"Procol Harum live at Union Chapel is a fabulous compilation of there music.

Got the Procol Harum jones again after seeing them this summer (2010) and also buying the Transatlantic CD with their cover of \\"In Held (twas) In I\\". The sound quality is excellent, good frequency response and no distortion, and the mixing is for the most part very good, and the video quality is very good. My one bone to pick is the video editing, which never stays put and is more close-ups than panning back - rarely is the whole band in the same frame (which would be nice, since Gary Brooker and Matthew Fisher are at opposite sides of the stage). The audio CD is OK, but if I were picking the songs I wouldn't have chosen so many from \\"Well's on Fire\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This re-release is an affront to Procol fans","review":"The low rating is for the manner of re-release only.

If you are a Procol fan what choice do you have but to purchase the dvd a second time?

Unlike many of the others out there who focus on teaching snippets of known songs, Petrucci shows you exercise upon exercise on how to improve your chops. Everything pertaining to rock guitar is included. From chord building, to melody to fast, screaming soloing, it's all here. The best feature of this video is that Petrucci teaches you how to practice. The VHS copy is two-hours long, and it is PACKED with information. You cannot go wrong with this one.I'm hoping that John Petrucci, who has won countless fan-favorite awards, will come out with a second installment soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Cover but content is not for the grieving husband.","review":"This book trys to convey what grief is like through metaphors.

Most books try to tell you how you should feel, or how you should feel ok about feeling. Whatever. This author never claims to have any clue about how the reader might be feeling. He just pours his own emotions onto the page - in poems, metaphors, however he can manage to express himself at the moment. For me, this was much more useful that the more directed help books. My emotions were often different than Robert's, but reading about his struggle made me feel less alone in my own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun - incoherent, but fun","review":"There's a lot going on here, and not a lot for the newbie to cling to. Maybe that doesn't matter, though.The artwork is veried and enjoyable - most of it is harsh, angluar penwork with limited use of color, but parts of it verge on the painterly.Story? Well, that's a problem. There are lots of one-page vignettes and a brief but cryptic story near the end. Robots abound, of course - for family fun, combat, and just about everything else. And, of course, there are endless adult entertainment opportunities, more hinted at than shown.Maybe this series depends on continuity from one issue to the next, so any one snapshot of the series looks disjoint. The artwork is good enough to pull me back to see if that's the case.

As I am normally a back sleeper, this helps me sleep on my side as is recommended. The horseshoe shape of it means that I also have support for my back, legs, belly and head. I also like that the cover is removable and washable. I've now been using the pillow for the past 3 weeks and still love it.

Definitely the best buy a pregnant woman can splurge on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preg Body pillow","review":"Hi,I brought this Todays Mom Cozy comfort Pregnancy pillow 1 week back i read the reviews but i feel its not worth the money.1.This pillow takes the whole space,I have a queen size bed and my husband cannot sleep if i place this pillow.2.i am 5.3 height and i feel my head does not fit in the right place and i get lot of neck pain when i use it.3.its a polyster material so its not good during summer4.i have given 2 star because it feels confortable for few minutes then you will start feeling the pinch.I think its good for people who are above 5.3 height.5.For sure its not worth the money i have stoped using it :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and very fast service","review":"I ordered this pillow on 1/30/12 and received it yesterday afternoon 1/31/12.

It really helped me get into a comfortable sleeping position. My only compliant is that I felt like I had to fluff it up every time i got up.

Read the fine print it's NOT RETURNABLE!! I however stopped the delivery of mine and 5 weeks later still have not been reimbursed. anyways...this pillow was amazing THE FIRST WEEK. Then slowly it started to DEFLATE like all other pillows out there. The first thing to go was the top middle. I had to add my own pillow for head support. The second was the ends where I rest my legs. For the money I paid this thing should have lasted my entire pregnancy but it didn't last even a couple of weeks. I should have just kept investing in crappy pillows and gotten the same outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"can not return when you feel it's not good","review":"long time sleep with this pillow make me can not feel my arm, it's really not comfortable.even bad, you can not return it.. by their policy.it's just waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Design","review":"We bought it for my wife who is in her second trimester.

It got ripped a couple year back due to a dog. She was so happy that I ordered her another one for christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very comfortable","review":"Love this pillow I used it for years and even after I had my kids. I eventually had to get rid of it because it was separating me and my husband on our bed, lol. I would highly recommend this pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!","review":"This is a great product! while pregnant, I was so uncomfortable, I would toss and turn all night long. This pillow saved me! It's soft and flexible and would position it so it would support my giant belly and my back at the same time. I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Maternity Investment Ever!","review":"I never purchased a maternity pillow for my first pregnancy, and I slept horribly the entire time. I am a back sleeper, so sleeping on my side is extremely uncomfortable anyway. I thought I'd take a chance with this pillow. AMAZING! I've been using it for 5 months and love it! It wedges me on my side so I don't roll forward or backward. It gets a little warm in the summer, but it was great in the winter. It also takes up a bit of the bed, but not too bad (we have a Queen-size). I highly recommend this pillow for anyone concerned about sleeping while pregnant. It was the best maternity investment I could have made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresented - Not comfortable","review":"I ordered this pillow and was shocked when I opened the box and found that it is almost completely flat. It appears full in the photo but it is actually more than half as flat as advertised. I tried using it but it provides no support for your back at all. It would need to be stuffed further with additional materials. Total waste of money and company would not allow me to return it. They take advantage of pregnant women...they should be ashamed to sell a crappy product and not care about their customers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used it once and hated it!!!","review":"Someone had told me about this pillow and how great it was, but when I got it I was very disappointed! When I first felt the pillow the material was very ruff, so I figured washing the cover would help, it didn't. The only way I can really explain the pillow is its loud and annoying. I would not get this pillow or any pillow off line because you can't feel it. Don't buy this and waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"refund not accepted","review":"My wife feels too much noise when she moves at night on this pillow.

I requested seller to return this product but they are not ready to accept return as per their policy. So please read this review before you spend this costly pillow. It is very very uncomfortable for pregnant woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed!!","review":"Do not waste your money on this pillow! I am highly disappointed after receiving and using it. I had high hopes that this would solve my sleeping discomforts, based upon the reviews. However, it is nothing like what the positive reviews say. It is fairly flat and should be stuffed MUCH more, especially for the price. Since it is flimsy, it moves way too much, and I am constantly having to readjust it. I have had to use several other pillows with it, and it continues to flatten more every day. I am seriously debating whether to return this product because of my disappointment. Try another pillow, if you are looking for quality - this is NOT a good one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Under stuffed Pillow Not As Good As It Lokks","review":"This pillow has no where near enough stuffing. Your head is pretty much on the mattress immediately. Plus the fabric finish smell is really strong and doesn't seem to fade. Getting a smaller option that just supports your belly and goes through your legs is a better idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware-NO RETURNS!","review":"I bought this pillow on the recommendation of a friend, and immediately found it too soft when I took it out of the box. I tried to return it before I even used it, and was informed it was NOT returnable. When I asked how I would know that, I was directed to a series of links that led me to a very buried return policy. Don't buy it unless you're sure! I spent $70 and I still can't sleep, and I will probably have to buy something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely uncomfortable and too bulky","review":"My husband and I share a queen size bed and this pillow took up most of the bed. It was too bulky and left kinks in my neck. I wish I had never purchased it. I tried it one night and then put it back in the box. That is how much I hated it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I used this pillow for two weeks and couldn't take it anymore so I threw it out. This is the worst body pillow I have ever owned. The pillow case is extremly rough and scratchy. The overall length is terrible. I do not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lifesaver in my last trimester","review":"I wasn't going to order a pregnancy pillow. Didn't think one was needed until I hit my last trimester, and sleep became a rarity. After researching countless pillows, I found this one, and what a blessing! Don't know what i would've done without it. It is a challenge to climb out of it those last few weeks, but once you're snuggled in, it's a Godsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfort to start my second trimester","review":"I love this pillow. It's huge so my husband doesn't love it so much :) Lucky we have a king size bed as it would take up any queen size easily. Really helps me get a good night's sleep though and I would definitely recommend to any woman pregnant or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saves my nights!","review":"I basically love this pillow. Since I got it, I have been sleeping well. I started looking for such pillow because I could not sleep at all. I got the pillow when I was 4 months pregnant. Without the pillow, I could not find a position that was comfortable enough. The pillow provides support in the right places and keeps me comfortable.The pillow is a bit to flat under the head, but I put another pillow beneath, giving me just the level I need. It also takes me some time to get in and out from the pillow, but that is not a big problem.Also, my husband has some back pain and he has tried this pillow a few times. He liked it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pregnancy pillow","review":"Very nice pillow. Provides good support for neck, back, and growing belly. My husband likes it because it keeps me from being too much of a bed hog"},{"rating":"2","title":"This pillow is wonderful!!","review":"I love, love, love this pillow. I resisted purchasing a pregnancy pillow, thinking it wasn't worth the money for just a few months. Boy was I wrong! This pillow has made sleep so much better. I love the fact that if I want to switch sides all I have to do is roll over. Since the rolling over itself can sometimes be a challenge later in pregnancy, not having to readjust my pillows is fantastic. I would highly recommend this pillow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT help!!!","review":"LOVE the pillow, can't sleep without it, since being pregnant I have to have something between my knees to sleep comfortably and I also have a pinched nerve in my hip... I don't know what I would do without this pillow!! My only complaint is that it goes flat rather quickly an the stuffing bunches up in the legs... but over all its amazing. I'm so glad I got it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I don't know what I would have done without this pillow. I had virtually zero back pain during my pregnancy, which I can not totally credit the pillow for but it certainly helped me sleep. My husband, however, despises this pillow and says that it created a barrier in our bed for the five months I used it. It did take up a good deal of our Queen size bed, so beware of that. I still have this baby packed away for my next pregnancy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best night's sleep!","review":"I'm not a natural side sleeper but this pillow made it so comfortable! While pregnant I ordered this and before I received it, I caught a cold that made it even more uncomfortable to sleep - I could only sleep 4 hours one night. The next day I received this pillow and managed 12 hours sleep! It was wonderful. IMHO best pregnancy pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I bought this for my birthday. I read all of the reviews and decided on getting this one because the other preggo pillows seemed to small. I'm nearly 5'8\\", so I needed a larger pillow.

I thought it was the best thing ever when I first got it. Provided excellent support, and my back felt way better. After just a month of using it, though, the stuffing material deflated and redispursed in to areas that weren't being supported. I still use the pillow, but I have to put other pillows where the head is and where the back support used to be, and it's not very comfortable anymore. I am sad that I have no money to invest in a better pillow. Please do not trust all the good reviews.. Many are written by people who haven't been using the pillow for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love!!!!!","review":"I can't sleep without it now.

When her hips started to hurt and I saw her struggling to sleep my male \\"fixer\\" traits emerged. I first tried putting a twin camping air mattress on top of our queen sized bed. It did help but left me a very small space. Next I bought a new memory foam mattress but the chemical off gassing was making me sick. When I got to the people who know, other pregnant women, I found this pillow. What a difference. This thing is great and I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY -NO REFUNDS","review":"I bought this and a another pillow to try them out. I did not use this one, I just tried it for a minute and it was too soft and BABY AGE WILL NOT REFUND my money. I would not recommend purchasing ANYTHING from BABY AGE> They have poor customer service. It is very soft with not a lot of support."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a lifesaver!","review":"I love this pillow! I've been sleeping on it now for almost six months, and I could not get by without it. It supports everywhere I need it to, and when you twist it up like a pretzel around your body, it lets you sort of prop yourself up in bed to watch TV (Great when you are on bedrest with twins!). The cover comes of easy for washing, the fabric is smooth, the zipper works great. Its a fantastic pillow! One of the nicest things about this style is that you can roll over in the night without having to take the whole pillow with you. Its a BIG pillow, but it easily fits on our king size bed without encroaching on hubby's side. I highly recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This pillow gives you the stability to position yourself however you want. It is very comfortable and worth it. The only downfall is it is very bulkly in bed and does take up a lot of room, which might bother your hubby a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"I researched a lot of pillows before deciding on this one. I love the size, all though it is big. But I can turn from side to side easily and it is easy to get in and out of it (Many trips to the bathroom in the middle of the night). It is long enough for me (5'9\\"). I did have to use a couple of pillows for my head because it was akward to sleep with just the pillow. I could not figure out where to put the \\"Bottom\\" arm. The fabric is a little scratchy, but does not bother me.I can't say that my sleep is back to 100%, but it did improve. I can't say my back never hurts, but it hurts less. I highly reccomend this pillow. But a warning to all husbands. In a Queen size bed or smaller, you will be making a sacrifice of your space."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's really just a pillow - but a nice one","review":"I read amazing reviews and hoped to sleep perfectly once the pillow arrived. And I have enjoyed it. I'm tall and it fits fine - I get up a lot in the night to use the bathroom and it's easy to get \\"in and out\\" of the pillow. It's been much easier than trying to keep umpteen pillows tucked around me all night. It's not magical - but it's a nice pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Order only from Amazon.com","review":"Case in point why to only order from Amazon.com and not individual sellers, unless you have not other choice.I wish I'd written this as a seller review, but in my procrastination this will have to do. Apparently, pregnant women (sorry honey) can be fickle about the pillows they snuggle with. This body pillow was no exception. We wanted to return it, but the seller (BabyAge) would not allow it.Amazon.com lets you return just about anything, minus the very few exceptions they outline. Additionally, Amazon will pay for your returns."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: NOT RETURNABLE","review":"I bought this product based on all of the positive reviews, but when I got it, I tried it out really quickly and realized that it was COMPLETELY uncomfortable for me. The pillow felt like it was half-filled with cushioning and did not actually provide me with any support. The next day, I contacted Amazon to attempt to return the item and have been notified that it is NOT RETURNABLE. I did not read down to the last sentence of the description where it states that it is NOT RETURNABLE. The question being, how can you know if you will like a pillow if you have to buy it to try it and then CANNOT RETURN it? Suffice it to say, I have an extra pillow now that is COMPLETELY UNUSED and USELESS and which I am completely out of $ for. I do not recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pillow - Firm and Soft","review":"The only negative reaction I have is that the slipcover is not as soft as I'd like - I'm spoiled with 1000 thread count sheets. I was having terrible hip pain and tossing and turning. Now, when I toss I land on the arm on the other side and I cradle my back against the arm behind me. But I'm tossing less because wrapping my arms and legs around the pillow relieves some of the pressure on my hips. And the pillow is well-stuffed and very firm. It's a pregnancy life saver. Sleep is very important!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I did a lot of looking around before I settled on this product. I was so excited when it arrived. I couldn't wait for bedtime just so I could try it out. I was disappointed when I spent most of the night repositioning and manipulating this cumbersome pillow. Out of despiration, I had a co-worker modify it (remove the head and neck part). It still didn't work for me. I used it a total of 4 nights; I mean 4 sleep less nights! Just get extra pillows or a body pillow at the store. This pillow is not worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No price tag on good sleep","review":"I am 7 months pregnant and I have been sleeping on this pillow now for over a month- it has helped me to have much better nights- now I only wake up to pee every hour- and not because my hips and back are hurting. It is great that the pillow works no matter which side you lay on! I have always been a tummy sleeper- so it was hard to transition to side-sleeping- it really helps me to be comfortable without taking up too much room in the bed. My husband is not as keen on the pillow- but he also appreciates me not waking him up to move all the pillows around in teh bed like I had been. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sooooo comfortable!!!","review":"Love this pillow, it can be positoned in so many different ways, and every one of them is comfortable. It's not to full and not to flat, fits well on my bed and my husband still has plenty of room. It's easy to get in and out of and doensn't need to be flipped if I want to turn from on side to the other. the cover is removable and washes well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big, felt trapped. Huge pregnancy pillow.","review":"If you're anything like me, you like to change positions while you sleep. This pillow makes it very hard to do. I'm 5'3 100 lbs so maybe that has something to do with it, but I felt swallowed in this thing and unable to get comfortable. I'd much rather have a simple wedge sponge for under my belly, a normal body pillow for my leg and arm, and my usual pillow for my head. The product is exactly how it seems, so my review is more of a personal comfort standpoint. Plus there is absolutely no way to cuddle when this beast is in your bed. The pillow also arrived with a tear in it. I sent it back and they refunded the money. I'm now 36 weeks and still just using pillows we already have, including a body pillow. But I really wish I would've bought a wedge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pillow","review":"I was torn between a 4-5 because I love the pillow it is very comfortable, but it is also much softer than I thought it was and I am still trying to figure out how to maneuver it to help with back support. I am looking forward to the continued use of the pillow and I think it will serve me very well through my pregnancy and after the baby is born."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable","review":"I would not recommend this pillow if you don't sleep in a king sized bed with your significant other. I love it, but I couldn't use it when we visited family and slept in a full size bed. Mine stays fluffy and I don't overheat. Just move the side of the pillow that is on the outside of the bed off to the side to get in and out of bed with ease."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improved my sleep 100 percent!","review":"I am 22 weeks pregnant and this is the best pregnancy pillow ever! I was worried as it does cost A LOT of money but now that I have used it for the last month I can see that it was worth every single last penny! I used to wake up constantly because I just couldn't get comfortable and now I sleep all the way through the night! It's wonderful! I love that it has the pillow come down on both sides so you don't have to wake up and adjust the pillow at all. Me and my husband have a queen size bed so it's a little snug for him but he doesn't complain at all because he knows that I'm comfortable and that I sleep better with it. :) Don't hesitate to buy this pillow it is 100 percent amazing!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too big","review":"I'm early on in my pregnancy and already have back pain so I purchased this pillow to relieve my aching back and keep me on my side. I woke up several times during the night on my back and with the pillow almost off the bed. It is way too big for a queen size bed and I don't like that you can't use your own pillow. I tried to turn it around and put my pillow on top but one of the legs fell off the bed in the middle of the night. It also elevated my pillow too high. I'm taking this product back and getting something smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable Product- Do not buy","review":"This product looks good on picture but not at all comfortable in reality. There is no place for the other arm which is underneath your body. This caused tremendous stress and my wife now has back-ache and neck pain after using it for 1 time. The worst thing is that company would not replace it due to \\"hygiene\\" but the fact is that it has a cover which can easily be replaced and the product can still be replaced. Also, its much softer in reality than what it looks in picture, so, you won't really get that much gap between the legs. I would not recommend this product and would have to go with some different brand now!http://www.amazon.com/dp/B001A0K43M/ref=pe_175190_21431760_C1_cs_sce_3p_dp_1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it","review":"I came across this in the early months while my wife was pregnant and she didn't think it was worth it or anything like that. In the last triemster, she was feeling extrememly uncomfortable, either couldn't get comfortable or always had to move around constantly in bed. Though we had enough pillow to cover her in and out when she would switch sides she had to move all the pillow around, which was annoying her and me and would sometime be in the middle of the night. Also at that time she was wishing I got this for her.... so I surprised her and got her one a week later. She loved it! Good sleep is worth a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cofortable!","review":"I hated this, I got it at about 6 months pregnat, and thought maybe it was uncomfortable because i wasnt so big, it wasnt even comfortable at 9 months! It took up the whole bed and i have a king! I would not reccomend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No more headaches and wake up feeling refreshed.","review":"I bought this pillow as I am 16wks pregnant. I have been battling a month long migraine and my first night with the pillow, I woke up with my headache gone. It was insane. Also, I woke up feeling so refreshed and rested. I would recommend this pillow to anyone. I am so impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a kayak made of pillow","review":"It's like being cuddled by a pillow monster while you sleep. I like it. The cover is definitely scratchy, but if you wash it (I washed and dried it on the delicate cycle, then ironed out the wrinkles) it's much softer. A benefit I hadn't expected is that, when I have to sleep practically sitting up because of congestion, this pillow makes it 100x more comfortable to do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giant Elf Pants Pillows Are Awesome!!!","review":"I love this pillow! It's well worth the money and I wish that I had had it during my first pregnancy. It's made my second one so much more comfortable. I was waking up several times a night with hip pain but this seems to have done the trick. I'm about 5'10\\" and the pillow is more useful to me with the \\"feet of the elf pants\\" by my head. This also allows me to use my standard sleeping pillow. I've washed the cover once and the removal and replacement of it are relatively easy considering the size. Now that the size has been mentioned, I must say that this is large! We have a queen size bed and takes up half of the bed. My husband also complains that he can't snuggle up to his wife and has to settle for giant elf pants, LOL. He coined the term but it is pretty accurate. My only other complaint is and its a very minor one, that it is a little noisy when you move around. All in all, I'm very pleased with this purchase and I highly recommend this maternity pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent pillow","review":"I looked at a lot of different maternity pillows before deciding to order this one, and I am confident I made the right choice! It's very supportive, and easy to get in just the position you need. I love that it supports my belly and back at the same time. I don't have to pick one or the other, or use multiple pillows. I am used to 100% cotton sheets with a pretty high thread count, so some of the reviews of the cover worried me. However, I really didn't find it to be a problem. One thing to note is that it is rather large. I'm not sure how it would work if we didn't have a king size bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not returnable","review":"I recieved this pillow and was really excited about it. It had great reviews so I was hoping it would be great. I only ended up sleeping on it for about 3 hours before I got sick of it and switched back to the pillows I was using before. For me it was not right because I did not feel like it was stuffed well enough to be supportive. I like my support pillows fairly firm. And the neck portion gave me a crick in the neck. I'm not sure why it did, I think it put my neck at a wrong angle. However this was not (for me) the worst thing. Because it is sold by a seller and not by amazon it is subject to the seller's return policy and this seller will not accept any returns on any pregnancy pillows. Therefore I was stuck trying to get rid of this pillow that holds absolutely no value for me. I resold it on ebay but I am still out some money because of sellers fee and shipping. So unless you know for sure you will like this pillow I would not suggest buying it here because you cannot return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets way too hot","review":"I purchased this pillow after reading the great reviews because my lower back started to hurt in my second trimester. Personally, this pillow was way too hot to sleep with. I guess it would be ok if you live in colder climates or will be pregnant during cooler months.This pillow insulates your entire body so I ended up just overheating at night. I bought a wedge to put between my legs and put one pillow at my back and another long one in front and now I sleep much more comfortably. I could have saved myself the money on this purchase.Be careful purchasing this item too because they do not accept returns on pillows! So if you don't like it you are stuck with it or have to ebay it."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged pillow, bad customer service!","review":"i bought this pillow for my pregnant girlfriend. when we opened the box it came in, we saw that the pillow/pillowcase had about an inch-and-a-half wide hole with filling coming out. product was clearly damaged BEFORE shipping, as the plastic had no hole but had filling all over the inside. when i bought it i didnt see that this product cannot be returned due to hygiene reasons. when i tried to return it they didnt respond- not even to tell me they dont do returns. the pillow itself is very nice but not worth $70 when you have to patch it before you use it. also the box it ships in says pregnancy pillow in big letters- not the best for a surprise gift!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So excellent, my husband steals it","review":"This pillow is outstanding. It has definitely helped me sleep as I am not one who sleeps on my side easily. The U shape helps provide back support that I could not get elsewhere. It's so comfortable, that when I go to the bathroom at night, I have to kick my husband out of it. The only draw back is that it takes up room so that my husband can't cuddle as closely as we'd like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled by the reviews!","review":"The pillow is not comfortable at all, the texture, the shape, the size, etc. It gives me neck and shoulder pain! And it's way too HOT that I had to switch back to my old pillow in the middle of the night. More important is, the seller's return policy is insane and that's why I'm writing this review to let you all know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality and uncomfortable","review":"I was so disappointed when I received this product. The pillow itself is made out of cheap materials (regular pillow fill, and a scratchy mesh casing), and the pillow case is rough and plastic feeling. I did not find that it provided the support that it promised. The space at the top of the pillow is very narrow and my shoulders felt trapped in it. I tried several nights to sleep using this pillow, and each night I ended up replacing it with my regular pillows instead. Note that this company doesn't accept returns on pregnancy pillows, so make sure this is what you want before you make your purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this pillow!!!","review":"I absolutely love this pillow! I'm 26 weeks pregnant and was having the worst back pain at night. This pillow has helped so much and I am able to sleep pain free! It supports my entire body. Yes it takes up a lot of room but I don't care, I am pregnant and sleeping well is what's important. I use a my regular pillow on the top to support my head, which is fine with me because I am use to a really firm pillow for head support. Every pregnant woman needs this pillow! Some people said they didn't like the cover, that it was too rough, I have no clue what they are talking about. I think the cover is just fine. It's not as silky as some finer sheets but I think its a pretty standard pillow cover and I don't get too hot from it.

We took it out of the box and she tried it out. She did not like it, said it was not very fluffy and I noticed a lot of the filling keeps coming out if the zipper is a little bit opened. This is not well made, and the worst part is BABY AGE WILL NOT TAKE IT BACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good nights rest!","review":"I was hesitant to spend so much money on a pillow. Luckily the 5 star reviews outweighed the 1 star reviews and I took a chance on this pillow. I am SO happy I did. This pillow is wonderful. While it is large since it is a horseshoe shape I can switch sides as many times as I want and still have a comfy pillow to rest my arm and leg on. I am 5'4\\" so the length of the pillow sides is great for me. I literally had the best nights sleep the first night I used the pillow. It prevents me from rolling onto my stomach (which is very uncomfortable) and from rolling onto my back (which my ob has advised to avoid sleeping on). My ONLY complaint with this pillow is the rough cover. I put a king size pillow cover on both legs of the pillow and tossed a fleece over the top to counteract this problem. If you are not sleeping well I highly recommend purchasing this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"This is my fourth pregnancy, and at 19 weeks I was already having trouble sleeping with just a pillow between my legs. I got this to replace my Leachco All Nighter pillow, as after the first three, it had gotten kind of flat. This body pillow is HORRIBLE! It is way too soft, and the cover is very stiff. The first night I slept ok at best, but the second, I woke up in pain in my shoulders, neck, and belly. I don't know if I'm just too early on to need something like this, but there is no way I will sleep with this thing for the rest of my pregnancy. I could sleep with my Leachco at any stage. Please save your money, and your body, and search elsewhere! Try the Leachco body pillow!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps with back pain!","review":"I received the pillow today, took it out of the box, and it was exactly what I ordered. I got it into bed, and noticed that it was a bit on the \\"flatter\\" side. So I decided to cut open one of my other pillows and use the \\"stuffing\\" out of it and put into the new pillow. After adding more \\"stuffing\\" the pillow was great! Very good support, cover is easy to remove and wash. I love the fact that I can switch from side to side without having to move the entire pillow. The \\"legs\\" of the pillow are a bit on the short side though, so this is probably not the pillow for a taller person. Im 5'2 and its a perfect size for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but does not hold up.","review":"Helped me get a goodnight sleep.

The cover is rough even after washing and softener it feels like sandpaper on my skin. I used a plain old $10 body pillow for my first pregnancy but I thought this would be even better. The concept is there but needs some refinements. A cover that doesnt exfoliate your skin when you move would be a start. Secondly, Im only 5'4\\" but i feel the pillow should be longer. It just reaches between my knees but would love for support even towards ankles when really pregant. Wish I could return it. BTW NO RETURNS on this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wife Loves It","review":"My wife has been wanting to get this product for awhile now. She is currently in her 5th month of pregnancy. The item arrived in great shape and looked just like the item online. My wife was so ecstatic when she recieved it that she almost went straight to bed. She slept the entire night with no discomfort and has been having blissful sleep for the past week. The pillow is pretty large and does take up half of our queen size bed, but I dont mind as long as she is sleeping well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cozy pillow","review":"This pillow is very cozy. It's nice that you can roll over without having to take pillows with you. It also kind of nestles you in, so it's really hard to end up completely on your back, it keeps you propped up on one side if you do try to roll over in your sleep. It didn't really do a thing for the severe hip pain I've been having at night, but I think that is more of a pressure point issue. I'm tall (5'9\\") and I turned the pillow around so that the head rest is under my feet (it supports my entire leg this way), and the ends of the pillow support my arms. I found it really comfortable this way. It could have a little more stuffing, so that it doesn't compress as much in between my knees, but overall I'm happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfortable","review":"I love this pillow. It supports every thing. My only issue is it's really big so I don't sleep with it under the sheets.

This was repaired after a couple of months as it took that long to reach someone at Smooth to repair, get parts, and get someone out to fix it.In December of last year, the electronic board went out. It's now been sitting in my bedroom for nearly 4 months, waiting for a new board. The repair team at Smooth can only inform me, when I can get in touch with them, which is an issue in itself, that those boards are on backorder, and they have no idea when they will be available.

Certainly there is much about history and society that we are routinely lied to about and historical facts that are suppressed so as to protect those with the power to pull the invisible strings fettering the world. This book documents much of that, but unfortunately delves into much disinformation and in the end will leave people confused--perhaps aware of several legitimate issues they had not known about before but also distracted by a series of unfounded claims muddying the waters.

For the simple fact, that even though this man is a christian, he relies not on christian beleifs to justify or to confirm what he is saying to be the truth. But instead puts forward his evidence as one person to another, as someone who has found or discovered the source of wars, drugs, crime, the manifestation of prophecy, and the coming of a new world order that will make every country in the world, part of a federation. This book is definetly a wake up call. Even for those of us that are quite awake, whether you are a believer in humanity threatening conspiricies or not, this book will at least give access to how things really work. If knowledge was money this book would make you very rich. And this book is alot more relevant to the European union of countries than it looks!.

I thought she was opinionated and was making excuses for the inequalities we face. I am beginning to form my own opinions now. The funny part about this book is that a lot of music I listened to, the artists talked about the same stuff that is in this book and I did not realized it till now. Actually when you research many people and some artist that have gone to prison get a hold of Behold A Pale Horse and begin to analyze the truth about the media, TV and the music industry.

It completely misses the point of what it means to live impecably in the tradition of the chamans of ancient mexico. Sanchez obviosly is capitalizing on the magical attraction of the wisdom within the works of Castaneda. It does not come close to the experience of living and reading the complete series of Castaneda. If you really want the practical side of this magical world please direct yourself to the book Magical Passes of the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"MOST UNIMPRESSIVE","review":"I have read all of Castaneda's books and I am most unimpressed with this book by Sanchez. He has neither the eloquence nor the literary wit of Castaneda. Sanchez has made a career from riding on Castaneda's coattails. He does little to make it easier for the reader to assimilate Castaneda's teachings. Esmeralda Arana (The Path) does a much better job at making Castaneda's teachings accesible to your average reader. I give Sanchez two stars for a thorough reading of Castaneda's material but cannot give a high rating for this boring regurgitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Disappointment","review":"For one, who read Carlos Castaneda books couple of times and knows the contents pretty well, this book will be a great disappointment. Castaneda is (or at least, was) a cult writer in the Europe; one could not possibly live through the high school or university without running into this magic world - and Dr. Sanchez just repeat over and over again information you already know \\"by heart\\".

Still a decent read, but misleading with the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do witches give this praise?","review":"I have been a witch over 13 years and I am a big fan of Charles Leland. This book I am not. It has very little truth to it. Mr. Leland got the text from someone who wanted to abuse the craft with lies. This is a Christian book. That is put in a way to please the church. Witches do not belive in satan, though to this book. The horned god is satan himself. Aradia is said to make comments that would have gotten her killed on the spot. I NEVER threaten the goddess. Again we have many areas saying we do this. There is not enough room to go through it all. You can get free copies from websites all over if you must read it. If you do think about what it is saying and you can easy see it for what it is. A preverted vesion of what should of been sacred."},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable presentation of a primary document","review":"The controversies surrounding Leland's book aside, this edition, which includes several essays as well as side-by-side translations of the origianl texts, is an invaluable resource. No matter what its faults, \\"Aradia\\" remains an important link in the chain of neopaganism in the past century. This expanded edition will remain an important reference work for folklorists and ethnographers, and for Wiccans, Witches, and neopagans whose traditions have been heavily influenced by this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"This book by the noted scholar Charles G. Leland sheds light on the ancient and much misunderstood religion of southern Europe. With the help of a strega, an Italian witch, Leland collected and compiled stories which he would form into te Witches Gospel. Used by many witches, both practitioners of the old religion and of more modern nature based faiths, this text is a must read for anyone interested in the origins of witchcraft in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"very interesting","review":"this book might offend alot of wiccans,but remember this book is about italian witchcraft not wicca. i dont recommend doing all spells in this book,especially the ones that threatens diana if she doesnt give you what you want. this book has alot of christian elements. i think the poetry in this book is beautiful. this book is an important read for anyone that studies or practices witchcraft. this book is very questionable,but still a very interesting read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"The Gospel of witches is something to truly read. However, its complex understandings and its lack of the image of Aradia failed through out the book. Eventhough, there were the rituals that were very interesting, because, you can see how the Charge of the Goddess was formed..that was really interesting to see. Anyhow, this book was very good, please remember that the book does drag and has more \\"ritual sense\\" than what the book was suppose to do...to tell you what Aradia was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing mixture","review":"Although this is clearly a forerunner of modern Wiccan tradition, it hardly deserves to be. The proto-\\"Charge\\" is poetic, and here and there an idea warrants exploration, but in the main this is highly negative and most Wiccans who believe in the 3-fold law should avoid it. It promotes killing all \\"masters\\" (rich people), poisoning, and generally getting your way at the expense of others. Finally, and most ironic to me, is the fact that its \\"spells\\" have the *nerve* to actually THREATEN the Goddess Diana if she doesn't help you with your spells! Highly questionable stuff here. Great historical data, but not a tradition I would want to be associated with, even though I have Italian ancestry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Editing","review":"I was aware from a previous rating that the book had some editing problems, but this book has a ridiculous amount of editing problems.

Is the story well-written? I can't tell you because as a copyeditor, the 100+ mistakes I counted trying to read the book totally distracted me.

How is it that the main character can be a schoolboy punk and bad ass office bully all at once? The time line skips around here and there and it's as if the author forgets that he has already mentioned certain details so he repeats them. All in all I was very disappointed in this read.

I did read the whole book in an effort to locate the CHRISTIAN turning point. It never came. I was highly disappointed in the author. He chose a very misleading title that only appeared as the ending phrase of the entire book. Church and God only came up in the whole book for about three paragraphs to prepare for a shotgun wedding in which the author added curse words to that. I was disappointed in all the lewd sexual content. I understand that reading should be diverse...but pick an appropriate title for the content of what we will be reading.

This book is allows you to see what went on behind the scenes of the World Trade Center, the problems it had and the problems it caused.

It's also much better than the SB-400 for the reasons below.Three things it has from the SB-400: Power, full manual mode, and tilt AND swivel for bouncing. You can also use the SB-600 off camera with optical triggers, ebay triggers, pocket wizards, sync cables, and any sort of other trigger as long as you adapt it to the hotshoe.Three main things it's missing from the SB-800: SU4 optical trigger isn't built in, commander mode(doesn't matter on some bodies), and a PC/Sync port.All of these can be worked around in one way or another, it really depends what you are doing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for all Nikon SLRs","review":"I bought this several years ago for my D50.

I have used both the SB-600 and the SB-800 at work (I am a wedding photographer) but had not used the Phoenix, and after reading many reviews, decided to just spend the extra money on the SB-600. Boy, was I glad! The SB-600 is extremely easy to use, it delivers the perfect results, and it has a nice solid body. I am very happy with my Flash so far, and you know the funny thing?

I have feeling that I may have been sent a used flash that someone else maybe returned since it was messed up even though I ordered a new one. So I guess this could be more of a customer service complaint than anything (since they wont do anything about it but said they could give me refund of 50% - 80% on what I paid.

It only took me about 15 minutes with the manual to get the wireless control function working.

It lacks a few features the SB800 has, but simply as a flash in a Nikon setup, you can't go wrong. I use them as slaves and can control them from either my D300 or my SB800.

I spent lots of time looking for the right camera (Nikon D80, awesome, btw) thanks to my brother-in-laws help. I mostly take outdoor shots, and really didn't think a flash would be my next addition. Until I was taking some indoor shots of my kids. So, I started to look for a flash. Again, my brother-in-law to the rescue. He pointed me towards this flash, and now I'm hook. The many years away from real photography has given me a chance to be impressed by all the new tech, and this flash is a great example. Between my computerized camera, the fancy lenses, and this really smart flash, I can't take a bad picture. My first picture was just a snap of my home office and I was so impressed that I haven't stopped taking indoor shots.I could go on and on about this flash, but the bottom line is that this thing cannot be beat. It's a great price for an amazing piece of equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a learning curve, but superb results.","review":"I upgraded to this flash from an SB-400. I had to read the manual a bit, but once I did, I was able to appreciate the advantages of it.I didn't use it as a remote slave yet (only for testing) but the additional range and power allows me to use it in certain situations were the SB-400 wasn't powerful enough. The red assist focus lamps are a lot lets intrusive than the white one on the camera (the flash is already intrusive enough)For 80% of my needs, the SB-400 was enough. But the extra versatility of this one was worth the upgrade for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good flash","review":"I purchased this flash mainly to take picture of my new born child. Due to having a older D50 I am unable to use all of the functions that come included with the flash. But the flash seems to be sturdy and allows me to take wonderfully lit pictures.

This light is great and definitely puts off enough flash to share around! I can't complain about this.

As the entry-level \\"slave\\" flash, it does great. It's small enough to travel well, creates the right light with proper adjustments, but eats the hell out of batteries. If you have the MD-10 grip, no problem; otherwise carry spares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever, cant ask for more","review":"I am a professional photographer who shoots 250 homes a year for the MLS service. I bracket those shots and do real virtual tours, meaning the flash does about 500 exposures per home. My last 2 SB600 flashes worked flawlessly for three years. Now they are replaced by the more expensive 800. No Problem. When it comes to working first shot till last, Nikon serves me well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A word of Warning for CoolPix owners","review":"I bought this for use with my CoolPix 5000 camera because Nikon's tech support had recomended it. They said it would improve my indoor shots (because the CP 5000 has a terrible flash built-in), but instead it overloads the shots and they come out mostly white. I read the manual carefully and it looks like the reason is that this flash is built to automatically or manually focus the light for a 14mm to 70mm lense and the CP 5000 has a 7.2mm lense. I subsequently purchased a Nikon D70s camera (1,000,000 times better camera) and this flash is great for extremely dark shots on that camera (though the built-in flash is perfect for fill so this is really only for night shots and shots in darkness where I want to get something far away). If you own a CoolPix camera, consider buying a used flash that isn't as powerfull. If you own a D70s and want superior night photography, this is the best flash in the world (good thing I ended up in the latter end of the spectrum)."},{"rating":"1","title":"NIKON CAMERA SB FLASHES","review":"I HAVE READ MANY REVIEWS ABOUT ALL THESE SB FLASH ATTACHMENTS.

After about six months of ownership, the display on the back of the flash began flashing rather than holding a steady view. I have tried resetting it, changing the batteries, etc. but it still does it. It does not seem to affect the flash but its very annoying, especially since no one seems to know how to fix it.

Not great for a device that cost me $200+ and lasted a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to use but poor quality.","review":"I bought the SB600 to go with my D80, primarily because of its ease of use but also because of Nikon's reputation for quality. Most of my pictures are taken outside, so I se a flash rarely. This particular flash has been used no more than 40 times and exclusively with my D80. It has never goten wet and was never dropped. It quite suddenly stopped workjng. One day it worked fine the next day it was as dead as if it contained no batteries. Of course the warranty has expired and Nikon wants $117.00 to repair. Maybe I got a lemon, but I am not the only person who has written in concerning the subpar quaility of the SB 600 This leads to my resolve to avoid Nikon products in the future. If anyone out there is in the market for a flash, you should think twice about buying the this on and most certainly stay away from a used one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great flash for a great camera at a great price!","review":"I researched both the 600 & 800 models and was a bit torn between the two.

Must have if you shoot indoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon SB-600 Speedlight","review":"The Nikon SB-600 Speedlight is the best flash unit that I have ever owned! I own a Nikon F-3HP and Nikon 8008S film cameras that at the time had the best flash units, but the SB-600 is much better.The integrated flash unit on my Nikon D-50 works for most snapshots, but with the SB-600, I have more control to produce great photographs! If you need balanced fill-in lighting, more camera to subject distance or broader area of coverage get the SB-600. It automatically powers on when you need to use a flash. I found it was ready to go right after I attached it to my camera.The only limitation I have found is taking successive photographs. If you look at the specifications for the SB-600 and SB-800, you'll see that one of the differences is not having a fast recycling to take successive photographs. Most of the time, we don't need to get 3 or 4 sequencial shots. If you do, get the SB-800. But for all that you need now, start with the SB-600 and get the SB-800 later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really, really easy to use","review":"It's pretty intimidating to read various websites on all the things you can do with this flash. I was really happy to unpack the box and find a simple guide with sample photos that described the effect (slow sync, rear-curtain sync, etc) and how to do it with the flash. There's also more detailed instructions of course.I'm using it with a Nikon D70, and the improvement of both my indoor and outdoor photos is amazing. If I had to do it again, I'd get this before getting any new lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"This flash unit is great.","review":"I bought this flash for use on my Nikon D200 and it works better than I had hoped. You can fine tune it for your own personal liking and it has more options than I am currently smart enough to use. But don't worry, you don't have to be a super camera geek to get great results right off the bat. This thing has great \\"reach\\" as it actually zooms right along with your lens to pinpoint your subject. It's just audible enough to let you know it's doing that. I'm definitely glad I bought this thing. MUCH better than the small pop-up flash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whoa... sure makes a difference than the camera flash!","review":"I bought this flash few days ago and have been using it on my D90 with Tamron 18-270 and Nikon 18-200 lens.

I'm definitely keeping it. I also like that we can use AA batteries if needed in an emergency. I'm running them off eneloops right now. I took some great portraits of my daughter bouncing the flash off the ceiling and I'm impressed!

Unfortunately, this live recording does nothing to change my initial impression. The Barenboim-Curzon partnership is a poor one, and there appears to be no clear common conception with regards to performing Mozart. This is a case where opposites fail to attract. The B-flat concerto is no less uninspiring. The tempo is too slow to bring out Mozart's charm and playfulness, but is also too slow to convey depth or poetic fantasy. This is stuffy Mozart, which gives academic interpretations a poor reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do justice to the performers or composer","review":"This CD was a terrible disappointment.

They had been drinking a lot, they were driving home and they got in a collision. This book is very well-written, dropping indications along the way to help solve the mystery. Todd Strasser has once again written another great novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book you will never forget!","review":"The Accident so far is taking place in a school and at Matt an Chris's house. Most of these settings are at the begging at the book. The charicters in this book are Chris who is a drugie, Matt who is a smart intelligent guy, Karen who is Matt's girlfriend, Jason and Bobby who are two of Matt's friends, Mrs.Walsh is Chris's mother, and Mrs Thompson who is Matt's mother. The plot of this book is that a whold bunch of kids are getting excited about going on a ski trip but soon they will be wishing it was all a dream! I think this book was a very good book, and I would encourage people to read it. Parts of this book would help kinds understand to not drink and drive, and they would discover the consiquences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have been an 'Accident' that this book was created","review":"The stupid story is about a teenager whose four friends are killed in an accdient caused by drunk driving and there is mystery for the teenager to solve about waht realy happened. Every character in this book is STUPID or ARRIGANT the ending of the book suggests its OK to denie the truth for goo reputation. The main character teenager is stupid and stubern for not letting go and being obsessive. His girlfriend is stubern for not being supportive. The parents of one of the victims of the accident are very sleasy. THIS IS PROBALY THE WORST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ! I hope people are reading this review so that if they want to read a book that is totaly evil and ignorant. This book has stuff in it that wouldn't be appropriate at all in real life. This book is straight trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Insight","review":"This book was a real disappointment. It barely skims the surface on Freddie Mercury's life, and offers no insight into upbringing, family life, or the influence his Persian heritage had on his development. Freestone gambles on the assumption that the readers will already be well versed on the biographical history of Mercury, which isn't so in my case. I'm left with more questions than answers, and would have appreciated more discussion of his pre-Queen years, the relationships between band members, love interests, and how he dealt with his illness. Information wise this title will leave all but die hard fans out in the cold."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly done and boringly so","review":"essentially i thought it .... It appeared more of a diary or even a rehash of a day planner from the writer. i was so disgusted at midpoint that i did not even finish the book and the only reason i read as far as i did was that i kept holding hope that it would improve. It did not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I COULD NOT GIVE THIS BOOK AWAY","review":"I do not care how you feel about Freddie or people who lived his lifestyle. THE BOOK IS TERRIBLE AND THE PICTURES ARE A JOKE. I could not even give this book away to the public library!You can read better and more accurate material for free online. There are many fansites that have reproductions of interviews conducted with Freddie and the other Queen members. A year or so ago, a trade publication dedicated the entire magazine to Queen and I learn new information.Take my advice and search the web for information and photographs, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"1","title":"another fable bites the dust....yeah yeah","review":"Is this the real life?I think Pheobes writting in fantasy,is my best accolade for this undesireable memoir.Taken as a costume designer by Freddie ,Mr Freestone accounts for very little in this memoir----apart from his memory may not serve him well these days.As to account as a memoir ,I think Pheobe should recite some more opera to fullfill the meaning of memoir. With little regard to scandal or the need of more fact in the late Mercury,I regard this title .....CASHING IN ON A DUE,THAT OBVIOUSLY Mr Freestone thiks he deserves??????.Strange but true what the millions of fans world wide need is?????not this title but an accurate account of Mercurys days as deplicted by his lover Jim Hutton(MERCURY&ME).Surely Mr Freestone could have accounted for missed years ?instead of grinding on what has been. Tomorrows fish & chips is what i accept will end as this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Intimate and UNabriged Memoir","review":"This book could easily have been condensed to 1/4 of the pages. Each event or memory written about goes on and on, and on... - impatient readers beware.While the author does a great job of providing every little detail, it is amazing to believe that he could remember everything in this much living colour, and doubtful that at the time he carried around a notebook to record everything happening around him.Generally the writing is poor to midland at best and it is obvious the author is not a professional writer. The book also could have been organised a bit better, for it is not chronological, nor are chapter headings or topics given.The reader will sense that the author wrote this book out of memory for his friend, Freddie Mercury, rather than out of primary interest in the royalties. Overall, this book is for only the most fanatical of Queen fans and for those supremely interested in Freddie Mercury."},{"rating":"1","title":"Start with a different book","review":"I was fascinated by some video performances so I wanted to find out more about Mercury. Read some good reviews of this book about it not being sensationalistic & a hack job. Unfortunately for me it didn't give me the kind of info that I was looking for. Definitely a book for someone who has more of a background in Mercury's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous writing","review":"I found this unreadable. The writing was horrendous, as if Freestone dictated it into an audio recorder and someone transcribed it. He goes off on tangents and writes about only a small portion of Mercury's life. What he does write about is mostly his own life inside Queen. I gave up after Chapter 1. All I could do, at that point, was skim it trying to find some coherent sentences. I failed in that regard and went on to another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sum of their parts","review":"I'm a queen fan, the first 4 or 5 albums I felt were quite groundbreaking and Mercury was a pivotal influence. However this book didn't give me any insight into who this person was, it felt like Freddie lived a life of the perennial teenager with no real depth of emotion or intelligence which I'm sure was far from the truth.The details of what curtains he liked or the fact he loved old movies was dull, no real mention was made of how he worked or a hint of any belief structure made this a disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't think I can get through this book.","review":"I have read probably half of this book, and I'm having a hard time getting through it. It's very poorly written and even boring in parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"It's rare that I never finish a book, but this is one of those cases. The book is more about the author than Mercury . . . I did this and I did that, and I got the hair brushes for the band members. It's (poorly) written dialy-planner style - no insight into Mercury's emotions, feelings or thoughts. I could not finish this book. Simply terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good picture of life with Freddie","review":"Peter Freestone holds Freddie in high regard and I he gives us an idea of Freddie's personality brilliant, magnetic, good natured, a little bad but human just like all of us. He tells of Freddie enjoying catalogs and auctions shopping for artwork and things which he loved to be surrounded with in his beautiful Kensington estate. I can only imagine what Freddie would have been capable of spending if he had the internet back then, lol. I believe any Freddie Mercury fan would thoroughly enjoy this book, I did. Peter Freestone was left plenty from Freddie and I don't think he needed the money, I believe he just wanted to share what life was like and his experiences with someone he cared for dearly. It definitely was a wild ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I enjoyed reading the life of Freddie Mercury on the stage and in his personal life. He was very generous to those who were close to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is one of the most one sided, self serving books I have every read. It was also extremely boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"We used our unit for about two months in our gameroom before the power supply/fan gave up the ghost. It did get used frequently by our two children and their friends but was never left on for more than one or two hours at a time. Unfortunately, even that level of usage was too much for the unit to handle.We found out quickly that the unit functioned more as a cooler and that drinks needed to be chilled prior to being placed in the machine. Now that my husband has taken out the non-functioning power supply, we just use it as a standard cooler with a novelty twist. I wish that I had read the previous review before my handyman husband threw out the old cord because he would have been able to do the modifications easily.I would certainly never recommend that anyone purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I purchased this item as a gift for my 13 year old because of it's nostalgic appeal. It was really cute, but that's about the only good thing that I can say. It did a really poor job of keeping the cans in place, they frequently rolled out the back and down through the dispenser. The biggest disappointment was that it only lasted about two months. The cooling device quit, rendering the unit useless. It was definitely a bad choice and I would have been better off purchasing a small refrigerator."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Entertainment Purposes....","review":"The author, Courtney Brown, tells us he has proof that he is going to share with the reader but never provides it. There is no independent proof given in this account except his \\"monitor\\". I can only conclude that this is either entirely fiction or mostly fiction and it should be viewed that way. I don't doubt that some elements of remote viewing work since psychics have been around for centuries, and more recently have had success with law enforcement, but this book goes way off the deep end. Make no mistake, this book is fiction. If Mr. Brown could do what he claims he can, he'd due it in a public forum like television away from his followers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, unscientific, uncorroborated","review":"I've checked this book out of the library twice, the second time to be certain my first impressions were supported by a second perspective: as someone who is interested in extra-normal experiences I want to believe the story this book is pushing, as someone who respects science and RATIONAL free thinking I cannot. The claims made are unsubstantiated by footnotes or any other kind of research worthy information, with constant reminders scattered through the first chapters that the process Professor Brown went through to indoctrinate himself in the belief system which resulted in this book is a very costly and time consuming one which, presumably, the average reader will not have the resources to undertake. Prof. Brown's constant references to \\"Star Trek\\" are very trying, I might add."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great collection of 101 actual ways to win.","review":"You get a great collection of 101 different systems/methods to win at craps. The book is divided into ten chapters like Place, Buy & Lay, Tournaments, Prop bets, Pass/Come, etc and each of these has 5-10 different systems written specially for that kind of bet. There is also a lot of info on dice control. At the end there is a good glossary, resources section, index and a coupon section. You can find several good systems on just about any part of the craps game in this book. They aren't rated or anything so we get to pick and choose the ones we like the best. I like don't betting and there lots of those. I don't think everyone will like everything in this book but you are bound to get your money's worth, even you just get 4 or 5 good money making systems from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Craps Craps","review":"Not worth the effort of reading. A lot of suggested approaches, but very confusing. Requires re-reading to grasp suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"littlewalks, bighit","review":"My 18 month old daughter loves this DVD! It's not often that I can get her to sit still for 30 minutes, but when this is on, she doesn't move. the other nice thing about this video is that it's also adult-friendly. Great music, great footage, no annoying characters that sing. A refreshing break from the usual children's video. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love this video....","review":"I went to visit my friend in Washington. She has a two year old daughter with a discerning video habit. I brought her this video (being from New York). We put it in the player and she was captivated. The images of New York against the wonderful mix of music was enchanting...(we were also drawn in!)If you want your child to watch something fun and fascinating, without the music driving you crazy. This is the video. I'm going to give it to all my friends with kids!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of its kind","review":"The H.W. is the only decent pad saver out there. It is soft, fluffy and absorbent, while the others are more like stiff pieces of nylon shag carpet, repelling moisture rather than sucking it up.The H.W. savers cost more and are harder to find, but worth the trouble and expense ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to this...","review":"...probably, the best Israel Vibes album.

It helped me take control of how I feel and how I express my feeling. If you get angry or depressed, these these techniques will help."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to control anger before it controls you","review":"This book has a great therapy meathod called Rational Emotive Behavior Training that helps you figure out where your anger comes from and how to change your response. THIS IS A VERY EFFECTIVE BOOK AND I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE WITH AN ANGER PROBLEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only wanted the box","review":"The truth is that I only bought this for the collector's box. I already own the series and wanted to box to it, and for $5 I couldn't pass it up. The series itself is something i probably wouldn't recommend to anyone because the plot itself doesn't make much sense. Things happen with no meaning at all, and all it would do is confuse you if you were expecting some sort of logic to it. If you ignore all of that and take things at face value I believe you will enjoy it much more. I do love watching this series just because of how much it doesn't make sense and I enjoy watching it every time.Just beware that this series is not for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very entertaining for 2 year-olds.","review":"Hardly any talking and not very entertaining for 2 year-old kids. This is more of a collectors DVD as compared to Elmo, Barney, etc., this is boring. Too bad - they do love Mickey Mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Plutopia\\" wildly inappropriate for any child","review":"We purchased several of the Cartoon Classic Favorites DVD series last month after our 2-year-old daughter met Mickey and others at Disneyland. Firstly, these DVDs don't play on our older player; only on the newer model. Frustrating.Secondly, yes, these are the cartoons we all watched when growing up, but parents of small children please supervise your child's watching. There is a lot more needless violence than you may expect; in particular, \\"Plutopia\\" offers a disturbing sequence of cat begging for punishment, pleading \\"Bite me, PLEASE\\" and then pulling out rifle to shoot itself in head. Do you really want your children seeing this? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not for me","review":"Loved the look of the shoes and great service, but shoe just didnt fit my foot.

I had this styler for three months and it overheated three times. I have medium hair and also used a regular blow dryer before I used this styler to lessen its strain. Yesterday, It started its \\"death rattle\\" and smelled like it was burning so I turned it off and it would not come back on even after it had cooled down. I did NOT overwork this styler and it was not abused. SAVE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"This hot air brush is not even worth 1 star. It is far from tangle free. If you want to keep your hair, don't buy this piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor quality","review":"I've had this dryer for almost a year now, and like the styists who also own it, I find it temperamental. It does a great job while it's working, but the thermostat gets progressively buggier after about three months. If you turn the dryer off, you'll have to wait for it to cool completely before it will turn back on. Now, it turns off while I'm in the middle of doing my hair. The stylists have three or four of these so they can alternate working with one while the other(s) cool off - as I said, when they work, they're terrific. I'm going to replace mine with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"still waiting for refund or replacement! item was defective--cap did not fit so barrel broke when i attempted to get cap on. returned the product but have not had any response from vendor. paid them the courtesy of not writing review until giving them sufficient time to remedy situation--over 2 mths later no word. vendor was \\"your best hair day\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised.","review":"It did not rotate automatically.

So, I recommend the book for the players who want to improve their understanding on the openings, especially Scilian and French defence. I am a 2000 rated player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book contains flawed analysis (on the M?ller Attack and others) which is really not acceptable. The book gives a glimpse of several major openings (to its credit) but stops its analysis arbitrarily and does not really emphasise the fundamental underlying principles which it claims to do.

The government's lawyers argued...\\"These are true taxes,\\" they stated, \\"their purpose simply being to raise revenue.... The proceeds are paid into the Treasury as internal revenue collections, available for the general support of the government.\\"They HAD to take that position, to keep the tax from being struck down on constitutional grounds.The court ruled in favor of the government. In the summary, the court stated...\\"The proceeds of both taxes (SS and unemployment) are to be paid into the Treasury like internal-revenue taxes generally, and are not earmarked in any way.\\"There is not, and never has been a true SS trust fund or \\"retirement account\\" to loot.

Sure, the new ones come with a wardrobe of clothes - which is nice - but they also have huge heads and horsey faces. This is the only first-issue set (that I know of) that includes extra wardrobe pieces. It's also nice to have the carrying case, which can fit up to 5 mini-Barbies. This was the only set that I'm aware of in which you could get the Clara doll. The other sets also came with furniture and fun party sets, and a few had animal friends from the movies. The only problem with them is that their knees don't bend, and some people might think permanent shoes are also a drawback - I don't.

Terrorism is a tactic of war, not an organization or a person. Those who are against war are by definition against terrorism. The idea that those who are anti-war are for terrorism is as foolish as the idea that Iraq had a role in the massacre on 9/11/01.If you wish to take a role in the world, you will be better equipped if you actually know something of it first.

There is too much open area between the two halves of the device. This is especially a problem when squeezing thin-skinned Valencia oranges.

Second time I tried with some blood oranges which are smaller in size. After it squeezed I noticed that the orange still had a lot more juice left.

While I agree there is pulp and a very small amount of juice left, this is a hand squeezer and not a juicer.

The movie only tells a small distorted version of what is Patch Adams. Patch has some unconventional ideas about medicine. These ideas have led to a movement to change health care for the better. Patch has dedicated his life toward helping the less fortunate and still lives on this creed.The one story in this book which sticks out in my mind is the story of the man with arthritis. To summarize, Patch discovered that the man did not feel the pain of his arthritis while watching the sunset. The man really enjoyed watching the sunset and pleasure from this event helps him forget his pain. Thinking of something pleasurable or performing a pleasurable act helps us forget pain. As Patch Adams himself said, The best medicince is not to treat the illness, but to treat the patient.\\"Thanks for your inspiration Patch!

Humor, fun, magic tricks, sunsets, animals, or whatever is needed to make a person feel better and forget about his/her pain; is his philosophy.The book describes the road Patch has taken to fullfill his dream, and the goals he has fixed for himself and his team. Working to give free, highest quality medicine is not an easy job. Still Patch smiles with his red nose, clownish hair, and funny clothes.

As another reviewer noted, the outlet hose is kinked at the junction with the bag, looks like at manufacturing, they just folded the hose over to make the 90 degree angle, and decided to live with the kink. Good news is that is seems able to handle it, so I don't expect it to fail, but a little heat and a slightly better manufacturing process could have avoided that, but probably would have raised the price. Also the clocking on the outlet hose is not as pictured, mine runs down and to the right, but they were smart enough to put a velcro loop on both sides, presumably to accommodate that, but again there seems no consistency in manufacturing. Otherwise it works great, has a thermometer on the back of it, when the outlet is closed it doesn't leak, I am very pleased with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm shower on a cool nite on Nicaragua","review":"How simple!

It is a review of Visual Basic which is pointless if you know VB, and way too short to be useful if you don't know VB. If you want a book to supplement other books on ActiveX, this is an okay choice. But, I would not reccomend it as a primary source to learn ActiveX."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hingecrafter Router Bit set Whiteside","review":"These bits are very thick carbide backed by extra heavy steel.

Despite the enormous differences in their culture such as the lack of education and technology, Kath March enables us to recognize that we all belong to the same family of flesh and experiences that bring laughter and tears, joy and sorrow.

This is the first solo album by Paul Heaton, the main singer/songwriter from TBS. Most of these songs could pass for TBS songs. This is a great pop album. It's wonderfully produced, with a thick sound, layered with a vairety of instrumentation. The melodies are catchy of course, and after a few listens they become addictive. The lyrics are meaty, though you'll probably have to consult the lyric sheet to understand what he's saying a lot of the time. The mood of the lyrics is typical TBS - cynical, clever and fun. The first single, \\"Mitch,\\" is one of the weaker songs on th album. The best tracks are The Perfect Couple, Man's World, and Poems ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Boy aka Cracking Good Album","review":"Paul Heaton of the Beautiful South has released a fantastic solo album. Every song is catchy as all get out. Within one listen you'll be singing along. And lyrically, he is unmatched.

Each song has something to recommend it, whether it's a catchy backing vocal. a subilme chorus, or just a funny lyric. The only thing I dislike is the female singer of Perfect Couple whos e voice warbles too much for my liking. But I quickly get past that when they start singing \\"jump Around\\" at the end.

If a microphone is made for PS2, it should work with all PS2 karaoke games, should it not? I'm sure I'm not the only one to have a problem with this blatent ripping off of customers.

Although possibly not as good as Cracked Rear View, this CD is as good if not better than thier previous two (FWJ & MC). \\"Fine Line\\" harkens back to the Hootie of old with a bit of a country feel, while \\"Hey, Hey, What can I do\\" (a Zepplin cover) is simply awesome. Darius Rucker voice is unbelievable in \\"Renaissance Eyes\\" and \\"Use Me\\". One minor letdown for me was \\"Gravity of the Situation\\", which was much more balanced on \\"MTV Unplugged\\". Nanci Griffith's vocals seem to almost drown out Darius' on the studio version. I highly recommend this to any fan of music, period.

Their debut album, which flew off the shelves and earned them a grammy as well as a platinum record, earned a perfect 5-stars in my book. This surpasses Musical Chairs for the second-place spot on my shelf. Fairweather Johnson, which was a bit disappointing for a sophomore album, would take a distant 4th. Simply put: This one's better than both Musical Chairs and Fairweather Johnson, but it will take Thriller-like creativity to surpass the success of Cracked Rear View. Die-hard fans should buy this, but people on the borderline NEED to hear this album.

The only reason this rating isn't 5 stars is because they didn't record my favorite 2 cover songs they used to do (maybe it's a copyright thing) --> \\"Mustang Sally\\" and \\"Love the One You're With.\\" But I can't complain too much - this whole album is a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hootie!

The main spy, Philby, an important man in British intelligence, had found refuge in the URSS in 1963. Blunt was only found out by the public in 1977. In the movie, he is shown at the peak of his glory: he was in charge of the Queen's paintings when his treason became public knowledge. James Fox[...] gives a powerful image of Blunt, caught in the limelight. The director John Schlesinger [...] plays on comparisons between the nature of fraud (treason vs fake paintings) and the nature of cancer (Blunt is dying from a cancer which is found out while he is found out as a traitor). The movie is both artistic(with alternance of strongly symbolic images) and spellbounding. The Queen (Prunella Scales) is ten times more realistic and interesting[...].This little gem is on my list of 10 best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly acted account of the biggest spy scandal","review":"Brilliant adaptation of Anthony Blunts secret life.A mesmorising account of intrigue and scandal at the top end of British society.James Fox gives a masterly performance as the Fourth Man in the Philby, Burgess and McLean Soviet spy ring that outfoxed the security services of Britain and caused untold damage to Britain and America.This is worth watching for any student of modern history.Watch out for an outstanding performance from Prunella Scales as the Queen.................SUPERB.."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Question of Attribution","review":"very disappointed.

GHC made Magnalite up until 1995 when they sold the name Magnalite and the plant. The fourth piece I own was made in Ohio after 1995 by another company. Though it looks similiar in design, it is measurably half the thickness and weight of my mother's pieces. There is also another company that is using the name Magnalite that is making them in China.

You know, even if somebody had done something ridiculous like turn \\"Say it Ain't So\\" into a rap song, it might've been fun to listen to. But this album presents nothing interesting. All that the bands try to do is imitate Weezer, and nothing comes close to the original. They don't put a new spin on anything, so what's the point? Go buy the Blue album and Pinkerton.

That worked, so I returned the refurbished printer to Canon.I print/scan infrequently (fewer than 5 pages/week). With almost every use, however, the printer had a low ink cartridge, so I continued to use my very old HP Deskjet 730C for most printing jobs and the MP800 for scanning/copying only. All to no avail: the MP800 has again returned to the blinking Error 6800.

Prints came out with very bright and pleasant quality. They really look as good as ones from photo lab with advantage we can crop ,edit and adjust what we want before printing. Because resolution is very good, we are combining 2 pictures in one 4x6 with good results.Had to print couple of prints first to get feel of adjustments needed to intensity and saturation so we could get best results. usign canon paper. the glossy plus is fine enough.Scanner was good and performed well scanning negatives at 2400 dpi.

With the cost of ink fairly expensive, it forces u to be real judicial about what u do print.Photo-print quality is kick-ass, btw... ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"At first I was very pleased with the product.

The prints are beautiful, and the speed quite good as well. However, I felt compelled to write a review tonight because of the constant error messages that pop up saying that there are too many ink cartridges of \\"X\\" color installed. It happens now between every print job, forcing me to open the printer, pull out and re-install one to three of the tanks, and then print my document. There is something wrong with this thing, and I don't appear to be the first experiencing it. Figures... I wait eight years to replace my printer, and end up with one that malfunctions! I will attempt to return this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limited Life","review":"Until today, I would have given this 5 stars. But today, just a week after the warranty expired, I turned the printer on and it was totally fried. (It's powered through an APC UPS.) The window showed Chinese characters, the computer didn't recognize it and called it unknown new hardware and the physical ink cartridge mechanism is locked up inside. Now I know I could have bought an extended warranty and all that, and Canon has no legal obligations to fix this, but I doubt that any of us really considers it acceptable for a product to only last through it's warranty and then die. So I'm giving this a single star because, as great a printer as it was, it should have lasted longer. And just to pour salt in the wound, this same printer costs $100 more today than it did when I bought it a year ago when it was the new model. Heck, it even costs more than its successor, the new and improved MP810. That's harsh, man."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake","review":"Do not buy this product. I called Canon 3 times totalling 2 hours trying to get the printer to just print test patterns. Failed each time. The black ink cartridge signaled it was out of ink(it was bran new).

I sent that back too.I've had a Canon printer for 4 years and it works fine. My camera is a Canon too.

It's filled with wonderful trails -- for hiking, biking, or running -- along coastlines, through tree-lined canyons, in redwood forests and more.This book is a true guide -- informative, easy-to-use, very well organized. I highly recommend it, along with all the other Top Trails books in the series: Los Angeles, Lake Tahoe and Yellowstone -- And not just because the books will guide you on whichever trails you decide to take, but because they will inspire you to get out of the city and explore all the natural, scenic beauty of the great outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"The life of an old man, in it's simplest form..observance.","review":"Frank Turner Hollon has created a book full of rich and vivid characters. He introduces each at just the right moment. From his dying grandmother to his dying best friend, each has a deep and profound affect on both the old man and the reader. Just as in life, Mr. Hollon takes us through a variety of emotions, including complacency.This is neither a happy book nor a sad book. It is simply a book about life. And maybe a little too lifelike. It forces the reader to think about the part of life that most of us don't want to think about at all. The part that is near the end.The Pains of April is very well written and holds the readers attention through to the end. Both it's humorous and sad situations left me with the feeling that I had been, or could imagine myself being, in just that type of situation. Excellent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read...","review":"It's my own fault that I fell for the publicist's hype for this book. Unfortunately, it was a pain to read but being a \\"novella\\" at least the agony was short-lived. The Pains of April lacks depth, the characters are wooden and the writing is simply not there. I honestly believe this effort was rushed to print way before its time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful experience!","review":"This is a great book for anyone who a) can't stand to read for more than a couple hours, or b) has avoided literature during the course of their life. It weighs in under 100 pages, the characters are generic facades, the chapters are short for the attention-impaired, and no big words are used.Unbearable cliches are employed from the very first page as the author is clearly out of his league in trying to portray the mindset and experiences of a character supposedly more than 50 years his senior when he wrote the book. I highly doubt the \\"pains\\" are those of an 86 year-old man, but rather those of an author who clearly has not found his place and meaning in his own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pains of April is a must-read","review":"The Pains of April is a book that originally someone loaned to me. It is the single book that has completely changed my life. Frank Turner Hollon is able to write in such a poetic and introspective way that anyone who enjoys examining life situations, trying to piece together what is true from what isn't, wanting to learn from every little thing, no matter how insignificant will love this book. I have purchased about 6 copies of this book so far, all gifts to people. Not one hasn't adored it upon reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Frank Turner Hollon's short novel left much to be desired. The only redeeming quality that I myself found was that it was a quick, short read that could hold your attention enough to be distracting. Though an interesting subject, I felt that it was lacking and empty. The writing seemed to show a scarcity of creativity and hardly showed depth. It seemed that a 26 year old wrote it--and indeed, a 26 year old did write it.The Pains of April should only be read if no other reading material is available at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated, but detailed","review":"While this book has a 1993 publication date, it was originally written in 1960 and little (if any) changed. The book offers a good discussion of gnosticism and of the relationship between the canonical gospels and the Gospel of Thomas. It also benefits from a discussion of each of the sayings, and relates the Thomas sayings to the existing Gospel sayings. What the book lacks is any attempt at analysing the sayings to create a coherent picture of Jesus, or at least, the Jesus whom the gnostics chose to remember. The authors flatly say that such an analysis is not warranted, but, in my humble opinion, I beg to differ. Also the book rarely discusses other gnostic gospels, and when it does so, it does it relatively superficially. Nonetheless, compared to other Gospels of Thomas, this version is better than average."},{"rating":"1","title":"You need small lemons... and big, strong hands!","review":"This will only juice small to med. sized lemons. Lemons with a larger circumference will overlap the sides when cut in half. It is also pretty tough for me to squeeze without really hurting my hands. The cut side of the lemon goes down and the curved part presses the lemon on the top until it collapses and turns inside out. That takes a lot of force, with the handles a good 5-6 inches apart.

It will save you time. Period. And no more pesky seeds to deal with. Easy to clean and does it's job. Really gets the juice out of the lemon with one good squeeze and keeps most of the seeds out (occasionally a single seed does get through the little holes but that's so much easier to pull out then 30 seeds from six lemons).I love it, I go crazy now when I'm at a friend's and have to squeeze lemons by hand and deseed them by hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective and cheap","review":"I've been squeezing lemons for years with traditional coned squeezers, and I never thought I would possibly be writing a review for a lemon squeezer, but I have 2 major problems with this squeezer.1) Upon first use, a hairline crack formed where the handle meets the circular part. Now I'm afraid that it could snap every time I use it, causing injury. Believe me, crazier things have happened. Now if this was the only problem, I'd send it back because I'm sure the company would replace it, which leads me to the next problem.2) This lemon squeezer doesn't work well. It gets half as much juice out of the lemon as a traditional coned squeezer would. I'm buying twice as many lemons at the store, so not only is this device frustrating me, it's getting into my pockets beyond the its principal cost.It gets 2 stars because it works, but do yourself a favor and buy a coned squeezer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made, easily broken","review":"This lasted all of one month in our house. I was a little wary when I first received it as it was much lighter in weight than the similar device it replaced, but I ignored the thought. Really wish I hadn't. This morning, after less than ten uses, an arm snapped right off it while juicing a lemon. And for the record, it was no mutant stone lemon. Just run of the mill citrus. Spend the extra $5 and get the real deal--\\"enameled aluminum\\" is code for cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, effective product","review":"As others have commented, this squeezer does not necessarily get every single drop of juice like an upright juicer might, but I find it much easier to use and certainly less of a hassle to clean.

I just use it like a reamer, spinning the spoon back and forth inside the lemon. If I need a large batch, I have a great $20 electric citrus juicer that can handle batches of lemons, limes, oranges, and grapefruit. The only benefit this item provides is that it has a built-in \\"strainer\\". I already have a small strainer though, so this serves no real purpose but takes a substantial amount of drawer space.This item really works on only lemons! Limes are too small for it to extract all the juice, and oranges are too big. Furthermore, upon my third or fourth use of this, the casing cracked while trying to squeeze the last bit of juice out. Save your money, use what you have, and preserve your precious kitchen space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke first time I used it","review":"The very first time I used it to squeeze a lemon, the handle snapped.

Hurt my finger!","review":"Do not buy this product! I had it for less than 2 weeks before it snapped in half while I was squeezing a lemon half.

Its 20 years old and works 100 times better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty nice im 50/50","review":"Seems like this will last VERY long time so good or bad its a keeper. actually it works VERY quickly half a lemon is squeezed in far less than 1 second! I seem to have a lot of juice left in the lemon after I squeeze it though and that is beginning to disappoint me? (i live in CA and at a average super market lemons are 1 dollar each!) lemons have become expensive for some reason, so if you really want to maximize the juice from the lemon id move on maybe to a different one? Beacause it doesent matter haw hard you squeeze, the two cups dont actually touch????? so when you squeeze the handle all the way closed until they touch each other the lemon inside is not all the way squished? there's more that a 1/4 inch on the inside, of space when fully closed?

My hair is only slightly wavy, and this did nothing for me; I would recommend spending a bit more on a ceramic hair straigtener, as they work far better.

I left it sitting on my book shelf for two more years. Well, when I finally picked it up - I couldn't put it down. I read it in one night and have reread it five times since. Mary Summer Rain and No Eyes are what I have been looking for for a long time. I read the first page and felt like I was home.

This is the first book in the \\"No Eyes\\" series by Mary Summer Rain and it provides a quick overview of their interactions from Mary's meeting of No Eyes through the end of their time together and Mary's reactions to the loss of her teacher. The next book in the series is \\"Phoenix Rising,\\" which purports to give a prophecy regarding the period of time during which Earth will go through a major change and general uplifting of the spirit. However, since the time given in this book until that period is 16 years, and Mary met No Eyes in 1982 and the book was published in 1985, it appears this is yet another prophecy that wasn't quite on the mark. Nonetheless, this book should be of interest to those who are interested in spirituality and shamanism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I had high expectations for this book, both because I loved The Aztec and because the ratings were so stellar.

Over and over.Journeyer is a wonderful ride! As good as Aztec, as good as Spangle, as good as Raptor. He's the only author that consistently puts on a great show.Is it sexual? Hell, yes. Just like the world has been from day one. Is it graphic? Yes. Just like the world has been....well, you get the picture.I leave Jennings' books feeling as if I've sat through a history class. But a class that has been one hell of a ride. If you loved Aztec then Journeyer will thrill you just as much.

Marco Polo's journey begins in Italy and ends in wonder. His description rivals that of someone good. Overall, an A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Aztec","review":"Hate to spoil the We-love-Jennings party, but I just didn't think it was that good. I read lots of historical fiction, and I did enjoy Aztec by the same author. The Journeyer however was simply boring. Compare it to Creation by Gore Vidal, where a Persian guy covers pretty much the same terrain, and you know what I mean. Whereas that book is full of intelligence and ideas, this one is simply...empty. It's the only word that comes to mind. Historical fiction lovers out there, don't waste your time on this one. Do read Aztec, but steer clear from mr. Jennings other books (Raptor was just as boring)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fiction..a historical fantasy","review":"A masterful use of events occuring in history. What is however disconcerting is the character & tradition demolition of certain ethnic groups through his fictional character of Marco Polo in the book. He has distorted the customs, traditions & habits of people that Marco Polo supposedly met in his journeys. Strangely, this even contradicts what Marco Polo wrote about the same people or nations in his original Franco-Genovese narrative \\"The Description of the World\\". True, history is written by the survivors, & also true, fiction takes creative license to weave more romantic & readable stories to make history go down easier.. thats what the book is meant to be..just fiction..if you want to really read about Marco Polo , go somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"has anyone noticed?","review":"I thought Aztec was very good.I thought Journeyer was also a good read.Then I started to read Raptor and then it became very clear that Mr Jennings has a great affinity for writing in scenes of pedophilia.I could understand that in the first two books I read that the subject is probably historical fact but three novels in a row? How much more of his work includes this subject matter?Assuming you write what you know.Look for this guy to be picked up in a sting operation in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disgusting, horrid book","review":"One must wonder what kind of person the author is, considering the horrible scenarios he has created in this book. My recommendation is to stay far, far away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this book for 50 cents and it wasn't worth it.","review":"I don't know if I'm missing something but I found this book exceedingly boring. It's unbelievable to the point of ridiculousness; I just couldn't get into it through all the phony garbage. Also other than Venice, the places mentioned in the book are not described to the point where you feel you are actually in them. I love historical fiction and wish I had a good book to read about this same journey. I thought this book was going to be great. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb historical novel that is one of the best ever.","review":"This is a fictional account of the life of Marco Polo. For 1000+ pages you'll be enthralled by one of the greatest adventure stories of all time. Mesmerizing, without a boring page or even a clanking sentence. A masterwork! Deserves 15 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will be swept into the time of your life!","review":"More happens by page 65 than most books give you in their entirty!

I am not one for historical reading; \\"Marco Polo?\\" I said, rather haughtily,\\" over my dead body!\\" However, out of respect for and curiosity over my friend's glowing description, I picked it up and COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN! I carried it everywhere with me, stayed up nights, read at stop lights in the car...wherever I could find a moment, I devoured the book. Jennings' descriptive prose let me feel the textures, smell the aromas, taste the delicacies, hear the crowd and the silence, and see all there was to see. I was there in all senses, immersed in the life and times of his multidimensional characters and interwoven story lines. A timeless classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb example of an excellent historical novel","review":"I just finished reading the Journeyer, and can not say enough good things about it. I read Aztec previous to this book and was quite impressed with the author's writing ability. Although I did not think it possible, this book surpassed even Aztec in it's vivid discriptions, interesting characters and awesome adventure.The book artfully and imaginatively fills in the gaps of Marco Polo's journey across Asia, bringing to life each character as Gary Jennings does so brilliantly in Aztec as well.I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in adventure, history, travel and great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Aztec, better than anything else.","review":"This is another one of Jennings best. The only people who would disagree are those easily offended by sex, or violence, of which there is plenty in The Journeyer. And no one really cares what they think anyway.This novel can only be compared to other works by Jennings; all other novels pale in comparison to this great tale of epic adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong advertising","review":"This item is too difficult for a six year old even advertised for 5-8 years old.

The artwork is choppy, and the stories are mainly fillers. DVD 3 is no exception, although the second episode on the disc, \\"Demon Genjo Sanzo,\\" made the whole thing worthwhile for me.While the other three episodes are very typical Reload fillers, \\"Demon Genjo Sanzo\\" has a very amusing plot, and the way it plays out makes me laugh every time I watch it. If all of the filler episodes were as good as that one, Reload would be a much better series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Episode 10 makes it all worth while !","review":"I agree with reviewer, SK, that episode 10 (Demon Genjzo Sanzo) makes the whole DVD worth the price.

I'm afraid that commercial success may not actualize for this CD because it may be to elaborate for pop fans. Nellie McKay has admirable musical integrity as she accentuates making quality songs as opposed to simplistic radio-friendly hits.

I hope this wonderful CD resonates with the masses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Has Its Moments","review":"As withGet Away from Me, I'm finding that while the entire album is interesting, there are only a few songs here that will end up in \\"heavy rotation\\" at my house. \\"Identity Theft\\" is the track I enjoy the most, though it's also difficult to resist the charms of a Nellie McKay song called \\"Zombie\\". \\"Oversure\\", a jazzy cabaret number that features Bob Dorough on vocals, is also good fun, and the \\"Don't Sleep in the Subway\\" vibe of \\"Gin Rummy\\" is quite tasty, but I'm not sure I'll listen to them more than occasionally.Overall, my impression after a few listens is that McKay continues to be an interesting, talented artist, but one whose reach sometimes exceeds her grasp. Many of the songs here are over-orchestrated in a way that's more appropriate for a big production number, and I suspect that I'd enjoy them more if I heard her perform them live with a small ensemble.

That being said, this book is an awesome reminder of the destructive patterns that fuel the vicious cycle of plummeting self esteem and increasing unhealthy habits. Geneen Roth's book is about loving oneself, which means creating lifestyle changes that incorporate body awareness, moderation, and confidence. I adored the short, easily-digestible chapters. I read this book easily in an hour and a half sitting, and left feeling empowered by the reminders of how (even more) gorgeous and happy we can be if we give ourselves a chance to be so. I think everyone can find something to benefit themselves from reading this book, and all have someone we know to pass it on to who could do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"No matter how many times it happens, I'm always amazed when I find that there are other people in the world who go through some of the same things as me. This book really did it, it really showed me that I'm not alone in the frightening world of body-image. By the time I finished the second chapter, I had decided that I was going to get this book for my best friend for her birthday, and by the time I had finished the sixth chapter, I realized that I was going to buy it for every single one of my girlfriends for their birthdays.This is a really amazing book, and the author really knows how to talk to women who are in need of reassurance as well as a little shove (or a big one) in the right direction.I suggest it for women of all ages who struggle with any sort of body/self-image, no matter how long that struggle has been going on."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful book!","review":"I saw this book at Geneen's workshop earlier this year.

Short of completely dismantling the camera I have tried all the posted internet fixes without success. I purchased this camera as an upgrade to the PowerShot A80, which I am still using and am very happy with, even at only 4MP.I am quite sure had the A610 been as reliable as my A80 I would have given it 5 stars. Unfortunately, my most recent experience leaves me with no choice but to give it one star (and I had to give it a one since ZERO STARS wasn't an option); you can't rate what won't work and what the manufacturer refuses to believe is a \\"problem\\".

At first I thought I had just accidentally turned the LCD itself off and took a few pictures through the optical viewfinder. However, when I hooked it up to my computer I was able to see that the pictures themselves were black. Bad CCD, apparently, and not the first of its kind to go bad.Black Screen Of Death. I expect to be in contact with Canon soon about a repair, and I also expect them to tenaciously hold to their $107 repair fee.

This camera is perfect for all ocasions. The auto feature is great for point and shoot. The camera has a shoot mode for every type of subject. It really does make a difference to choose the best mode for the subject to get the best picture possible. We have taken many 'portraits' of our new baby boy and they look awesome. The camera comes with more than enough stuff to get you up and running. Make sure you buy a memory card 1 gig or larger(the card that comes with the camera only holds a few pictures) if you plan on taking video, which is also another great feature. If you are just getting into photography like me, there is enough manual adjustments to learn and have fun. I would recomend a Canon Power Shot to anyone looking for a digital camera. I will buy a Canon again."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy","review":"I'm pleased with this camera. It takes pretty good pictures. I think the learning curve is a bit steep though. I still haven't been able to eliminate the red-eye problem entirely, even though I'm sure I've played with every setting imaginable. If you buy one of these, get a good case for it. My zoom lever popped off and I had to send it in to Canon. Canon fixed it, as it was still under warranty. I'm happy to say that their customer service handled my issue very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"erratic or sticky lens motor and lens cover","review":"After one year of babying the camera, it suddenly has malfunctioning lens i.e. both zoom and focus. Cover would not close properly anymore. Makes loud buzzing noise when turned on, and lens does not glide smoothly. Now it drains fully charged high capacity nickle metal hydride batteries very quickly. The internal gears must be made of absolutely worthless material to go bad so quickly. The alternatives are not much better either as every manufacturer may well be using poor quality internal gears so they can keep selling a new one to customers every year or so. Good scheme for generating revenues. Is there collusion among manufacturers?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Durability Redux","review":"Took great pictures for a year and then the power switch got flakey on me. For a while it took two presses to turn it on. Then had to press it repeatedly for 10 seconds then 20. Time got longer to turn it on before I finally sent it in for repair. Estimate was $180 to repair a $250 camera. Ummm, naaahh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died for no reason after only 16 months.","review":"The title is self explanatory.Just like others here my camera died no pictures and no screen after few time I used.Never dropped or abused.It is a lemon form Canon.Gio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great camera...when it doesn't die suddenly","review":"Awesome camera, quick, and just easy to use. I did tons of research on it when I purchased it in Feb '06. Unfortunately, if you start looking at some of the more recent reviews, you can see that folk that got it around a year ago are having major issues.Mine's no exception, and amazingly, this is first piece of hardware that's actually failed me. Quite an experience and interesting to see that many others are having the same issue as me: a LCD screen that's black and an inability to take pictures.And like a previous poster said, Canon's taking responsibility for a bunch of other models but not this one yet. You can read the notice on their website after navigating through their digital camera support section.So all in all, it was nice...while it lasted. Hope things are better now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust","review":"Wow, so I'm not alone in my $150 purchase of a camera that lasts 16 months? Thanks everyone, misery loves company.For my camera, I was taking photos when i put my finger in front of the lens when i zoomed out. All of a sudden I get error code \\"E18\\" (obstructed lens) and my camera is DEAD. I'm out of Canon warranty, I didnt get Bestbuy's warranty, and the local repair shop wants $65 minimum to 'take a look'.....betwen my own lens problem and all of the other published problems on this camera, I dont want to invest more money in a lemon. I am now seriously concerned for the quality of all canon cameras and I dont CARE how popular they are, Once burned, you learn your lesson, I'll go for Sony next time.I really LOVED this camera while it lasted which is the sad part. I hate Canon and I do hold a grudge. They lost a customer forever. An electronic product should not be this shoddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"I am very pleased with the camera, love the full manual settings, great movie mode (u can even zoom) and best of all it takes great pictures! This is the follow up camera to the A95, advantages include a bigger LCD, digic 2 processor (which means faster speed), high-speed 2.0 USB connection, better macro mode (less the half an inch!), 4 optical zoom. I think the biggest thing I noticed was the speed of the zoom lens and ability to focus. Macro shots is simply amazing! Personally I would get the Sandisk Ultra 2 SD memory card to go with this for top speed. Its a simply amazing camera you will love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A610 Could have defective CCD chip","review":"This is a great camera as long as you don't get one of the ones with the defective CCD chip. Canon bought some defective vendor supplied chips and some found their way into this model. Canon refuses to acknowledge this for this model but you can find many others that bought this camera that have the same exact problem. Canon fixed some if you get the right person on the phone. Otherwise you are stuck with a camera that might fail right after the warranty runs out."},{"rating":"1","title":"shake...shake..shake","review":"I want to echo the review by Johnny Damon: \\"Features and functionality are very nice, but I cannot get a single sharp image; pictures are all blurry and noisy no matter what setting i use.

Just a black screen, and black memory card image. The image sensor appears to be defective. Canon knows that it got a bad batch of CCD image sensors from Sony and they are in quite a few products. They are trying to take care of the problem now, but you'll have to go to their website and look at their service advisory, and the A610 is not yet on the list of camera that they will repair free of charge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera - UNTIL IT STOPS WORKING","review":"DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA. Disregard my original rating of 5 stars. I liked the A610 camera when I bought it back in February/March 2006. It is now May 2007, the warranty expired 2 months ago. I turned on the camera last week and no LCD display. The image sensor has died. I have used this camera less than 10 times. Never dropped it, no bumps or bruises on it. The LCD display is completely black. I can now take only pure black pictures. Everything else on the camera works - just no image. Canon evidently received a batch of faulty image sensors but they are taking no responsibility for their bad parts. I contacted them and they gave me two options: I can pay $100++ to have it repaired at their factory in Illinois, or I can join their loyalty program and pay $125 plus $10 shipping for a refurbished camera. Some loyalty program. DON'T BUY THIS CAMERA. CANON DOESN'T STAND BEHIND THEIR PRODUCTS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same dissapointing failure","review":"I've now owned an A80 and the A610 -- Love the cameras, hate the failures.

Honestly, the design of these cameras is brilliant, but I cannot afford to keep replacing my camera so frequently!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon cameras are terrible!!!!!","review":"I bought my Canon camera thinking it would be a good quality camera. It worked fine up until I owned it for just under 15 months. The screen went black, and like so many others with the exact same problem, Canon REFUSES to fix it. Saying it is out of warranty. Bottom line is that Canon produced a line of defective cameras, and I for one will NEVER buy another product that bears the Canon name. Now, all I have is a really expensive paperweight!!! I hate to throw it away! Maybe someday, Canon will come to its senses and offer to fix it. But I won't hold my breath. If you are even remotely considering buying a Canon camera, I would strongly recommend not doing so. Their customer service is absolutely among the worst I have ever seen and experienced!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this new camera!!","review":"I have enjoyed this camera alot!

I have been very happy so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good deal","review":"There are many features and controls on this. But what is the point of this rich feature set on a camera that basically takes junkier pictures (on automatic) than my old Sony DSC-S30? The AE (autoexposure) frames still manage to expose my pictures wrong. The Sony with no such \\"feature\\" never got it wrong. The colors on the A610 are muddy and grey, not vivid. I have to take 5 pix to get enough coverage for one of them to be in-focus. pathetic. And the \\"camera shake\\" icon is the default state of this thing. What is the point of making a camera that uses it's technology to 'helpfully' tell you it can't take your pictures 70 percent of the time?This thing goes through non-rechargeable batteries like nobody's business.Not a good camera. Not a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to return it coz it was too difficult to figure out","review":"I bought this camera, and unfortunately, I had to return it. It came with SEVERAL booklets, and one would just refer you to another. It was just too difficult to figure out. I'm a novice, and this was my first digital camera. I wanted something simple. I'm sure it's a very good camera for someone with digital camera experience, but this is NOT the camera for a first-time user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware: red-eye consistent in indoor pictures","review":"Buyer beware! red-eye will be present in majority of indoor photos. Even with the red-eye reduction and indoor modes \\"on\\"; red-eye is present in pictures. If the flash goes off expect RED-EYE in the picture. For $300 - one should expect better results. It's inconvenient and time consuming to manually edit many red-eye pictures. The edited red-eye pictures either still have some red-eye or the eye appears black. On Amazon - I have read reviews that Kodak models have solved the red-eye issue. Learn from my $300 buying mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"You are rolling the dice if you buy this camera! stay away!","review":"This camera does take great shots, but the reliability of it stinks.

Canon choosing not to acknowledge the issue and repair the defective cameras for little to no cost, is unfortunate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annoying Problem With Zoom Browser Software","review":"To use the software that comes with the camera, you have to use an older version of QuickTime (Version 6) than the current version (Version 7). Apple ITUNES requires Version 7 of Quicktime, so you essentiallly have to choose between using your camera software or ITunes because of this software conflict.This only affects the ability to watch movies taken with the A610, but I can't believe Canon has a released a brand new camera that is dependent on an outdated version of QuickTime. They have no plans to offer a patch to get around the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Camera","review":"I should have done this review 18 months ago to help other people.This camera is a solid buy. 5 MPs isn't much by today's standards. I have just purchased the Canon A560 - 7.1 MPs.I have used the camera on several vacations. It performed quite well.I spent more on the older Canon but that is technology for you. If you buy the A610 for a decent price, it will be a good buy. Solid camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon Powershot A610 5MP Digital Camera with 4x Optical Zoom","review":"Very unreliable camera, since we bought this camera last December, the camera has been sent back to Canon three times for problems. The basic issue was that it did not take pictures. Each time, Canon fixed and sent camera back. For the third time, we requested a replacement because we believed that the camera was a lemon.

When it was very cold the shutter would not open completely, sometimes I had to open the battery door and close it to get it to power up. Then came the dreaded blank screen. I contacted Cannon and received the typical $110 up front answer. I will continue to argue with them and try to get a reduced price or free if I can but I'm not holding my breath. I took excellent care of this camera but is still died after about 28 months of use. I still have a 25 year old Pentax camera that works like the day I bought it, why can't they make anything that last now days?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This camera rocks","review":"I run a internet company which requires professional use of digital photos, etc. In short, this camera surprised me with all the options and all. Don't listen to people saying \\"it is too heavy\\". the heavier the better. It is solid, and I really love it. I also checked reviews before I bought this camera. It deserves 5 stars, not 4.5. If people did/do complain, it is because they don't know how to take pictures, for that matter..do they even know how to check their email? Anyways, i am impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for its new price.","review":"I work at a public access TV station where we bought five of these for our digital imaging classes.

Be warned: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good assortment of music","review":"The \\"On the Line\\" soundtrack is a definite must-have for NSync fans since it's not only from the movie featuring two guys from the group, but it also has two never-before-released songs from the group. In addition, the album contains music by other pop stars like Britney Spears and BB Mak. There's also a little country thrown in the the final song \\"Ready to Fall\\" sung by Meredith Edwards. Overall, the CD has a variety of musical genres respresented, but most of the songs are definitely love-oriented. There is a great mixture of tempo in that some songs are slow and romantic while others are upbeat and fun. Definitely a good buy though!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On the Line and Out of the Station","review":"Granted, I had some, okay several, misgivings about this album. Until I saw the preview during a sneak preview of \\"Serendipity.\\" And once I heard the music used in the film, I knew I had to have this soundtrack. And other thanthe Britney Spears song, she wrote it???, the album is really very good. Trust me. The 'N Sync songs are good, the On the Line All-Stars are good, Joey Fatone's solo is good (who knew that he had such a smooth, silky voice and kept that hidden?) and I LOVE Kessica Folker's song. Buy the album! As for the film, well, I'll leave that up to you, but the album is definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT new songs !!","review":"there are three new nsync tracks, all of which are very good! joey fatone (nsync) sings a solo (ready to fall - orignally by merdith edwards) and its great! i dont like the britney song and a few of the other pop songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Hit","review":"This CD is an awesome collection of song styles and artists. Several people making cameos or staring in the movie are featered on the CD making it a very song worthy soundtrack to go alongside the CD. The only track not really seeming to have a place on the CD is Britney Spears' \\"Let Me Be\\". Other than that the CD is a very strong mix of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!!!!!","review":"This cd is awesome! I love the song \\"Ready to fall\\" by meredith edward...the same song is also sung by Joey fatone and it sounds incredible. another great song is the title track.

I was really suprised to hear Joey sing by himself because he never sings solo. This CD is awsome and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album for fans of all types of music!","review":"I really enjoyed this album. It's got two great new songs by Nsync and the title song is very catchy. I love it also that such a wide range of artists are included on the album, like BBMak, Britney, Al Green and even the Christan band True Vibe. Joey Fatone's solo song, Ready To Fall, blew me away! What a great chance to hear is \\"real\\" voice, out from behind the Nsync harmonies (which are also great, as always). However, as the album goes along, the artists are unrecognizable and the songs don't stick with you as much. But Meredith Edward's country version of \\"Ready to Fall\\" makes up for the wait. I recommend this CD to all Nsync fans who want to broaden thier musical tastes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I even need to explain?","review":"There are basically two reasons the movie was bad enough (and their names are Lance and Joey) just as there are two reasons not to buy this (and their names are *NSYNC and Britney). An almost ironic choice to put on the soundtrack of a film starring two boy band members- opposing boy bands! What brainiac thought this up, anyway? Filled with all the singers I hate most in the world, the disc proves itself a credit to idiocy everywhere. We have not heard from Blaque in how many years and suddenly they reappear (thankfully only on here). Vitamin C's laughable attempt at keeping her career up has been fun to watch but is exceedingly painful to listen to on \\"Do You C what I C.\\" Joey Fatone goes solo with \\"Ready to Fall,\\" which is croaked out so badly, it would remind one of those Budwieser Frogs. And the rest is filled with nobodies and has-beens who simply won't go away.I would not buy this CD under any circumstance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best soundtrack.","review":"I did not really like this CD.

I do not recommend this book....especially as a first coloring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book was a bit boring. I found that my professor had to add a lot of information beyond the book's description of styles of articles.

Yeah, it's very VERY dated & absolutely unauthentic, but Rex Harrison's portrayal of Saladin is NOT TO BE MISSED! Ah, sigh, to be in his harem...and Lawrence Harvey, bleached hair & all, does the best an Englishman can to impersonate a Scot. It's fun. It's flashy. You'll enjoy it over & over."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Talisman - 50's Hollywood style","review":"Well, the film didn't follow the book but that's not surprising. This was an obvious B- movie for the masses. I did enjoy watching Rex Harrison ham it up as Saladin, he obbviously had a good time with the part. Virginia Mayo was gorgeous, Laurence Harvey was stiff/predictable, and George Sanders was a disappointing King Richard. Although acting like the real King Richard would be tough for most hollywood actors in the 50's. The close-up horse-riding scenes were silly (moving background - static horse) and the battle scenes were lame. The jousts were OK and the desert dune scene was fun. All-in-all it was what I expected from a low budget 50's flick.djb"},{"rating":"2","title":"King Richard & Crusaders [VHS]","review":"King Richard and the Crusaders is a good tall tale with lots of action and adventure with a good dose of comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb, Dumb, DUMB","review":"They couldn't have miscast this film even worse if they'd tried.I nearly collapsed from laughter.

I have read just about every book and magazine article written about him over the last 30 years and have viewed many of the video bios about him. This book is by far the worst. It seems to me that the author had a negative bias from the beginning.Clapton is no saint and his past is what it is. Nevertheless, it appears that the author interviewed only those people who had a grudge or bone to pick. From the rather unflattering cover picture to his reviews of EC's work this biography is nothing more than an anti-Clapton diatribe. Even his compliments are backhanded. Sanford's claim that he \\"came to have a quite genuine and deep sympathy for [Clapton]\\" rings very hollow. He seems to have found every reason to trash the man and the majority of his work.Those interested in a balanced view should avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch I've ever owned!","review":"I love watches and clocks, but have never liked wearing a watch around my wrist. I do use pocket watches, but often those are either overly delicate or overly cumbersome or both. I was trying to find some sort of a compromise, but didn't know what all was available. I found this browsing through Amazon and figured it had to be worth a try considering the price. Well, don't let that price fool you: this is a whole lot of watch for the money. It is very stout and clearly built to last. I am not at all worried about knocking it around when working and playing. It is very handsome and sleek. It is easy to read and to set. The simple latch of the carabiner onto a belt loop is easy as pie of course, and the watch naturally stays out of way when your bending, crouching, etc. The icing on the cake is the bright LED light on one end. The whole package is much better than I expected. I am a very, very happy (and on-time :-) camper. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prayer","review":"Anyone wanting to have a structured prayer life I highly recommend Book of Common Prayer. It is a beautiful book and praying the psalms helps deepen one^s spiritual life. The Lectionary gives you the daily readings of the church.

I shoulda just bought another copy of Jay-Z's Blueprint, DMX or something, that's how bad this album is to me.

The original was a classic anthem for everything that Tupac stood for, and was a tight song. The remix however leaves a lot to be desired. The beat is wack, the background vocals are worse, and the whole idea of an east coast raper redoing a Tupac song is messed up. Other that the pain re-mix, this album is aight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew there was such a thing as manufactured rap?","review":"I'm sure Ja Rule was not the first to do so, but he is in the current lead as #1 manufactured, radio-friendly rapper (Jay-Z could be considered but at least he delves into underground beats once in a while). His debut was more focused on streetlife but Ja himself said that afterwards, he took a look at what sort of music sold, therefore he shaped his songs to be more appealing to the mass market. His second and now his third album have been more dependant on featured R&B singers, catchy hooks and beats, and even Ja Rule hmself singing them. Should we punish him for wanting to increase his record sales? No but some amount of substance always outweighs a load of glitter."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong???","review":"Im very disapointed with this album. Ja changed from his \\"Murda\\" stlye rap to this \\"pop\\" rap. Its disgusting. His first single with J-Lo \\"Im real\\" is just his way of making an extra dollar. \\"Livin it up\\" is another cheasy single. \\"Always on Time\\" (his third single) Im pretty sure nobody even liked. His best song is \\"Dial M for murder\\" and even for Ja it's pretty weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y'all need a refresher course","review":"When considering how to approach this review, please realize that \\"So Much Pain\\" is not a Ja Rule song at all. The reason Ja sounds like 2Pac is because this is a remake of Pac's \\"Pain\\" off the \\"Above the Rim\\" soundtrack (cassette version; to get it on CD you had to buy \\"More Songs from Above the Rim.\\") It's one of 2Pac's best songs if you ask me, and y'all need to be educated if you weren't already aware. The way Ja brought Pac in for the final verse was nice, but it only made me want to listen to the original version.Bottom line on this album is he needs to stop singing. Bring in more Lil' Mo or Christina Milian or whoever if you must be R&B, Ja, just don't try to handle the singing yourself. It doesn't come off."},{"rating":"2","title":"I AGREE","review":"WELL I AGREE WIT KRIS20032 ABOUT JA RULE, I MEAN I NO EVERY RAP STAR, AND STILL I AGREE WITH 2- REASON'S, I MEAN COME ON I'M A BOY AND I NO GIRL'S LUV A MAN WIT A DEEP VOICE, AND PLUS IT'S JEFFERY ATKIN'S(JA)RULE, THAT MURDA SONG, 4 FAST AND THE FURIOUS, AND THE MUSIC-VIDEO IS KOOL, AND I LOVE RAP, AND AS FAR AS CUSSING/OR PROFANITY-WISE, COME-ON IT'S RAP,I MEAN COME-ON THEY ACT LIKE THE J-MAN, IS THE ONLY GUY THAT CUSS'S,LOOK AT TRAINING- DAY, SNOOPP DOGG,HE CUSS'S, BIG DEAL,AND HE'S ONE OF THE BEST RAPPER'S OUT-THERE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to the new age of music","review":"The future is bright indeed!Flanked by fellow amazing musicians (though they are above that title) of the brilliant Murder Inc. camp, Mr. Rule has proven he will not stop. It is a sad fact that haters do not realize this fact, because he can't stop. Music is a passion of Ja's, he is so passionate that I might as well bloody give up my singing career!He brought the music industry to another level with this one, with the earth shaking \\"Livin' it up\\". Yes Mr. Rule, I will continue to live it up indeed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It PAINS me to see him sell out, but i LOVE this album","review":"I'm not gonna front and say Ja hasn't sold out since his debut, Venni Vetti Vecci. Yet, I still like all of his albums, and almost all of his songs. Pain Is Love is no different, a solid album throughout.I don't mind that Ja is selling out, although I don't really like commercial artists. He still is somewhat keepin it gangsta. Whatever he releases as his single are the sellout songs, but he's a true thug on the unreleased tracks.This album is really good, but I believe that his previous two were better. The beats and lyrics were good on his last two LP's. If you are a true Ja fan, you won't mind that he is actually SINGING now (Rainy Days). You also won't mind that he is collaboratin wit J. Lo too much..."},{"rating":"2","title":"JaRule's \\"Pain is Love\\" is Tight!!!","review":"JaRule's album Pain is Love is one of the best rap CD's I've heard in a while. His style and voice are really unique and he doesn't sound like anyone out there right now. Plus, his ability to do remixes with so many different artists shows that he can successfully adapt his style to a variety of different sounds. He is a huge talent and his CD is so worth it! Make sure you check tracks #6 and #11 ... they are off the hook."},{"rating":"2","title":"PAIN IS LOVE IS OFF DA CHAIN","review":"PAIN IS LOVE IS THE BEST JARULE ALBUM I'VE HEARD SO FAR. HE'S LETTING YOU FEEL HIS PAIN AS WELL AS HIS HAPPINESS IN THIS ALBUM. JARULE AND CASE REALLY SET IT OFF WITH LIVIN' IT UP AND JARULE AND MISSY GOT REAL WILD ON THE SONG X. JARULE IS DOING BIG THINGS ON THIS ALBUM. HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW THAT YOU CAN'T HAVE LOVE ALL THE TIME WITHOUT HAVING SOME PAIN. THE SONG HE DID WITH TUPAC IS REALLY AWESOME. JARULE IS DOING IT BIG ON THIS ALBUM. THE LEO SKIT HE DID HAD ME LAUGHING REAL HARD. ON THIS ALBUM HE'S SHOWING YOU HIS SERIOUS SIDE AS WELL AS HIS NOT SO SERIOUS SIDE. HE'S LETTING YOU KNOW THAT IT'S OK TO HAVE PAIN BUT YOU HAVE TO HAVE FUN ALSO. JARULE IS ALWAYS GOING TO DO IT BIG I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ALBUM.

His rugged, charasmatic voice paired with some of the tightest beats heard in recent years make this a must have for any hip-hop fan. The three hot singles right now are \\"I'm Real Remix,\\" \\"Livin' It Up,\\" and \\"Always On Time.\\" Overall, a great CD!

This cd has a lot of good songs on it. And for the people who dis Ja Rule's voice, you are just jealous because A LOT of girls think his is sexy(and it is). As for the profanity, WHAT DO U THINK RAP IS?? It says right on the cd, PARENTAL ADVISORY EXPLICIT CONTENT, whenver it says that, it means that there will be profanity along with other things. So, before you go and dis Ja's cd, think about yourself, COULD U DO ANY BETTER?????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial rap at its worst","review":"Pain is love is nothing more then soft, weak rhymed commercial hip hop. Ja went from being gangsta on Venni Vetti Vecci to a trl/pop novelty for suburban kids everywhere. Now there is talk that he is going to do a song with metallica.

He became weak (even wack). His sophomore effort \\"Rule 3:36\\" was weaker than his debut and this one is straight up b.s. He became a R&B-pop star on this album. His \\"Venni vetti vecci\\" was almost a classic release but this one is plain weak. I hate to say that 'cause I respected him but now... I don't know... I decided not to buy it. Ja you must go back to your roots! This is WEAK!Told: 2-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellence and a Humble Spin Doctor","review":"I found this to be an ecellent, and not too over the top representation of the reason I initially found interest in \\"gangsta or hard core rap in the vein of NWA\\".

If we, as a people, or a global community, can get beyond local colloquailisms, what marvelous tales such as Ja Rule (and guests) has presented, could we truly enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does everyone hate his album?","review":"I know, it may be no Venni Vetti Vecci but on the whole this IS a good album. While the tunes are not as hard as on his previous albums the message stays the same: and in some cases it's actually quite romantic. He manages to combine murderous backround music and painful lyrics on 'Dial M For Murder' and 'Worldwide Gangsta', and tracks like (the anthem)'Livin' It Up', 'Lost Little Girl' 'Always On Time' and 'Lost Little Girl', on which of corse Tupac should be thanked, not Ja.I know this album maybe too 'radio friendly' for some of you rap critics out there, but it is good that Ja can be versatile, so his raps appeal to a wider audience, without becoming too much of a mainstream rapper. Anyway you make your own decisions, but think about it, he is the best thing this year......."},{"rating":"1","title":"CONSISTENTLY HORRIBLE","review":"You gotta give the man credit- no one can be this bad, this distingusting, and this wasteful on such a regular basis.

Quit foolin' around, Ja.","review":"I didn't like this album much. The album starts off pretty good, but then goes another direction and goes back where it started and so forth. Track 2, Dial M For Murda, shows his raspy hardcore type rapping. Then it suddenly turns when Track 3,Livin It Up, starts. The next song is not bad. Then it goes to the dumbest songs, Always On Time w/ Ashanti, and Down Ass B***h w/ Charlie Baltimore. Worldwide Gangsta is one of the best songs in the album, and is the next track. The song is a freestyling type song with Black Child, Cadillac Tah, Boo & Gotti. After that, the album goes all the way down to the lowest it can possibly go. The only songs I like in this album are:Dial M For Murda, Worldwide Gangsta, and So Much Pain w/ 2Pac.If I were you, I would buy \\"Venni, Vetti, Vecci\\", Ja's first album, instead of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for rap fans","review":"Ja Rule can't rap with the best of them, but he can make you dance.

Livin' It Up with Case (Ja and Case make really good songs together, see Suicide Freestyle from V V V), Lost Little Girl (powerful message, though he sings a lot), and Dial M for Murda.

I have listened 2 this cd and i have 2 say that ja is a dmx/2pac clone at best. the only good thing about this cd is \\"so much pain\\". that gives it the extra star, simply because of the fact that 2pac (the greatest of all time) is on this. other than that, \\"always on time\\" is so overplayed i cant turn on the radio without hearing it. look ja, no one, repeat no one has ever or will ever come close to 'Pac's greatness. dont think that putting this remake of \\"pain\\" (by the way the original is probably the tightest 2pac song ever) makes ya hard or more of a thug. quit putting jlo in your songs, it only softens them even more. I have to say that \\"holla,holla\\" is the song that made me a ja fan, then 336 came out and he just plain [stank]. so much pain is a ok remake, but he just cant come close to 2pac and stretch(other guy in the original song)emotion. all in all, ja might be able 2 flow, but quit thinking your 2pac.

If this album were more like the Venni Vetti Veche album, it would be ok. But he went soft. Those songs are garbage. Throw it out. It had a few good beats on there and Tupac was nice as usual on it. Ja trying to sing really messes it up a lot. If he want a singer, he should go out and sign a singer from the streets to his label. Ja, give up on the singing. Please~!! For the sake of Hip Hop please stop singing. Only certain people like Bone, and people who's voices can be fixed with the modern day studio technology can sing.

I rated Ja Rule as one of my top five rappers back when his first album Venni, Vetti, Vecci came out. I was really excited when the second one dropped. I ran out to buy it only to be disappointed.I could barely listen to half of the LP. I don't mind when someone changes their flow a little bit, but when you are trying to sing along with the vocalists it just doesn't work. Especially when you have a voice like Ja's. His third effort has even less playability in my system. There is only one song that I would even consider playing, which is Dial M for Murder.

He took 2Pacs lyrics and re-worded them just a little. If you want the real song, buy the cassette version of the Above The Rim soundtrack, but I couldnt find it so I got it off the internet.

His first album was very hard and rocked. His second album while equally hard and following the same style was more along the hip-hop lines.This album however reverses the previous mix of 80% hard core music and 20% R&B/hip-hop to something akin to 20% hard coreand 80% R&B/Hip-Hop music. There are a *few* good tracks butif you were expecting anything close to Rule 3:36 then you'llhave a serious let down. The best song on the album is probablythe duet with J-Lo.

Now, this CD, pain is love is a huge disappointment. It is all basically r&b. Ja, what happened to the hard stuff, the real rap?

To add to my dilemma, I'm totally lost on Astrology, a very serious underpinning for this work. Yes, I think Universal Gravitation affects us in a personal way but I'll never be convinced that enough people could be studied to make it a science.Clow/Satya speak of nine dimensions - I still do not understand the first four.

Ok, for those of you who don't know -- Jupiter is a GAS GIANT. It is MADE OF GAS. There is NO surface on Jupiter.

Kudos to the author for omitting the buckets of verbiage that so many new to the art writers feel obliged to dump on the unwary reader.

The tribulations and 'lows' Jinnah had to suffer throughout his life were a true eye opener for me. It's difficult to find these real-life, 3D accounts of Jinnah's life as most of the material out there has passed through official Pakistan government sources which ensure a pristine, monolithic view of Jinnah. Ironically, it's Jinnah's perseverence in the face of hopelessness and failure which ultimately make him larger than life, rather than his never-failed, Superman image in Pakistan which belittles his true struggle. Hats off to Stanley Wolpert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reseach","review":"Stanley Wolpert has given a very revealing, historical perspective on the man, who almost single-handedly led to the creation of Pakistan from British India.

In writing about the mind of a great scientist, has found a way to write about creativity without going down the established, oft cliched route of writing about writing, or painting. However it is fundamentally a poor book, which Banville has subsequently admitted. It artfully chronicles the ideas of Kepler, his struggle, but fails to invoke this in a passionate or beautiful manner.Banville's best novels are works of art. As Beckett said of Joyce, his work is not about anything, it is about the work itself. Kepler is a novel about something, a novel of ideas. It does not work well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Akerman should have called this one \\"A Slender Squirel\\"","review":"As a hotline listner, I was really excited about reading this book.

It is one of those that I will continuously return to. I wasn't planning on reviewing this book, but I was compelled by the one star reviews that complained about Ackerman's backyard observations. Perhaps they missed the \\"slender thread\\" (forgive the play on words) but it was about so much more than a few squirrels and birds. It is difficult to explain in words, but the balance between the heartache in the book and Ackerman's personal experiences created an amazing and comforting feeling that I enjoyed each time I picked up the book. I do not recommend this book as a introduction to this author, but those who already love Ackerman's style will delight in it. Her style is very personal and her books often have personal anecdotes and stories which I very much enjoy, but if that sort of thing isn't for you, you may not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the elliptical; hated the service","review":"I purchased a Smooth Fitness CE Elliptical on December 22, 2005.

I am not easily convinced, but I am convinced that Dr. Newton is a man of considerable intelligence and integrety. It can certainly be argued that the mind under hypnosis plays tricks, but thousands of subjects are unlikely to experience the same tricks. Sheer volume of experience is hardly proof, but it is evidence.

Its not that there is no validity to anything said, its that there is so little credibility to most of it that it does a major disservice to many in the field who have strived to do actual research on the topic of reincarnation.Nobody incarnates in Canada and the US at the same time. Nobody is a \\"we\\" inhabiting multiple bodies. So many things about this book make you raise your eyebrows if you are a scientist or critical thinker.If you really have an interest in real research done by scientists regarding reincarnation read the works of Brian Weiss and also study the decades of work done at The University Of Virginia by Dr Ian Stevenson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome death","review":"If the afterlife is as represented in this book, the only question I have remaining is \\"How long do I have to live on this earth plane before I can get back there.\\"A truly remarkable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions, questions.....","review":"It is a fascinating book and the uniformity of reports about the spirit world from his patients is compelling. Yet, we know very little of Mr. Newton himself. He claims to be a PhD but where was he educated? If you do a search you'll come up with nothing (or at least I came up with nothing). He's said to have been on the faculty of higher educational institutions as a teacher. Which institutions and in what capacity? Again, a blank.Why isn't there transparency here? It's not like this information is somehow confidential or sensitive. All this is suspicious to me and smacks of someone with something to hide. And this taints the legitimacy of his research which remains uncorroborated. Until there are answers to these questions, just two stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"What I had expected is an academic study on the possibility of reincarnation like ones of Stevenson or Tucker.

I highly recommend this to others interested in the life \\"between\\" lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much boring interpretation by author","review":"I started the book but can't finish it, he's way too intense explaining his theories of how everything in the afterlife works, but apparently as fact in his mind as he even draws charts and diagrams. Give me a break - too far out! None of his dialogue has the ring of truth like some authors. I don't see how anybody can read this and agree that it's gonna be like he says. Points of light spinning around in infinity?? what would be the purpose? If you want to be inspired by a happy existence you can look forward to, read The Afterlife of Leslie Stringfellow and anything by Brian Weiss, George Anderson, John Edward. Or the Bible for that matter, mansions and streets of gold. That's what I look forward to :o)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible crock of junk.","review":"I do not like this book.

You'll enjoy this book if you have an open mind and believe that the author is simply passing a message to the reader directly from his clients' subconscious and super-conscious memories. The author will from time-to-time give his opinion on certain ideas and notions which are helpful and thought-provoking! Also, the author is extremely clear about the intentions of this book and I never felt like I was being pushed to any particular viewpoint.Most of the material in this book is uncommon I understand that certain people will be turned-off by the studies and probably write the whole book off as \\"hokey\\". It certainly is a lot to take in especially if you're strongly set in your beliefs.When you're ready, give this book a read with a clear-head and enjoy it for what it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life.","review":"One of THE best books I've ever read.

Have often felt that precognition was very possible and very possibly reinforced by theories surrounding DNA relative to memory and instinct. I believe that there are stores of memory from ancestors in a person's DNA; that there are many dimensions to what one refers to as \\"instinct\\", and have noticed predispositions for language and linguistics that seem to appear out of nowhere. I also wonder how many of us have experienced that D��j�� Vu that accompanies a sense of \\"having been there before\\" or having \\"seen that before\\". And then, there is the simple spiritual belief that life has a path that is out of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$$","review":"I had high hopes for this book after reading many regarding NDE's, channelled info from the Great Beyond, etc. But I cannot believe the Afterlife would be as boring as this book claims....i.e. hanging around in spirit form, with the same soul group you've always incarnated with, attending classes together, waiting for the next round of incarnations. Ye gods, it sounds like hi school that NEVER ENDS!Not my idea of a wonderful Afterlife. And I agree with other one & two star reviews that the \\"cases\\" aren't very scientific.Regression hypnosis results have NOT been proven totally reliable in many cases, more a product of our imagination--like dreams. I do believe those who have \\"crossed over\\" CAN contact us thru dreams.....I have personally had \\"announcing dreams\\" from deceased relatives about events which came to pass.Wish I had passed on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get some real cases!!","review":"The \\"case studies\\" in this book sound very fake and made up. They seem limited by Mr. Newton's imagination as appears through the repeated mention of \\"tunnel effect\\" and \\"bright light\\". These images are known very commonly as post-death images in all cultures and don't really convey anything new. Mr. Newton, get some REAL cases and then write a book!!I agree that this is a new area (especially in the western world); but some of the older cultures (e.g. Hindu culture) have a lot of literature on the subject and I wish Mr. Newton would have taken time to go through it (as one has to consider the spiritual aspect along with the physical one). I personally prefer the explaination provided by Swami Vivekananda about 100 years back in one of his lectures in London. That focuses more on the philosophical or spiritual aspect; but still seems much more plausible compared to these \\"case studies\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waist your time","review":"After reading all the reviews, I thought that is sounded like a great book.Boy was I disapointed, I am pretty open minded, and the book started off well, But after getting part-way through it, started sounding far fetched. I think he just made stuff up, as to publish a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Journey of Souls","review":"I hated this book. If this is what life is like in the Spirit world then I hope to stay right here. The images presented in this book by the hypnotized clients are my description of hell. Wispy, floating forms, living in layers of a cloud like environment, taking constant classes. What is the point of this? I truly think this author got it all wrong. If found his ideas to be incredibly depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"The proper scientific proposal discusses other sources, makes correlations from other sources, views great amounts of data (as opposed to a small handful of case stories from an unknown quarry),suggests errors in the theory , forms various hypothesis, and proposes definitive ways to prove or to reject those hypothesis. Over all, it must not assume the answer from scant data.This book followed none of those rules, and as such is a poor testament, though sadly the best reincarnation has, as to the scientific worth of such a suggestion (might I even say myth).I was, to say the least, highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings great peace of mind.","review":"This book does more than any other book I have read to ensure peace of mind for those contemplating their own death or the death of a loved one. It gives detailed histories of soul progress from the time of death up to the choice of the next birth. The detail is convincing, and it fits with my extensive study of metaphysical literature on spiritual development and reincarnation. The stories carry more credibility because they come from a skeptical hypnotherapist who got into regression therapy to help people with behavior problems, and developed techniques for regressing the client to the cause of the problem. At first he was getting mainly childhood events, then he got a case involving a past life. In following his own curiosity, he learned to take clients through their death scene and into the various phases of life between lives. Thus far I have bought about 8 copies to share with friends, and have told many more about it.

I met the author at a Book signing and found him fully credible.The Book covers what happens to us between our lives, as relayed to Dr. Newton through the eyes of his patients that have been hypnotized. If you are skeptical about reincarnation read this book.In the end though the book shows us that it is much more important to live our lives well, and to be as loving as possible to all we have the privilege to meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was life changing for me, it just made sense!!","review":"Ive read many books on religion and philosophy trying to find something that would feel right in my spirit and that made sense intellectully.

And I am busy reading destiny of Souls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful...!","review":"I have read this book twice and read a few pages every now and then. A very insightful book that had a healing effect for me. It helped to give a perspective of some of the unanswered questions in life. Sometimes even a perspective goes a long way to bring closure or an eye opener for anything new or revised in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read","review":"This book by Michael Newton is one of the best I've read on life after life. Carefully researched, each chapter builds upon the last one as he reviews the lives and soul journeys of his clients. As I read this book, I felt as though a window was opening and my perspective on so many things began to change, as I was filled with hope instead of the resignation I had been feeling. I look at life and life events in a completely different way now. I have ordered his other book, \\"Destiny of Souls\\" and can't wait to see what awaits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still excellent... even after the second reading!","review":"I read this book in English and in French, and I still consider it one of a kind. I think he's in line to match such philosophy as author Harold Klemp which writes about past lives and Soul Travel. I recommend it to anyone with an open-mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting!","review":"I read Many Lives Many Masters several years ago and this book supports the same theory that we've been here before and will be back, most likely. I found that it didn't refute the ideas that many of our most popular religions are founded on but rather presents another possibility to life after death. To me, it makes sense that we would keep coming back and working on improving ourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jouney of souls","review":"Very deep and at some point you have to put it down before it does your head in.Journey of souls is a book not for everyone to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book....dissapointing seller","review":"I love this book.

The premise fascinated me, so I bought it and began reading it. I nearly read it all in one sitting and quickly ordered the sequel, Destiny of Souls. When I began reading this book, I immediately recognized its truth; on a spiritual level, I could feel it. Its hard to explain. I am generally a cynic by nature, but this book answered the questions of my soul, so to speak. I'm not doing a very good job of explaining this, really.... For me, it is a work that goes far beyond the spoken word. It has become my favorite book of all time, and it is required reading for anyone who is ready to think beyond what conventional religion teaches about the soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for overcoming fear of death!","review":"The proposition this book offers on what happens after physical death is nothing short of amazing. This book really helped me overcome my fear of death and it has given me peace of mind. Also great for anyone who has lost a loved one. A must have page turner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Ignore","review":"Michael Newton's Journey of Souls is so compelling that it is difficult to ignore his findings. He has substantiated the existence of a spirit world and the fact that we all have spiritual guides who monitor our behavior here on earth. That really blew my mind.The information on reincarnation is also compelling. A true lover of this book may want to read Marna Leaks' Confessions of a Sister Out of Time. This book illustrates many of Dr. Newton's findiings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not convinced...","review":"A good friend recommended this book to me and I ordered it in high anticipation of its arrival.Unfortunately, as I read along, I found myself doubting the conclusions/opinions of the author regarding his clinical experience with a variety of patients and individuals. In other words, the author did not supply any empirical evidence that his conclusions were correct. Too much was left to the unproven veracity of the patients and his subjective opinion.Otherwise, its not a bad read as it does open you up to a pretty comforting belief about death and the aftermath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possible, but I have concerns","review":"Some initial elements in Dr. Newton's narrative tie in well with Dr. Raymond Moody's Life after life. Slowly the author moves definitively into uncharted areas. The level of detail seems to be well beyond the material he could have gleaned from his clients. I do want to acknowledge that many of the concepts he espouses do correlate with well known disciplines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe in it","review":"First of all, If Michael Newton is a professor from a college, why can't we find any degrees or a name of the college?Secondly, granted if you are a psychic, you don't need degrees, but he does not show that.Third, he promps his patients during regression to help them out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"reincarnation","review":"I do not believe much of what he says.

This book is, however, a great novel if you read it as science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"far from reality","review":"I thought I would read a book about some evidence based information/incidents but it's far from that.

There's page after page of useful information in this very substantial book.Also, this book is not just dry statistics. There's a narrative involving some of the larceny that goes on at the racetrack, like jockey Sylvester Carmouche who hid in the fog at the quarter pole at Delta Downs until the other horses came around, and then finished lengths ahead, never having gone around the course.

The three are running away from Gorilla leader Urko who believes that the humans threaten the existence of their society.The plots are simple, the makeup is certainly not as believable as in the movies (The TV budget was minimal), but if you expect to find a series set as today's standards and budget, you are looking in the wrong place anyway.The series was entertaining and it's fun to watch today. Unfortunately in its original airing it never found an audience so it was cancelled after only a few months, but if you enjoy the Planet of the Apes movies, you will probably enjoy these wonderful stories...you get 14 episodes in the package.

Any time a historian puts as much emphasis on tales as much as fact they are on thin academic ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dr. Goldschmidt's \\"A Concise History of the Middle East\\"","review":"Having to study this book for an undergraduate Middle East course, I was wearily annoyed at Dr. Goldschmidt's illuminated bias during the entire book. Chapter 3 alone is no where near a \\"history\\" but rather an author's editorialjustifying any and all actions of Muhammad, including the slaughter of Jews during the seventh century for not accepting the authority of Muhammad as a prophet or messiah, adultery, polygamy, theft and pre-emptive war in support of it all. Dr. Goldschmidt portrays the Western and Christian world as ignorant to understanding the great works of Muhummad and trys to pull any new student of the Middle East and Islam into his little realm of prejudices. Any humane Christian or Jew who reads this book will be outraged at Dr. Goldschmidt's justifications. I understand history is bias but history isn't insane. This book most certainly deserves no praise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its an ok video","review":"This video is a great video if you are a fast learner.

Although I agree with another reviewer that some of the segments are too short (i.e., kickboxing and boot camp), I have found this to be a great workout for my no-attention span days, or as a supplement to other exercise DVDs. It's also a good bet for those who are relatively new to working out, as it gives viewers a nice introduction into 5 different types of workouts.

There are 5 workouts- aerobics, pilates, ballet, kickboxing, and yoga. You can even program a workout to tailor your needs. I tend to do 2 sessions of the pilates (it really works the abs), ballet (all you need is a chair to assist you), kickboxing (you feel it in your thighs), and yoga (a nice cool-down).

For starters, everyone else failed to mention that the camera moves while Michelle is moving. This makes you really dizzy just watching.Second, there is hardly any explanation given. Even if you're like me and watch it once beforehand to see what the workout is like, it's really hard to follow.Third, everything felt too rushed. In the pilates segment, for a brief moment you can see one of the cameramen holding up fingers to show Michelle how many repetitions were left. I guess we all know what she's interested in: hurrying up to go somewhere else.A much better 10 minute mix-and-match workout series is the QuickFix series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Easy","review":"I thought this video was far too easy.

Siepi was a worthy follower in Pinza's footsteps and, having been lucky enough to see him on the stage, I can attest that this voice and acting were as magnificent as they are in the DVD production. My ONLY regret is that this was not the actual performance, but staged after the fact, as they wanted to have a visual of this great performance and, particularly, of the great Wilhelm Furtwangler's conducting of it, which is indeed splendid.

Dr. Capra is drawing parallels in two fields and not trying to say \\"see I told you so\\". He takes the time and pages to describe the science and also does a pretty good job of distilling complex religions down to single chapters.

It was the first book I gave my much younger little brother and I was shocked and saddened to find out that it is no longer in print since I was recommending it to a friend whose son is in the hospital.

He spent a great deal of the book furnishing us with irrelevant aspects of the characters lives whilst neglecting to fully explain some of the more important aspects of the book, for example the 1998 ecological situation.His characters appeared very clich��d and I felt upon reading this novel that Benford is a complete misogynist under the impression that women will succumb to any man without a second thought. It seems he has a very over-inflated ego regarding his sexual prowess.This book was one I had to plough through and although I enjoyed the end I felt he did not fully develop or explain events and that this story would be better served as a short story eliminating a lot of the unnecessary rambling prose.

But the overall idea, one of the only viable time-travel-like premises I've yet encountered, was very interesting and innovative. And if this book had been about 100, maybe 200, pages I'd give it a 5 and have been quite happy about it. But unfortunately this novel rambled on for over 500 pages.

Much detailed information about the metaphysical organization of the cosmos, particularly that includes hierarchy, is always suspicious to me. It is too easy to make that up, and also it avoids the real issue and purpose of channeling, which is to teach human beings something important and useful that they do not already know, something they can use to make a difference in their own lives, and something that will improve the condition of man. Another inherent and important purpose of channeling is to change the thinking patterns of the channeler and of others who read the channeling. I do not see any of that in this book. In other words, I see very little wisdom in it. I found the information in this book useless and, because it suggests that there is a spiritual hierarchy in the nature of reality, I find it highly suspect of being untrue and invalid channeling. True spiritual teachers do not teach hierarchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to treasure!","review":"This book has truths that will resonate.

It has definitely altered mine.A fabulous book that can be read as a fairy tale although it could not be truerer.

I consider myself pretty open so I picked it up and Whoa!..I immediately experienced interesting feelings while reading the book. At first I approached it from a standpoint of \\"Is this REALLY true?\\" and then as I read I found that there were certain statements that rang true such as the emphasis on realizing that each person should claim the responsibility of their lives and be empowered. There were other things that did not resonate for me and that's fine. I took what I found to be intriguing and left the rest. The key to reading this book (as well as all books) is discernment. There's no requirement to accept EVERYTHING that's placed before you unless it resonates for you...afterall, that's the point of empowerment. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every Starseed Should Read This Book!!!","review":"Often duplicated (or outright plagiarized), but never outdone...This book was truly a joy to read.

This is an attempt to break in the mainstream with pop music production, 3-minute songs, and lazy songwriting. Tom Englund's voice has been sadly killed and there are no more keys that made their earlier albums special. This being their last album on InsideOut, they obviously wanted to aim for the US market like their friends In Flames. The guitars are watery and weak too. I am terribly disappointed.

They seem only slightly oversized compared to the ones in the movies, but they are fun to wear nonetheless. I wear them almost every day, tipped up over my head instead of my eyes.

Using an audio palette solely consisting of strings, woodwinds and electric organs, Glass conjures up a land before Western time, and although the lyrics are delivered in an alien tongue the emotion is there - surprising, as this was Glass' first go at writing vocal music for a cast (most of 'Einstein' was mostly spoken, and the vocals were numbers). Although Glass was often described as being 'minimalist', 'Akhnaten' is anything but small (there are very few 'quiet moments'), and musically it's surprisingly conventional, sounding almost like a new age Wagner at times. Although you can't really hum any of the tunes whilst riding the bus to work, it blocks out the outside world effectively. Only a strange epilogue, set in the present day, seems to be out of place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still in Shock!","review":"I saw the Boston Lyric Opera production of this opera on Jan.30th, 2000 and don't quite know what to make of it.

While I have never had the good fortune to catch a performance, I saw a 'making of' documentary way back, in England and it was simply mesmerizing.Only Glass could do justice to an opera about the controversial and androgynous ruler, referred to by some New Agers as The Extraterrestrial King. The combination of Philip's trademark layered repetition techniques and his masterful grasp of the psychological and socio-political consequences of the Pharaoh's sweeping changes, makes for a magical experience for the listener.A virtually flawless work of Genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glass' Most Cohesive, Moving Work","review":"A compelling, cohesive musical experience that doesn't need Wilsonian stage pictures or avant-opera staging to bring it to life.

An argument can be made that this team ranks, along with the 1927, 1961 and 1998 Yankees as one of the greatest teams of all times. The 1939 team completed a four game sweep of the Reds in the World series--capping off their fourth consecutive world's title---a feat only equaled by the 1949 - 1953 Yankees.The year 1939 also marked the end of Gehrig's consecutive game streak; an early televised broadcast of a Brooklyn Dodger's game, the opening of the Hall of fame and an expansion of night baseball. With storm clouds of war gathering over Europe, 1939 may have been the last season unsullied by the prospect of World war.Author Tofel does a fine job in capturing a feel for the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tofel hits a Homer","review":"Dick Tofel's new book on the '39 Yankees is a line-drive to gap just left of the monuments, a \\"rope\\" like the ones that Joe D. used to devliver, it's going - going -gone, that book is out of here, a home run, a four- bagger, a veritable trip around the bases, and -- if they count the runners on base -- many will come to regard this as a a grand slam. Tofel brings us back to a time when baseball was more than a game. Must reading for anyone who ever wondered how America came to have a National Pastime."},{"rating":"1","title":"A legend in his mind only","review":"Why the 1939 Yankees ? - I guess because Tofel could get a book published about his own obsession with them.

Upon opening the first page, I was instantly transported back to the rainforest. At times, I felt the author had stood in the same spot that I did to take his photographs. Glorious color that captures the mood, emotions and life in the rainforest. A beautiful book to give anyone who has been to Costa Rica or who can only be an armchair traveler."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I found the cars fascinating, and the descriptions complete. The only thing I disliked was that all of the pictures were black and white, and there were several errors in relation to car specifications. I recommend this book to anyone who likes cars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Title doesn't match content","review":"One would have expected to see some direct ties between Prince espousings and what Dick Morris has observed in his various capacities, but save the first few paragraphs in the intro which mention Machiavelli, the book is void of any reference to Machiavelli's theses. In terms of an expose on how present-day political adminsitrations reflect Machiavellian principles, it comes up short. It is more a giving of personal views and opinions of how politics should work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some People Say They Speak The Truth, Dick Morris Does It!","review":"Another straight forward, straight talking and an insider's informative book which the public and all political pundits will enjoy. Dick Morris for all who critique him pretty much follows the public's wishes and get them what they want and this book helps explain that in vivid detail. Whatever you want to say about Mr. Morris, I tell you now, he is a refreshing breath of reality in politics and is not afraid to speak his mind or convey his attitude of knowledge which is considerable. When confronted by scandal he admits the truth, takes responsibility and moves on with life, the exact same thing the Bible and any Self-Help book teaches you.. The book does the same in many aspects of the subject matter. We are never perfect, but we can try to be, and Dick Morris comes closest to political perfection than any other political person in awhile. The book is excellent pure excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Republicans NEED to read this book","review":"Republicans who have been scratching their heads wondering how Clinton keeps slipping away from them like a greased pig will serve themselves well by reading this book. Morris illustrates how a polititian who discusses ideas will beat out a slick well funded candidate. Morris' claim that the death of ideology is a good thing is highly questionable. But the fact remains that the candidate that sells the electorate on their way of thinking will win. Republicans who want a contest to see who's the most conservative and who can claim the most character will continue to lose. But in their hands the ideas in this book would be a devastating weapon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REVIEW BY LINKED CLERIHEWS","review":"Dick MorrisTries mightily to bore us---Often on TV,Where he's an intellectual peewee.And Dick MorrisWent with a whorris.His bookIs politics with a meathook.He's as much like Machiavelli,As is Tony of the Soprani."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childhood nostalgia at its best!","review":"Being a cartoon lover, this was a terrific find.

In the end, this works wonders...but it does take patience. You can't just glop a giant glob and let it dry because it will sag. So, the tactic is (and the instuctions on the can say this) to apply it in small amounts, let it dry, then apply more. For larger jobs like rebuilding an entire corner, it will take hours...but once it's dried, sanded, and painted, you couldn't tell it from wood. It bonds really well.On a side note; don't watse your time with the 4oz can...it's simply not enough for even a small job, and consideing the price difference is only like $1-$2, go with the 16oz can and be sure you have enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"DAP Plastic Wood 16 Ounce.","review":"Used this product to fill a large hole on my deck, not exactly per the manufacturers recommended use.

Simply because this set is so good that I don't see the need to get another. Abbado has a great sense of Mendelssohn's \\"sound\\", his tempos (actually \\"tempi\\" for real Italian speakers) are spot on, and the LSO responds to him perfectly. Combine that with the fact that England was as good as Mendelssohn's second home during his lifetime, giving British orchestras a position of authenticity for Mendelssohn's music similar to the Wiener Philharmoniker's regarding Beethoven or Mozart, and I just don't see any need for me to spend money on another set that, after this one, would be surperfluous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap and enjoyable.","review":"I can't turn down a bargain when it's for good music.

I read a lot and rarely have I ever put a book down, but I had to with this one. I might pic it up again later, but it got to the point that it was agonizing to try and plow through the slop at the midway point in this book.

PUTS infuse hard hitting beats with jazz, african drums and funk. This creates some of the most incredible and enchanting music I have ever heard. The rhymes are off the hook!

That is what is so great about PUTS, anyone can feel it."},{"rating":"2","title":"O.S.T. is a Great Album!","review":"This is real hip hop, y'all. Nothing about large bank accounts, ho'z, or shooting people. The Beats are dope and Double K and Thes-1 are great MC's. I couldn't find any negatives about this album. Well worth coughing up the cash for an album that will remain on your play list for several months."},{"rating":"2","title":"If only I could give this album 6 stars...","review":"I don't often make sweeping statements about music, but this is undoubtedly one the finest albums released this side of the millenium, and absolutely one of the best hip hop albums ever put down. As previous reviews have pointed out, this is not \\"groundbreaking\\", \\"experiemental\\" hip hop - and that's quite the point. PUTS are very much of the philosophy that if it ain't broke, don't f*** with it. These are two guys who grew up on Hip Hop when that was something to be proud of, and their sound is very much in the style of a lot of golden age hip hop. With all the garbage that passes for hip hop these days, most real heads have given up hope. DON'T! This is catchy, intelligent and original, but with a classic early 90's flavour that will never die as long as real hip hoppers keep making - and buying music like this. If hip hop has a future, it lives under the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent, Soulful, Creative Music","review":"The People Under the Stairs have definitely created a soulful approach to rap music. This album is one of my favorites from the underground. I've been a fan of Central/southern California underground for a couple of years now, and I have to say that the region has produced more talented, creative hip-hop acts in the late 90's than any I've heard (i.e. Living Legends, The Pharcyde). This music has evolved from the literal and straightforward mumblings of early to mid-90's gangsta rap to intelligent, philosophical poetry over music. This is just another advancement."},{"rating":"1","title":"big time garbage!!!!!!!!!","review":"this has got to be the worst Hip-Hop cd ever. the only track that's tight is the first track. this is a massive dissapointment if your a true Hip-Hop head you will understand when you listen to this cd. do yourself a favor don't cop this cd, if you do you will tell yourself i should of listen to that kat on the amazon reviews..."},{"rating":"2","title":"MARQUSAS","review":"Survivor is the best show ever.The Survivor team really knows there stuff.Including of coarse the producer.All Survivor addicts like myself,and even if your not and watched other Survivors Survovor Marquesas was great.See how Boston Rob started out.Just cant say enough.Great.Great show"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Season!","review":"This season of Survivor was great!

The good thing about this though is episode 5. Watch the episode and after it you will fall out of your seat LAUGHING!!

Where are they now? I don't really care and I don't really want to know. Kathy should've won it - she had the best image transformation of the entire show.

This was three loose boxes in shrink wrap. The individual hard cases for the disks in previous seasons had different cast members on the cover. This one had the same people.

I've seen nearly every season at this point, and this was the second survivor season that I saw. I loved it at the time, and have been anxiously awaiting it's release. But now after viewing it again, it wasn't as good as I remembered. In fact, it really doesn't hold up to the newer seasons.There was so little strategy by these contestants, so little drama, so few heroics, and certainly no memorable villains. Neither of the final 2 really seemed very deserving (in terms of controlling the game or in terms of dominating challenges). The whole season was just very \\"meh\\" in hindsight. I'd be hard pressed to rank anything that happened in this season as one of the more memorable survivor moments, and the same could be said for the participants themselves. I guess it's a testament to how good the later seasons have become that this one seems to vanilla."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF CBS???","review":"Why the HE@# hasn't CBS released all the seasons of Survivor?

Kathy was great the whole season.I have been waiting years to buy this, and now that it is finally for sale...I find myself being reluctant to make the plunge for the DVD-R version. Do I get a nice box set with the castaways' pictures...doubt it, are there tons of extra features and behind the scenes footage...don't know.I really want to, but don't know what to expect...But A+ on the show and season anyway, maybe one day we will get an official release!Update: Can't believe I wasn't sure about this.

But when CBS keeps putting off the release date, the temptation grows stronger.Last time I checked here on Amazon, there was a release date for late February this year.

Its the season where the people playing survivor got smart... It is also the season when there is the first kiss!

First of all when it was sent to me it came in 3 dvd covers thats it no box like is advertised just 3 dvd covers with 3 dvds in each cover 2 episodes on each dvd until you get to the last 2 dvds and then it's only 1 episode per dvd no real extras and the dvds are for sure dvd-r's burnt copies so I was very diappointed in the season all around. Packaging and just a very boring season of survivor that no one deserved to win most of all the person that actually won so my suggestion to anyone reading this and thinking about buying it skip this one save your money for something good."},{"rating":"2","title":"different kind of war storey","review":"although a bit long, this storey of 3 soldiers in ww 2, is a good one, dean martin bascially plays himself...., (...)actormongomery clift plays a sulky character, and marlon brando plays a german officer diillusioned by his country's war machine. cameo appearance at the end by\\" sgt shultz\\" of hogan'shero's fame- actor john banner. made in 1958, this would have been a real gem if filmed in color."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anachronisms Galore","review":"I have trouble with films with glaring anachronisms, and this one has them right off the bat. The initial scenes take place in Bavaria in 1938 and the clothes and hairstyles of the female characters are straight out of the late 50's. Ditto for the scenes showing the early to mid 40's. If I am not mistaken, in some of the scenes depicting the war years, some of the women's costumes had Dior's \\"New Look\\" construction, which was definitely POST war. So, a half baked attempt to be true to the 40's was attempted, but they got the timing wrong.More problematic for the plot is the female lead's prescience to know how bad Hitler was going to be--in 1938. Her whole attitude is of someone who knew the outcome of WW II, which she obviously couldn't have at that time. Avoid this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak","review":"Two movies spliced together is what this one seems. Brando and Clift only meet in the end for two seconds. Weird structure for a film, and it doesn't work. And if Brando is such a great actor, how come he's so weak in this film and in DESIREE (which I just saw). In Brando's autobiography, he says he learned the trick of reading dummy cards on this film, instead of memorizing lines. Well, at least he accomplished something with this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marlon Brando Makes You Und Offer You Can't Refuse","review":"In essence this shows how war can be hell. Brando plays a blond(ha!) Nazi who questions himself and his allegiance to the Nazi cause, he never seems to appear with other actors. The cast is also small with Dean Martin, Montgomery Clift and Hope Lange. Martina and Clift are friends and are drafted and end up together in the same unit where Clift finds jewish persecution is not occuring in Germany only and he continually fights every soldier. His wife, Lange is truly in love and sympathetic with his cause but warns him that if he continues he'll end up in the brig and never see is unborn child. The movie is trite and the only highlights are Martin(not singing or playing the stereotypical Italian) and Lange as the young bride! This is HOpe Lange's only B&W film and she was wasted in it as Clifts wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, disappointing.","review":"My husband and I are always interested in WWII movies. So when Mom, an ardent Brando fan, recommended this, we watched it.It's a long time since we did - perhaps as long ago as a year - but the impression is still with me that this movie had very little to do with The War - it was more about interpersonal relationships and character development. So in the way of being a War Movie, it was not so good. I think it was a rather long movie, too, which didn't help. We just kept waiting for 'something to happen' - and it never did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great WWII Film","review":"This World War Two movie is unlike any I have ever seen. It tells the parallel stories of a German officer(Marlon Brando) and two American soldiers(Montgomery Clift and Dean Martin), both in a simpathetic light. There was no real antagonist in this film, but the war itself. Brando's character is at odds with the Nazi's motives, but feels compelled as a soldier and patriot of Germany to fight for his native land. Martin is a professional singer who will do anything to get out of fighting, until he befriends Clift, a Jewish soldier with a humble backround taking grief(and physical beatings) within their army company. Clift stands up to the other men and eventually earns their respect and Martin's. The movie also involves the three men's different affairs with women and with authority, which add to their characters and the movie's message. All in all, Dmytryk delivers a interesting and poiniant antiwar film which people should see."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind war movie","review":"Despite a few flaws, this is nontheless a fine and unique film, with a skilled cast, good production values, and a compelling, though episodic story. There are many outstanding and often disturbing scenes which linger in the mind long after viewing. I have seen it many times, and have always found it to be a thoroughly engrossing piece of work. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing Cast","review":"The three leads in this movie struck me as a most unlikely combination. And I'm definitely not a Brando fan. That the director had the confidence to cast Dean Martin as one of the leads is impressive in itself. At this point, Dean Martin had only made one other movie since splitting up with Jerry Lewis - a dud comedy called \\"10,000 Bedrooms\\". But the casting works. Martin is very good in his part as one of two American GIs in Europe during WWII, along with Montgomery Clift. Brando surprised me. He is very good in this film - good enough that most of the time I was able to forget that it was Brando. The movie is a little slow in places, but for the most part this goes unnoticed, due to the acting, script and direction. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Lions","review":"Very interesting teaming of Dean Martin and Montgomery Clift. The fact that marlon Brando is in this is almost a second thought. He shares no sceanes with Clift and Martin till the very last minute but, you have to remember that this story was taken from a novel by Irwin Shaw an author much in the same vein as Jackie Collins and other romanticist types. So views very much like reading a novel but just condensed down to movie format.I liked \\"The Young Lions\\" but I feel it could have been a tad better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Ok, so I'm the storm of bad news, now I like all sorts of music and appreciate all kinds, but there is no effort into this album, it's like a grungy hippie band that really doesn't know how to do much of anything lyricly or musically, Maybe they should learn how to play the instruments a little better before they decide to make a cd out of it, Also the review above says that they play in Seattle all the time in pubs and Coffee Houses etc, I have NEVER seen any kind of advertising nor ever heard of them until I got a recomendation from some one at work (who is a hippie). you can find way better, If you want folk get the Indigo girls....."},{"rating":"2","title":"The art as only device for not dying of truth!","review":"The tumultuous preparation of Wagner 's Tannhauser will work out as fabulous hook to this superb director (once of the top ten directors all over the world) to express the art is the only device to rejoin the different cultures and with major emphasis a continent: Europe.Until this date I have not seen any film of this outstanding director that may be classified of minor. He has this devoted feature, the Midas touch, a symptomatic characteristic of the genius in progress.The cast is fabulous. Glenn Close had to be nominated to the Academy Award for this unerring and towering performance. Glenn Close 's voice is dubbed by Kiri Te Kanawa."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hope this movie goes straight to Blu-ray","review":"I made the mistake of lending my VHS of Meeting Venus to a \\"friend\\" who has since lost it. No matter, I'll just get the DVD ...NOT! I agree wholeheartedly with the earlier reviewer, this is a gem of a movie. Brilliant mix of satire, humor, romance and the opera-biz all played out on a world stage somewhat removed from most of us, yet getting more familiar all the time...Eastern Europe. I doubt that my current DVD player will handle this format, so I'll have to wait. But, when you get a chance, if you like movies where the action is driven from the passion and talent in the lives of the characters, don't miss this one, it's lovely, and easily my favorite of Glenn Close's performances!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prison Letters will move and inspire you...","review":"Prison Letters are the letters that were smuggled out from two of the prisons that Corrie, and her sister Bep were sent to.

The one thing I like about the Taylor Steele Movies is that there is never nudity or profanity.

If you like the comedy part, check out Drive Thru. It is hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another BOMB from Taylor Steele!","review":"Taylor Steele is the most overrated director in the world of surfing. Here's another example of his tired attempt to be 'cool' in the world of surfing. I'm sure he has the right attitude to get along with all of those surfers, but he has no sense of art, story, direction, mood, music AND waves!

If you like revenge movies, this is the collection for you. These stories not only show violence and destruction, but can also show how revenge can backfire. The best out of all of the three is no doubt Oldboy. Even though I had an idea of how it was going to end, it didn't stop my mouth from gaping. Min-sik Choi is amazing in it. He is also in Lady Vengeance (as a different character). Sympathy for Mr. Vengeance and Lady Vengeance are good - but Oldboy is definitely the highlight.I don't want to say much more, since I don't particularly like spoiling movies. Let's just say that I am more than happy I have these movies in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vengeance Trilogy","review":"This is a great looking set.

What a complete waste of money - thankfully I charged it to the taxpayers - just like my New York trips. The book read like a self-promotion for the website. His comments on how Alan Keyes won the first debate are very far off, it only means Keyes made sure his supporters voted."},{"rating":"1","title":"vote.com","review":"This is the worst book I have read in a long time. The book is extremely disjointed. Some chapters were simply added just to increase the size of the book. The book is a poor attempt by the author to advertise his web site Vote.com.

I'd finished it by the time I had reached my destination 4 hours later.My biggest issue with the book after the first couple chapters was that it was filled with sweeping generalizations after sweeping generalizations with nothing to back them up. If you want to hear \\"the internet will revolutionize our lives\\" and \\"the internet is revolutionary\\" over and over and yes, over again, then you might find this book interesting.After I managed to get over the generalizations, I realized that book is really an advertisement for the vote.com website!I found very little substance in this book and was extremely disappointed that such an exciting topic could be brought down to such a low point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughably inept","review":"If Morris's understanding of politics is half as shaky as his grasp of the Internet, it's a miracle that his political career lasted as long as it did.

I thought I surely would! I mean, it's set here in Chicago and revolves around the lives of identical twins (also quite applicable to me!). And while it was an engrossing story, it left me feeling unsatisfied and that the whole book was rather inconclusive.Also, and I am not quite sure why, the book oozed self-publication, and despite the author claiming to live in Chicago, it seemed as though some of the details were pretty off. I also didn't see the point in the focus being almost entirely sexual... it is hard to maintain, and Frangello definitely did not keep my interest. I also felt like all the characters were unattractive and unlikeable. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone other than my own sister, and even then just to see what she thinks of it.Maybe someday I will re-visit this book and see if my opinion has shifted, but I think it will be on the shelf a long while before that happens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, highly charged story","review":"This is one of the few books in recent memory that has continued to linger in my mind. It's on my Reread Soon list. Frangello's characters are all rendered warmly, with depth, and sympathy, no matter how cold, scheming, or hypocritical they might be. I found myself caring for each and every one of them, warts and all. The story of one twin's attempt to understand and tell her sister's life plunges us into a zig-zagging attempt at revealing truth. As each facet her sister's and family's life is revealed (drink, drugs, AIDS, S&M, recovered memories, and lies, lies, lies), you gain a broader, deeper picture, but one that is ultimately as murky as real life often is. Despite what some might consider sensationalistic subject matter, it is not presented as titillation. One of the best books I've read in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure...","review":"I'm about 100 pages in and I can't decide whether to keep reading or not. I was really expecting to be totally enthralled with this book as a result of the description and the reviews but so far, I can't get connected to the story or the characters. I find the concept of the book fascinating but ultimately, I don't find the characters engaging and in some ways it all seems superficial or contrived to me. At the same time, I keep believing that if I stick it out a little longer, I will find it more compelling and that I might miss out on a good book if I give up. My philosophy has always been that I would rather walk away from a book I'm not enjoying or gaining anything from in favor of others that I would find more satisfying. With this one, I'm very torn. I think I may ultimately move on to something else. That being said, if the description interests you, I would recommend giving it a chance; maybe it will speak to you more than it has to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is life really like this?","review":"I persevered the 800- pages of this novel always looking for ultimate goodness of human nature to triumph.

One gets the idea that Paul Strathern thinks that Nietzsche was just a megalomaniacal joke who took himself too seriously. He writes off all of his philosophical works as \\"childish\\" and only understandable to teenagers.

The most helpful was the second section, which explains oft-tedious concepts in a simple manner.This book, or series, works magic for essays and position papers. Again, if its a deep understanding of Nietzsche that is desired, this is not the best choice. If its a basic understanding of his ideas, then by all means have at this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth... very simple","review":"More of Nietzsche words should be included into this book. As is we get more of a biographical knowledge than of the actual work itself. More quotes would help and certainly a little more depth into his works as well. In the end it all seems like a MTV clip... too fast and too little. Same for other books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Cliff's Notes","review":"I had to do a project on Nietzschie and found just diving into his work confusing. This book made better starting point, it gave me some background. It's written in a very entertaining way. However, the point of view is very biased, so I would just use this as a jumping off point before reading some real (and objective) literature about Nietzsche."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book if you're curious about Nietzsche...","review":"With all of the volumes and volumes of essays and novels written about such a great man, one can see how difficult it would be to condense a summary into an overview about as big as Cliffs Notes. However, Paul Strathern does a fine job. When I first opened the book, I was turned off by the seemingly strong and objective views of the author who was supposed to take a neutral perspective, until I realized that he was merely taking on the stance of many generalizations of the public. His wit and sarcasm make this a very enjoyable and easy to read introduction. It is clear and concise and even includes insightful little stories. A humorous and excellent timesaver for those who merely want to satisfy their curiousity. An even better jump off point for those who've found themselves curious and hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful enhancement for quick references to Nietzsche.","review":"Paul Strathern combines quick insight of Nietzsche's biography with his memorizing works. By breaking down simply the instances in Nietzsche's life, you are left refreshed and intrigued on most aspects of the exisitential philosopher. Though it is very short and simple, it yields at understandings that not only amuse you but informs as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"stands the test of time...","review":"I just wanted to throw my 2 cents in on this one seeing as it wasn't getting much representation. This is a really good compilation. For me, it has withstood the test of time...I've had it for about two years now and have listened to it consistently. It sets a nice mood for roadtrips, studying,or just chillin' with that special someone on a warm summer night. There are some very smooth and somewhat funky basslines here to be appreciated. The only song lacking is the last one...it doesn't flow well with the rest of the albumn. Overall though I think this is a nice addition to any downtempo/electronic/acid jazz collection. Pop this in, pour yourself a glass of wine, and enjoy...cheers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book of any kind EVER.","review":"This book gives golf and books a bad name. To play a round of golf with Fred Gefen must be hell... Schindler's List was a funnier book. This book leaves but one burning question... What is the opposite of funny? In fact, this book is also the answer to that question."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the same as the original; but enjoyable never the less","review":"I suppose it's natural to compare this release with the original classic (which, by the way, you should listen to first).The word that hits me when listening to this release is \\"technical\\". It sounds like there must be 100 horns where the original was, what, 1? Some parts seem overly cute... but it's not like it's some insult to the original. One thing I can't stand is when an artist remakes a piece of music (even their own) and it sounds the SAME. In those cases, the duplicate is implying that they are better. This version is different. It has a big band sound.Like all of the Wynton Marsalis projects, the audio quality in this release is unmatched.So, I'd recommend this release as a supplement. Don't think of it as the new kids trying to \\"one up\\" Trane and I think you can enjoy it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big band version of Coltrane classic","review":"If you are a jazz aficionado, then you probably should avoid this CD. Nothing can compete with the 1964 classic Coltrane original recording. However, this big band orchestration is very approachable for non experts. Everything is very professional and the musicians are quite frankly astoundingly good, particularly the young rhythm section. I heard them live in Ann Arbor last night at a packed Hill Auditorium and the audience seemed extremely satisfied with the product. If you're a purist, stay away; otherwise you may be very happy indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyers be warned ! this may not be what you hope for !","review":"Buyers need to be warned that this is Marsalis' own version of A Love Supreme which he had liberally rewritten and given much big band flavor. Others might disagree, but I think this is a total abomination of one of the finest jazz albums ever created. I heard this mess live at Lincoln Center. I could tell by the audience reaction that they were displeased, no booing but near dead silence. Elvin Jones was in the audience that night, I wanted to ask him if he knew ahead of time what Marsalis had done. I had heard a very fine rendition of A Love Supreme the prior year at Carnegie Hall performed by the now-defunct Carnegie Hall jazz band. They did an amazing job retaining the original characteristics without doing a note-by-note copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very anachronistic","review":"As much as I love Wynton AND the LCJO, this is a total miss. They play Coltrane's suite as if it was written in the 1920's, and it is just lame. Creative arrangements as one would expect from W.M., but I feel they do not suit the music. Perhaps if this was done by someone like David Murray and his big band...?Nah, forget it. John Coltrane delivered the ultimate take in 1964."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's simple really...","review":"LCJO does to A Love Supreme what the Disneyland Dixieland band does for Muskrat Ramble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great deal","review":"Line is great, but be advised this is a small spool of line 110yards.

One after another great rendention of songs I had never heard by some of my favorite artists.

I'm just using it as a sleep shirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this shirt!","review":"I purchased this shirt in the evergreen color and liked it so much that I bought three more in other colors. The Amazon price is considerably lower than the American Apparel price, and at least two of them were prime eligible. This shirt is perfect. It's cut narrow, but not too tight. It's thin and lightweight, but not see-through or clingy. It comes in nice colors. Most importantly, it is long enough to cover the belly of a tall girl with a long torso. I can even tuck it in my pants or shorts if I want to. I've washed two of them. One I washed by hand and put outside to dry. The other I washed in the washer in cold water and dried in the dryer on low. Both washed fine with no noticeable fading or shrinkage.I was a little uncertain about what size to order. Since it was a unisex shirt, I decided to order a small instead of my regular medium. I'm 5'8\\" and about 135 pounds, and it fits perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Not only did this drive completely fail after only 4 months but the company refused to honor the guarantee! Also, don't be taken in by the resemblence to the other Crossfire drives (like I was). This is a much heavier and nosier drive.There are many more reliable and cheaper drives on the market. I replaced this unit with a LaCie, which is not only much quieter but also seems faster.I lost over 150 MB of music files when this drive failed for no apparent reason. The company refused to accept Amazon order form as proof of purchase and refused to honor their guarantee.A word of advice, for those planning large music projects. You should be prepared to buy at least 2 large drives in order to be able to backup. Also avoid this company and research your options!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Realistic","review":"This book is not the least bit realistic. What are the odds three 10 year old girls could tame a wild pony in only a few a weeks with no help? And how could a formerly tame,docile pony go completely wild in just under a year? When I bought my horse he had been out to pasture for two years,but he was pretty well behaved when he came to my stable. Plus,despite their relatively small size,Morgan horses are usually considered horses. If you have a horse-crazy child who dreams of ponies,(but the closest theyv'e been to one is the pony ride Shetlands at the county fair)then this is the book for them.

When I heard the song, however, I was very disappointed. The singing was fantastic but the music totally destroyed what American Pie is all about. I am not a musician so I can't give you specifics but it just sounds like the music doesn't match the lyrics. It is like a marching band at a dance.

They are pure power pop and their fuzzy guitars perfectly balance off their exquisite vocal harmonies. \\"The Concept\\" opens the album and it is a brilliant song that sets the tone for the album. Lead singer Norman Blake's honey drenched vocals are backed by a fuzz-toned guitar riff and the lyrics are quite sly. Other standout tracks like \\"Alcoholiday\\", \\"Star Sign\\", \\"December\\" and \\"What You Do To Me\\" combine the band's Beatles and Big Star influences of slick harmonies, large hooks, crunching guitars and snarky lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun fun fun","review":"This CD stands out in my collection like a sore thumb.

The second thing you notice is a few of the songs are just too darn long.

One of the great underrated bands of the last decade showed just what they were capable of in the messy, poignant, joyous collection of songs that is Bandwagonesque. Big Star blah blah - Teenage Fanclub stand on their own as a great band who write great songs, full stop. And they invented Travis.December, Guiding Star, What You Do to Me and Alcoholiday are all lovely, but my favourite is the Gerry Love penned instrumental Is This Music, though how the Fannies managed to get their guitars to sound like bagpipes is a mystery not uncommon in Scottish bands (remember Big Country?).Bandwagonesque is not as smooth as later Teenage Fanclub offerings, the wonderful Grand Prix, the excellent Songs From Northern Britain and their latest long player Howdy, but in its sheer ragged exuberance it stands out as one of the best albums of the 90s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Conceptually Brilliant","review":"With a sense of earnestness and a broad wink, this Scottish band has concocted a sound comprised of snarly guitars, melodies that beg to be whistled, and harmonies that are positively haunting. A couple of the tracks happily tread closely to bubblegum (viz. Metal Baby),others, namely Alcoholiday and The Concept, soar nearly to the sublime. If you are young, or ever were, you will enjoy this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories of all kinds","review":"This album reminds me of a great alternative rock radio station in Minnesota circa 1991. Just at the time I thought \\"rock\\" was dead, along came that radio station and albums like this. \\"The Concept,\\" \\"What You Do To Me,\\" and \\"Star Sign\\" received regular rotation on the old KJJO, and what great tunes they were. Over the course of time this album has become a favorite in my collection. Good times. Great tunes. If it weren't for my discovery of classic alternative bands like this I'd probably be listening to country-and-western now. Ugh. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic must have in every sense","review":"and quit already with the lame Big Star fodder. I've listened to #1 Record and Radio City countless times and neither can touch Bandwagonesque. Who cares if Chilton and co. had influence here, guess what they were influenced too. And last I checked the Fannies wrote these great pop rock tunes not Big Star. Anyways, this album truly is perfection. Great pop rock tunes galore, especially The Concept, December, and Alcoholiday. But what gives this album an edge is the two instrumental tracks, which shows the Fannies versatility."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than \\"nevermind\\" anyday...","review":"really too bad that they are so underrated but then again such a band is best left as our personal secret, something we can listen to while everyone else \\"rocks out\\" to bon jovi, hopefully a higher entity WON'T spare their souls. but anyway bandwagonesque has one particular song, \\"Alcoholiday\\", that is easily worth the six bucks you'll pay for the cd. I'm quite aware of the significance of the song and it being the definite tennage fanclub song but no matter what tag the song comes with it is brillaint. The Concept and Guiding Star are also quite integral to the overall scope of the album. While most the songs are basic pop (most, not all) the way in which they formulate the songs makes this pop actually enjoyable to listen to without feeling that terrible guiltness, which I really wouldn't know anything about:) anyway its 6 bucks and for that much you can't really can't go wrong unless it's oasis or something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"me encanta","review":"buenas noches, de excelente calidad, envi�� r��pido tal cual como aparece en la imagen... deportivo, un reloj que se puede usar diariamente"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glo light went out right-a-way","review":"I bought this watch and the glo light stopped working only days after the manufacturers warranty expired.

The characters we had become familiar with could now go home to their families and leave the work day behind them.That was just uninteresting to me.

It's like it it's the same album with another nam, up to a point that Vinnie Moore plays exactly like Schenker in the mentioned phase of the band. It's incredible! (well, better try to play like the master than goes shredding the whole album!)The twelve tracks drags on and on without ending. Of course there are good moments, theses guys are very talented musicians. Jason Bonham drumming is very solid and interesting, a real upgrade to the band (altough Ansley Dunbar delivered the goods also).Anyway, is a good album for a completist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Track Listing for the SPV Steamhammer release","review":"1) When Daylight Goes to Town - 4:332) Black Cold Coffee - 3:203) The Wild One - 5:394) Give It Up - 4:255) Call Me - 4:036) Slipping Away - 4:567) The Spark That Is Us - 4:118) Sympathy - 3:489) Mr. Freeze - 4:4310) Jello Man - 4:1311)Baby Blue - 4:3112) Swallow - 4:30"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW WOW WOW","review":"This is pehaps the best MUSIC I have heard in years. Not just from UFO, but from any band,period. All to many band today are chasing that \\"Hit song\\" and locking on to formulas to do it,as a result...all sounding the same, Boring,unimaginative and bland. The Music (and I mean MUSIC in it purest form) is hypnotic, captivating and full of solid tasty groove. the Songs on \\"You are Here\\" are truley that, SONGS, rythmic quality,progression,everything is there, everything a song should be is THERE. this CD is too good, and I will say a prayer that they tour the US and keep the line-up in tact.

I own just about every UFO, Schenker, Moog, Way, cd/project out there.I am not very familar with Vinnie Moore's work, but I must say after hearing this cd I am ready to here more. This disc is awesome it really grows on you, it is heavy, melodic, and bluesy . I had the pleasure of seeing them in my hometown at a tiny little movie theater called The Roxy back in October(2004), what a hell of a show. These guys rock and I hope they stick together and put out more discs. Schenker is great I love his work but, \\"Sharks was a poor effort and the guitar work was very uninspired. \\"you Are Here\\" is one of my favorite cds of the year. Vinnie and Jason are just what UFO needed to get the creative juices flowing again. Stand out tracks are, \\"The Wild One\\",\\"Black Cold Coffee\\",\\"Call Me\\",\\"Sympathy\\", and \\"Mr Freeze\\". Keep rockin guys and stop back in Northampton on your next tour!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I am STOKED! More UFO!","review":"If you are at all a hard rock fan and don't get chills up and down your spine listening to the third song \\"Wild One,\\" you are dead! I have every disc the master Mogg has released, and he pours his blood and soul into every song he crafts. No, the guitars are not by Schenker, but Vinnie Moore is no slouch, and isn't it supposed to be a \\"band\\" anyway?! Anyone seen Schenker with the same three cast of characters for more than a year straight, in the last ten? He's his own animal. I saw Moore and his band backing up MSG on a west coast tour back in '99, and they were both awesome; and Moore sounds extremely well groomed for the UFO sound. In my viewpoint, I get twice as much music; UFO doing their thing, and Schenker doing his! These songs are Phil Mogg UFO through and through, classic blue collar grooving rockers.

The author points out the lack of conclusory evidence regarding the long-term effects of divorce, parenting styles (strict versus lenient), single parenting, early attachment and Freudian concepts. It also points out that culture-which does affect personality, at least to some extent--is transmitted through peer influence more than parental influence. The book suggests that parents' true role is to enjoy their kids and to provide them with opportunities--to attend good schools, to live in good neighborhoods, to fit in with their peers to the extent their peers are positive influences and to remove kids, if necessary (and possible), from negative peer or cultural influences. This book is on my short list of books that actually changed my way of thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good deal of information","review":"I found this book an interesting read.

This book ought to make her money in a culture where people would rather blame someone else or take a quick pill than take the hard road of responsibility, dedication, and perseverance. The truth is, our children are a complex mixture of genes, parental input, socio-economic factors, and social/peer input. If you take the aggregate of child behavioral studies you will reach this conclusion. As parents, we are our children's teachers, and we should not hide from our role or the responsibility it demands. Raising children requires sacrifice, hard-work, dedication, and responsibility. But every smile makes that work easy. Don't hide behind a pop-psychology book: go spend some time with your kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absurd premise","review":"This book is a classic case of academic ivory-tower absurdity, or perhaps more cynically, one written to be controversial and therefore generate sales.

Secondly, how can we believe our children are more affected by the kid down the street than by the people under whose roof they live? Harris seems to have written this book to prove she is not responsible for the problems of her adopted daughter, whose growing up years were much more difficult than those of Harris' natural born daughter. Has Harris done any reading on adopted children? It seems quite likely that much of her adopted child's problems stemmed from feelings born of being an adopted child. I believe many factors determine how a child behaves, including friends and acquaintances, heredity, etc. But I have seen all around me how individual parents affect their children by the way they treat them, the time they spend with them, the values and mores they impart, what the parents emphasize as important or unimportant, etc. Parents do matter!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly argued and written","review":"This writer relies upon a patchwork of primarily anecdotal evidence, as well as often flawed and inconsistent logic, to conclude that there is relatively little influence parents have over their children's development.

These correlations are not based on any kind of control group and the sample size is not specified which leads you to believe she either doesn't know or care about proper research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of paper","review":"Too simplistic, illogical, and absurd. To assert that parents - and the lack or abundance of infant/child nurturance, or even potentially abusive homes- do not affect the long-term psychological outcomes and mental health of an individual is outrageous. While evolutionarily, our genes play a far more important role than our familial environment- and while peers are very important (particularly during adolescence), the mere suggestion that parents can abdicate responsibility for every aspect of their child-become-adult's adjustment is irresponsible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-written yet ultimately pointless","review":"OF COURSE nature matters!

It's in the archives there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every peer group has the ability to create it's own culture.","review":"When I read Harris' book I felt very strongly that she had come upon a truth. I too, frequently wondered about children and their abillity to create a new language when they lacked a common language. I felt that somehow this fact was more than a curiosity. It said something very profound about humans. Judith Harris' theory has a lot of explaining power. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew! What a relief!","review":"I'm sure this book will be greatly lauded by many \\"experts\\" and parents alike. If I wrote a book stating that what you eat really has no effect upon your health, I know it would receive the same response. This work, standing on a mountain of specious facts (her evidence is derived mainly from questionaires, in lieu of actual studies), basically states that there is no difference between good parents or bad parents. That you have very little effect upon who your child becomes. This is great news to all the guilt-ridden parents of the world! Don't worry! Since you have such a limited influence over your child, you don't even have to set a good example! As a parent, I think this book is more than just erroneous and self-serving. Its dangerous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What she didn't say is here","review":"Baumrind, Diana. The average expectable environment is not good enough: A response to Scarr. Child Development.

Ask your library to get a copy of it to see what Harris didn't tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A completely new look at why we are who we are","review":"This book is a true 'paradigm-shifter'. In my readings on the socialistation of children, this is also the first book I have found in a long time which almost totally accords with what I consider to be common-sense notions, that parents are simply not the be all and end all of why we turn out the way we are. The great tragedy of the way some people have received this book is the tendency at times to criticise the implications of the author's argument, or to mount personal attacks on the author, rather than to question the truth of what the author is saying. One criticism levelled at 'The Nurture Assumption' it merely relieves bad parents of guilt. This is not true. Children have rights to be treated well - and they possess these rights as children - not merely as future adults. The originality and intellectual fertility of 'The Nurture Assumption' is a great contribution to our search for the answer to the eternal question of why we are who we are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required reading...","review":"...for any parent, any psychologist, or anyone interested in humans: how they develop, grow, behave, and interact with others. It's shocking that I never find this on the \\"Parenting\\" shelves of bookstores. Fascinating, and incredibly lucidly argued and evidenced."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little irritating","review":"I found this book quite boring and irritating. I found it repetetive and her conclusions became too predictable. It is largely concerned with debunking research, this is ok if you have paid a lot of attention to the research in question. If you haven't you may wonder what is the point of reading all her criticisms. I agree with her advice to get kids out of a \\"bad\\" peer group by moving house or schools."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Balanced View Of \\"Spiritual\\" Prosperity","review":"I agree that the \\"law\\" of tithing has often been abused. Churches are among the offenders, but there are many other self-improvement promoters guilty of using the \\"prosperity principle\\" to enrich themselves. I don't think Eric Butterworth was really one of the shady ones. In fact, he notes that it isn't really the monetary giving that is important, but your overall thought process and intent as you are giving. Nor does he require that the giving be in money, but of time, effort, etc. as an equally acceptable currency. (Interestingly, this \\"philosopy\\" works no matter your spiritual bent, or lack thereof, since giving back always benefits someone.) If you are exploring the many so-called prosperity philosophies, systems and teachings, I think you should give this nearly 30 year old work a try. Eric is gone, so he's not personally benefitting from his efforts. Perhaps you will."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prosperity Process","review":"If you are on a spiritual journey and want to understand how money relates to your quest, this is the book to own. Butterworth takes us on a journey of looking at what we believe about money and gives us a spiritual understanding of it. It goes beyond the simple message of the Law of Attraction to a deeper experience of it. A must-have book in every New Thought Library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A catalyst for economic prosperity","review":"Spiritual Economics is a well written book in the form of Christianity called \\"New Thought\\". I found the book quite inspiring. Prosperity and abundance are at the core of this book, however, it is not limited to economic prosperity. This book has led me to read other great books from similar writers. I read this book a few months ago and I have already set it aside for a second reading. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Church propaganda","review":"This book was written to be used in Unity Church study groups all over the country to put psychological pressure on church members to tithe a tenth of their income to their local Unity Church. If you believe in tithing, you will like the book. If you don't, you won't like it. I don't like it as I believe it was written to manipulate people to feel guilty if they don't give a lot of their money to the church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achieving Financial Prosperity on a Higher Level","review":"Many people make the mistake of associating poverty and piety. Nothing could be further from the truth of the creator's divine plan for us. The universe is an abundant place and as children of the creator, we are heir to the abundance, wealth and prosperity that it has to offer. Remove the shackles from your mind and take your rightful place in the kingdom of plenty. Spiritual Economics has made a significant impact on my life! I share it others through my \\"Millionaire University\\" Reading list on my website!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read","review":"This book is the best book I've ever read thus far connecting spirituality with financial abundance. I am currently on my second-pass through it and as I read the words, it reminds me that WE ARE NOT VICTIMS of what's going on \\"out there\\" to determine our successes and failures. It's all determined by our thoughts, beliefs and perceptions. This book will speak to your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor programming book","review":"Simpy put, this book is of poor quality and has a misleading title. Both the information presented and the printed code are full of errors. Furhtermore the code in the book is not the same as the code on the disk. Much of the code is so bad it takes an excessive effort to get it to compile. The title of the book \\"... Using Visual C++ 6.0\\" is an outright lie. The book was written for VC 5.0. The VC 6.0 information was added as an after thought (usually mentioned in the last few pages of each chapter) in an attempt to bring the book upto date before release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this book!","review":"I made the very stupid mistake of buying this book. Please do not commit the same mistake. The book is supposed to \\"teach\\" (in order for the reader to \\"learn\\") ActiveX development. If this book teaches anything, it is how to use the Wizards to create components. It makes no attempt to explain the mountains of code that the wizards create. Also, some of the examples do not work. I would have loved to have been able to fix them (that is usually how a programmer learns the most), but I lack the knowledge to do it and the book is certainly no help in that department. Then to add insult to injury, the book's web site is under construction and has no listings of errata or any other kind of help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad I can't enter 0 stars.","review":"Although I'm only starting as a C++ programmer, even I could write better code than this guy. I was greatly amused by shortening up his very verbose code examples to just 5 or 10 lines in places.If you have the time to spend/waste/squander trying to make his programs work as presented in the book, you will learn much about the MS VC++ environment. But trust me - you won't learn much from this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Follow the examples step by step and don't enter any data other than what was in the screen shot or, it will blow up. This ranks right at the bottom of the pile with Scott Hillier and Dan Mesick's books. The Tom Armstrong book is outstanding and it's cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff not enough substance","review":"If you are considering buying this book to learn ActiveX, look some where else. This book is not structured with any real logical order in teaching someone how to program. It's not even a good book to teach you how to use the ATL wizard for beginners. It falls short of any proper explaination on any of it's topics. I do not recommend this book for anybody that wants to learn how to program ActiveX."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible waste of paper","review":"Most of the sample programs in the book fail to work. But, the program on the cd works but the code is completely different from the code in the book. Also, he creates ATL code with the MFC dependency just so he can use CString. Does the author know how to use standard C++ like maybe basic_string. In addition he never mentions anything about adding metafile support so that you can use the control in something other than the test container nor does he bother much with the OC96 standard. If you're not new to C++ but want to learn about ActiveX controls read Julian Templeman's MFC COM for MFC controls or Richard Grimes Beginning ATL for ATL controls. If you know C++ and stl at all this book will probably rate below most high school beginning programming books. Just make sure that you look at it in a book store first and be happy that Amazon has a return policy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Could Be There for You","review":"I got turned on to this album back in the early to mid 90's and have never tired of it; listening to it is like revisiting an old friend and having a killer conversation. On this record, Steve Forbert offers an incredibly well written version of one man's life perspective. \\"Responsibility\\" and \\"You Cannot Win 'Em All\\" are favorites of mine. I like the personal feel that Steve gets when he strips down the tunes to his guitar and vocal with light accompaniment. His lyrics sound like the diary of what might be a young father that has taken a few knocks in life and come back up swinging. This a great album for anyone that enjoys upbeat acoustic folk. The record meant so much to me that I had a friend tell Steve so at one of his shows. My friend told me that Steve smiled and said, \\"Glad that I could be there for him.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL","review":"IT WAS GREAT AND CAN NOT WAIT FOR THE NEXT BOOK.

When I first picked up _Seventeenth Summer_, I was a little turned off by some of the old-fashioned language, and wondered how I could relate to a book written in 1942. But _Seventeenth Summer_ describes the emotions of first love so vividly that it doesn't feel old-fashioned at all. Instead, you will find yourself feeling like Maureen Daly wrote your own life story- from that wonderfully free but kind of scared way you feel when you've just graduated from high school, to how you feel when you first go out with a guy you really click with, to the way your view of your family changes as you find yourself growing up (this probably comes from the fact that the author was only 19 when she started writing the book, and modeled the characters and situations on her own life). Don't be put off by the dippy cover photo, or the year that it was written- this is one of the best books you will ever read about being seventeen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"Seventeenth summer was a book I found at the library no one had told me about it but when i saw the cover i couldnt resist. It didnt even take 24 hours to read i couldnt put the book down. Jack and Angie may be made up but they are so real to me and anyone who will read this book.

THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. Let me summ it up for you. I wouldn't even wipe my behind with this book its so awful. One of the worst books I have ever read. And I only say that about books I have to read.

Whether Maria is \\"bad\\" or not is irrelevant: Castel is so full of hate and acts it out on her because, like many other victims, she's become vulnerable to him. The fact that she understands his art is just the reason he was attracted to her, just like other abusers/assasins are attracted to their victims because of their beauty or charm; whatever it is, they'll find an excuse to destroy it, like OJ Simpson destroyed Nicole and Othello, Desdemona."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing all over","review":"I did not like this item.

It is very intriguing from the get go as one learns the outcome of the novel first and then the story develops afterwards. The protagonist Juan is a reclusive painter striving for acknowledgement. Maria becomes an obsession since she is the only one who can understand his work. His passion, obsession and desesperation leads him to kill Maria and gives the readers insight to his \\"tunel\\" (his torchered inner soul).The only other novel that I read along these lines in terms of uniqueness of plot and intrigue was L'entranger by Albert Camus.

The account does not invoke any interventions by supernatural beings (although of course all the characters believe in their own gods); rather, the narration is cleverly constructed of secular events that might easily have given rise to the myths we all know.Agamemnon in this sequel makes Machiavelli look like Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm.

I noticed a lot of people smiling at me when I rode by and can only assume it is because I looked so cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great helmet!","review":"I thought my 14 year old son would hate the color but he absolutely loves this item.

This helmet adjusts to fit perfectly and provides a high level of protection (lots of coverage of your entire head).

I crossed my fingers and got lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"This helmet is almost too cool looking to wear...","review":"I never cared much for the foam \\"Ice Cooler\\" type helmets and have only worn hard shell type helmets in the past.. I have been purchasing parts and accessories for an old beach cruiser I am putting a 35.5 cc motor kit on here at Amazon and found a good deal on this helmet and had to have it... I wear a size 7 3/8 hat and found that this large size helmet fit me perfectly right out of the box... If it hadn't there wouldn't have been any problem since it comes with thicker and thinner pads with hook and loop fasteners to be used for adjusting for a looser or tighter fit.. A plain helmet without the wild graphics are available at the local WallyWorld for a few dollars more but I hate going into the place... Once again I have gotten what I needed at a decent price on Amazon... It's become a habit but not a bad one."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, but it just big looking on the head","review":"I am still giving this helmet 4 stars because it's a great build quality, and feels great on the head. But honestly it is just TOO bulky looking. I got the white and when looking in the mirror I felt like a storm trooper. I recently tried on a Protec helmet of a similar style, and the helmet fit me just as well and LOOKED much smaller on the head too. I am sending this one back in favor of the Protec, but I do think if you're not too concerned about the look of the helmet, this could be the one for you. I'd love to see Bell redesign this helmet to be a little more sleek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bell Helmet","review":"I bought for my 13 year old son. He loves the style, it has a good fit and over all great Helmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protection and aesthetics.","review":"This is the exact helmet I has in mind when I was looking for a \\"Cool\\" helmet. It has the shape and look of a skating helmet as opposed to the weird obviously-foam biking helmet. I put it on my head, made a few adjustments, and was on my way (I ripped off the \\"Bell\\" sticker and put on one of my own.).The only thing that might be an issue is that it is hotter than it maybe should be. There are vents, but maybe there are not as many or they are not as well placed as the ones in the helmets the kids make fun of. I sweat in this helmet. A Lot. But that is a trade-off. I would rather sweat than look un\\"Cool\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-built helmet.","review":"I've never worn a helmet while cycling. Start riding a bike when I was cycling four years old and I am much older now. I really did not like the design of most of the other helmets. They looks sort of dorky. When I found these on Amazon, I really like the looks of them. When I received it I was very please find that it is a beautiful helmet. It is constructed well and fits perfectly. Additional pads come with it, so you can ensure yourself a proper fit. I think my only complaint is that it was hard to find the sizing chart. I had to go to the Bell site to find one.

However I must admit I'd never bought any of his solo stuff (only because there's so much music so little time).One thing I notice about Iommi's solo stuff is that it's a bit softer sounding and not as frantic as sabbath on some albums (like dehumanizer). However, Tonys IS the riff master no matter who he plays with. This album reminds me a bit of seventh star but with a lot more updated feel (not so 80's).Another thing that blew me away was how good of a singer Glenn Hughes is. You don't really get an appreciation of how good he was with sabbath as he wasn't there long enough. Personally, I don't think he fit the sabbath frame (I think Dio took that band to heights only he could of), but for this album - take it for what it's worth - a great rock/metal album.The albums only going to grow on me. Every sabbath fan should have this in their collection"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"I'm a HUGE Glenn Hughes fan and an equally HUGE Black Sabbath (and, thus, Tony Iommi) fan.

He has nothing to prove in that regard. It saddens me so much to have to say this, but this CD is horrible. Nothing new. Childish lyrics. Predictable. Weak material. After listening to this CD a couple times, I switched on the radio. By coincidence, they were playing War Pigs. Wow....what a difference. Bright, well produced and bombastic. Done with feeling. Now I am not suggesting that Tony and Glenn should be doing that type, or sound, but please, can somebody please write some decent material for these guys. How is possible that such an incredibly talented group of musicians come up with such a bunch of garbage? Didn't someone in the production department tell these guys that this stinks? It is almost embarassing to listen to. I eagerly await Tony's next release. But if it should come out as this one did, that will be the end of it for him. I will just haul out some of the older material, and bask in it's greatness."},{"rating":"1","title":"How people sometimes overestimate an album...","review":"Of course, in this mediocre and utterly obnoxious musical scenario we have nowadays (thanks in great part to MTV, the Grammy awards), old giants like Iommi and Hughes, evn when deliver a moderately shineless record, are much better than the new artists.But this album is simply not good. A lot of the songs seem the same, with a dreadful nu-metal style to some of them. There's nothing here so amazing as some reviews say. Nothing here is even as good as THE ETERNAL IDOL or even THE SEVENTH STAR 9to mentin another albume featuring Iommi and Hughes).Mos of the sogns are slow, boring, pedestrian. The exception goes for WHAT YOU'RE LIVING FOR. as for Hughes vocals, of course they are still breathtaking. But the songs.."},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars- Even worse than 96' Dep Sessions","review":"I got to tell you that I can hardly stand Glenn Hughes' singing voice. He just sounds crazy and makes Tony Martin look like the greatest singer that ever lived. Let's get back to making Black Sabbath albums with Tony on board. Okay, Mr.Iommi! I'm sure there are probably millions who agree with me about Glenn's voice. I think Mr.Iommi should take a long break, and think about getting Tony back, and when you know you got some good writing, then give the Sab thing a go again. This cd sounds more like hard driving rock, than any type of metal. Save your money folks, and maybe go out and buy an Iced Earth cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"tony please don't go on this way ...","review":"Uninspired, monotonous and no surprises at all. Let's get some things straight first. I'm a guitarist and Tony's always been one of my biggest influences. From the first Sabbath record up to the Seventh Star album this guy's playing impressed me more than anything. He had the riffs, the melodies, the rhythm changes and the sound no one else had. And what do I hear on this record ? None of all that. Even Glenn sounds bored and singing in his \\"Midlands\\" dialect seems to accentuate this feeling. The chemistry between two of rock's finest artists just doesn't work on this album. The magic was already fading on the previous Iommi solo album but now it's definitely gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, again. Makes me sad!","review":"I have been a die-hard Tony Iommi supporter for decades. When Ozzy left, I supported Iommi. When Dio left, I supported Iommi. I followed Sabbath, and still listen to my Sabbath cd's. But the three Iommi cd's that I have purchased, including this one, FUSED, have all disappointed me. In this case, it's more about Glenn Hughes, whose voice I find annoying on this effort.I would love to have seen Iommi team up with someone like David Lee Roth, or when Rob Halford was still roaming solo. Tony needs a GREAT vocalist, and he comes out strong. Tony is a great performer, love his riffs, but they are drowned out by the annoying Glenn Hughes on this album. Heck, even someone like Joe Lynn Turner would have been an improvement on Glenn Hughes. Isn't Vince Neil looking for a job these days?Ug, so yeah, this album is ONLY for the die hard Tony Iommi and/or Glenn Hughes fan. Otherwise, by an older Sabbath album."},{"rating":"1","title":"STOP STOP STOP","review":"Yes we know you want to release new music. Just stop.. This should be the last thing that you release.

A love story between werewolf and vampire? No! Thats a Movie without any action, no SFX, no heart blood, so boaring that i wonder why even the vampires did not die of thirst. The werewolves? Their transitions to animated fur balls had been the best scenes in that movie.So dear Bosses of \\"Summit Entertainment\\" - please fire those yappie managers who accepted that screenplay before you go bankrupt or they abort your studio.Sorry - i did not imagine that such a bad DVD had been promoted this year.The good news - never watched such a time wasting movie nor i expect that such exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I am the type of person that will give any movie a chance despite what all the critics say, but this one was a force to be reckoned with... a devastatingly boring one. I have never wanted to leave a theater during a movie, but the thought crossed my mind several times. It is just long and whiny. I love that everyone says that if you have read the books you will be a huge fan. Just because something is popular doesn't mean that it is good, smart, or cutting edge. I gave it a 2 star simply because it was so bad that its great to make fun of. Wait! If you got a scratch reading this review let me take my shirt off in extra slow motion for you.

This series is wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this set's lack of extras","review":"The good news: New Moon is much better done than Twilight and the acting is also much improved.The bad news (and the reason for the low rating): This version of the DVDs does not contain any deleted or extended scenes. And the only commentary is by the director and editor. (I enjoyed their commentary but would have liked to hear the actors' take, too.)There's already a very nice review here by E-Transitions who took the time to list out where you have to buy other DVD versions of this movie if you want the extras Summit did not include in this version. I don't buy a lot of DVDs, so perhaps this greedy practice of parceling out the extras between different versions in order to get buyers to purchase multiple copies is standard, but I think it's awful and I'm really mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie with fast delivery","review":"As a big fan of the Twilight Saga movies, it was great to start my collection.

Enjoyed watching the movie with friends. A good addition to the twilight series. I look forward to watching the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"even worse than twilight!","review":"The movie was hard to sit through. The acting and plot were so terrible and contrived that I found it impossible to enjoy anything. it was frustrating seeing Bella pine in her room for months after Edward ended their relationship. She should just have chosen Jacob and stuck with him, he was far better boyfriend material then Edward. he was a thoughtful and nice guy, and unlike Edward, he wasn't some sparkly pretty boy with a head of perpetually messy hair. This movie was even worse than Twilight. Some of the scenes had Bella staring off with some wistful expression almost as if she would cry, it was so terrible. Some of the camerawork and cuts done for scenes were just horrible and contrived. I didn't think it was possible to make a movie worse than Twilight, but I guess the producers sure proved me wrong!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Vamp fanatics.","review":"I loved the Twilight Saga books and the movies are a close second. I felt the new director did a much better job with the special effects. Kristin Stewart took acting lessons. I still wanted to laugh hysterically during her 'nightmares'.Overall a good movie for pre-teen and older. I have to add though, Twilight completely pales in comparison to Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy, which is geared towards a little bit older of an audience, maybe mid/late teens and up. It has a much more complex plot and interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd time is the key","review":"The 2-disc set of Twilight: New Moon is well worth the price. The acting is much more natural and believable than the first film, Twilight. There is more chemistry between the actors, and more of the book is evident. Am anxious for the 3rd in the series to come on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Crap","review":"Still disappointing. I really had hope but between the garble'd lines and poor acting it was pretty hard to stomach. I think the wolves chasing the vampire was the highlight of the movie. It completely lacked any emotional connection, I think it was actually worse than twilight if that's even possible. It completely amazes me that with such a huge budget and fan base, they still can't even get close to getting it right. The cheesy outfits, the make-up, even the soundtrack was bad. Go read the books, there's no comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampires looked better","review":"Not as good as Twilight, but the story is sad.

If you have not watched them, its a good idea to start from the beginning and work your way through them in order or else they will not make sense. The books are a lot better then the movies, but I watched the movies way before I even started the books [the movie are actually what got me to read the books]. This one has more action then the first movie, which was nice & since I like Jacob better, this movie was my favorite out of all of them. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"very misleading","review":"I was sad so see the version I received was a French copy.

By the end of the movie, it seemed like there was a lot of suspense, but not the right kind of suspense. I found myself with enough time between the character's lines to figure out what I'm doing for the rest of the week/month. A lot of times the pauses in the dialog were filled by grunts, sighs, and heavy breathing, which is more than a little uncomfortable. Also, I found myself wondering how two such awesome genre's as Vampires and Werewolves would get themselves wrapped up in something as lame as a highschooler with a breathing problem. Do yourself a favor and rent/buy/obsess over something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the frying pan to the fire","review":"That's what Bella gets when she discovers that her new found love is actually a 'werewolf'..(This woman seems to attract the wrong kinda creatures..opps, sorry guys!!) anyway the first half plods through at snail pace..while the second half is better.the special effects are B grade & the guys wear more make up than the girls..The movie is more of a kid flick than a chick flick, Nevertheleass I still enjoyed it. hopefully the DVD/Blu Ray release will have many extras including a audio cd of the movie & a first look at the next movie in the 'Twilight saga'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hilarious","review":"Hilarious. The first Twilight movie just sucked but this one was worth watching for the unintentional humor every time Robert Pattinson came on screen. Seriously, I think they overdid the sensitive thing if that was what they were going for with his character....Anyway, I gave it two stars because I don't think it the movie was well made but I might have given it more if I were just judging things based on whether I enjoyed the movie or not, because it genuinely did make me laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"They sent me the French DVD!","review":"I ordered this as a present for my Edward Cullen loving wife.

Why couldn't this DVD contain them? but again the movie NEW MOON was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"easily the WORST of the Twilight trilogy!","review":"Oy, there were certain places in this movie when I was just cringing and howling, that's how bad it was...some of the most appallingly corny, dopey dialogue and ridiculous plotlines imaginable. Imagine the first episode with the cheesy scenes amped up about ten times, and without the more decent parts.The ladies will be pleased by Jacob's newfound buffness, however.

I can understand a young girl who still has Hannah Montana posters up in her room falling all over this but WOMEN? ADULT WOMEN?A vampire movie (especially one versus werewolves or dogs on steroids) should have a little more pulse pounding excitement. People spend good money to be entertained and just like TWILIGHT, I was bored silly. The movie does have some interesting concepts in it but the execution is terrible and lacking.NOW FOR MY BLU RAY THOUGHTS: I am disgusted that there are several versions out depending on where you buy it. That is a joke and an insult to the consumer. The print is strong and the sound is a nice mix. Special features are bland. FINAL THOUGHTS: I wish I rented or borrowed it.

Didn't really care for the differences between the two versions of Bella's meeting Aro and the rest either. I know \\"Volterra\\" had to look different because a real Italian town was used, but the interior set stuff, why change that?

That said, maybe other adults won't waste 2 hours of their lives on this mind-numbing piece of drivel. Nothing but constant whining, sad atmosphere, sad music, characters with downcast eyes and stupid questions of \\"why they're not together\\". Believe me, the melodrama is stratospheric.I actually bought this BLU-ray version thinking it would have awesome special effects and great extras. I had no idea the games SUMMIT ENTERTAINMENT was playing with its distribution practices. Since it seems Amazon got screwed by SUMMIT I've ended up with nothing. And no, I won't be hopping around to Wal-mart, Target, whatever, just to get all versions of the extras.

I felt very disappointed at how many details were left out, the completely different look of the sets, the actors... I realize to have included more about each character, or relationship, would have taken more time than one movie would allow; I just felt like I was being told half a story. As \\"popular\\" as these books have become, step it up and get better direction/production.Kudos to Taylor Lautner for stepping into the actual look of \\"Jacob\\", though. Wouldn't hurt for Pattinson to do the same, considering his character in the book is so often described as \\"perfect\\".If you haven't read the books and think you might be interested, do yourself a favor and read them. I was a skeptic, thinking they were \\"teen reading\\", and really, really enjoyed them, and I'm old enough to be the Mom of the focus group.

I also think that the actual book was not as strong as the Twilight one so I don't blame the film makers. The story line is a little anying regarding Bella feeling sorry for herself and not being kind to anyone trying to be nice to her.

Pattinson doesn't fare quite as bad, but not much better. Taylor Lautner really stepped it up and I really felt for him (I honestly believe he has a bright future ahead). Billy Burke and Anna Kendrick as usual shined during the little screen time they had. Ashley Greene and Kellan Lutz did wonderful with what they were given, etc. The bright spots were Fanning and Sheen. Sheen was wonderfully creepy and scary. Don't pay full price for this.

I am giving this 2 stars because the case is upsetting me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twilight Saga New Moon (Borders Exclusive)","review":"This movie is awesome. Since there are three different Twilight Saga New Moon DVDs with extra features, I chose this one because I'm big on extended and deleted scenes.

Based on what extra features you prefer should determine which DVDs collection to get unless you're a die hard fan and want them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up.","review":"Being a lover of all things vampire, I really WANT to like The Twilight Saga. Before seeing \\"New Moon,\\" I saw it as a chance for redemption, since the first film in this series was tolerable, yet slow and a bit shallow. But after seeing this film, I'm convinced that I should give up and move onto something new. This entire film could've been replaced by 130 minutes of Taylor Lautner running around with his shirt off, and I would've felt like I actually got my money's worth. At least the plot would be more interesting that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I found this movie really boring, maybe its a movie for young people but , then again, I think its still boring.You spend all the time waiting for some one to be smart enough to see that the girl is desperate for a kiss, dosn't matter where it comes from, vampires , wolves or donkeys, but a KISSSSSSS, PLEASSSSSSSE !!!!! No way. Finally you want to get in the movie and help her,but you fall asleep first..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another sad attempt","review":"How sad that the vampires have lost all their mystery and grace, and teenage love has lost it's intensity and angst. What happened to the passion and magic of the books? It's not here. Have to say this is the second epic fail in this series, so once again, buy the book. The first half of the movie is as spectacularly boring as the first film, the second half picks up some but only by adding action scenes that weren't in the book and leaving out others that would have been better and more interesting. Deviations from the story do nothing to add to the story or to the interest. Again, skip this movie it's stolen my happy memories and depth of the story presented in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got fooled...","review":"I have read some of the reviews, and maybe I am missing something but I only received 3 cds of nothing...no movie...nothing that the title implied...somebody let me know..because I am confused and disappointed...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I ordered!!","review":"The Blu Ray I received for Twilight-New Moon was a Canadian copy.

It remains true to the story line in the book in ways the first one did not. My one complaint is with Amazon and not the movie. Why in the world would I pre-order a movie months in advance and then still wait another week to receive the movie! I could have gone to Target on the day of release and bought the 3 disc special edition. Instead, as a loyal Amazon customer I pre-ordered WAY in advance and yet here I am still waiting for my movie to be delivered. Very, very disappointed. What is the advantage of pre-order?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A little frustrated","review":"I love the movie for all the reasons so many others have gone into - but am I the only one who noticed one major difference from the books, as well as from the first movie? In the books Stephenie Meyer makes a big point of telling us that one gauge of the vampires' hunger level is how dark their eyes are - yet in the big scene in Volterra, when Edward looks like five kinds of hell and obviously hasn't fed in weeks, his eyes are the same glowing golden color they were in the beginning of the movie. Come on, his eyes should have been pitch-black!Okay, got that out of my system. Grrr. Other than that discrepancy, I think the movie is an excellent adaptation of the book, although I do wish we could have seen at least some of the return trip home, and Charlie's reaction to Edward's presence. The transition from Italy to Washington is a little too abrupt, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must see!!","review":"LOVE IT!! Love anything to do with Twilight!!

Boring. Have to admit the books are much better. These movies just cannot hold my attention. They are very slow paced. I don't even get any 'romantic' story in this. All I can figure out is people like these movies for the actors or actresses. I wouldn't recommend this. The werewolves are not werewolves at all. Just large wolves. Very disappointed in this film. I don't hate it but it's definitely on the bottom of any movie watching list I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"deleted scenes","review":"I was looking for the deleted scenes, but found out they are not on the version from Amazon.

Masculine Werewolves!!!","review":"For the past two years, I've avoided the Twilight saga like the plague because it just looked so melodramatic and ruined the image of scary vampires like Dracula. Instead, we get a Glampire, buff Werewolves, and a whiny teen named Bella who is suicidal over them. There was a double feature at my theater last week, so I finally decided to cave in and watch. Bella is just ridiculous. After she gets a paper cut at her birthday party, Jasper Cullen tries to attack her. The Cullens soon decide to leave Forks, and Bella goes into a deep depression. Whenever she gets an adrenaline fix, she can see glimpses of Edward. If you love glampires and melodramatic love stories, I'm sure you'll love NEW MOON!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"*****************","review":"I really love this movie .......it came so fast .......GREAT service thank you again:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly awful","review":"I enjoyed the first \\"Twilight\\" film, and looked forward to the seeing where the story would go. But I never imagined they would wind up with such a poorly plotted, slow-moving, incoherent mess, or that they would so shamelessly push the teen-heartthrob angle at the expense of trying to actually tell a good story. This was just awful. And the actor that plays her second love interest, the werewolf kid, is so intensely unattractive -- why, why, why, oh why do we have to keep watching him take his shirt off and try and look all sexy? Yuchh. Anyway, this movie was a real embarrassment. If this is the direction their headed in, I'd be amazed if they could pull it together again for the third film.

The movie skipped in 4 different times in the movie. I took it back to wal-mart and they told me at least 20 other people had the same problem.

But, the special effects seemed cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars","review":"I can't believe how bad this movie was. I walked out after 45 minutes because the acting was so lame and the plot so ridiculous. It's a shame that young women and girls go to movies like this and end up thinking that this is the best that the movies can offer.If they want to watch romance and/or vampire films, there are so many more examples that are of better quality, and I sure hope they don't think that love is in any way like the rellationships they see here. The books have to be better than this, at least I hope so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is SO BAD","review":"I liked the books, a lot, actually, I read them all couple of times. Twilight movie was OK, not great, but fine. But New Moon is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In the book, my favourite part is when they are on the way from Italy and then after they get home. Those scenes are not in the movie at all. Edward looked pretty cute in the Twilight movie, even though not as cute as I though he should be, but in New Moon is looks like a zombie, especially when standing next to Jacob. I am very disappointed in this movie, I think the director could've done much more with the movie. And by the way, I think Kristin Stewart as Bella sucks. She acts like EMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"You people are imbeciles if you want to buy this","review":"This movie along with the Twilight movie RUINED the Twilight series. If you actually liked the book before it became outrageously popular, do NOT watch this movie. I watched the first movie and was very let down by the poor casting in my personal opinion and the even worse acting. I saw the previews for New Moon and I feared it was going to be just as bad as the first movie. Many vital parts of the plot were left out or altered completely to fit in a different section of the plot. But I'm an optimist and watched it anyway. I was let down. Eclipse is going to be just as bad, if not worse. Stephanie Meyer was a genius... until she sold the rights to this movie and such a horrible cast was chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love the twilight saga","review":"I have never been so into any other book and movie series, the twilight saga is the best for me!!!

After waiting 3 months til it came out I was very anxious to watch it, but when I put the disc in my Blu Ray player it would stop at 17 seconds and not play a single thing. I had not used my Blu Ray player in awhile so I began to think maybe it was broken, so I went and bought another movie on Blu Ray and it worked just fine. So I called Amazon and they ended up sending me a second New Moon Blu Ray and it did the same thing! I was very frustrated at that point and called Amazon again and they ended up giving me a refund and temporarily removed the item from their site. All in all Amazon's customer service was very helpful, but it was very frustrating to receive two defective items. I ended up purchasing the DVD version from a local store instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was painful to watch!","review":"Bite me! Please! You think that is the whole plot. Sure, you could lose your soul, but my shoes have soles and I've lost them before. This film is boring and drags along to a punch line at the end leading to another sequel. It isn't even on par with the soap opera Dark Shadows from the late 60s, but I shouldn't insult those fans. Boring and pointless! I watched it on Netflix blu-ray and bid it goodbye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"I recieved this Blu-ray DVD and it wouldn't play the movie itself...played all the stupid previews etc. but the movie was sound and no picture and before you ask ...yes I do have a New Samsung Blu-ray DVD player and it plays all the others just fine...so unhappy.

I saw reviews that New Moon was better (which is why I watched it), but Kristen Stewart is still horrible-- she looks as if she had a hard time remembering her lines with her constant stammering of words in every direction. I honestly think her only role was to look pretty. It was difficult to watch this movie. Lautner and Pattinson acted better, but the overall film was weak and boring. I gave this 2 stars because at least there is some slight entertainment value in waiting to see if Eclipse will redeem this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"new moon dvd","review":"The movie I purchased, New Moon,was delivered very quickly and was great!

I was incredibly disappointed to say the least, so much so that I even resent giving it a one star rating! The plot was weak/ non-existant and really just boring. When Edward Cullen says something about \\"let's wait five more years\\" I was thinking \\"OH hell, 5 more sequels in order to outdo the Harry Potter franchise, so we can all get fabulously rich selling our tat to kids!\\". This film was all about dreary teen angst and dreamy boys getting their shirts off and acting heroically for girls - which is fine in its place, but not for me or anyone much over the of 20 I suspect. I hear the next in the series is even worse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawnfest. The book still rocks though.","review":"This movie was terrible. The acting was bad, and I can't understand how anyone who read the book could actually like this. I feel like a lot of fans of the book support it blindly just so they can keep making more movies. I loved the book, but i can't support these films. I hate the films thus far. Why do fans accept mediocrity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"These Vampires Suck!","review":"This is a vampire movie, but nobody gets bit. That about sums it up. Boring, lame and really should be on the WB Network. Not good... Not good at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"I'm 45 minutes into this film and can't think of any good reason to finish watching it. There is NO STORY. Belle is pining for Edward and fixing a motorcycle. Wow, I'm on the edge of my seat. I've never been able to see what the young ladies see in Robert Pattinson, and this makes me wonder even more. But to each his (or in this case, her) own. The only thing keeping me in suspense is when does Taylor Lautner cut his hair? If you're a fan of the series or fan because all your other friends are gaga for this series, then watch it, otherwise, catch up on any missed episodes of Buffy. She's far more entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Go Wrong","review":"If you loved the first movie, then you'll love this one. The scenes with Jacob and the wolves were amazing. Much better than I expected. The fight scene with the Volturi was so, so good. There was something about the look of the vampires that I didn't quite like, though. Their eyes, I think, were different in Twilight. But it's such a fun movie. I took one star off because I don't like how Summit requires you to watch all the previews every time you watch the movie. I should be able to go straight to the menu."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's better than the first.","review":"I rented this from Amazon to recap before watching Breaking Dawn Pt. 2 in theaters.

My older son had this in Jr. Kindergarten and when the year was over he asked for this toy and another (Clics) so I bought both. I tend to like the Clics better, but my older son likes them equally. I do like the convenience of the parts all returning to a nice, easily closed tub. That's a plus when you have a lot of toys in your home.

As she has evolved as an accordionist she has added so much to her repertoire beyond the traditional Celtic music. At first I found this evolution a bit disconcerting but as a loyal fan I decided to trust the directon Shannon took, which is collaborating with artists of many different styles. She has continued this evolution with her most recent CD (Libertango) which is also quite good.The CD is worth owning if only for the wonderful piece sung by Dessie O'Halloran, \\"Say You Love Me\\", a most endearing love song. I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. O'Halloran in person with the Sharon Shannon band, a memorable performance to say the least.There are many enjoyable tracks on this CD, including some traditional works, and the collaborations with other artists are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!","review":"I bought this on a recommendation and I loved it from the first play.

I have the open-mouthed one pictured here, but another reviewer stated he has the closed-mouth one pictured on the box. I hate when McFarlane does that kind of thing...It's just low and sneaky.The figure itself is great. It's not the most articulated figure McFarlane has done, but the HUGE wings on the figures back more than make up for that. I was totally taken by surprise by the wings- You can't see them at all when the figure is in the box, and I bought it thinking it was a cloak of some kind. I was pleasantly surprised...Overall, The Tooth Fairy makes a welcome addition to the Movie Maniacs collection, and with the movie \\"Darkness Falls\\" about to be released, it should be hard to find soon. Get yours now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"On site image does not match figure","review":"I'm a tad dissapointed to find that the open mouth full of teeth shown on the web site is not what the Tooth Fairy has in its reality.

However, while listening to it, I realized some of the music was the same music used on the CD, \\"Algonquin Suite.\\" I thought my mind was playing tricks on me, so I listened again, then played the AS CD and in one section, it was the same music, redubbed onto \\"Island Paradise.\\" Granted, the nature sounds were different - but it seems someone has taken a short cut or two by just remixing old music tracks with new sounds. While the entire CD is not the exact same music, hearing even one music track that had already been featured on another disc, set in a different natural environment, really did take away much of the enjoyment for me.

Author also ignores the lack of common courtesy among shop owners and the dangers posed by walking after nine PM on the streets, which are taken over by gangs of what are known as Pollillas - translated into \\"Moths\\".The cultural life is hardly taken into account, as it is virtually nonexistent. The greatest parts of visiting Bolivia are all OUTSIDE the cities, yet the author tries to gloss over the fact of the stagnant urban scene, to convince it as a viable tourist option. Totally unreliable view."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not convinced that the authors have ever been to Bolivia","review":"Lonely Planet is generally a great source for guidebooks, but I'm not convinced the authors returned to Bolivia to do research for this updated edition. It seems as if they just slapped on a new cover and republished the previous edition.The restaurant recommendations (if the restaurant recommended is even still open for business, that is) lean heavily on pizza and pasta places that cater to travelers, which is fine if you have traveled all the way to Bolivia to eat pizza with a bunch of German tourists in zip-off hiking pants, but not useful at all if you want an authentic experience.I also had a Rough Guide to Bolivia during my 5-week trip around Bolivia and found that book to be a far superior resource to LP Bolivia. The Rough Guide never disappointed in terms of hotel, restaurant, and sight seeing recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version of Lonely Planet Bolivia","review":"In my understanding the use of a guide book is to help you orient yourself in an unknown surrounding with ease (and help you stay safe).

The \\"sleep\\", \\"eat\\" and \\"get around\\" sections of the book are useful some of the time although I have found the internet to be a more helpful resource.Two stars (instead of three) for the bad maps.

I bought a version that the website claims to be published on December 2012. For example, how can a guide miss an airport in Uyuni (one of the most important destinations in Bolivia)? The airport was built two years ago!!!!!Travel times, travel routes, companies and so on are not accurate any more. The guide is still useful for a general idea of where to go and what do to but it is not reliable for making decisions.On a more specific and personal level, I think this is the last guide I buy for kindle. It is really difficult to navigate and maps are just impossible to use.One ends up wasting a lot of time trying to find stuff and in the process one misses some important bits of information.Summary: Look for another guide if you plan to travel to Bolivia or use this one knowing that for getting around it is not accurate and you'll have to find travel specifics from somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Reader","review":"Perry is working ferociously with the Brain on Venus, desperately trying to learn enough to be able to counter the M.S. invaders and agents.

JAN VACLAV HUGO VORICEK (1791-1825) was a significant composer. He influenced his friend Schubert and won the approval of Beethoven, who was his chief influence. Vorisek's Symphony in D (lamentably his only symphony) is his most poular work. But it is his MASS IN B FLAT that I wish to bring to your notice. I don't know if a mass is supposed to be enjoyable. Perhaps \\"satisfying\\" is the better word. Enjoy the Symphony, but pay special attention to the sumptuous and satifying canonical work.Would that Vorisek had not contracted TB and lived to give us more works on a grand scale. These two will suffice to keep his memory alive.

I thought his explanations of esoteric Buddhist concepts were clear and straightforward, his observations rich with the detail of day-to-day life. The small tome is a superficial--at best--look at this ancient religion, but an honest one. Too bad Moore clings to what he calls his \\"Project Mind\\"--the premise that he's on an anthroplogical mission (to find out what American Buddhism is and why it appeals to us) rather than a spiritual one. Clearly, Moore is seeking more than \\"data\\" on his journey; his chats with spiritual leaders are about much more than \\"good quote.\\" I for one would have related far better to Moore's journalistic journey had he dispensed with the pretense and gotten down to the sticky, messy, uncomfortable business of enlightenment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read, an American journey into Buddhism","review":"I enjoyed reading this book.

Instead, it seems to me to fall into the jazz fusion arena a'la Jeff Beck \\"Wired\\" and \\"Blow By Blow,\\" with a southern flavor that reflects the previous bands these players have been in. There are many Little Feat moments that arise from the rhythm section, but remember that Little Feat were very tight ensemble players. There are also quite a few Dixie Dregs moments in here, too--at times making you think that Steve Morse has snuck up and grabbed the guitar.This is highly-arranged music, but doesn't come off overly structured because truly great musicians can always find ways to mix in soloing to sound spontaneous yet tight. If you love great playing, stop-on-a-dime instrumental arrangements, and a hint of southern greasiness, you'll love this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"top rated","review":"Very good album.

The film is propelled by a pulsating soundtrack featuring Middle Eastern and Spanish gypsy rhythms that is sometimes pretentious (especially during the opening song) but always catchy and interesting. The plotlines is incredulous at times and the shots are also too obviously intended to be symbolic and socially meaningful, at the expense of credibility, but Romain Duris and Lubna Azabal, as the couple searching for meaning and identity by travelling to Algiers, are two of the most interesting and watchable young stars working in French cinema today and make the cinematic road trip to Algeria worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"A musical jouney to home","review":"Lots of music components, while watching the DVD, I feel touched by the music in the background.

But I'm disappointed that he made this movie. The cover synopsis mentioned a great soundtrack and beautiful scenery, and I would have to disagree with both counts (see Himalaya if you want beautiful scenery). The story was as aimless as the two characters, who I never connected with, especially the woman. There was nothing for me to like about her - it seemed like the film went out of its way to make her look a mess and her inner self was also a mess. The wandering culminates in a long, unpleasant, loud, annoying frenetic dance that went on FAR too long. I was relieved when that scene, and the entire movie, was over. I can't say enough how stupid I thought this was. Watch L'Auberge Espagnole, Les Poupees Russes, or other Romain Duris films, but skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Now!","review":"Because Til Tuesday's brief moment in the sun was the mediocre song \\"Voices Carry\\" the only reason anyone is likely to be interested in the band's third and final album (which itself was an unjustified commercial flop) is due to the recent attention lead singer Aimme Mann has been getting for her magnificent solo album \\"Bachelor No. 2.\\" Fans of that album should get \\"Everything's Different Now\\" immediately.Granted the production here does not really have the edge of Mann's solo work, but this is easily made up for by the utter grace and melodic appeal of each and every song here. Songs like \\"Rip in Heaven,\\" \\"Why Must I,\\" \\"J For Jules,\\" \\"The Other End of the Telescope\\" and \\"How Can You Give Up\\" are musts in today's melody deprived world and the other songs here more than hold their own. Don't pass this up Aimee fans. Now is the time to discover \\"Everything's Different Now.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"INTENSELY PERSONAL, ACHINGLY GORGEOUS MUSIC","review":"The third and final Til Tuesday album is one of the great unappreciated gems of modern music. The record company failed to promote this well, goodness only knows why, as bands like Crowded House were very succesful with this kind of music. This album is transitional for Aimee Mann, in that it has several songs that fall more into the more guitar pop mode of her later work. It is an intensely personal break-up album, and in the first person too, with nothing cryptic about it. Why this album never makes best of lists is beyond me, it's one of the best break-up albums I've ever heard, and I've heard Blood on The Tracks,Here,My Dear, and Tunnel of Love. So if you are an Aimee Mann fan and want to delve into her older stuff, start here and also get Voices Carry and Welcome Home by Til Tuesday as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"Aimee Mann's displays her impressive lyrical and musical talent on this sweet yet sinuous collection of often country-inflected melodies.

This CD is a true treasure and as many other folks have noted, the songs are timeless. Aimee Mann's vocals are so heartfelt and the lyrics are so clever, it's clear that this CD was ahead of its time. Do yourself a favor and buy this CD- you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily the smartest pop album of the 80s.","review":"This cd is full of very well crafted song. The Epic suits that hated this album and failed to hear its genius should be taken out and shot. The poor sales of this album is a omen for what now has become pop today.

I was eagerly looking forward to seeing pictures of a young James Herriot, a young 'Siegfried' et al. We fans already knew that the characters names were pseudonyms but did Lord really have to go to so many lengths in almost calling James Herriot a liar ? Why did he feel it so important to reveal so much ? I felt he and Eddie Straiton collaborated in trying to destroy what James Herriot had spent so many years building - a little corner of the world where we can all escape to in our hearts and minds. I wonder how many people will ever be able to enjoy re-reading James Herriots books again after reading this unnecessary 'expose'. Shame on you Graham Lord !"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has the wrong sub-title","review":"I agree with most of the opinions expressed in other reviews - Lord seems to be determined to highlight the inconsistencies in Herriot/Wight's life. Even though it's a well documented and well written book, I really wonder about Lord's motivation for writing it.One comment I haven't read so far, though, is that the book should be sub-titled \\"The Life of a Writer\\". Fully 1/2 of the book discusses his work as a writer - how he got started, how he got published, how he handled fame, etc. That was interesting, but - after reading 4 of Herriot's books - what I really wanted to know was what his daily life as a vet was like (what the sub-title implies). Unfortunately, Lord skims over those decades of Herriot/Wight's life, only focusing on dicrepancies between the Herriot books and reality. Overall, a disapointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you love James Herriot you will hate this book...","review":"If you love James Herriot you will hate this book...The author in attempting to tell the \\"true\\" story spends much of his time diminishing Herriot.I actually threw the book out of a speeding car window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogged down with inane details","review":"I knew James Herriot was really Alf Wight, I didn't need to know that he had a rather embarrassing problem with his bum, that his wife was a bit of a witch and the names/dates of people who graduated from schools he attended. The pace is faltering and gets bogged down with all these inane details. In somewhat tumultuous times, James Herriot brought us a world of beauty, grace and humor. Graham Lord seems to be able to destroy that with a few chapters. The author gave himself so many pats on the back for his early review of Herriot's work, that I am surprised he can still stand straight!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly researched and highly speculative","review":"This can barely be called a biography. The writing gives little insight into the personality and life of \\"James Herriott.\\" Rather it is a poorly researched and highly speculative conglomerate of anecdotes and opinions. The author makes lots of suppositions about many aspects of his subject's life with little to back up his conclusions. Much is made of the fiction versus non-fiction content of the \\"All Creatures Great and Small\\" books, as if it would be incredibly shocking (apparently especially shocking to Americans) to the reader. I love those books and it came as no surprise to me that a good amount of the work is fiction or fictionalized. Mr. Lord has taken what is, essentialy, a newspaper piece (and not a very good one) and streched it into a book. Herriot fans deserve a solid biography of Alf Wight. This isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly disappointing","review":"I was looking forward to reading this book, as I greatly enjoyed Herriot's books, especially the first one (or two). The writing reminded me of term papers I read in college. Lord shows no feeling for the magic of Herriot's storytelling. There is not a trace of humor in this book. There is no discriminination between important and unimportant life events or influences. The best part is the introduction; it unfortunately convinced me to buy the book. I couldn't even finish it. Very disapponting for someone who makes his living reviewing other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, to say the least","review":"A mean-spirited attempt to capitalize on the success of Herriot's books. Even if Graham Lord's assessment is accurate, it is entirely unnecessary to imply that Alf Wight (James Herriot) fictionalized his accounts of life as a Yorkshire vet. Those of us who have read (and loved) Mr. Herriot's stories of his life in \\"Darrowby\\" will be offended by this attempt to convince us that much of the content was fiction rather than fact. Let the man rest in peace and let his many readers enjoy his stories, regardless of whether they were strictly true or not.

While it may be factual, the illusion I had of James Herriot before reading this book was more important to me than possessing the facts of Wight's life.

After the stadium rock of 1995's Good News From The Next World, this, the band's 12th studio album, does a U-turn towards the cool soundscapes of 1982's classic New Gold Dream (81, 82, 83, 84). This makes for a better album. But while there's less pomposity than before, there's still plenty of pose and faux-U2isms, and touches of their Euro-trash lifestyles. Walsh does a good job in the studio mixing in humming synths, distorted vocals, and beautifully numbing guitar. Songs like Glitterball, War Babies and Killing Andy Warhol have an oddly familiar feel but are great songs nonetheless. Once a bloated monster, Simple Minds have shed a few pounds and are now a lither, leaner music machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and fast-moving thriller - and this story is true!","review":"This was an extremely well-written book, a disturbing true story about some really really bad cops who engage in mayhem and murder, and the author does a great job of setting the locale for the reader.

Over all i think this game is ok but could be A LOT better but there working on it now so i'm waiting to be impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks","review":"this game sucks.big fan of the games and series but when they came out with this one they ruined the whole mojo of dragonball z.the last three were outstanding but getting kind of tired of the same ol thing im tired of beating cell and freiza come up with something new like they did in the gt series.my 8 year old son beat this game in 2 hours on hard but he couldnt beat the last three so i went and got my monet back."},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it'll make your mom cry","review":"this game S.U.C.K.S. i mean budokai 1 is better its ALOT better compared to thi, nothing good on it its old styled and crapy bad-as s graphicz. and seriously DO NOT BUY THIS just stick with the good ol series like budokai 1,2,3 and the new one tenkaichi.seriously atari this was a big let down ,im sorry .thanks for reading this ,take my advise and some other angry customer's advice"},{"rating":"1","title":"LOAD OF CRAP!!!","review":"THIS GAME IS A STINKING WASTE OF TIME! It is a piece of crap put together. From where Budokai 3 took us, this game is a STINKING NOSEDIVE! ONLY DBZ FANS WHO LOVE THE SERIES, BUT DON'T CARE FOR GRAPHICS WILL GET THIS.Good points:........... Uh............Bad points: To short, horrid controls, not a good thing about it, loaded crap, bad graphics, repetitive.... It continues. In other words, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"nenck","review":"it freezies to much during a fight or u get ur assss kicked by an invisible guy but cuz of glitch er wetf"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool","review":"I like this game from the beginning. I don't like most of the DBZ games because they are common clieches of street fighter sort of games. I like this one coz it's different. The game has scenes from the cartoon that are thoughtfully interwoven with the game play. Very cool action adventure! I like to recommend this game to all action fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"get any other dbz game but this","review":"ok,first off,they move WAY TOO SLOW.the graphics,my gosh,its like a 2nd rate n64 game i swear.fun,not really,maybe if this were on a game boy i would say 4 stars but a ps2 surely not.as far as i can tell very few characters,they are no where near as powerful as the other games.i would not get this if i were you.i bought it from here for ten bucks.it might have been worth five.get budokai one two or three they are all better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exceptional.","review":"To be honest, I was expecting some rare DBZ 'coolness' when I bought this for my little brother to play. Together we took turns playing, and before we knew it: the game was over.Yes, you get to (almost) freely travel. Yes, the graphics are fairly plausable.But for what reason did they produce this game, when they didn't make it exceptional? Sometimes I think that the DBZ franchise is all about currancy, and for nothing else.This game was alright: but just buy Tenkaichi, instead."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},M={class:"card-container"},C=["disabled"],B={key:0},H={key:1};function x(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",M,[(i(!0),a(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(i(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(i(),a("span",H,"Loading...")):(i(),a("span",B,"See more"))],8,C)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(N,[["render",x],["__scopeId","data-v-11d09583"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"guide/58.md","filePath":"guide/58.md"}'),W={name:"guide/58.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(i(),a("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
