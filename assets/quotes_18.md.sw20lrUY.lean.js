THis CD is another rending of Mr. Cura's bad singing decisions. I guess he just doesn't study his roles. I saw him at La Scala in \\"La Forza del Destino\\" and I can say that his only redeeming quality is his presence, which was quite appropriate. His acting was ok as well. But when you compare him to the greats of before like Domingo, Corelli, Pavarotti, or Jon Vickers he just doesn't compare. He has lots of talent I would think, but it is raw talent and clearly he did not study long enough before he began his career. His musicality is also horrible, all his swooping and grunts are reprehensible. His voice is uneven, and he often sings with a false shadowing of his voice. I agree with the other reviewer when he states that he much prefers Ben Heppner and others. THey studied singing before they began performing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Succession Desperation","review":"The world awaits successors to the great Pavarotti and Domingo, and tenors aspiring to their crowns are pushed on stage to bare their throats. The latest is Jose Cura, with menacing good looks and marketing prowess, but a voice that breaks glass. This is not a singer, but a carnival barker seducing the new generation of opera thrill seekers and audiophiles who have been led to believe that louder is better, and that shouting is musical expression. To hear singing that is music, click on selections from albums from the last generation of singers like DiStefano, Bjorling, del Monaco, even Lanza: the world still awaits their successors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best tenor collection","review":"Jose Cura's voice is not a beautiful one when compared to the great tenor voices (Caruso, Corelli). I just do not see any artistry in his reading of the scores. I am a voice student myself and have recordings of virtually every tenor that has recorded and Mr. Cura ranks no where near the top. If you want excitment and passion in a tenor voice try Franco Corelli. I do not recomend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Histrionics and a \\"hard\\" throat","review":"I know Jose Cura is an exciting performer -- he has that ineffable and charismatic \\"star\\" quality on stage -- I've seen it and \\"I believe\\". But, his vocalizing here suffers from phony (and ubiquitous) vocal sobs, kind of a latter-day Gigli. In addition, his throaty sound wears. It sounds as though he must push a lot of air through to get his vocal apparatus to vibrate appropriately. The result is a hard flat sound lacking surrounding harmonics that provide light and air and frankly, interest. Intonation is too often suspect.A little less \\"acting\\" and more from-the-heart singing would be welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo ancora","review":"This ,overall, is an excellent c.d.There is an excellent range of repetoire,from the well known to the extremely rare.The first thing i noticed as I listened to this c.d. is the way that Curas voice has darkened considerably since I heard him last in a performance of Otello(and even that due to the role was dark).There is a cerain draw back to this,yet he manages to get away with it on some of the more maturer pieces.The conducting is quite good but I felt he could have taken some of the pieces at a slightly quicker pace.But this is a minor quibble and over all this is a highly entertaining disc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nike Running Watch","review":"It is hard to see the screen when in certain light and buttons are hard to push while running.

Anyway, when I bought this book and started reading it, I got lost and bored with all the author's personal stories, which he somehow tried to relate to the case. I even tried skipping over his personal jarble to get to the actual parts about the Laci Peterson case, but that was hard also, so I just put the book away!

It's for outdoor use only unless you have florescent lighting in your house. It's impossible to take a good picture. You have to try and line it up 5 times to get it right and by that time you've totally drained the 2 AA batteries that it runs on. I called Vivitar and they wouldn't even hear of refunding me my money despite the fact that I'm so unhappy so if anyone has any idea what I should do with a camera that I don't want, please post it here cause at this point it's a paperweight. Don't waste your money on it like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Video quality was very poor","review":"The video quality on this camera was very poor in normal household lighting.

I chose this camera because I was familiar with the Vivitar name as a good camera maker. This offering doesn't really come close to living up to standards.The price tag is good, but you're setting yourself up for frustration if you want to try and use this as a camcorder.

He has a great deal of experience in this area and that really pays off when human beings are so similar at the core. Which is what it is all really about, getting to know yourself at your core. Also, by experience I mean that he has done a lot of deep thinking himself and has many years of experience with talking to various people around the world about this same thing.

For people in this situation, psychological remedies of any kind are ineffective, and Roth's \\"eat what you want\\" method can be downright dangerous.

I didn't know that that Italian label Black Widow had put out this many of the dark progressive band's discs. Tunes here that I got the most out of are the somewhat stunning spoken-word \\"Neque Semper Arcum\\" (would make a good soundtrack for an obscure vampire movie), \\"In Hoc Signo Vinces\\", the seven-minute \\"Non Fiat Voluntas Tua\\" and \\"Aquila Non Capit Muscas\\" (featuring some fantastic keyboards).

Easy to install, sturdy and safe, easy to operate. Can't go wrong with this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wood is too flimsy!","review":"I purchased this gate for the top of our stairs based on the great reviews it received. My husband installed it with little trouble, although he did have to get drywall anchors for the screws as their weren't studs nearby.However, one installed, we could tell the gate just wasn't sturdy enough to really feel comfortable with. The wood rungs are very thin and bendable. Our baby is 10 months old, and while he couldn't do any damage to it now, I'm concerned a wood slat could snap when he gets older (maybe 18 mos).Also, we have a 5 year old who will be using the gate, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of him putting any weight onto this gate as he's using it, I feel it could easily break.We're retuning this item.I think it's a fine gate for other household areas, but I wouldn't trust it for the top of the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Protection overall","review":"I don't understand how ratings on the same gate can go from 5 stars to 1 from different customers. It's like they are talking about different gates! This gate has no plastic parts. The gate, pictured above, is constructed of solid wood with all metal hardware. I purchased 3 of these gates to protect my son from falls down our various flight of stairs. I even installed one on the top of our stairs to our outside deck. I simply slide the gate off from it's hardward during bad weather and bring it inside. I also bought a 4th gate and installed one at my in-laws. Depending on the location and the presence of a stud, installation can take a little work and create a challenge. The templates and instructions could use some improving. I have been happy with all these gates overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate it","review":"It's hard to open, even harder to close.

AND - it's really not all that nice looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate!","review":"We needed a swing gate for our stairs that would prevent dog and baby from going to our downstairs. This is a great gate that looks nice too! The only thing that takes some getting used to is opening it one handed with baby in arm. You have to push and squeeze in to release the gate. Once you get the hang of it, it's fine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for all moms!","review":"We purchased 2 of these gates. My husband installed them, but with the drilling template provided, I could have just as easily installed it myself. They provide an extra set of mounting hardware if you want to share a gate with 2 locations. The gate is easy to open and close, but difficult enough that my 2 and a half year old can't open it. My daughter and my 1 year son like to shake the gate violently when their father comes home from work and it's held up great! My daughter even stands on the bottom rung and the gate doesn't even have a dent. We've had these for about 6 months and so far they look like they'll last a long time. You do need to be careful at first when you're learning to open it, it'll pinch if you don't watch out. All in all, an A+++ product."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it","review":"We have three of these gates(model 1050 without the remote control) in our house and two at Grammy's house. I will never buy/recommend cheap plastic or wood pressure gates again! We use them for babies, toddlers & pets. Taking your time to install the gate will insure smooth operation & we quickly learned to operate with one hand. It quickly removes when not in use (a great feature for grammy's house ~ the mounting hardware isn't very noticable) & additional hardware is available for around $10 to make this useful in more than one spot...It is very sturdy, but we do have one little cousin (4 years old) who has successfully climbed it(..)Ours are several years old and doing very well though. We are very pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay","review":"Sometimes tough to open, wood is sliding on wood and sometimes it sticks, plus can be tough to fit to openings that have high baseboards."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"We bought this gate yesterday and returned it today! It is easy to install, and why not? There's nothing to it! Once installed, THE BOTTOM RAIL POPS OUT and can not be secured into place! With any child old enough to walk, this is a safety hazard as they could push the bottom of the gate and potentially get their head stuck between the gate and the door jam! The directions also tell you to install the gate between 2-3\\" from the ground. At this height, if a toddler climbs on the gate it will make the gate bend, further causing distortion to the side that already won't stay in place!!

I found this gate very frustrating and would love to replace it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this gate!","review":"This is probably my 4th gate purchase after searching for the perfect one for the top of my stair and reading the great reviews for this product I bought it. I have a 3yr old, an 18 month old and #3 on the way I wanted a gate that was easy to open/close with one hand while carriying a baby...this was not it. You have to make sure that the top and bottom line up exactly to get it to lock not exactly easy with one hand and then when you have to slide it to open I have already pinched my hand in it multiple times and it had only been up 1 day!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap, but not worth it","review":"Cheaply made of unfinished wood. Seems sturdy enough once it's latched, but just because it's made of wood does not mean it is good quality. It is stapled together (no screws, dowels, or glue), flexes in every direction and binds when you try to slide it open or shut. The quick removal feature means the hardware on the hinge side is also sloppy and rattles. We took it down after 2 days and were happy to spend twice as much on a better gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top of Stairs- sturdy","review":"I installed this at the top of the stairs. Had to \\"rig it\\" to the wall(used 4 small 2X4 pieces of wood) and it is very sturdy. My son likes to shake and rattle it. Latch system is very easy to use and the directions are easy to follow for installation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evenflow Stair guard","review":"I will say up front that I use the gate at the bottom of the stairs and not at the top as the product suggests. The gate is built well...simple and functional. It has the optional ability to restrict the direction of movment and the hinges give a great angle of movment and detach easily. It went up easy and works as designed. It is just a tiny bit awkward to reach for the latch to release and pull back the gate but this is a very minor issue. In a similar vien, you have to line up the bottom rail at the same time you line up the top rail in order to close. My guess is that it would be less awkward if used at the top of the stairs as recommended. Overall I would recommend the gate for both locations on the stairs."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GATE!","review":"I purchased this for the top of a stair way. I love it. Installation was easy.

For the cost, it is a very sturdy and excellent gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good gate - as long as you modify it","review":"Understated gate, working well enough. However, our tree year olds were breaking the slats on it on daily basis. We finally screwed on a sheet of durable transparent plastic to reinforce the gate. That worked very well - we had no breakage ever since!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby gate is fantastic at the top of stairs","review":"First of all, this gate is very SECURE. I have a 2 year old and a 1 year old and neither of them, with all their climbing and shaking, can get this gate to budge. Next, it's so easy to take down! If you are having company over and want the gate gone for awhile, it just slides in and out of the clips you install in the wall. It is hard for strangers to open the first time, but I think that's mainly because our walls aren't straight and there's more tension than there would be in well-framed houses. That being said, it installs very well whether your walls are square or not. The latch is very easy for me to open with one hand and it only took a couple of tries to become adept at it. The only downside is that I've pinched my finger in the latch a few times, but it was no big deal. Overall, this gate is so sturdy and safe, I prefer it much more to the tension-mounted one I had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy gate","review":"Strong and sturdy gate. It locks into place via 2 metal locks that are bolted to your wall. My 25lb son shakes this thing and it does not budge. The only bad thing I can say is that you need to take your time with the install. They give you a blueprint where to drill your holes in the wall, but I rushed it on the first gate and the two locks didn't line up right. The second gate I installed, I took my time and it lined up perfect. Great gate for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy install very sturdy","review":"The gate took about 15 minutes to install.

I have a very active 1 year old, who has tried to kick, climb, and pull this gate down but failed every time. This is NOT one of those cheap pressure mounted gates this gate is very sturdy, and mounts to the wall, you hear the lock click, so you can rest assured it's closed. It swing both ways, and opens with one hand. It also works great with our two Saint Bernards. This is a great gate. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the the money","review":"I bought this gate to keep my 16 month old out of the kitchen. I have ruined my wall with all the holes I had to put in because it would only hold for about 3 weeks then the screws would fall out, it also caused the wall to crack just behind where the gate would swing open. I have moved it back and forth on the same opening about 8 inches wide. This has been going on for about 2 months and the wall won't even hold any more because of all of the spackle I had to put on. I am returnig the gate today and going to get the everflo position and lock gate. I already had one position and lock gate that I used to gate up my litter box so I am using that one until I can get to babies r us to get another one.. Don't waste your money on this gate just get the cheaper one that won't damage your walls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate for a door opening","review":"This is a nice gate for a door opening, probably not the best choice for a stairway. We found it easy to install and is well made. I don't know how some people found this to be junky. The wood looks nice, too. Gates are a barrier not a babysitter, so for the price we found this to be good for door openings to our hallway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rickety Junk","review":"You'd get better security, and better build quality, if you installed a house of cards at the top of your stairs. The template that comes with it is wrong (so more holes in your wall). Once you get it installed, you'll notice that the bottom rail pops right out because the wooden 'gate' - and I use that term loosely - is rickety junk. Either the people who gave this gate 5 stars are morons, or they got some pre-NAFTA version that isn't slapped together from the cheapest materials possible. Buy the First Years Simple & Secure Stair Gate. Excellent construction, great instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"at first i thought that this gate was great. however, it fell apart after a week. great idea, terrible workmanship. i would not recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a baby safe, its just a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"I got these gates about 2-3 yrs ago, they worked great in the beginning, but after time (2-3yrs) they seemed to become softer (wood) and more flexible to the kids abuse...my kids pull on the gates some so they are rough (3 and 1 yrs old) but not so rough that these should not hold up...I HAVE 3 of these, and my son 3 yrs old now knows how to open them and let our baby up/down the stairs (he is only 1 so this is very dangerous)...Obviously we are going out to purchase a different kind...Look wise these served their purpose, but quality & craftsmanship, I would think they should last past 3yrs, but they have not, so that is why I say BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"1","title":"unsafe on top of the stairs.","review":"We bought ours at Lowes.

I was so shocked and returned it the next day. This should have been recalled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built Cheap & Dangerous","review":"The BabiesRUs store I went to did not have one out of the box to look at, so I went off of what I could tell on the box. Once I got it home, a few things became obvious. First, it would not work with my stairs due to the lack of a stud in the proper place on the wall side. I realize that is not a design flaw in the product and just an incompatibility. However, I also found it to be a poor design. When the gate was open, the two pieces would freely slide in and out from each other. Due to the space between the two pieces, it presented an obvious pinching hazard to little fingers and adult fingers alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have two, one works and one doesn't","review":"We had a baby safety company baby-proof our home, and several safety gates were installed. The Kidco, inc pressure gate works well in our hallway and is easy to open and close. We have two Evenflo Walk-through stair gates. One, at the top of the stairs, works fairly well, but you need to use two hands when opening and closing this gate (which means putting down a crying child momentarily while wrestling with the gate). The one at the bottom of the stairs is useless, since the wood appears to have warped and can not be closed without pulling the entire gate (screws and all) out of the wall. We're in the process of looking for another gate (anything-but-wood)which can be opened easily with one hand. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids can't open it!!","review":"We installed this gate at the top of our stairs 4 years ago when my younger daughter was 1. Now, she's almost 5 and neither she, nor her 7 year old sister, have been able to figure out how to open this gate.This gate also saved me from possible broken bones. I tripped and fell toward the stairs a few years back and this gate stopped me from tumbling down our steep stairs. Not bad for a baby gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great safety gate with a little work","review":"This gate stands up to my 26lb. toddler bouncing on the bottom rung and has stayed put for 4 months at the top of the stairs. It takes a few tries to get used to opening it, but it snaps in place (you can hear it!) so you know it's latched. The only down side is that in order for it to really attach to the wall my husband had to screw in thin wood slats to the wall and attach the gate to them to keep the screws from coming loose from the drywall (although it says this in the directions, I think). So it's not pretty, but it works great!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult to maneuver","review":"I bought this gate because the reviews were good. While it's a sturdy gate, and matches the decor/woodwork in our house, it is very difficult to open and close. You have to slide the gate and lift a lever while you slide it into a slot. Sometimes the top and bottom don't go into their respective slots at the same time. It's really a pain in the butt, especially if you are caring a baby in one arm.I recommend trying a gate that does not slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We bought the Evenflo Secure Solutions Swing Gate for our 9 month old. My husband installed the gate which was not a huge ordeal.We are both disapponted with the gate for several reasons.It is very cheap material plastic and wood.

I have recommended it to everyone I know with children under 3 or 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids/Dogs get right through it","review":"We got this first for our dog.

It is easy to open, can detach if needed, can be stained or painted to match decor,and keeps even the most mechanical 2 year old from opening it. The only problem is sometimes if you lift when opening, instead of just slide back, the gate will detach. Otherwise I would recommend this gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate","review":"After going through a few gates we finally found this one and installed one at the top and bottom of the stairs. It's durable, inexpensive, simple to install and easy to open and close. In addition, it's not bulky looking like some of the other gates (especially the Safety 1st gates). I would definitely recommend it to anyone in the market for a gate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I bought this gate for use at the top of my basement stairs which are open. Not only do I have a five month old to look out for but I also have 2 rambunctious 2 year old nephews who are always over, both \\"master climbers\\". Besides the fact that they couldn't even attempt to climb it, they defintely couldn't open it. Sometimes it's hard for me to open, and that's not to say it's a bad thing - if it were too easy for me, they'd find a way to open it themselves. It doesn't touch the floor, so there's no bump to have to walk over - something I was looking for specifically in a gate. Some reviews mention a difficult installation but my husband had no problems at all - he said just make sure you find a beam to screw into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gate!!","review":"We purchased one gate to replace a really awful Safety 1st gate and we couldn't be happier.

The latch is a bit tough to use but I'd rather it be tight then too loose and have my son be able to get thru it.We like this gate so much that we went and bought another one the next day. Worth the price!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great at first","review":"I reviewed lots of gates before I bought this one, and it seemed to be the highest quality for the price. I like the fact that it's made of wood which matches our baby's room decor (the gate is on her doorway, as the stairs are right outside), and the vertical slats are great as she's a climber. It was also very easy to install, now that the correct template is included. HOWEVER, the first time my daughter tried to rattle the gate around the bottom rail slid right out of the wall support, and with a little pulling on her part there was a lot of room between the last slat and the door frame. We've had to anchor the rail with a spring clamp -- very annoying. I can't find the receipt or I'd bring the thing back, and I'd never buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"13 month old broke this gate TWICE!!","review":"We recently moved into a new house and bought and installed 3 of these gates. Within one week, our 13 month old broke two of the gates. Once by holding onto the rungs and shaking the gate the other time by grabbing one of the rungs when he tripped.Both times the rung popped right out breaking at the top and bottom. This left a gap in the rungs wide enough for our son to stick his head through which means he could get past the gate if we kept it up (which of course we didn't.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"decent gate","review":"overall, a good gate. beware when installing if you have baseboards on both sides of the stairs. the slot where the gate locks at the bottom requires more room than the hinges on the other side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gate","review":"We purchased one of these gates for the top of our stairs. It works great. It is very sturdy and safe. After the kids are in bed, we leave the gate open. It easily swings out the way and stays positioned up against the wall. Another nice feature, is the fact that the gate slides out of the mounting hardware fairly easily, and you can remove the gate when and if necessary.The latch can be a little tricky, but I usually don't have a problem with it. I think with most gates like this there is some tricks that you learn after using it for a while in connection with opening and closing it.Overall my husband and I have been happy with this gate. - mom of 2 boys"},{"rating":"1","title":"This gate was no match for my soon to be 2 yr. old!","review":"For the price of this gate I expected much more quality wise. My husband put the gate up at the top of the stairs on our landing, and followed the directions to a T. Well whenever we would be upstairs my daughter would stand on the gate and shake it with all of her might, and of course being the stubborn 19 months she is, I could not get her to stop doing this. Well after two weeks of doing this the part of the gate that attaches to the wall (the part that swings) ripped out of the wall. How a 2 yr old could do this I am not sure. My husband put it up again with larger anchors and screws but it looks like it is going to come out again.For $35 I expect much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gates are OK","review":"These gates were ok but I still liked the quality better from the stair gates I got at http://www.stairgatestore.com.

It sure looks good with the wood railing banister but only works 20% of the time. We spend the other 80% of the time cursing it because it jams or locks-up. You have to keep hitting the remote button to get it to open. Most of the time the top latch opens but not the bottom. We even ordered a new receiver from the company to see if that was the problem.

When you install something like this it's very important for the holes to be kept to a minimum for security, we had to make extra holes because of the faulty template. #2 If we yank on the bottom (latch side) it comes out making the gate unstable and we need it for the top of the stairs!! It might be too hard for a wee one to yank but \\"might be\\" is too much of a risk and it's not worth our babies safety!!

Lackluster, no beats and you can't not dance to it, if you know what I mean. I am a total Genesis fanatic and have been since I was 16 - I have seen them live, talked to them in person, been in a band that did it's darndest to emulate their sound and their spirit (and yes, we had a Mellotron, and it sounded fantatsic, when it worked) but when Tony is bad, he's REALLY bad. His best solo effort by far is \\"A Curious Feeling\\". This is as much of a yawner as Mike Rutherford's 'Acting Very Strange\\". Face it, Genesis was a brilliant sum of it's parts.. not all of the parts function nearly as well seperately, with the main exception being Peter Gabirel, who has managed to maintain his artistic integrity through the years (but where the heck is a new album, Peter?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok.","review":"I must concur. \\"Soundtracks\\" and Still are Tony's weakest efforts. Especially from someone who produced perhaps the finest progressive album ever, A Curious Feeling. (Come to think of it, I guess In The Court Of The Crimson King is the finest, so A Curious Feeling would be #2).If you're interested in Tony Banks or just want to hear the kind of music they don't make any more (long, interesting, quality tracks) get A Curious Feeling and then Strictly, Inc. If you're hooked, go for The Fugitive, too.If you're still listening to A Trick of The Tail, Duke, etc, than anything from Tony Banks should sound great. OTOH, if your idea of great music is Invisible Touch or In The Air Tonight, none of this is for you. (Mr. Methane's version of In The Air Tonight, is, I admit, superb).And if you want to hear Mr. Banks work real magic with a soundtrack, hunt down the LP from The Wicked Lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must read\\" for anyone who calls themselves an American","review":"This book captures what our founders had in their minds and hearts when they envisioned what America could be.

We still have the potential to become as great, as free and as inspiring - to ourselves and all the world. All we need to do is get ourselves back on track.

It's about a boy Diego (half white/half indian) who grows up together with his Indian 'brother'. When they're older they part for Barcelona where Diego will learn about love and justice and where he will be admitted to a secret society for Justice: that's where he will gets his name ZORRO. It's a book about life, poverty, justice and love: themes frequently found in Allende. Daily things which are developed more profoundly and thus makes it interesting to read. No thrilling, exciting, spectacular things, just a normal boy who lives his life. I would just say: read the book and you'll find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The making of El Zorro","review":"Isabelle Allende has created a believable childhood for Diego, his family, friends, and adventures. The historical context is very interesting as well. I have always been quite a sucker for this romantic hero, going back to the television series as a young girl--so I am probably a fairly easy \\"sell\\".

The story is clever, Allende re-creates a legend (hence the title)which is always hard to do, especially for a popular character as Zorro, just for taking on this feat she deserved high marks.On the downside, the book has too much \\"and then...\\" this or that happened. I was also hoping to get more about the history of California, since Ms. Allende said she thoroughly researched it and wanted to incorporate her findings in the story. However the research didn't come through the story and very little in the background.*suggestion: When reading the book, read it in a Spanish accent as if Selma Hayek is narrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zorro: a mystical reinvention","review":"Isabel Allende is a very talented writer. However, she appears to have a great interest in mysticism and she has put as much of it as possible in this book. The original Zorro was a Spanish Nobleman and a Christian who fought on behalf of the poor and oppressed. So, it is ironic that Ms. Allende has tried to tie Zorro to practically every kind of mysticism which existed in the 19th century. She gives him an Indian Shaman for a Grandmother. Has him get the idea for Zorro from an Indian initiation right where he gets the fox (Zorro in Spanish) as his totemic symbol. Has him have an affair with a Gypsi who tells fortunes. Gives him a telepathic connection with his friend Bernardo. Has him join a secret society. And last, but not least, has an extended discussion of Voodoo magic. By the end of the book - I was wondering if this story was more about Zorro or Ms. Allende's attempt to normalize pagan spiritualism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zorro-a swish off","review":"What a disappointment.

He was probably the most knowledgable man about the music of the Ozarks. That knowledge is reflected in his songs on this album.

Yes...she is irreverent... and takes on everything from California healthy living..Wee people in Ireland ... her parents and siblings.. a tour of the Mormon temple... she hits such a variety of topics but didn't miss a beat on any of them. Beware ... she is a democrat and she does think.. so if you find either of those threatening or offensive this is not your cup of tea.

Frankly, I see nothing comical about including cursing in comedy. There are funnier comedians than Kathleen Madigan who never use a curse word. I am no saint, and I can use expletives, but if I were a comedienne, I wouldn't use the disgusting expletives (publicly) that Kathleen uses. It's as if you are telling the world, \\"I have very few morals, and I want the public know...I am proud of that.\\" It's as if the comedians like Kathleen think that the more they use expletives the funnier they are...NOT so!Two very funny, and clean, comedians are Brian Regan, and Henry Cho.I am sure I am going to get a lot of mail admonishing me.

They had shaggy hair and beards; there were no perfectly clipped, 20th-century coiffes. The horses had those medieval robes. I wonder if the Bruce was really redhead, or if the makers choose red hair just because it's often associated with the Scottish. Also, I couldn't tell if the actor had real or dyed red hair.This work focuses on Bruce's battle dynamics. It is more scant on facts about his life or why the Scots fought the English. This was mostly about war tactics than a biography of a famous person.If I recall correctly, we read about royal successions in my high school European history class. However, people like the Bruce and Braveheart did not come up. I really think this is a documentary by and for Brits. Americans who liked Gibson's \\"Braveheart\\" will love it.

Written in graceful, engaging prose, in a brief 224 pages, Reitano presents a kaleidoscope of significant events, conflicts and turmoil which produced America's greatest city. Contrary to other approaches to the subject, Reitano depicts the city from the 17th century to the present as never static, but as a cauldron of struggle between contending groups out of which a constructive evolution developed. Interwoven throughout are compelling biographies of exceptional individuals who are often overlooked, such as Fanny Wright, Langston Hughes, Emma Goldman, Paul Robeson, W.E.B. DuBois and Vito Marcantonio. As an accessible, enlightening treatise on both New York City and American history, The Restless City is a remarkable achievement.Lawrence Rushing, New York City"},{"rating":"1","title":"not the usual razors","review":"I received the razor refills but the packaging was slightly different than what I usually order and the quality was much worse.

I am glad that Warner Bros. chose to delight old and new Prince fans with this Jazzy collection of music. From the opening track The Rest of My Life to the ending track Extraordinary, Prince delivers a soul stirring musical deliverance. If you like jazz and blues this is the cd for you. There is nothing like the sound of a live band conducted and lead the by the Artist himself. Tracks like When the Lights Go Down and There is Lonely will set the mood for a romantic evening. The rest of the songs are just wonderful. Special applause to She Spoke to Me and 5 Women. It is worth the purchase and will definately become an all time classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing!!!","review":"As a long time Prince fan, I must say, I was extremely pleased at the depth of the songs on this release and how COMPLETELY different this is than anything he has put out commercially. It is full of musicianship, creativity and just genious writing that I as a Prince fan come to expect. I think my favorites, though hard to pick, are \\"5 Women\\" and \\"When the Lights Go Down\\". It is obvious who the influences are on these cuts with their BB King and Miles Davis flavor, but still 100% unique Prince.If you're a commercial Prince fan, this may not be for you.

And I am so pleased that these songs were finally rescued from the vaults, but I'm sure there must also be a wealth of material left there that we have yet to hear. This is probably a different side to Prince than the side most of his fans know. And some may not like it.

As a matter of fact, the title track, \\"Old Friends 4 Sale,\\" is a different version than the oft-bootlegged one, and is lyrically and musically inferior, in my humble opinion. \\"Extraordinary\\" and \\"5 Women\\" are the standouts. Otherwise, you have some great bluesy grooves that ultimately go nowhere, due in large part to the uninspired lyrics accompanying them. For future reference, Prince and/or WB should release less mid-90's NPG stuff and more mid-80's Revolution stuff.

Problem is the tightening screw is too close to the end of the gold contact point so you can't grip down on wire casing or the wire itself. Waste of money.

After about a month or so, the silver paint started flaking off of the interior of the unit, which made me a little queasy wondering if it was getting into the food. Then, the cooker started turning off before the rice was even cooked. Others have said the same thing-- that it's impossible to keep the \\"cook\\" button depressed no matter what you do. I usually turn it off for a while and then press the button and that seems to do the trick, but having to watch the unit kind of defeats the purpose of a rice cooker.

The lack of quotation marks makes it a very frustrating read. The prose resembles a screenplay with pages of dialogues interspersed with descriptions. The Irish dialect is tough to understand. I did start to enjoy it during the last few pages, but it wasn't worth to reread the book again. If you're interested in Irish fiction, skip this and read Dubliners by James Joyce."},{"rating":"2","title":"A is for Abigail","review":"A is for Abigail An Almanac of Amazing American Women.

However, we also can't ignore the utter whiteness of this book. Yes, there are a few non-white faces in this book, but not nearly enough to make it truly representative of all the wonderful women who have contributed to our America. Read Dinner at Aunt Connie's House by Faith Ringgold and you will meet some of the amazing black women, for example, that Cheney leaves out.As long as we perpetuate whiteness as \\"neutral\\" or \\"representative of all\\" our society will never be an equal one.The fight continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"While it has it's bright moments, there are far better books out their.

This book gets right down to specific problems on and off set and exactly how they dealt with them and the results... it has a refreshing straight-to-the-point style of writing, and taught me a few things about the Hollywood system that I didn't know.

Perhaps I'm cheap or more likely, I don't think a book can be developed properly in less than 300 pages. Sheri Reynolds' \\"A Gracious Plenty\\" has definitely proven me wrong.

It is a story of a girl who becomes a bit of a grotesque through an accident. She becomes the primary caretaker of a cemetary, and is so in tune with the deceased that she can communicate and see them. This gift makes for a fine story.

Finch is fiesty, often stubborn, and can communicate with the dead. After her parents die, Finch assumes ownership of the graveyard where she tends the dead.Finch is a woman that had socially isolated herself. She has no friends, but everyone knows her. Her scars are what sets her apart. Instead of feeling saddened and desperate, Finch is often hostile. It is through the hostility that she hides her pain and longing for true relationshipsA Gracious Plenty explores the need for relationships and how people must look both within and beyond what they initially see. Finch is a character that must first accept herself before others can accept her.

As a child Finch gets picked on and called names by everyone. Through her life this never seems to go away. She only has a handful of friends; her mother and father, animals and the dead. All through the book the dead people are telling stories about their lives before they died. They talk about stuff like childhood and what let to their death. I think the only part that threw me off was the cross dressing man who breast fed a baby. That didn't really make sense to me and I don't think I want it to make sense. The book was a good book and should be read, especially if you like books that will give you mixed feelings about the characters and their stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gracious, mystical book of plenty","review":"Finch Nobles was terribly burned as a child, and as a result she hides from most of human society. But she's welcome in the graveyard she passionately tends, where the dead -- including her beloved parents and an always-squalling baby -- speak to her, telling the tales that will eventually allow them to progress along the path they must take. When a local eccentric is buried in the cemetery, however, everything -- including the dynamics of the town just outside the graveyard gates -- is changed, and Finch finds herself forced to allow living beings into her life -- and let the dead follow their own road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Sheri Reynolds","review":"Finch Nobles was horribly burned at the age of four and has lived as an outsider all of her life. She tends the cemetery of her small southern town and keeps company with the spirits who have passed on. She shares their heartache and joy, anger and disappointment and learns multitudes about herself in the process. Sheri Reynolds has written a heart-warming and intriguing piece of fiction. Everyone is an outsider at one point or another and can identify with Finch's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"Great story great book.

Although this was my first time reading a book by Sheri Reynolds, I was amazed by her novel. The book was centered around Finch, a young girl who's face was burned as a child. This novel made me realize that people don't look for the good in a person, they only look for their faults. Once I started to read this novel I thought it was great, and it is one that everybody should read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written, full of emotion","review":"Badly burned in a kitchen accident as a child, Finch Nobels lives her life as an outcast in a tightly knit society.

I loved it. I immediately felt as if I were in the cemetary with her. Sherri has the unique ability to make the supernatural seem natural. I will never go by a grave yard again without thinking about this book. It has even made me think again about my own desire to be cremated when I die. A fabulous book. I read it twice and I'm going to buy my own copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"eccentricities of a finch","review":"Finch, the scarred main character, forty-ish, not in any way charming or attractive, tends the local graveyard with singular devotion. And why not, the dead are her best friends. Reynolds creates characters who are very real because they are very hurt and yet very strong. And she weaves a story that is very human. Finch may be a medium for the departed, but she is solidly US, someone readers can identify with. It is hard to read Reynolds and not be impressed with her poetic style, her terse bits of wisdom (\\"knots untangle themselves\\"--I copied that out of her book and taped it to my fridge for weeks) and her understanding and compassion for the human condition. Read her and watch, because this writer is going to be very well-known and is going to last as an important voice in American fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, great author","review":"I very much enjoyed this book.

The first trip I kept saying, \\"Say again please\\"; second trip I said this less often; third trip I was so lucky to stay with native Scots in varied locations, all willing to blether, crack, clash. I find older Scots or those interested in the history, eager to explain & educate me in the meanings & pronunciation. This book is invaluable when reading Burns or 18/19/20th century literature. Understanding speech & meaning from NE, West Coast, Highlands, Lowlands varies greatly, so this book helps. If you are visiting but have no real interest in the Scots, then the book is of little use. I find it hard to imagine a visit without the book or not falling in love with the Scots."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cheetah Girls","review":"This book is wonderful though sometimes it is hard to understand. Thankfully Ms. Gregory included a glossary so those of us who don't understand Galleria and her friend's language can keep up.

The new DVD release will undoubtedly give the film a new lease on life, and hurrah for that. What movie did the critics see? This picture may not be top-drawer work from anyone involved, but it's still a great deal of fun, and definitely worth a look. Hepburn is enchanting, as always, and it's enjoyable to see her spoofing horror and action film conventions. Knowing her real-life feelings for Holden adds a special poignancy to their work together here, particularly in his big self-loathing monologue; her reaction shots to him are very moving. He's game, as are Tony Curtis and Noel Coward in cameos, and there's real wit in the Axelrod screenplay. If only the average comedy released today could have a tenth of the style or flair in this \\"flop\\" of Hollywood's later golden era!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirkyand Cute- I love it","review":"I love this movie because it is so different yet totally captivating and funny. The Paris backdrop is genius and the costumes and hair are fantastic, but what makes the film most interesting is just how random and fun it is. It's not a movie where you observe the acting or study the plot, because there hardly is one here, but it's a nice break from the more \\"civilized\\" comedies of the era. Overall, I would highly recommend it to any Audrey fan or anyone who just wants to watch a goofy old movie starring one of the worlds most beloved and (mostly) serious actresses"},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Review","review":"I purchased the DVD as a gift for my niece for Christmas.

Granted that it is not one of her best movies(on the bottom second above \\"they all laughed\\"), it is still a good one. It is a very light romantic comedy with no deeper meaning a la \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\", \\"Roman Holliday\\", \\"Sabrina\\", \\"Love in the Afternoon\\" and others. One has to watch it with a relaxed mind and just enjoy the parody of hollywood and the silliness of a screen writer. The video is as best as it can get in VHS, especially for a movie of that time, and with plenty of location sights of Paris coupled with Audrey in top original fashion clothes, this movie is a pleasure to be viewed. Every moment is enjoyable, of course with no other expectation than as described above, especially for Audrey fans. For people new to Audrey's movies, I definitely recommend first to watch her best movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great surprise","review":"Paris When It Sizzles is a great tale that I found played off of bits of other Audrey Hepburn movies, making vague refrences to movies such as Breakfast at Tiffany's which enhances the movie if you are a true fan and collector of Hepburn movies.

It was not what I had expected, but what a wonderful surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paris When It Fizzles","review":"In 1964 when this movie came out in the theaters the reviews it got were not good.

However, the plot goes quickly from clever to inane. Despite having Audrey Hepburn and William Holden, the film could not be saved. They do the best with what they are given, which isn't much. The film bombed at the box office. I'm not the least bit surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Hardcore Fans","review":"Movies about moviemaking are generally narcissistic exercises, and this film is no exception. Too bad so many inexperienced filmmakers get caught in the classic trap of making a film about their own activities. Here it is done with a big budget and two of my favorite stars. It is said this film sat in the can for two years before it was released so this is Holden/Hepburn (reunited after Sabrina) circa 1961/62. The story is dull, fluffy and filling like whipped cream, the dialogue is reasonably good, and I am a great fan of both these people. The period of the early 60's offers forth it's abundant and wasteful values, interesting just in that aspect alone. I love that apartment. Audrey is absolutely gorgeous, William is in unbelievable shape, and they both exude huge amounts of energy all for a bunch of fluff.

Although Audrey gave her usual gracious and beautiful performance, she seemed at times to be wondering how she could rescue this movie from disaster. I'm also a Wm Holden fan, but in this film he appeared to be dissipated & cynical and really not worth the trouble she was taking to save him. They both could do, and have done, so much better.

They keep pretending that they are in the movie they are writing. They back up and start over and even once pretend that Holden is a vampire with his face all aglow.

I didn't find her \\"Tales of Disillusioned Diana\\" segments particularly helpful, but the comments of current & past professionals offer good insights & the \\"hands on\\" exercises recommended in each chapter encourage readers to apply lessons learned to their current situation.

Yet, this book portrayed us brats - all brats - as victims of all types abuse, mental and physical. I certainly didn't see the prevelance of alcohol (that this book seems to think is the #1 evil in all military families) in the families I grew up with and was very close to, including mine. There were definitly a couple of chapters that I'm glad I got to read and really hit home! But overall... it just was way too negative! I think I lived a very good life as a Brat... this book makes you think that no brat ever did."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided negativeoutdated view","review":"I found Wertsch's book a negative one-sided view of military life. Maybe it is because I experienced military life from 1984 on but what my aviator husband, my children, and myself experienced was nothing like she denotes. Life was hard and a challenge that brought us closer as a family and a military community. Much of what she presents as negatives were great positive forces for us. We were stoic, tough, and determined and, at the same time, made no bones of using the multiple services provided by the military for coping with the stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty good, but there are better","review":"As a Foreign Service Brat, it is interesting to read how close some military experiences and how far others are from my own, and Wertsch's book was certianly well written. While I enjoyed it and certainly found it well documented, I thought Mary Truscott's Brats: Children of the American Military Speak Out a much better read. I have a problem with the way Wertsch used a metaphor and then ran with it for the entire book. I would say in general that Wertsch's book is a great resource for a person writing a paper, while the human side of the experience is better brought across by Truscott. The one caveat is that Wertsch's book, written much more recently, covers alcoholism and abuse much more in depth. If you read this book and enjoyed it, I would highly recommend Truscott's."},{"rating":"2","title":"It stunned me with how right on target it was","review":"I loved every word of this book. It made me look at my family in a new way. All the little eccentricities that I always thought were part of my own family dynamic I now realize were part of the warrior family syndrome. Also the class system of officers versus enlisted men was so ingrained in me, I never looked at it as affecting my life, but now I realize that being the daughter of an enlisted man while most of my friends were officers' kids did have an impact on me. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any military brat","review":"Mary Edward Wertch captures the experiences of military brat life in its truest sense. She illustrates through interviews, and her own family experiences, how brats do not live as civilian kids do. The book discusses the stresses and strains of a military parent constantly leaving home for months at a time; of living inside the military fortress with all its rules, frustrations, and expectations on the warrior family; of the effects of alcoholism within the military; and of the constant moves, broken friendships, and fractured relationships. As a backdrop to the interviews and stories, the author also weaves throughout the book scenes from the movie \\"The Great Santini\\", which to many a civilian is just a fictional movie about a military family, but to many a military brat, all too real. This is a must read for any military brat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite a dissapointment.","review":"I was so excited to receive this book but found it to be very difficult to read without getting angry. I am a military brat, but I grew up in a loving home, with parents who set examples and had high expectations. Was my dad strict, a perfectionist, and \\"military\\"? You bet he was. But no one was a drunk or wife/child beater.

But recently discovering that Gustavo Santaolalla's label was behind this effort was the key to making me check them out. This is a musical collective from Argentina that blends in styles you'd never imagine combined, and it does so both, in style and very effectively. Tango is balanced against trip hop yielding a new form of sensual chillout music that you will find appealing from the first note. While this, the first effort by Bajofondo Tango Club, works on so many levels, I recommend a bit more that you check out \\"Supervielle\\". It's a bit fresher and experimental."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tango experience for those under 30","review":"Tango is a mood. You don't listen to tango, you \\"feel\\" tango. Tango is a way of complaining about your unhappy moments in life, to understand it (and like it) you must have lived and suffered (a boy who left you, a girl who didn't pay attention to you) and when you are 18 there's not much that can put you in a tango way...Nevertheless, 2002 was a though year in both sides of Rio de la Plata, we all felt tragic, nostalgic, no matter how old or young we were. And there it appeared, Bajodondo, the perfect sound for those who wouldn't listen to tango. The right mix of tango mood and DJs. There's a little bit of everything you must listen to, but sampled, so give tango a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show me the money, preferably in pounds...","review":"Seems like these guys really like British techno, the problem is that the \\"electronica\\" part of this record sounds dated.

After him, many more followed with their own talent.I guess it's a good thing that De Caro died 30 years ago, so he didn't get to hear this crap.\\"World music\\" audiences will consume anything with an electronic bass & drums base track.

Is it an alternative at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"I agree with the fellow who used the word Muzak to describe this nonsense. It has all the feel of elevator music made for a business park in suburban Buenos Aires.

Maybe is that everything that comes out from Santaolalla's factory always is well received by the record industry (he is part of it, in fact). Basically, Bajofondo is electronic stuff with some tango hints, but i dont think you can call it \\"tango\\" at all. One of the most important things on tango is the lyrics and you can not found (or even listen to) any single lyric here. And for the electronic side, there are many other artists that build a better relationship between genres. Karsh Kale for example, or Natacha Atlas, who can keep it natural, let say, as a way of express something that is there and not as an intelectual (and commercial) excercise."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD espetacular!","review":"Amo esse CD mas no conseguia comprar no Brasil por estar esgotado no fornecedor.

It is not. I thought it would be heavy duty but its pretty tinny. The scale is not mechanical, its electronic. Runs on 2 AA batteries (not included i might add...). When you step on it calibrates for up to 5 seconds and then the scale needle lights up and moves to the weight. Cool the first time, annoying the 2nd time - really annoying every time after that. The memory function seemed like a good idea but again, there is such a delay in waiting for the thing you wont use it. The digital readout is also too small and not backlit so you cant see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scale a one on a scale of one to ten.","review":"This scale is very large, very ugly, very expensive and if it gets wet, stops working for days until it completely dries out. If you get water on it after taking a shower, it won't work! This does not seem a good feature on a bathroom scale. The dual readout is useless, the numbers on the dial part are incomprehensible. The needle lights up but the dial doesn't so it can't be read in the dark. It takes about fifteen seconds to register your weight, and if you get off during this time, it takes about a minute to reset. NOT A GOOD THING TO BUY! I wish I could get my money back. P.S. The scale is accurate when it's working."},{"rating":"2","title":"good on-line game for DC","review":"If you play on-line on your Dreamcast this is a game worth purchasing. On-line gaming is unbelievable. There really is no lag as the game play is quite smooth at all time. I'm not joking. I play NFL2K1 all the time and I experience lag a lot. But, I was very surprised to see there was no lag in UT even with 8 players on line. I have a keyboard and mouse--which I think makes the game much easier to play. My friend uses the controller. He seems to have no problem. It takes a little more time to just get used to it. \\"Auto aim\\" makes it easier. I have a lot of fun playing this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"a game worth buying","review":"Ok, here's the bottom line. There are many pros and many cons in this game. They are as follows: PROS: awesome graphics, awesome gameplay, cool weapons, cool music, lots of levels, great sound effects, head shots, online play, good controlCONS: multi-player has less levels, no one-player mode, no assault mode, not enough skinsAll in all this game is a great party game or online game. If you are more into one-player games, this may not be a game for you. In my opinion unreal tournament is better than quake 3 which was boring and too fast and confusing. Stick with UT."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!","review":"The only explanation I have for the great reviews about this game is that these people haven't actually played this veersion yet. The computer version was awesome, the PS2 version OK, and this one is just downright awful. The first few levels play well (at least faster than the PS2), but you can immediatly tell that the animation frames have been lowered significantly. Enemies will be floating in the air when they are standing still, and the moves are really jerky. The real problems begin once you advance to the Capture the Flag and Domination modes, where I swear the frame rate drops to the single digits for entire rounds. This game is completely unacceptable. If you have never played any other version of UT, and haven't played Quake 3 on DC, you MIGHT enjoy this, otherwise, avoid this at all costs and stick with Quake 3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st Person Shooter.","review":"I used to play this alot with my friends before I sold my Dreamcast in the year 2000 but I still have the game with the holder and disk. But it's not the end of the world because I found out that if you put a Dreamcast game into a PS2 it will work. Anyway it's a great game I recomend this game to 1st person shooter fans so buy it for 10 bucks or less and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it would only work...","review":"There's a few reasons why I only give this 2 stars: First, IT WON'T LOAD ON FIRST TRY! It actually takes a few tries; the Dreamcast won't recognise it as a DC game most tries. This is a big problem, and from what I hear from other players online, it happens to all of them.Next, it freezes quite a bit, on- or off-line, and sometimes loss of VMU data comes with that.The frame-rate isn't that great, but it's playable. And the online servers go from working fine to INCREADABLE lag, even with a broadband adapter. The PC version is WONDERFUL; and I think you can get some fun out of this version, but I really suggest renting this one before you think of buying. You will see all the problems right off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review- Cuando cantan los lagartos","review":"The thing that I liked about this novel was the way that it captured the bitter-sweet reality of life. If you are looking for a happy fairytale, it's not for you. But if you want to recognize life's traumas, and heartbreaks along with its good moments and re-experience them in a poignant, beautiful and very imaginative context you will love this novel. Think _Out of Africa_ or _The lover_, but with more of a sense of humor, and tongue-in-cheek approach to depicting human affairs and lost love. I was also impressed with the way that it played on Gabriel Garci'a Ma'rquez's magical realism (Cien Annos de soledad/A Hundred Years of Solitude)- a glimpse into this writer's ironic side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"If you are looking for a fresh approach to Spanish literature, \\"Cuando Cantan los lagartos\\" will not disappoint you. Miguel Santana weaves words and images in a tapestry of Tarahumara landscape. You will savor his writing artistry and flowing creativity.

I believe that the two people who heard her and the Assads in person heard great performances, but this studio recording is lifeless. It sounds like New Age music. And the Assads are Brazilian classical guitarists with a little pinch of Gypsy flavoring, not enough to spice up the mix. If you want to hear the authentic thing, listen to Tomatito. If you want a Gypsy-classical mixture that is far more exciting than this, try Gilles Apap and the Transylvania Mountain Boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Datebook is NOT a Sin","review":"Another great item from Shag.

To see near variations of the same oxymoronic witticism, side by side, as written or spoken by various literary notables, is perhaps the most fascinating aspect of the book.

I think the book is written in realistic terms, and with a few days of earnest study, is helpful to any aspiring biker that wants to up his/her biking game. I am hoping to race in the Leadville race coming up here in Colorado in July; Friel's planning, I feel two months into it, is at least giving me some purposeful and consistent workouts. Easy to read, and with charts etc... included. The book allows the reader to create their own personal workout plan that can be easily scheduled around irritating things like work. If you are willing to 1. read the book and do the research, 2. follow through with the 'best laid plans', I think this book is a good source."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mistitled Book","review":"I recently began biking in order to add some variety along side my primary activity which is swimming. I bought this book in order to learn something about mountain biking. If that is also your reason for buying this book then look elsewhere. Despite it's title this book has very little direct contact with mountainbiking. It has zero instruction on technique.I think that the major problem is that the book is mistitled. This is a very well written book on periodized training for the endurance athlete. What Mr. Friel writes is applicable to any endurance sport and most of the text is not specific to mountain biking. It is also directed towards the very serious and experienced athlete.In conclusion: this is an excellent book on periodized training, both theory and practice. If that is what you are looking for then buy this book. If you want to learn about mountainbiking - look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound & Effective Training Plan for Competing","review":"If you're looking for a training regimen that is specifically designed for you with specific goals in mind, this book is for you. Friel helps you find your strengths and weaknesses as well as identifying your goals.

It is a great guide to help you peak at just the right time to be your best for a race or other competition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hardcore for recreational riders!","review":"Thorough book but only for those that are interested in racing.

However my real gripe with this one is the Inside Diameter that is stated to be 2-7/8\\". For my particular needs I required at least a 2-3/4\\" diameter or larger, so this driver should have worked. But it didn't! The true inside diameter is a little less than 2-3/4\\" which is then made worse by the shape not being fully round, but instead being a bit flatten on the welded side. So the largest diameter I could find was just short of 2-3/4\\" and in places it was reduced to less than 2-3/8\\". So beware! if the inside diameter is important for your purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Hazard","review":"There is a serious safety hazard with this driver. The short length allows the operator to raise the driver high enough to disengage with the top of the post. If the edge of the bottom of the driver then lands on top of the post the weighted top of the driver with be pulled in a 90 degree arc downward toward the operator's head with sufficient force to cause injury requiring emergency medical attention (sutures, concussion, neck injury).

I heard a pop from the kitchen and opened the microwave to discover the zipper pull had fired off and the material around the zipper was charring.So, yeah, cloves and lavender smell great.

However the 3 bags of beads do not cover the entire interior surface of the wrap, so you are left with uneven heat distribution. Also the herbal aroma is strong and lingers; we do not find it pleasant. It takes 3-4 minutes in the microwave to heat up sufficiently but does retain the heat nicely--better than the Thermalon. However, the Thermalon heats sufficiently in about 90 seconds. Guess we'll stick with the Thermalon and just reheat it more often as needed. As others have mentioned, beware the metal zipper--we also suffered a scorch mark on ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"cozy neck warmer","review":"After reading the reviews I was a bit leery about the possibility of a microwave fire from metal zipper and unpleasant smell. Both were unfounded fears. There is no metal, just velcro closures. And I find the herbal scent to be pleasant. The cover is very soft and comfortable.

The novel is narrated from the 20th century; reflections by Dumpling & her daughter, Sherry, as they travel by SUV from Nevada to Georgia; whereas \\"SUGAR\\" & \\"THIS BITTER EARTH\\" is written from an earlier century, from Sugar's point of view. (Both excellent books.)The only drawback I had about this story is the undertone reference to voodoo. Other than that, the story was well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must you?","review":"Does Bernice have to break our hearts with every book? I loved it. I was everything I expected & some.

This product though, is inexpensive enough that it does not keep me up night with guilt, yet the quality if high enough that I don't fret about using is, particularly when serving to guests. Be warned though, be light with the fingers on this one as it does not take much and it is quite easy to overdue it. I use this with extra virgin olive oil (again, I spend way, way too much on that too), and it works wonders on salads, bread dips, roasts, chops and just about every other dish I prepare.

To position your shot is easy and making the actual shot is easy. BUT there are challenges. There are things called puzzles which are basiclly trick shots on different shaped tables ( star, heart ect.) Those are alot of fun and some are hard to master.

It just doesn't have a convincing look-and-feel of playing a real pool game. It certainly doesn't exercise the graphics capabilities of the PS2 in any signficant manner. The controls are unintiutive and imprecise.

The molds are thin plastic and will not hold up to repeated use. In fact, one of them broke after placing it in the freezer to remove the letter (as directed). This turned out to be a very time-consuming and tedious process. It took several hours to make the letters I needed for my cake (14 in total). Pressing both colors into the same mold was not easy at all and took a lot of patience. It was also quite difficult to get the letters out of the molds, even after dusting the molds with cornstarch as directed.

It just takes a smidgen too long to get where it's going, although the ending is fine.Due to the title and cover art, it is not revealing too much to say that Karloff becomes a killer, one with a rather scrunched-up face. These contortions seem appropriately gruesome at first, yet ultimately distract from the film. For one thing, for the movie to have us believe that these meager facial alterations would make him totally unrecognizable to those around him is asking a bit much.Still, some strongly dark atmosphere and intriguing storytelling are present. Probably worth a half-star more, but the bad slightly outweighs the good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing on all levels","review":"The first thing you will notice when flipping through this book is the stunning photography. It is obvious that Corey Rich is not just taking pictures, but putting himself in the mind of the athlete to capture what they are seeing. Every image is a compelling and iimportant part of the book. In addition to the photography, the side notes help this book to stand apart from the rest. I have a renewed appreciation for what it takes to be behind the lens in these situations. This is a must read and must see for any who enjoys photography, action sports or the outdoors."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential addition to the history of the Napoleonic wars","review":"This is one of the best books I have read on the Napoleonic era. Although I believe the first world war to be the Seven Years war Fergosi compelling argues how the Napoleonic wars engulfed the world. From the Caribbean to Europe, to America to Australia the forces of Europe clashed and brought destruction across the globe to stop the man from Corsica. The struggle for empire between the British and the French is very clearly seen and well analyzed. It is very easy to read and whether you are a beginner or an avid expert of Napoleon this is an excellent book. This is an essential addition to any Napoleonic library. Highly recommend as one of the two great books I have read on Napoleon (out of some 70 books)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Study on the nature of Jesus","review":"This is an amazing book. It explores in detail the topic of who Jesus is and his relationship to his Father, God. The authors have done an extremely good job at providing a thorough explanation of the Biblical Unitarian perspective. I especially enjoyed Appendix A, which reviews 100 of the most common verses Trinitarians normally use to prove the deity of Christ. This books goes far beyond what many other books on this subject, which only talk about what Jesus is not, and spends many chapters on who he is and what he is doing now.This is a must read for anyone who is serious questioning the doctrine of theTrinity and wants to understand scripturally solid arguments that prove differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"After reading this book you will know who Jesus is.","review":"Most non-trinitarians know who Jesus is not. Very few know who Jesus is. This book fully explains who Jesus is and why he is not \\"GOD the SON\\" or a \\"mere\\" mortal (as the trinitarians would like you to think all non-trinitarians believe). You will learn why believing he is the \\"highly exalted\\" Son of God is the truth.These authors explore a subject that for most orthodox Christians is not to be questioned. However, anyone who seriously studies the Scriptures cannot reconcile the Jesus revealed in the churches with the Jesus revealed in the Scriptures. This book reveals the truth about Jesus and where and when the error crept into the Christian faith.It is a must read for any believer who truly wishes to know who the only begotten Son of God is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Word on The Word of God","review":"Covers the subject from every angle, and is presented in an enjoyable, easy- to-read style. In the process of relating the uniqueness of Christ, the work again shows that Holy Scripture is God-breathed, with no contradictions. Apparent \\"contradictions\\" will enter in when Scripture is asked to justify man-made doctrine. Appendix A shows that the verses used to try to validate Trinitarian doctrine say something totally different than what Trinitarians have inferred from them. Anyone whose goal is getting to the Truth of God's Word should have and read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flesh and Boring!","review":"This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read this year. I can't believe I wasted my money on it! The plot line is awful, and the story has way to many characters. You really don't like any of them, and can't wait for the next one to get murdered. The ending was vey predictable. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done to death!","review":"Kellerman has become too complacent in developing this series character, and the book just rambles on as if the reader is supposed to fill in the blanks. There are no twists, which by definition is what makes something a THRILLER. This was not thrilling at all . . . Kellerman has fallen victim to the growing trend among successful authors to just phone in tired tales to their large reading audience. The plot is a bad episode of \\"Barretta\\" at best or some T.V movie of the week at worst. The characters show up and deliver lines that are right of a high school production and you skip around so much trying to find some meat that you lose track of the story. Perhaps Kellerman is tired of this genre, because his main character seems to be just going through the motions as well. It's been a long time since this series was exciting . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually 4 1/2 stars....","review":"Jonathon Kellerman is a master of suspense and mystery! I am a die-hard horror buff and have recently branched out to other forms of literature. Kellerman is among the best in any genre, he writes with a clear and concise style that is easy to understand and enjoy.Kellerman's plots always have twists and turns just when u think u have it all figured out. He is a lot like John Saul without the supernatural influence; both men are great storytellers.Kellerman and his wife, Faye, are the best husband-wife combo out there (not that are a lot of them, but hey who's counting?) and both write best-sellers.Jonathon writes about real people and real activities; that is what is \\"scary\\". In horror, we are talking about far-fetched stuff for the most part. Kellerman writes about stuff that very possibly could and DOES happen!!The Kellerman household must be very busy and I think they are a very special couple. I read anything they put out because it is a sure-fire red-hot page-turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read and idiotic!","review":"In real life, detectives have to track down every possible lead and interview everyone with the slightest possible information about their case. Most of it amounts to nothing...which is why we read thrillers.Unfortunately, Kellerman takes us along on all the useless interviews and dead ends while protagonist Alex Delaware uses psychobabble to speculate about possible motives. And whenever the investigation stalls, Delaware decides to jump in his car and go for a ride \\"to clear his head\\" -and amazingly stumbles upon a hot new lead each time!Overwritten and tiresome, FLESH AND BLOOD will try your patience. For a truly taut and exciting thriller, I strongly recommend PURSUIT by Thomas Perry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and predictable","review":"This is the first time I read a book by Kellerman and it will also be the last. This book could have been written by an aspiring writer and they would have done a better job. It is highly predictable and 'staged'. The whole book is a collection of chance encounters and discoveries. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troubled young girls are murdered","review":"Lauren Teague, a former patient of psychiatrist Dr. Alex Delaware, is found murdered in a dumpster. Her distraught mother comes to Alex, requesting that he help in the murder investigation. There are virtually no clues and Alex and his buddy Milo Sturges, LAPD investigator, have to dig hard to find answers in this case. They find out that another young girl disappeared a year earlier in a similar scenario, and Alex is convinced that the two cases are connected. The investigation takes them into the lives of university psychology professors and to the home of a Hugh Hefner clone. The case also includes some sticky and interwoven family lives and loyalties. This is well-written and is a good mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Jonathan Kellerman really write this book ??","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I found it very hard to believe that Jonathan Kellerman actually wrote this book. I found it downright corny the way Alex Delaware was playing ace detective and kept just happening to be at the right place at the right time. The book seemed to have no \\"story\\" to it, as his always do. I got very bored reading one and a half pages of descriptions of what people were wearing, how their hair looked and on and on. I always enjoyed Kellerman's breif descriptions of people and places, but once again, this became downright corny.I'm glad this was not my first Kellerman book, as I probably wouldn't try another one. I'm a dedicated reader of his and hope that this was just a fluke. Everyone's entitled to one bad book. Hope that was his first and last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truly disappointing performance....","review":"I don't know what's with Kellerman these days. Each of his books, it seems, get worse and worse. Delaware is turning into a very tired character and the author's prose is tired to. Maybe it's time to give this protagonist a break and try to plough some new ground. A very disappointing performance. Too bad, because some of the earlier Delaware books were excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bimbo","review":"A former working girl is dead. She is bright, ambitious, and a student at the time of her death. She was notable for her detachment. Nonetheless, her death evidences the fact that somebody else was in control.Another blonde, a college student, a person considerably younger than the other girl, Lauren, is missing. Next, a person interviewed by the police in the course of the investigation turns up dead. Alex Delaware and Milo, the police officer, feel considerable chagrin.The author uses a ficitious lifestyle magazine and the founder of it as one of the storylines in the book. Although the subject of psychology arises since Alex Delaware is a psychologist, as subject matter it is peripheral to the main plot. What is suggested is that persons who pursue dangerous lines of work create chaotic zones around them as more and more people who surrounded Lauren Teague in life die.Mystery lovers will find this a satisfying yarn. The smooth writing is another reason to enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flesh and Blood","review":"Kellerman's worst. Very trashy, no story, difficult to finish.

Very disappointing compared to previous Kellerman novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, maybe next time..............","review":"I have been a Kellerman fan for years. I love a series, but this time Alex Delaware is dull, needs to get a life and bring himself into 2002!He is so bored he is boring!Kellerman would do good to revamp Delaware's character so that he does not sound like all of the other characters in his book.More than reading, I would say I skimmed this book trying my best to find substance.Delaware has become a shadow of his former self and that is sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to finish type book","review":"How ridiculous that this phycologist would spend that much time investigating a death of one of his patients from 10 years prior that he only saw 2 times.

Wonderful read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a talented author, just a prolific one....","review":"Jonathan Kellerman is an irritating writer to read---the plots are okay, it's his prose style...especially in the Delaware books, which I check out occasionally from the library.

That can be overlooked, but the grinder was horrible in its grinding ability.

Well have fun with this one gang! The missions are tough, but fun. the graphics are pretty good, not great, but good enough. You have to use your head sometimes to avoid being killed or detected, but it's a great game and I would say well worth the money. This one's a sleeper. Never heard any advertising or promo's for it, but I stumbled onto it and had a great time. I highly recommend it. I'm a hard-corps combat gamer and I love this one. You won't go wrong with it, believe me. You usually have a choice of a number of different weapons and you can pick up weapons from the VC you kill. It's exciting at times and a bit scary in spots. The VC hide pretty good, so be wary or you'll be the victim... AND, this game has saves and plenty of them so you don't have to worry about that... Buy it, you'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stress management","review":"This is a game for patient people.

I highly recommend it on those grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"contains spyware","review":"After the game installed it wanted me to register it. At that point Windows Defender popped up and said it was known to be harmful so I closed the registration box. I was able to open the game and proceeded to play the tutorial.

This time it was my firewall saying it had blocked a transmission and did I want it to continue blocking. I did. At that point I just restored my computer to before the installation.I hate it when you buy a game and then find out that it installs spyware or malware onto your computer.

They see you when they shouldn't and they never miss...EVER.

Even when they shouldn't be able to see you, they shoot and kill you within 6-8 shots.)Sniping is to easy.Your able to walk directly up a wall face. It seems to be a glitch, one that could have been fixed.In night missions you are given a rifle with a night vision scope on it, which makes it nearly impossible to use.Multi-player is fun but in most games people just use the hugely overpowered Grenade launcher and spawn kill.I had high hopes for this game, but ultimately it failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I love the adventure travel genre, but this one doesn't make the grade.

Altough, having spent a few thousand on my own violin, I expected a low quality violin, this was unacceptable. I tune kids all the time who have cheep quality instruments, but I was unable to get this violin to stay in tune for more that 2 measures of a song. This is a great violin for decorating and hanging on a cealing, but not for any more than that. Although many parents believe that a begining student does not need anymore than this quality of violin, this is simply not true. Speaking from experience, children with these types of instruments often become more frusterated with music than other children, and these instruments often break very quickly. If you are a parent loooking for an instrument for a child who is just begining lessons, I would strongly advise that you spend more on an instrument, or simply rent from the local music store.Best of luck,~C.

Although i knew these things happened in slavery but to actually hear it from those who actually lived thru it still ripped at my heart.Being a very proud woman of color to read what my ancestor's had to go thru and still keep the faith and carry on makes me both proud and faithful.I highly recommend this book to anyone who really wants to know the truth about slavery and to any person of color who is truly proud of who they are and truly want to know about their heritage.An EXCELLENT READ AND I WILL BE PURCHASING THE 100 SLAVE MEMOIRS AS WELL."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Books I Have Ever Read","review":"The author takes the best or most descriptive of the narratives and puts them into this extremely inexpensive book.

You MUST use it as a review and a means to spur new thought and point you in new directions of study. Don't think that reading it cover to cover and learning the answers will help you. Take the tests, find out what you got wrong, and focus on those areas. The Oral section is totally outdated. Your best bet is to read books like Arnheim cover to cover. Talk to ATC's in your school or your area to get their insight. I completed an internship (which is quickly becoming a thing of the past), and after reading countless books passed the written and written sim with flying colors. Don't neglect the practical.

Differences in language can be confusing: for example \\"animal-care assistants\\" are refered to as \\"unqualified\\". In US English, \\"unqualified\\" means \\"incompetent\\". In the Queen's English, \\"unqualified\\" means that one has not been admitted to a profession (eg: vet). More serious problems in the book include the ommission of some diseases that occur in the US, such as \\"corona virus\\", a potentially greater killer of puppies. Also, this book has NO information whatever on spaying or neutering a dog. In the US, almost all responsible persons spay or neuter, and the surplus dog population mainly comes from irresponsible low-lifes. In contrast, in England it is much less common for even responsible persons to spay or neuter.

The gameplay is uninspired: you run through a level, fighting guys, until you get to the end of the level, then you go to the next level. There's no strategy to it and nothing to think about. You just tap keys a lot. The game levels are interwoven with cut scenes, both animated and filmed, which is actually annoying in practice; you want to play the game and you have to stop and wait far too long to do so. Plus the inflexible game save system forces you to watch the same movies over and over again for difficult levels. The controls are awkward. The story, such as it is, is unnecessary, and anyway if they wanted to tell a story they should have just released it as a video like The Animatrix.

The mouse support during the driving is absolutely horrid, as it the menu selection. The Matrix: reloaded concurrent story line is very nice, and most likely the only reason anyone can find to play the game. And while the live footage is a very nice touch, the in game animations are choppy and unatural at best.

The first level is a great way to get into the game, lots of action although the fact that people you have already wasted re-appear is annoying.. The graphics are good although they could have been a little more polished (guess thats the problem with strict release dates).

Within about 5 mins of playing the game, half the cities police force is trying to kill you! The graphics rock, including the faces, which I read were scanned on to a computer,and glued on to the chracter. Like in the Matrix movies, both chracters have special Kung Fu abilities. A blow in the head with your fist is no way to handle things; You can press and hold focus and run at a wall to run on it, and kick the bad guys in the head.

However, the graphics are terrible and the controls are more than terrible. You spend most of your time being shot by people you can't even see because the camera is pointing the wrong direction. And there is no aiming reticle in 3rd person. In other words, you just shoot a lot and hit something about every 10th shot or so. In scenes with cars the wheels are SQUARE (and I'm running a VERY top of the line system)! That should give you some idea of how disappointing this is.

But it didn't start there. The install process was horrible as well. The installer for the game popped up with error after error. I'm very upset by all this.

I'm using a trainer to try to follow the story and not have to worry about gameplay and can just run through -- but I still have to do the stupid driving levels!

It looks really good from what they Say, and the story is good. But the Graphics stink, and the car chasing scene and fighting effects aren't that good. But if you want to hear the story you have to buy it. So I would not recommend that you buy this game unless you really want to hear the story. But thats not all the camera views are not that good either and the characters are really jerky. The AI is not that good either. But it does have some good things also. The sound is good, the music is good, some fights are good, the controls are ok and the movies are good.

Unfortunately, I was disappointed. From the very first time I watched Ghost flail his arms when he ran, I knew this game just wasn't going to cut it. In the attempt to make a workable control system, Shiny has made something that doesn't respond fluidly. Instead, the focus jumps between targets, jerking the viewpoint around and making navigation difficult. Additionally, the game is way too under-challenging. I'm no expert player, but all you have to do is sit still for a few seconds and your health just magically refills. It really sucks the challenge out of the game. Maybe a few patches down the road things will be better, but things are still way too rough at version 1.52"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistically high system requirements!","review":"My system:AMD Athlon XP 1800+ 1.53 GHz1GB DDR RAM2 40GB 7200RPM HDD'sSound Blaster Live Platinum 5.1ATI Rage Fury Pro 32MB AGP 4xApparently it won't run at all on my Video Card.

I found it impossible to move myself around with ease.

I'm running Windows XP, and yes, I've been through all the troubleshooting steps, Atari is trying to pass the ball, all my drivers are updated, and every other DirectX game on my system runs flawlessly, but this one is seriously buggy.

Maybe not since this one was recommended by a friend. I found some of the advice very comforting (e.g. that young male students will challenge young female faculty), mainly because it helped me feel like my experiences were not all my fault, but were a common part of life for young female faculty. But some of her advice is just odd (e.g. don't ride your bike to work if it makes you stand out).

DC probably had to step carefully to avoid treading on Marvel's copyrights on the Dracula character, and that results in a seriously underwhelming villain. The art, heavily influenced by Bernie Wrightson (and I'm being very kind here), is interesting, but Kelly Jones has never learned to draw human beings in proper proportions: Thalidomide flipper limbs sprout off mutant musclebound torsos, and bodies twist around in knotted, impossible contortions. Doug Moench apparently never got the memo that comix grew up, so he continues to write florid, overwrought funny book prose.

The book just sort of ends without concluding what it started. While I do hope that another book follows to fully conclude the story, it shouldn't have to. This book was not created with an \\"epic storyline spanning multiple books\\" being advertised, so it should conclude the story it began.However, I'm willing to overlook the minor flaws overall and say that this was an excellent book.

Little character development, little plot and almost no closure. Apart from the aliens having better infantry weapons, they exhibit no sense of tactics, organization or military dicipline.There were several miliary mistakes - like the sidewinder missles and a mention of a CH-53 as an \\"attack\\" helicopter. Simple simple fact checking that wasn't done.My issue is that WW3 really was a bunch of isoilated skirmishes using only light weapons and squad tactics. Even those were not well described.

What I found most frustrating was that the author didn't take the 20 seconds needed to do some simple research in various areas. For example, Tornados (or any aircraft) would not attack a ground target with Sidewinder missiles since they are air-to-air missiles. Such sloppiness in details is apparent throughout the book.If you get frustrated with people who try to demonstrate their knowledge of a particular area and then wind up showing you how little they really do know, you will want to throw this book against the wall at various times.If you are looking for something to pass boring hours in the airport this book may just keep you mildly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Took 1 week to return to a shape the pros at Discount Tire could actaully get on a rim.","review":"Shipped folded.

Skaters like it to pump themselves up and only for that reason. Take my advise and don't buy this cd. It's not kinky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very helpful.","review":"I reviewed the daVinci tool separately before I realized I could review them both together (whoops). The back roller for me is not that great. I lie on a short-pile rug to exercise my back. To use the roller, I have to take off my shirt, as it will slide out of position between my shirt and the rug- those rubber traction jobbies at each end are practically useless. It helps a little with soreness between my shoulder blades, but either of these devices is overpriced."},{"rating":"1","title":"This version is NOT 90 minutes long, it is 82 minutes, and looks bad, too.","review":"I ordered one of these as \\"used\\", from an Amazon Seller, and what came was not 90 minutes long (I timed it very carefully). It was 82 minutes like nearly everybody else's version.And, it looked really bad by usual DVD standards -- like as if somebody had made a really bad copy of a VHS tape or something like that. There were none of the usual DVD setup screens, chapters, or anything, which just makes me suspect even more that somebody just dubbed this version off of a VHS tape.Bottom line: I sent the DVD back to the seller and got a refund (which took over a month). Now, I'll just wait for \\"The Blob\\" to be shown on TCM or OnDemand or something like that. It's a sweet, old movie, and my 1-star rating is not aimed at the movie itself or anything about it, per se.

Michael Herr seemingly knew Kubrick well, so those who seek some traits of personality of the great filmmaker should be satisfied. But don't expect much. Herr mostly talked to Kubrick on the phone (or, rather - Kubrick talked to Herr).There are a few anecdotes, a kew quotations, and that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Kubrick","review":"Anyone who is interested in the work of Stanley Kubrick should read this beautifully-written and insightful memoir of Mr. Herr's long, personal and creative relationship with Kubrick. I've read the biographies and the compendia of analysis; none has given me as thoughtful and authentic a glimpse of the iconic artist behind some of cinema's greatest works as this book has. If you're looking for a book on Kubrick, this one is essential. Mr. Herr, an elegant writer, knows his subject, which is not only Kubrick but collaboration, creativity, human nature, movies, art and much more, and he shares what he knows."},{"rating":"2","title":"short but articulate.

The final section of this small book is a brand new hell-raising defence of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" as a modern masterpiece: Herr also assails those critics who he believes did dirt to the memory of Kubrick.. Herr is a very seductive, stylish writer, and this memoir of the late, great director is loving, but clear-eyed and a good antidote to Fredric Raphael's vitriolic \\"Eyes Wide Open.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new","review":"From the SK discussion:\\"I received Michael Herr's newbook KUBRICK from Amazon.com yesterday. Much to my surprise anddisappointment, this book is nothing more than a reprint of the two articles that he wrote for Vanity Fair magazine. I assumed that the previously published Vanity Fair material would be incorporated into this book, and greatly expanded upon. But no - they're all you get! There is no new material here, except for one photograph of Kubrick on p.64 that I don't think has been published before. The essays themselves are excellent, but you'd think it would include something besides material that had already appeared in two issues of a magazine that went for $3.95 apiece. Gary\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice companion to the life of Kubrick","review":"This book should be used as a companion while studying Kubrick, as Herr discusses Kubrick as a man and a friend rather than going into Stanley's films in depth.

I would even go as far to say that I really enjoy this album quite a bit. It is quite short, but that's ok, after all, how long can you drag Frosty the Snowman on for? There are 10 songs on this CD, 9 traditionals and 1 original called Lollipop Parade, which is quite a good song.

This book, along with KEISHA's DOORS deserves a place of honor along with LOOKING AFTER LOUIS.It's time for tacos and it is time for this book.

Though the last season was heavier on the \\"World\\" and much lighter on \\"Holly,\\" the first two seasons of Holly's World are a blast, so I knew I'd be purchasing this DVD. This DVD contains both uncensored seasons of Holly's World, some deleted scenes, outtakes and the music video that the group made called \\"Report to the Floor\\" and a super teaser for the season.I do have a few complaints about the set, but they are minor: I wish that there was commentary on the discs. The commentary on the Girls Next Door DVDs have become some of my favorite parts of the entire series - it is so much fun to hear the behind-the-scenes activity. Also, the first episode feels very low-budget and it really comes across in the DVD. Other than that, this is a great set.Holly fans, snatch this up.

I've seen a lot more progress from this game than all the others I've tried. The only complaint I've ever gotten, and mostly from older kids, is that SpongeBob's comments get annoying! Throughout the typing excercises he has little comments and remarks which have gotten to a few of the kids I've seen use it, but I just tell them, \\"turn the volume down\\" and they're ok with that and continue with the game.

The drills should be built into the lessons and associate mastering with specific levels of adjusted (accounts for errors) wpm. VERY IMPORTANT! Your child needs to \\"play\\" regularly, 4-5/week.

After Barbra's brother, Johnny, is killed by a zombie loose in her father's cemetery, she seeks shelter in an abandoned house nearby. She soon discovers that other people are in the house as well, and have been in similar situations as Barbra. As the group of people begin finding more resources during this trauma, they discover that the zombies lurking outside are not just desiring their deaths...they are planning the menu for their next meal!Extremely graphic for its time, \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is a classic of the genre, and anyone seriously interested in the genre should find something great about it. Even if you're not usually interested in horror, you should still watch it.

On the other side, he isa very critical of westerners, yet I found his lack of acurate facts about Bali, their spirituality and purpose inexcusable. One segment talked about the importance of dance in their culture - like Legong - but only showed school boys being taught the dance - no actual visuals of the legong, welcome or any other importance dance. I just returned from an extended stay in Bali and Rick Ray did not do the island and its people any great service with this video. I found it interesting that he put down tourists, but his video is mostly about him - quite arrogant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marion Morash Fish and Vegetable Cookbook","review":"It's frustrating.

There is no attempt to analyze or even really comment on anything that is mentioned in the text; be it a play, a famous director, the author's motives or even World War II.

The chapter exams consist of extremely difficult problems, making the use of this text discouraging.

It introduces new notation, new concepts and DOES NOT explain them. eg, it introduces the Derivative in 1 line without any explanation - somehow Lim x-> 0 (f(c+h)-f(c))/h relates to f(x)=x^2+x because in 2 lines it shows that because a limit can be calculated for the former at a value means that a derivative of the latter can be found with the same value.

This makes the book extremely hard to follow along for a self-help guide.

Why not use a simple continuous function with a single definition to introduce the idea? What can possibly come from using a function that has different definitions depending on the range of x, except adding an unnecessary detail for the reader to weed through? It almost seems that the author is intentionally making it sound complicated to convice the reader that he (the author) is so brilliant that he (the author) can't understand how the reader isn't able to connect the dots, which he (the author) has made unnecessarily difficult to connect.Examples of this unnecessary obfuscation is found in spades in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A self-teaching guide it isn't...","review":"I had bought this book mostly by the claims on its cover--namely that of being a self-teaching guide.

The amount of advertising is disturbing. It seems that for every 1-2 pages of content there is an equal (if not more) amount of advertising. The few articles that I've read have been interesting, but not at the expense of over-exposure to pop culture and media. Shame on you, BSA, for failing to reinforce the values that your organization promotes during den and pack meetings.

It's a shame that some of the quintessential, classic visual comedic moments of Lloyd's career are not represented here, such as losing his trousers at the formal dance in \\"The Freshman,\\" especially when the author takes the trouble to repeat the oft-told tale of Lloyd reassembling the cast and set to add this gag after preview audiences were disappointed that the Freshman's unravelling suit stopped short of his pants.

I am not old, heck, I am in my early twenties, but rest assure, I just do not find this movie funny or tasteful. The only tiny micro-second scene that I like was when Jacob(Who cannot hold a candle to Lautner)shifted into a chihuahua. This is only because I love the breed, and have one of my own. The Simpsons have been making parodies and spoofs since '87, and only one of the hundreds of episodes was not funny.

I am in NO WAY a fan of the twilight books, or movies. But, even though I am a sane adult male, I have seen the films, and read all the books. Needless to say, am an informed on the matter of twilight.I usually stray away from parody movies of late, mostly due to the fact that they are getting dumber and dumber... not to mention more vulgar as each new movie is made. However, the writers of this movie really did their homework. This movie does a great job of taking all those people obsessed with Twilight and giving them a big 'ole middle finger.All in all, a great movie for anyone who was forced to see or have anything to do with the twilight saga. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremly stupid","review":"This movie is so stupid! it's a little funny with it's sarcastic refrences, but i really wouldn't bet on this one to be a blockbuster. this movie is so stupid it has even \\"Strange Brew\\" beat on that scale.

I had heard bad reviews, but decided to make up my own mind. Not only was it in bad taste, it was not very funny at all. I think I probably laughed out loud *once* during the movie (when Bella wakes up to find Edward in her room with his hair in rollers, bleaching his teeth). It's not appropriate for tweens, really either because of the gross sexual humor. I usually don't mind a few swear words if the movie is funny, but this wasn't.

(I laughed at the chiuahua scene)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just Sucks!","review":"3 funny moments that are forgotten in a storm of third grade humor. It doesn't even deserve a courtesy laugh.

And who would have come up with the money to back this one?I am not going to waste your time with the finer points (what finer points?) of the film. Jo I would just say if it were free it would not be worth watching on a bet.The highlight is when someone tells Frank that he is missing the big picture.

Still it penetrates the skin deeply after fifteen minutes and is barely discernable on the skin. It definitely plumps the skin and makes it feel more hydrated. At first this mask may seem a little tingly - it could be the addition of sea salt. This also contains extract of red marine algae, seaweed, sea lettuce, lavender essential oil and sea fennel. This is a good mask to use in the dryness of winter. You may also want to try it as a hand mask.~The Rebecca Review"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I expected","review":"I wanted to love this product. I knew I had to be careful choosing a hydrating mask because I have oily skin so I thought this H2O mask was perfect to get me through the winter months. The consistency is pretty thick, similar to a lotion. The scent is pleasant. Even though I left the mask on for the recommend amount of time, it just felt like it was sitting on top of my skin-not really getting absorbed at all. After several uses and nearly finishing the tube, I haven't noticed any difference in my skin. I think this product is seriously overpriced and ineffective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey Ant & Aardvark Please Come Back!","review":"i can't believe other then the tom & jerry , bugs bunny & othersthe ant and the Aardvark have'nt seen the light of day for awhile & i can't understand why such a classy sidespliting cartoon has not been available. i saw it years ago on one of the networks , but have'nt seen it since then & would love to obtain a copy of this classic slapstick cartoon . let friz's work be shown for what it is , pure genius. jackie mason is wonderful as the high strung grouch Aardvark always chasing after that wisecracking Ant always putting him down.

Well, he didn't. \\"Conspiracies and Secret Societies\\" is the boldest, most daring book about Government Conspiracy and Secrecy that I have read in a VERY long time.

The music isn't too bad, although I've heard better, and I doubt you'll hear many people complaining about sound. In fact, the only thing I can complain about is the plot. While the movies look great, only a few of them told a character's story, and none told them very clearly.

There are twenty one characters(2 in tekken ball)that are playable. It has all your arcade favorites such as Jin,Eddy,Law,Hehachi,and Yoshimitsu. Plus a few new ones for playstation only. There are eight modes to play. There is Arcade,Team,VS.,Survival,Tekken Force,Tekken Ball, Practice,and Time Attack. There are plenty of things to like in Tekken 3.

The chracters in this game seem to be more fun than the basic Mortal Kombat-esque chracters. The Tekken Ball mode is a good reward after you have cleared the arcade mode plenty of times. Tekken force is Final Fight-esque beat em up game and could be sold as a game on its own. Its challenging but it is another game within Tekken 3 and I'm still not bored with it. The separate cinema endings for each chracter give this fighting game a sense of personality that only the Tekken series has. The music in this game is the best in the entire fighting genre and you'll wanna get theatre mode just to listen to this music It fits the game perfectly. If you're into fighting and action games this is the game for you! ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"[Tekken 3]","review":"The best of the tekken games. The graphics are the best I've seen in a fighting game for a long time. The characters are amazing and have tons of moves to learn. Even the classic fighters like Nina, Anna and Heihachi have new tricks up their sleves. There are many hidden characters and loads of new ones. To make it more different some characters have hidden costumes, to find them you have to complete from around 10 to 50 times! As well as this, there's a new sub game called Tekken Force. You choose a character and fight the Mishama armies with a boss at the end of the level. When you've completed it you gain a key. When you have three you fight another fight after Heihachi and gain a odd character. I give this game a ten and reccomand it to tekken fans and fighting game lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good translation","review":"This game has one of the better translation from arcade to video game. The graphics and even the sounds are similar, down to the finest detail. The only bad thing: you must get a good joystick to play the game -- otherwise, the controls are very tricky at best. The hidden levels and characters are pretty cool. However, with the release of Tekken 4 and its new mode of fighting, Tekken 3 may become primitive and outdated. All in all, still an excellent game and excellent hidden levels and characters.The Tekken Ball mode being one of my favorites -- especially with me and one of my friends. Tekken Force mode is also not too bad -- although the movement (such as sidestepping and turning) are EXTREMELY tricky and fickle.

Two of them are Dunkle books.By These Ten Bones is not fantasy at all. It feels very real. Like this may have happened and Dunkle was channeling when she wrote this. The cultural references are very good, and I cen see the valley quite clearly in my mind.I read books in cycles. Romance, fantasy, mystery, ect. And By These Ten bones usually ends up being last since I save the best for last."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"This reads like a first novel, too choppy and vague for my taste. Dunkle inserts historical information in a less-than-subtle manner (such as her description of the villagers' clothing) without grounding us in the reality of the time period. (What time period? In what country?) This aspect of the tale reminded me of Sherryl Jordan's _The Raging Quiet_, an equally implausible plot in an equally vague historical setting. Even the werewolf mythology is incomplete, not in how one becomes a werewolf, but in how one heals from being a werewolf. I wouldn't recommend this to a discerning fantasy reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I really liked this book, because for once, a werewolf has a happy ending. I really like that Dunkle was able to find some fresh ideas about werewolfs, and that the characters arent werewolf stereotypes,for once.Story: ABackround image: BCharacters:A"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch out!

A day later, I get an email from Circuit City (the online affiliate of Amazon for the Mini) saying they have no Ipod Mini's instock and my order is cancelled. But, Amazon does not cancel my order for the Arm Band nor can I cancel it. So, I getting an Ipod Arm Band and no Ipod. Real Lame. I would wait until you have confirmation of shipping on the IPod Mini, before getting this Arm Band (they don't arrive together anyway) or you could be stuck getting an Arm Band (for $30) and no IPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE waste of money!","review":"What possessed me to spend $30 on a rubbery piece of velcro?! I have no idea! I bought this thing because I was so paranoid about taking my new iPod mini to the gym, and I thought I should play it safe and get the arm band. HUGE waste of money! I should have just bought one of those wrist bands you can get at Target for $1.50 and clipped my iPod to it using the belt clip that it came with. That would have been just as effective as the \\"official\\" iPod mini armband, and I would be $28.50 richer than I am right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Destined for the back of a drawer","review":"I found the armband to be uncomfortable and inconvenient. I think the upper arm is just a bad place to carry an iPod. The added weight is distracting when I'm running. Even worse is any activity that requires me to flex my biceps at all, so lifting weights is out. Put it on too tight, and I constrict the muscle. Loosen it a little, and the band slips off. There is no happy medium. Also, the earphone cord gets in the way more when it's leading from my arm.The belt clip that came with my iPod mini works much better for me. I clip it on the waistband of my sweatpants when I'm working out and it remains very secure, even when I'm running on the treadmill. And the cord stays close to my body, where it is far less likely to get caught on something.The only advantage of this product is that it lets you advertise to the world that you own an iPod mini. Big deal. My armband is destined to be forgotten in the back of a drawer at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"The clip is better","review":"I bought the armband when I got my mini ipod.

It takes forever to get it just right, so that it won't slip off and still it feels uncomfortable and not quite right. Now they have them in sorts of colors, don't buy it, you'll just get annoyed everytime you want to use it, like me."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a better and much cheaper alternative","review":"There is no need to buy this armband. Just get yourself a length of two-sided velcro (There is a kind that sticks to itself.) Wrap it around your arm and attach your iPod to it using the belt clip that came with it.

Hitler's Peace is the worst yet; I simply can't believe that the man who created Bernie Gunther and the brilliant Berlin Noir trilogy is now writing such tedious rubbish. Please, save your money. If you must read Kerr's latest, you're likely to find a copy in the street, where a former admirer like me has flung it in disgust."},{"rating":"1","title":"lower your expectations","review":"I loved the Berlin Noir trilogy. I found Hitler's Peace very unsatisfying. Kerr fans who liked Philosophical Investigation and Esau may like this, but I doubt it. Hitler's Peace is larded with interesting philosophical questions like why Roosevelt insisted on \\"unconditional surrender\\" acted out against a backdrop of spy/counterspy, but in the end the book is neither/nor, not noir. Furthermore, the mayhem Kerr turns on his best characters is simply frigid. Read it, but lower your expectations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical fiction -- a fantasy thought about World War II","review":"This fantasy of \\"Hitler's Peace\\" is well worth reading. It includes enough facts and factual material to make the \\"surprise\\" of the book a possibility that is not beyond reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"insult to history","review":"This is not a good book. The characters are wooden, the plot contrived, and the writing is simplistic and dull. Moreover, the idea that the great events of history could somehow be changed by improbable schemes supposedly hatched by Hitler and Stalin (with cameos form pet demons Himmler and Beria) is really insulting. The hero is a cartoon whose arrogance and self-pity really grate after a while. Yet somehow astute politicians such as FDR and Churchill defer to his judgement?Kerr does a good job of providing period versimilitude - not least in that his characters seem to smoke before and after every word, thought, and sex act. He pays attention to brands and models of stuff and that's why I gave it a 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillful intrigue","review":"Phillip Kerr gets better with each book. The history incorporated is largely accurate and informative up to but not including a literary gimmick toward the end, which has a highly improbably confrontation at a conference toward the end of WWII in Europe. But gimmick included it is a most enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why does Kerr have it in for Ayn Rand?","review":"I have now read quite a few of Kerr's Bernie Guenther novels as well as others and if my memory serves me right in several of them Kerr slams Ayn Rand. He is especially annoyed with The Fountainhead, it seems, although he never actually argues with any of its themes. However, Kerr's protagonists are somewhat sympathetic to communism and the Soviets (during WW II), and of course, Rand detested the Soviets. So maybe this is Kerr's payback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Fans of the excellent Berlin Noir trilogy and other of Kerr's earlier books will be disappointed by this. In the overflowing field of what-if books on the Second World War, \\"Hitler's Peace\\" offers one of the more improbable plots and will soon be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"A failure at re-written history","review":"I jumped at the chance to buy this book, and quickly read it. It neither does justice to the history of the period nor when it re-writes history. Hitler never won an election; he lost all of the elections he entered. He came to power only because he had the largest majority in the Bundestag. The Joints Chiefs came into being in August 1949. Constantly referring to Hap Arnold, George C. Marshall and the other generals and admirals as 'Joint Chiefs' detracts from the story line. What were they thinking? This does not add credence to the story line, it simply detracts from it. I had another problem with the sloppy editing. There were too many errors of grammar that never should have been made. I found the book to be easy reading, though, and quickly read. I enjoyed it even with these minor faults. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys this kind of period novel, but realize that it is not 100% authentic in accuracy or re-writing history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateurish and Contrived","review":"This must be one of Kerr's earliest works, as it certainly doesn't measure up to his more recent efforts.The main character, Meyer, is, like most of Kerr's heroes, a fellow traveler who still seems to tilt to the left even after learning of two of Stalin's most diabolical massacres: the Katyn Forest Massacre and the murderous conditions inflicted upon German POW's.The plot is certainly far-fetched, as is the ending, although some of the characters are interesting.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather Absurd","review":"The first two-thirds of the book are well-constructed and well-plotted. But after that it descends in an arc through the improbable (e.g., the main character conveniently bends over just in time for the bullet meant for him to miss and kill someone else) to the absurd: Adolf Hitler comes to the 1943 Tehran summit to meet with the Big Three.I read sometime ago in the New Yorker that publishing houses no longer give their editors time to work with authors to improve their work. I believe it.Two stars instead of one only because the earlier part of the book is so well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lesson In Love","review":"SHOPWORN ANGEL is a movie about a worldly Broadway actress (Margaret Sullivan) who meets a doughboy (Jimmy Stewart) just before he leaves for France. Stewart is a naive cowboy from Texas who brags to his army buddies that he knows Sullivan. When they actually do meet Stewart immediately falls in love with her. The only complication is that Sullivan really loves her business manager Walter Pigeon. This awkward situation forces both Sullivan and Pigeon to look deeper and learn new truths about life and love.Margaret Sullivan is superb as her character changes visibly from a spoiled and egotistical mess into a warm and giving adult. Stewart, Pigeon and Hattie McDaniel give their usual strong performances mostly playing themselves. Sullivan's singing is dubbed by Mary Martin.H.C. Potter also directed MR.

It filled me with both fear and surprise. I found it intruiging, and powerful. It filled the void in my reading, as I had been looking for a long time for something, and didn't know what, this was it. The creativity of the \\"beast\\" in this book was exceptional, and it was a different, and more powerful writing style that I had ever found before. Pike's style is wonderful and captavating, and I love each and every one of his works. The setting is perfect, and the story is magical, it left me with chills. I couldn't put the book down! I recommend this book to everyone, get to know one of the greatest writers of the 20th century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very different for Pike's taste.","review":"Spellbound was a very different book to read my Mr. Pike, if you've read enough of his works to see how he usually goes. This involved the supernatural, and the plot is just a tad far-fetched. Although, I must say it was kind of complicated.

For all his books are wonderful and will keep you turning the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Christopher Pike book ever","review":"I can't believe it... I've found a Christopher Pike I can't stand. This book is really crappy and far fetched. At the end of the book, a girl's soul gets trapped in a parrot. Give me a break. I don't like the Christopher Pike books that envolve the supernatural and science fictiion, I like the stories such as Chain Letter and Weekend.

It is also a worthwhile review for the general public who want to have a better understanding of our debt to the ancient Greeks and Romans, and to trace the developments that led from the Dark Ages to the Middle Ages, the Renaissance and the Age of Reason.Van Doren is somewhat less helpful in dealing with the 20th century, and his speculation about the 21st century.

This guy has absolutely no concept of how scientists think (he claims it's all math, no ideas/concepts); his sweeping generalizations and stereotypes completely ignore current research in the neurosciences regarding learning and memory and the mind/body problem, not to mention the rest of the entire field of biomedical sciences.

His insights are compassionate and honest. I disagree with him that the \\"Warm and Fuzzy\\" computers of the future will not lend a helping had to human nature. To the contrary I believe that such computers will have tremendous potential to change humanity. Time will tell. I DO agree however with his view that computers have no instict or desire to revolt or take over the world. Anyhow, I respect his views on this and many other subjects. Great book...

This book has a huge Western Civilization/Chrisitianity bias, as though anyone reading it would only be interested in other cultures to the extent that they influenced the dominant culture. The shallowness of his remarks in areas that I know a great deal about lead me to distrust his remarks in areas that I am less familiar with.

He also uses views of cults when \\"explaining\\" Christianity. He states that Jesus went to hell for three days, after He was crucified. THE BIBLE NEVER SAID THAT!!!

The best part of it is the index so you can skip the bull and get to the stuff you want to read. Parts of this book intrigued me only because i am fan of history, but the writer kind of scares me. His socialist view of a world government especially gave me goosebumps (\\"Why Not World Government?\\"). He pulls off making this part of the book convincing, but if you're aware of all the problems with the military-police state and globalist agendas (Global 2000 report by Cyrus Vance, the birth of the HIV virus{yes, it's a man-made virus, search on clusty.com}) you probably won't agree with him. The way he ends the section is quite disgusting and very suspicious, like he wants you to take his side (\\"Right?\\").

But his writing skills need to be more mature. The characters aren't engaging, and do not seem to have distinct personalities or internal motivations.The story also develops too slowly, and the reader is kind of strung along until the end as if it were a mystery novel, however there isn't any real sense of suspense, mystery or wonder that might motivate you to keep reading.Hard to believe this is the same novel that is hyped on the cover. While my review is rather negative, this book isn't awful, but it suffers in comparison to the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"EMPTY SPACE!","review":"I love hard sci-fi, but Mr Reynold's Revelation Space is a dull and insipid second-rate tale that belongs somewhere in the Star Trek league.It might all be scientifically squared off, but the storyline is repetitious and confusing, the characters lack any saving graces, and the ending is incredibly unimaginative and sell-out.To me, it felt like Mr Reynolds was trying to distill the best of Iaine M.Banks, Dan Simmons and Peter F Hamilton all into one pastiche of the genre...and failed.Mr Reynolds, either stick to the hard science you understand, or take a writing course in developing human characters we can sympathize with and actually want to follow across the universe.Sorry Alastair, but Revelation Space reads like Empty Space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Edited","review":"The publishers of this book, Orion Publishing Group, should be ashamed of themselves. This is my first book by alastair reynolds. Though I think he could one day be a very competent writer, I feel like he isn't really \\"there\\" yet. However, if Orion wanted to publish a book by him, they could have at least put an interested Editor on board in order to clean up the numerous spelling mistakes, typographical errors, character flaws, plot holes, and narrative definicies rampant throughout the novel.I skimmed the last hundred or so pages because the writing just got increasingly worse. The dialogue was terrible. There was constant repetition of previous passages. I feel like this book was written in pieces, and instead of tying it all together in a seamless fashion, the author clumped it together, and badly at that.However, I did finish the book, so there must have been some redeeming qualities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most intelligent SF I've read in years","review":"If you watch the chapter headings carefully you will realize that Reynolds even takes the speed of light and travel times into account.

That said this book is a really good book. I don't know what readers who don't read a lot of sci fi would think of this book, but as a fan of the genre I really liked it. My problem is that I've read so much sci fi that it is hard to find stuff that is original enough for me to enjoy. This book is an epic, well written, and original enough to keep me reading. The only problem I had is the punctuation and grammar are a little off. It's not as bad as some kindle books I've read and I'll put up a lot for an interesting story anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Revelation Space","review":"Reynolds is a phenomenal writer, and this is not an easy read. It begins \\"in medias res\\" using language that only makes sense if you stick with it. The payoff, however, is worth it. As the action unfolds in circles within circles, the logic is flawless, and the ending is satisfying enough to hook you into the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chasing Neil Stephenson, Bruce Sterling, and the Gregs","review":"A profusion of highly inventive ideas in the same hyperintelligent vein of Stephenson, Sterling, Egan, and Bear. Not yet as humorous as Sterling or Stephenson or as edgy as Egan and Bear, but this first novel actually has a better ending than many of these modern masters seem to be able to muster (much better than Stephenson's first outings).Yes, there are some some very soft spots in the plot; yes, the choppy relativistic time frame makes it hard to develop and relate to characters, but the underlying theme and global plot development is excellent--well worth the 10 hours it may take to read.If his editors and publisher give him time to refine and tweak the next plot (and solicit some smart readers to help out) then we may have a classic. I have not yet read Chasm City yet. Fingers crossed.There goes a research career for a promising astrophysicist. Clone him quick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good First Sci-fi Novel","review":"Reynold's Revelation Space was an interesting story on the way humanity began to evole into a different species through the use of science, though his claim that culture not nature as a vehicle for evolution was unconvincing.What I did enjoy was the scope of the plot of his novel that remind me of Isaac Asimnov's \\"The Foundation Trilogy\\" or Robert Blumetti's \\"Ironstorm.\\" The galactic scope of the story was well done and believible soaring across time and space. If you like to read complex stories then I recormend Revelation Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better that your average space opera","review":"For anyone who gets bored by 'hard' SF, this novel has a lot more going for it, well-described cultures and technologies, action on a grand scale, a backstory which will leave you amazed and a even couple of half-decent female characters.

I tried the sequel also.. same..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but sometimes hard to follow","review":"When I decided to start reading science fiction this is what I started with. What a shock. You need to be able to keep track of several story lines happening in several different decades. After adjusting to this I found myself quite engaged in the story and very drawn into this universe.However, I didn't feel like the universe's background had been adequately introduced. This left me confused since there is so much new jargon and references popping up everywhere. I have since finished the trilogy and the stand alone \\"Chasm City\\". It was the latter that really helped explain some things and I might recommend reading it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop reading before the last 12 pages!","review":"Great book, a great plot, exciting characters, kept me guessing till the end, book would have got 5 stars if it had stopped twelve pages earlier then it did, (except last 2 pages) the part about the neutron star was totally unbelievable and dumb....an apparant misguided effort to give the book a \\"happy\\" ending...maybe the editors required it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was excited after reading the positive reviews for this book, and after reading the first few pages. But by page 150 I realized that I no longer cared what happened next. The characters are incredibly dull and one-dimensional. I also was frustrated by the fact that there seemed to be no logic in what the author chose to describe at length, versus what was hardly described at all. Relatively unimportant objects where described in detail, while more important objects were hardly described or explained at all. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Perhaps the cover text about \\"Best Sci-Fi of the Year\\" raised my expectations too high, but I was disappointed in this book. Although it has some interesting devices and some reasonably plausible science, the characters and their interaction with each other and their world simply wasn't compelling. There's no real hero; maybe an anti-hero. In addition, the \\"epic\\" plot line taking place over centuries merely serves to confuse and to rip you from one locale you're just starting to be interested in to the next, 50 -100 years later. As a measuring stick, I'd give Peter Hamilton's Night's Dawn (The Reality Dysfunction) series five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed...","review":"Had a lot of hope when I began to read this tome.. and tome it is... it just meanders on and on and nothing moves ahead... sluggish.

Just didn't engage me for some reason...probaly because it's really a rather dull beginning... And (as other reviewers have stated) I'm sorry too because I really did want to like this book. It's just a big lump of something impenetrable... and so uncomfortable to hold it in your hands, it weighs a ton!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused & Wandering & Silly","review":"This is one I thought I\`d like a lot. I didn't. Confusing, wandering, promising much more than it delivered, what this book needed was a decent editor. It's also full of cynical, monomanical characters and too-cute-for-words dialogue (a regretable trend in much sci-fi these days). The ending is merely silly. Where are you Vernor Vinge?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fizzled towards the end","review":"The good part of the book was that it is unpredictable, mysterious, and a bit suspenseful at times. However, this cannot overcome the lack of character development. The author could have killed off any character in the book at any time, and I couldn't have cared less. I was a bit bored by the end, and only stuck with it to see where the author was going.A large part of the book deals with people converted in AI on machines. However, the author made little attempt to make these AI personalities seem like \\"Real Life\\". I would recommend Tad William's Otherworld for a better treatment of the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let him suck you in","review":"I really enjoyed the first books. They were slow getting started but I put it down to careful plot building. There are a number of interesting sub plots. The final book in the series, Absolution Gap, is just plain ridiculous. Mr. Reynolds abandons all his subplots in what appears to be a hurry up finish. Maybe he got tired of writing? I could have put up with the mediocre book plot to get to some closure on the series long subplots. Nope.Once I buy into a series, I think I'm owed more than he delivered. I'll never read anything by him again. This was not a question of an author finding his voice. In some cases, a writer visibly improves or changes as his writing progresses. This is just a bad ending.He should have stuck with astronomy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate","review":"every character in this book. What a bunch of @55h0les.

Reading afterward on Wikipedia a summary of the book and of the larger Revelation Space universe just confirmed that the book would not be worth reading.The plot is goofy and unrealistic, from the small details to the big picture (the motivation of the Inhibitors for wiping out all civilizations). Characters are wooden, dialog is awful, plot is wobbly. In short, there are better books out there for SF lovers (try Iain Banks or Vernor Vinge, for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont bother","review":"This book was probably the worst book I have ever read. It jumps from one time frame to another with no apparent order. There are so many flashbacks, it becomes very confusing.

It promised so much and delivered so very little."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Bulwer-Lytton fans only","review":"This is appallingly written.

But Reynolds drones on and on about sci-fi baloney that would only interest a physics PhD or a geek that thinks he knows science, coincidence? I think not. And where was the editor for this book? Reynolds writing isn't good enough to spend a couple paragraphs describing a bio \`war' at the molecular level. He may have had some cool new ideas but I couldn't get through all the bio-tech B.S. It was just plain boring.And then there are his characters. Cardboard cutouts have more going on. I didn't care one bit about these people, live, die, whatever. But as one reviewer pointed out, Reynolds somehow kept me thinking that something was finally going to happen. Nothing happened, honestly I couldn't take it anymore and skipped the last 30-40 pages and read the last chapter. Even that was painful and completely anti-climactic. But I was determined, just so I could warn you off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini-review: Semi-hard sci-fi","review":"Don't be put off by the label of \\"hard\\" science fiction. This book contains some hard science backdrop, to be sure, but by and large it is a sprawling novel with some interesting, and interestingly flawed, characters. Those readers who generally prefer fantasy-type science fiction or military-oriented sci-fi will probably not like this book so well. It is not action-packed. Neither the climax nor the denouement is completely satisfying, but this book reminds me of Cavafi's poem Ithaka: this is about the journey, not about arriving at a destination. If the journey is rich enough, you will not feel cheated at the final destination. This book, its storyline, and its characters definitely make the journey rich."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read!","review":"What can I say? I enjoyed this book enough that I bought some of his other books. I thought it was a little slow at times but overall still give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"I love space opera, and was pretty pleased with this. Although maybe not quite on par with the earlier stuff by Iain Banks (Consider Phlebas, Against a Dark Background), and Vernon Vinge; it is much, much better than Peter Hamilton, which isn't hard sf at all. He writes about disguised zombies, while Reynolds keeps it real. The story is exciting, and of course the secrets should be released little by litte. The person complaining about BIG SECRETS being dumped suddenly really doesn't grasp how a story should unfold, and should stick to kid's novels. Reynolds provides good, hard sf, a little bloated maybe, but not too much, not like the overswelling Hamilton-novels, who seem to decide beforehand to make his novels 1200+ pages. Anyway, I intend to read more of Reynolds, as this was most convincing. But if you haven't read early Banks, I would do that first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to finish","review":"This is another sci-fi book that I bought because the Amazon reviews were excellent.Unfortunately, I am 200 pages into it after 2-3 months of working on it.

It's only on my desk because my wife brought it in from the kitchen when she was picking up.I feel obligated to finish it and figure out what's going on, but it's almost like chinese water torture. There's so much stuff in it that doesn't contribute to the story and, after 200 pages, I don't feel like it's progressing towards a conclusion.The biggest problem I have with books like these is the excessive technobabble and jumping back and forth between timelines, ships, locations, and even characters.

The story is heavy on science, backing off just before your eyes start to glaze over and thus keeping the pacing and your interest. The story elements, characters, and world created are incredible, interesting, and make you crave more.Then in the last hundred pages or so everything just sort of wraps up with a \\"Well, I guess everything's okay,\\" and some characters suddenly reveal they've learned all the intricacies of the plot and recite them aloud.Very unsatisfying end to a riveting story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Great Workout","review":"This video has the ocean as a backdrop and is easy to follow along with the program.

I only did the routine once because it really was boring and ineffective. I didn't work up any sweat or increase my heart rate. Also, the music was so boring!

First of all, Denise is standing near the ocean, which makes for a nice view, but the noise of the waves seriously interfered with the sound quality -- at times I couldn't even hear her! Also, I found the choreography to be far too intricate for a beginner. It was nearly impossible for me to keep up (granted, I'm no Ginger Rogers).

But I expected more from a beginner's tape. Like actaully showing you how to do the steps.

The ancient Romans probably did not know their empire and culture were crumbling until it was too late. Americans seem just as blind. Many take the unrealistic view that \\"All will work out in the end\\". Berman has about the best final chapter I have ever seen with respect to similar books. Most books on the subject had their authors adding a final chapter with all sorts of pie-in-the-sky unworkable solutions. For example, things like we must elect better people to government; we must hold our politicians to their word and so on. Berman knowns better. He says that the best we can hope for is a slowing of the decline and he's right.

Europe and China are very flawed animals not to mention very different from each other. The fact that the author simply lumps the two countries/regions together as potential \\"overtakers\\" of America leads me to believe that the authour is more intent on predicting America's 3rd rate status without giving real thought to the merits of the eventual powers, Europe and China. This was a total \\"agenda\\" work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The idea that America is in decline is intriguing. Our nation continues to attract the most immigrants from all corners of the globe, a sign, in fact, of vibrance and ascendancy. Why would people flock to a land of tyranny, poverty, and injustice? Perhaps because America is not these things.Indeed, Berman's litany of ills are found in greater magnitude, not surprisingly, in the very nations these people are fleeing. Berman knows, like most folks, that America isn't perfect. Unlike most folks though, he doesn't see that America is good. This is what makes his books so disappointing: it's clear he doesn't understand that distinction. I'm glad my grandparents escaped an authoritarian, communitarian, 'non-materialistic' (read: poor) country to come to America.

The special effects are really cool and the fighting scenes actually look REAL. I mean it doesn't have the cheesy slow moves that is impossible in some movies. Gollem looks so pitiful and looks real. He is a very well made CGI character. Some people say it is too boring. But it's the middle so it can't have a beginning or an ending. I also thought that the battle with the ents was REALLY cool. So verdict from me is:1 star for great characters1 star for VERY cool background1 star for action1 star for a little loveand 1 star for a good storyVERDICT IS 5 GOLDEN STARS Yeah!"},{"rating":"2","title":"best card game ever","review":"Cranium games are fun and educational.

After one game I was HOOKED! I had my mom buy the game and now even my 17 year old cousin loves it! The cards are clear and are slippery so they might fall out of your hands alot. This is a card game with an Exclusive Tin Can. There are clear cards with different symbols at the corners. There's \\"Add up to 11,\\" \\"Spell a Word,\\" \\"Complete the Puzzle\\" and \\"Match the Instrument\\" On each of your cards you have a number, a letter, peice of the puzzle, and an instrument. When you get add up to 11 you have to use your cards to add up to 11, when you get Spell a word you have to spell a word with your cards with the letter you chose, in Complete the Puzzle you need to complete a small puzzle with the peices on your cards, and in Match the Instrument you have to match the instrument you chose with the instruments in your cards. It's a great educational game. I am one satisfied kid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BoRiNg!","review":"I played this game as an adult and found it very boring. The idea is nice, you have cool see-thru plastic cards each with several \\"game Pieces\\" on each.

I have used the Pilot Better Ball Point Pen for about 20 years. I use them all day, every day and these Pilot pens have never failed to write! These pens are in and out of my pocket many times every day, they always write and I have never had one malfunction in any way. The metal pocket clips never fall off, they always retract properly, etc. When I hand one to a customer to sign a sales order or receipt they frequently comment on how well they write. They are just the right size and while not fancy, they don't look or feel cheap. In my opinion, this the best pen available. They are just about impossible to buy where I live today, near Tampa, Fl. I am glad Amazon carries them.

Yes, her high notes are INCREDIBLE but so are Mady Mesple's and Sumi Jo's and Lily Pon's and Joan Sutherland's and...well you get the picture. It IS nice to have a sample of Mozart'a lesser known arias and after listening to this cd 3 years after I bought it at the urging of my voice teacher I would probably rate this at 3 stars instead of two but I still don't like her middle range and there is no low range. Doesn't exsist. I just can't worship her like my own personally savior like my teacher thinks I should. I just don't see the perfection that others do. And she may be an incredibly gifted actress on the stage which I would not know as I have not seen her but her interepertation of every song leaves me cold. She sounds almost robotic in some places.

I guess some people think it is too thin, but that is what I like about it. From what I hear it is the perfect strength/depth. What I like is that she doesn't sound exactly like all the others.

Marvellous coloratura!","review":"Natalie Dessay has always dazzled us with her fantastic pure coloratura voice. Dessay not only demonstrates tremendous vocalization and agility, but also produces beautiful tone quality and color. Her Queen of the night as well as the rest of the heroines portrayed on this album are top notch. Dessay's lower register is not as strong as say a full lyric or a dramatic soprano's might be, but it isn't supposed to be! She is a true coloratura soprano! This album is not one to disapoint!

I had this same concern (briefly). Look for a dimmer extension cord for lamps that will allow you to throttle down the power if you think you need to.

The tracks are far beyond any other, with great scenery and sound effects. You can race in countries like USA, Canada, Germany, France, and the UK.The Hot Pursuit option is very good with the lighting effects and the different looking cop cars.

She devastates the Mackinnon-Dworkin procensorship position, pointing out its glaring legal and common-sense errors. She shows how censorship harms women more than pornography, and how attacks on pornography quickly mushroom into attacks on all forms of sexual expression. Anyone who values his or her freedom needs to read this book. It is aimed at a general audience and does not contain too much technical legal analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pornography is not freedom.","review":"As a survivor of the pornography industry I can state clearly that this book does not give an accurate representation of pornography or of it's effects on the people who are victimized by it. Strossen tries to cleverly rephrase porn into a context where it is presented as liberation as freedom and as a symbol of women's rights. But porn is none of those. Porn is violence against women and children.My feeling is that this book reads like a court room drama hearing from only one attorney, one viewpoint and eliminating all of the victims.Andrea Dworkin has several titles which accurately represent the reality of porn. A reality that I knew first hand. A reality that has left me scarred for life.

She defends the freedom of speech and the ideas that, as citizens, we hold very dearly. It is not enough to state that Strossen's arguments are logical, distinct, and thoughtful. Free expression and speech are imperative to a culture who believes they are free. She points out the liberties the government makes when it comes to our individual freedoms. Strossen takes on a functional perspective of 'pornography' and understands that sexual expression is not the only way we (citizens) are oppressed. The rhetoric is intelligent in a respect that it allows each and every one of us to assume that sexual orientation, expression, and thought are practical and natural in humans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and a breath of fresh air.","review":"Finally, there is a feminist viewpiont that I would align withmy own.

The fact that it's a poorly written soap opera? That it's full of clichés? That the one Latino character in the book is a poor Mexican who \\"in desperation\\" turns to a drug deal--and ends up in jail? That the mother in the book is a lousy one? (not that this is much of a surprise coming from an author who's made a career out of telling total strangers that if her four children died, she'd be OK; that her daughter was ugly when she was born; that her eight-year-old son thinks he's gay, etc.)Michael should be a nicer husband and help his wife with her books, since she can't write to save her life. Then again, if the author weren't Mrs. Michael Chabon, \\"Daughter's Keeper\\" would have never been published. I guess that's enough help there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, no, no, no","review":"Ayelet Waldman should stick to practicing law. As a writer, she's so obviously riding the coattails of her husband, Pulitzer winner Michael Chabon, that she's become a literary embarrassment. There are writing friends of mine who write FAR better than Ms. Waldman, but will their books ever get into print? Heck, no. In fact, it's highly doubtful they'll ever even land an agent. Did Waldman have any trouble selling her book? You can bet your sweet bippy she was ushered into the head honcho's office and plied with wine and jumbo shrimp - all the big guys aching to make nice over the wife of a justly famous man. The book itself deals with serious and important material, but Ayelet Waldman is not the writer who should be carrying this flag.Please, folks: don't waste your money.

I don't know whether to applaud her social conscience or ream her for what she's done to the minimum standards generally accepted in the world of fiction. A recomended read, if you promise not to think this is an example of wonderful prose or ignore the fact that she probably had a little advantage getting started. In time, her style may improve. Her heart is already there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad for a first draft","review":"While the concepts in this novel are admirable and even inspiring, I have to agree with the readers who have negative things to say about the mechanics of the writing. The lack of attention to basic principles of fiction is likely to make many readers cringe, as I did. It reads in many places as though it simply wasn't edited.Contrary to what a couple of readers have suggested, I understand Ms. Waldman did endure numerous rejections of this manuscript. I am however surprised that her publisher didn't insist on some more work before arranging for it to be printed. There are indeed many well written books out there (including unpublished ones) and there's not much point in spending your time with a writer who hasn't taken her readers seriously enough to learn the craft before marketing her work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Review","review":"Keith Code does an excellent job of explaining the dynamics of riding performance motorcycles.

It will help new riders understand the physics of how the bike works in turn dismissing some of the common fears associated with riding.

It does a good job of explaining the reasons why so many motorcyclists are unable to master some of the techniques required to avoid crashing. The book is pretty easy to read and a great thought stimulator for those seeking to understand the why's and why nots. There are also several excersizes detailed to try and train your mind not to do some of the things which although intuitive are bad riding habits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Informative","review":"I found this book to cover a different area to most \\"technique\\" oriented books.

Turning on hills and the timing in a corner or turn at the street level. For the regular rider I would give these books a ' D '."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book on the finer points of motorcycle riding.","review":"This book deals mainly with steering by use of lean (counter steering) and throttle control.

What these people need is not an independent publishing firm, they need a good editor. They preach a single rule throughout the first half od the book, and repeat it in so many boring ways, with so many boring examples that you do not want to read any more. The side notes that are scattered through the book have no connection to the text, the illustrations are irrelevant, and the stupidest of all are the asterisks, scattered randomly through the text explaining words such as 'Identical', 'Determine', 'Exception', 'Respect'....Conclusion: Go to the MSF training, Mr Code and Mr Chandler need to go to basic writing training."},{"rating":"2","title":"great tips, strange structure","review":"Code's book is easy to read and very helpful.What I can't quite figure is the way words like 'force', 'emotional' and 'area' are included in the glossary, while there are some more technical terms that are omitted.Otherwise, quality stuff. Humorous, informative and well put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"If we rode like Keith writes, we'd all be dead","review":"Terribly written book. Has many ideas and concepts I've tried and haven't found viable for me. HOWEVER, two chapters in the book are very worthwhile: 1)The 7 deadly Survial Reactions and 2) the chapter on visual directional control--the \\"Two-Step.\\" These alone make it worth the price of the book. There are many books that teach motorcycle riding techniques far better, that you can actually understand because they aren't written by someone who must have spent his high school career flunking English. Glad it's cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Needed Book, But Surely The Worst Writing Ever Published","review":"This book has some definite merit; however, readers will most certainly feel that they have earned the knowledge it contains by enduring the book's oppressive style and format. Mr. Code's credentials as a trainer of riders sound impressive and he does seem to understand motorcycles, especially their road-racing aspects. His difficulty lies in explaining the principles and techniques he espouses in a clear, concise manner. Never have I encountered a book such as this one where the writer feels compelled to include definitions for words like \\"goals\\", \\"purposes\\", \\"exaggerate\\", etc. Perhaps the riders he normally instructs abandoned education in their quest for undying motorcycle glory. At any rate, if you can get beyond the book's second-class writing and worse illustrations, there are some \\"gems\\" of wisdom to be found.

Code is very obviously a naive writer, but the info in this book will improve your riding, and could save your life. Good riding technique is at least as important on the road as on the track, and the info in this book has certainly helped me to be a safer, faster rider, while having more fun.

You'll be a better rider for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good info, but too little of it; terribly written","review":"This should be a magazine article, written by someone (who canwrite) who has interviewed Mr. Code. The information in this bookcould easily be conveyed in a couple of thousand words.Worse, the writing is by far the most pretentious, misdirected, ridiculous style I have ever seen--and I am sure I have read way over 10,000 books (and hundreds of thousands of articles) in my life. I had a hard time forcing myself to read such atrocity. The problem is not mechanics--he understands grammar and sentence structure well enough. The problem is empty words, overblown rhetoric, unclear content, and the most bizarre conceit I have ever seen, namely, defining ordinary words in a glossary.E.g., \\"Characteristics,\\" \\"perspective,\\" \\"knowledge.\\"If you can find a buddy who has read it, get him to take ten minutes and tell you about it. That's plenty of time to convey the information. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looking for Street Riding? Go read Hough","review":"Twist of the Wrist is a great book...for track racing. The street-applicable skills are buried in discussion of track-specific performance training.As a novice motorcyclist, I bought Twist of the Wrist and Proficient Motorcyling at approximately the same time, and found Proficient Motorcycling to be much more useful. That book takes all the useful street skills that you'll find in Twist the Wrist, then adds reams of additional street riding content, including wet/icy weather riding, judging corners, avoiding lane-straddling cars, how to set your shocks for load, riding gear essentials, correct braking, what to do when you see a deer, etc. Do yourself a big favor, go pick it up and wait for Twist the Wrist until you are planning to take your bike to the track. That's when Twist becomes useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without knowing, a bike reacts the opposite way !","review":"When you read \\"A Twist of the wrist I and II\\" you will drive better!

I took my time and I gradually added speed. At the time (before reading the book) everything I did seemed logic and safe to me. After reading the book I knew that I had been riding very dangerously and it was a mirracle I didn't crash !! These books are full of tips and knowledge you really should know.

If you have have no idea about what ICO is, think something along the lines of Myst or Riven. ICO has been clearly inspired by those two creations, but takes the idea to new heights.The soundtrack is incidental and atmospheric music from the game. The incidental pieces come from the various set-pieces you encounter, and can be quite dark. The atmospheric pieces are lighter, with a very minimal quality; just one or two strings. I would call this music 'ambient' but not in the Brian Eno style, nor Enya's style. It is a world away from 'relaxation' music. The closest albums I can think of are the soundtracks of Myst and Riven, but probably 'Gone To Earth' by David Sylvian is a better match. If you like David Sylvian, you might like this.Overall, I like it. A lot. It has been in my CD deck regularly over the past 4 weeks since I bought it.

The only hope for Sally and her class is escape into the wilds of the outback.

Now they have to devise a plan and fight for their own survival and try to get away from these kidnappers before its too late. They have to use their brains to get out of this situation.

In the end, they fight it out with the bad guys and win! And all this is done in a quite believable way.The children are completely believable in their performances, and there are about a dozen children.The only flaw in this neatly done movie is a striving after significance at the very end, where the filmmaker tries to turn it into a Lord of the Flies.

So it might be the perfect movie for a disposable medium.The cast and acting were excellent, and the story line ambitious, but many of the loose ends it tried to tie up and connect by the end of the movie were left somewhat unresolved. None of the stories, except perhaps the Susan Sarandon/Robin Williams plot, were strong enough to stand on their own. Presenting them as \\"parallel stories\\" did not work.

I had hoped that it would be a Christmas story, but I fail to see what it has to do with Christmas. It could have been set in any time frame and would, unfortunately, have been just as bad. The script was simply poorly thought out, so I can't blame the actors for the failure of the project. Some of the acting was not bad, but none of the actors had anything to work with, and I do not understand why some of these actors agreed to do these performances. I could not recommend this to anyone I liked. If you are looking for a heartwarming Christmas movie, stick to the old black and white Christmas movies.

IF there is a moral to the story, it is well hidden along with the story line - IF there is one. For the life of me, I can't figure out how that many well-known actors were talked into being a part of this shoddy production. If you haven't seen 'Noel,' don't bother.

I enjoyed the book enough to read the entire thing, however, several times, I was tempted to set it aside for a book of greater quality such as Patricia Cornwell or Sue Grafton. I found the story idea to be compelling, but did not find the same with the writing. To me, it seems that he is trying too hard which makes the book almost childish. I did buy both of his books at a book signing and I intend to read the other one even though this one did not impress me. I find that the first book for any author is usually not the best one.

The midrange is okay, sounds like speakers in a high-end television. But overall, the sound is more than a bit flat, and gets tiresome after a while. And, all of this is based on driving them through a 100 watt, old but high-end 2-channel stereo using 7 channel equalizer settings to tweak them. They are fairly efficient for the size, but increasing the sound level does not fill the room; they sound too flat.I have ordered a Sony 100 watt subwoofer for them, this should balance out the package and sound quite great.

I'm returning it, as soon as the ups page that amazon offers to see the return places finally appears, and and going to ask for a new one, just because I want to see if it is a matter of just one mixer or if all of them work as bad.

The main reason I did were all the positive reviews. I purchased this to mix dry organic milk, which is non-instant.

Those raspberries in the picture should have given me a clue. It arrived in a box the size of a 3x5 index card. I put in the batteries and inserted the whisk attachment, as it is the one I planned to use the most. This was fortunate, because there are no instructions as to how to remove the attachment, and I can't get it back out. Indeed, there are precious few instructions at all. I didn't expect much action, but the little gadget did a nice job whipping up some protein powder and milk in a small glass jar. Obviously this is not the machine to tackle mashed potatoes or cake batter, but it's easy to clean and takes up no storage space. Whether it will last long remains to be seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of garbage","review":"I bought this after reading some of the good reviews.

I loved its performance as long as it worked. Only mixer and frother attachments are useful. Egg whisker is useless since mixer is not so powerful to take the load of egg but now I use it as a manual whisk. After the mixer stopped working this is the only piece useful as a whisk.

The multiple attachments each have their uses and do them well.I would give this a 5 star rating except for the one real flaw, there is no real on or off button.

Unfortunately, the author is British so much of the history focuses on British and German aircraft, which most Americans (including myself) are probably unfamiliar with. The color photos are nice and overall technical content is enlightening. I do feel that the book would benefit from a chapter of technical material explaining things such as wing-loading and its importance and some light engine/propulsion theory as some terms are not explained effectively which makes the discussion hard to follow.Overall, it's a good read for someone interested in the history and development of fighter aircraft."},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be better books on solar electricity","review":"This book will leave you wanting.

However it is not clear to me that the editor has paid attention to the order of the composition of the poems. This is a matter often neglected. It is important when reading a poem from a book of poems--say High Windows--to know what poems surrounded it. The editor does provide the original order in the back--but the order of composition matters or rather the arrangement of poems that the poet produces matters--if Larkin wanted a certain order it was because he felt that the poems feed off each other in a specific way.

Larkin unashamedly uses rhymes and iambic pentameters in modern times when these structures are considered out-dated and gauche. However, they only draw the reader deeper in the (deceptively) easy lines of the poems, lines which once you read, you could not shake off for the rest of your life.Larkin hasn't been the most prolific writer and what he writes is usually short, terse poems.

He could be witty or morbid, or both at once. Above all his gift was for memorableness, something that can only be accomplished by striking deep and hard.The arrangement of the volume is right: we are first presented with the poems, starting in 1946, that (in Mr. Thwait's judgment) begin to showcase Larkin's unique voice. A small set of earlier poems is at the back, mostly of historical value (though a few are gems, e.g: \\"This is the first thing/I have understood:/Time is the echo of an axe/Within a wood.\\")If you like poetry with a punch, absorb this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good speakers, good price","review":"I bought these as replacements for the original drivers in some PA cabinets.

I loved the illustrations in this book and I liked the African cultural themes. I wish the rest was as good.

The way the dad reassures the child is by pointing out that their hands look alike and the child's eyes look like mamas. My child has not expressed worries about whether we are still her parents and I don't want to bring up such a disturbing thought for her if it is not on her mind already. Also, as I look around me I see many families where parents and children have differently colored, textured, or shaped eyes, skin, or hair.

And half-way through this read, I thought that wherever he would leave me really didn't matter. While the destination was awesome, my journey was equally satisfying.I highly recommend this book (and any of Mr. Cameron's other ones as well). He writes so well. Using a minimum of words, he is able to tell the story so vividly, far better than a lot of other authors who use paragraphs upon paragraphs to describe a scene.

He made a name forhimself in films playing villains and heavies. But in the 1960s he began acting in spagetti westerns which sabata was. To me the novel is well written and tells a very good story,not too many words and the transitions are well timed. I guarantee that you will want to read other novels written by Brian Fox, your time will be well spent and you will be entertained. It spawned three films Sabata-adios sabata-and return of sabata.

Not only did I personally find the plot to be a turn-off (a hospital employee intentionally killing children), but I believe the description of the characters and their interpersonal relationships were very cliche.Annick was not at all original or even slightly inspiring as a heroine. Also, the hospital murderer she is chasing fits the typical, cliche mold of your everyday creepy pycho. In addition, I feel there was very little time spent on character development of the victims (children).In short, this book was not at all engaging. I felt it was poorly written and moreover, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I feel I wasted my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youthful Markson","review":"This hilarious western shows the humorous side of a great American author. It includes many of the themes he would use later in his assemblage work and is written with a snappy, lively voice that is in sharp contrast to the ethereal moodiness of Markson's other fiction. For readers who either love Westerns, love good funny light reads, or love David Markson, this is a little treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"For small men with good eyesight","review":"When I bought this watch, Amazon did not have an image posted. So I was surprised to find that the watch is tiny and numbers are difficult to read. I had bought this to time my laps in the pool, but it would have been impossible to read underwater. It taught me a lesson not to buy anything from Amazon unless they show you a picture."},{"rating":"2","title":"GI Detox","review":"I have found that this is a much more healthy way to get the fiber needed daily to maintain regularity. It has a very fresh and natural scent to it, and there are no additives, sweeteners or fillers added. Plus, it has probiotics in it that your intestinal tract can always benefit from. I just mix it with orange juice and drink it right before bedtime. Yes, it has an herbal taste to it, but not hard to get down at all. I would highly recommend this as an alternative to Metamucil, which is not an all-natural product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same Little Richard...

It works better for women though who store their phones in their purse and have no need for the belt clip. For men, you're better off leaving the clip off and just storing the phone in your pocket. A non-swivel type clip might have been better for this. It really is huge and a little clumsy. The leather case itself is really nice, a great fit. It looks as good as it does on the photo. If you can do without that belt clip it's even nicer."},{"rating":"2","title":"still slim","review":"I like this case a lot. it fits the phone perfectly, yet still remains slim. since the V3 is so slim, it's almost easier to use now that it's in the case."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess after 3 months","review":"This cover seemed like the best solution for me...thin, full protection, belt clip. I was good for a month or so, then it began to be bothersome. Dust would easily accumulate under the clear portion of the cover and I would have to slip my finger under it to wipe it clean all the time.And, the top would sag when I opened the phone so that when I took photos, I would have to make sure it was flat, or my pictures would have portions of the cover blocking it.Later, I noticed that the cover worked loose the rubber plugs on the phone that keep it from slamming shut, metal to metal. Pretty soon, the plugs were gone.Finally, after about 4 1/2 months, the seams where clear plastic meets leather began to show wear and pull apart.I didn't abuse this cover at all! Overall, I would say, don't expect this cover to last on your rzr for very long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very sturdy and protective","review":"I've had cheaper cases for other phones, but this one is superior quality. I've broken many cases by yanking them on the steering wheel or other places, but when I snagged this one, it seemed to release without breaking. The only knock is that it significantly adds to the thickness of my RAZR phone and let's face it... the main reason I got the phone was because it was thin and flashy. Most of that is gone by virtue of this case, but at least I know it is very well protected, even if dropped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"I don't understand why so many people like this case.

This case really detracts from those looks with a big leather case and a big useless swivel clip. The case is padded in the back and the swivel clip sticks way out. (See blakdogg image.)

I'm trying to return it to seller but am not getting cooperation.(They're probably glad to get this off their hands.)If you like your RAZR's slim looks don't get this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"fairly useless item","review":"I don't see what others have liked about this.

Unfortunately, the attachment for the clip kind of protrudes. Add this to the clip that is also thick and it sticks out on your waist. Kind of defeats the slim Razr. I bought a clip that was thinner but it easily slips off.The other bad thing is that it doesn't totally protect the Razr. As you can see from the photos it leaves the top sides exposed (near camera lens). So if you drop it then you can expect the Razr to get chipped.So I've had it over a year and it is alright but could be improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt clip is 2-plastic sided clip not as showing in figure!!!","review":"Hi, i bought this case 3-months ago and it was fine, later on the belt clip because its plastic the 2-sides got ripped and scratched so the case keeps falling from the clip which is annouying in some time the phone falls when it gets pressed by your side or belt.The picture shows the belt clip hooks to a round plastic thing, THIS IS NOT RIGHT! the clip you will be recieving is a 2-sided plastic edges that slide in the case, if one gets pealed then it will loose and fall.I kept on using the case holding it in my hand because the case is very helpful in openning/closing by flipping the phone and i needed that.Thanks,TOA"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality case","review":"The case is made of high quality leather and fit is excellent.Works well with screen protectors also."},{"rating":"1","title":"introduction to communication theory","review":"what is transmission? transmission history analog signal and digital signal digitizing"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like it.","review":"This is very poor quality.

It doesn't cover how STL cooperates with other libraries and operating systems. (Which is required for any application.) Many examples are overly simplified and clinically correct.After reading this you won't be able to use STL, you won't be able to explain what a quicksort is and why it's faster on a vector, and you won't know how to create your own templates.I'm truly sorry I spend money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful read","review":"The day to day struggles of man and nature as humorously depicted by American bonsai master John Naka's favorite Japanese proverbs ring true.

It is patently obvious that the author wants the reader to think like he does.The sign of a good academic is the he/she presents the facts pro and contra and leaves the student or reader to make up his or her mind. I get the feeling that this book has been written for those who are unable to think or weigh up evidence for themselves.According to the author, those who do not share his restricted views about numbers in the bible are \\"liberals\\".

I got it so that i wouldnt have to mount a traditional cb radio in my truck. i only use it when im towing my jeep, and with the external antenna you get pretty good distance. i would recommened this unit to anyone who is not looking for a top of line cb and for its compact size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy radio.....","review":"Purchased this radio as a hold over until I mounted my other radio in the truck. Worked fine. Speaker is kinda small so hard to hear at times with the windows down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hand held","review":"This is an excellent value. The CB comes with the accessories needed to use. I have another hand held CB from another manufacturer. This product is superior. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midland 75-822 for Motorcycle Use","review":"I purchased this handheld CB as an alternative to buying the very expensive Honda radio for my Valkyrie Interstate. I bought a remote push to talk switch, speakers, and mic for my helmet to communicate while riding. This setup worked pretty good. I rode with a few others that had factory CBs and everyone was shocked at the clarity of this CB. This was a good purchase for my use. I am currently using the whip antenna for reception, but plan to connect to an external antenna later. The whip antenna provided decent range of about 3/4 mile, which works for my needs since we ride in a pack and are rarely ever separated for more that a mile at most. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a solid handheld CB at a decent price. Put it this way, the few shortcomings experienced the way I use the CB are miniscule to the money that remains in my pocket from not purchasing the OEM CB (OEM radio $650, Midland $75)."},{"rating":"2","title":"portable CB radio","review":"Fantastic for the money. I have had the other brand's similar equipment and this is 2x better. The overall operation is better than my Uniden, small form factor CB. Just use a standard mag mount antenna, lay the mike over your leg and let the miles go buy, well informed and clearly understood by the other drivers."},{"rating":"1","title":"very compact but was a waste of money","review":"I purchased this because of how compact it was however I barely got a 50 foot range with it. I asked the local CB repair shop if there was anything I could do to fix the range on it, they said get a real CB, the compact all in one handset units are not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoped for better","review":"I purchased this unit for a road trip cross-country. I was very disappointed with the quality. If I could return it at this point I would. Range is less than 1000 feet without an external antenna mounted to the vehicle. I've had other handhelds in the past with much better reception."},{"rating":"2","title":"CB Radio","review":"I have been looking for inexpensive cb radio to use on my motorcycle and I think I found it.

Started to review each piece. The battery packs are a bit flimsy. Put the fresh AA batteries in one pack and 8 rechargables in the other and went outside to try it. Only heard static on the CB bands. Tried the weather bands and heard WX 1 loud and clear. Hooked up the radio in my car and connected the outside antenna, same result on CB bands. Tried a second mobil antenna on car with same results. Checked antenna with another CB and it worked.It appears that the Midland is a very attractive toy but not really a usable CB.Glad I bought it from Amazon so there is no problem returning."},{"rating":"1","title":"static, missing part","review":"Overall this product was ok. There was alot of static and I had to turn the Squelch up so much I missed conversation. Also, the rechargeable battery pack had a piece missing. The controls on the reciever were ok, they could have been backlit for night time driving. And the lcd screen should have the option to stay lit all of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"I should have listened to everyone else reviewing this product. Handhelds, including this one, are pretty useless without an external antenna. Perhaps it was defective, but this one wouldn't even pick up a broadcast 50' in front of my truck. Nonetheless, this would be a great value if it worked. It includes a cigarette lighter adapter and two battery compartments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio","review":"Defective unit, scan function worked 1 out of 30. Battery trays are very poorly made. The eight battery compartment would not power the unit. If the unit was working as designed I would have great concern for the longevity of the battery holders. As they were not straight in the compartments with slight alignment issues. Audio was acceptable and it did bring in the NOAA clearly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"I usually have very favorable reviews, but this unit is poor at best. I wanted to use for motorcycle communication between bikes, but when I tested the unit, it would only work for about 100 yards from one hand held unit to another. I drove down the street, and before I even went 1/10 of a mile the unit stopped working. It only works when literally standing next to each other. The ONLY way the unit barely works is to have connected to external antenna (which is still very limiting). My advice is to just get good GMRS or FRS radios from Midland or some other manufacturer as they work better and are significantly cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"compact cb radio, needs better reception","review":"Very poor reception with the factory antenna, I tried it with another antenna mount to the roof, it was a little bit better.

However the unit definitely required an external attenna to function... it was totally worthless with the short one...even in battery mode.I was not satisfied with this unit because it did not function with the short antenna and returned it.One more consideration that I found uncomforable... this unit comes with two different battery packs, a standard AA and a rechargable AA. I do not know why you need 2 more rechargeables than regulars but thats not the point... why do I want to have to keep track of more parts? design it better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance from Midland 75-822 40 Channel CB-Way Radio","review":"While unit did work occasionally, 98% of the time all I heard was static - breaking squelch and unintelligble audio.Radio is not worth owning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective from the box","review":"Purchased this cb from Best Buy. It would not work with batteries or the power source in the vehicle. Most difficult to get the battery pack open and off the cb in the beginning but once I made a call to the company I figured out that you must mash a button and slide the battery pack off the cb.

The plug didn't seem to fit completely into the transceiver, so Amazon shipped it back at no cost sent another unit out 2 day post.That unit has the exact same issue. It will not charge rechargeable batteries which is its sole purpose. I even went out and bought eight new Radioshack rechargeable AA, cost $38, to make sure it wasn't the batteries. It wasn't.This unit gets NOA crystal clear in my truck as well, but no CB channels get any reception.Instead of shipping this one back to Amazon for a fourth unit or just returning it and moving on to another CB maker, I called Midland Radio and they are sending me a new rechargeable transceiver and plug. If that doesn't work it goes back and I will buy elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midland 75-933 40 Ch 2 way CB","review":"Product is solid. The plug-in/portable battery clip on is great along with the ability to plug into an antenna like a lil Wil.Reception is not great, a couple miles, but typical unless you plug into an antenna, again typical. full scan and 9/19 scan is a solid feature.Nothing amazing about it, nothing bad about it. Great back up when cell service is not available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor execution.","review":"Ok, the features list and the configuration make this look like a great product. Functions as either a mobile CB with a very small footprint, or as a handheld, NOAA Weather stations, easy to use. Looks good so far. But, as a radio, it's just plain junk.Range as a handheld with the provided antenna is only around 100ft or so between two identical units, and that's with the squelch control turned off. So an external antenna is mandatory for pretty much any use. Even when you get good reception, the audio quality from the built in speaker is flat and hard to hear.Using it while driving is the worst situation at all, since the radio is severely impacted by ignition noise from your car. Yes, this is something that you have to deal with when using just about any two-way radio, so it's not like a different brand would eliminate the problem, but this unit does not appear to have any built-in filtering to help with the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me.....","review":"Pulls in enough conversation (about 5 miles) for what I needed it for as I only wanted it for traveling on major highways. Allows you to hear conversations within five miles either way of your traveling direction. I used the short based Cobra HG A 1000 Base-Load Small Mount 100W CB Antenna for what I needed. I'm sure with a longer antenna I could have gotten better range of conversation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be a great back up","review":"I was going to use it for in the car for the occasional time it would be good to talk and see what is going on. Fits in glove box easily, cables make it easy to power up. Reception is horrible with the antenna included.

With the supplied pwr/ant adapter the signal is great with a 102\\" whip; however, the Wilson 4ft silver load antenna did not work well at all with my Jeep Cherokee mounted on the bumper. The radio is great; a scan feature that works, the squelch works, volume's not great when traveling at speed with the windows down, Extra battery cases, everything works as it should. If you hold down the function button you can see the freq instead of the channels. Overall this is an excellent hand-held radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midland 75-822 handheld CB radio","review":"Works very well and a great value for the purchase price. The fact that this radio can be a handheld or a mobile radio and that it comes with a 12-volt cigarette lighter plug, a PL-259 external antenna connector, a portable antenna, a battery box for using six \\"AA' batteries, and an AC adapter made the system very versatile. The NOAA weather band capabilities only added to this versatility My only complaint is that the radio could use more volume output as it is sometimes hard to hear when used in a vehicle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poor ergonomics","review":"I bought this CB for my Jeep in hopes of having a multi-purpose unit that would allow me to communicate well with other Jeeps when I was spotting them on the trails. It performed well, but the ergonomics were very poor. It has no hook that would allow for a convenient and accessible place to store the unit while driving. Also, the channel change buttons are very close to the PTT (Push-To-Talk) button, so I ended up changing the channel every time I tried to talk.I imagine that time spent with this unit would have enabled me to get comfortable with its ergonomics, but I decided instead to return the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Midland CB","review":"This was awful. I could get no reception at all while in my car and live in an area where there are 3 interstate highways and 2 interstate beltways. If I stepped away from a vehicle I could get periodic fragments of CB reception. I even pulled off the road into a rest area and the reception was virtually non-existent using the attached antenna. Only when I used a trunk mounted more powerful antenna could I get a signal. But then again, that defeats the purpose of having a portable handheld."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't recommend wasting money on this.","review":"I bought this cb less than a year ago.

I do not recommend this as a CB."},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE !","review":"How great is it to have portable communication with truckers DB channel 9; or Recreational Vehicles, CB Channel 13, or that POLICE MONITOR CB CHANNEL 9 in the squad car?Don't forget about the weather channel NOAA!I was skeptical about this small CB, but after having it, I am happy.I esp love the SCAN featur, which constantaly allows you to scan all 40 channels like you would a police scanner. This keeps you company better than just staying on one channel, which you can also do. I prefer to hear what is going on all the channels and it keeps things lively for long trips.Any trucker will tell you that its all about the antenna. So choose a Wilson, K90, or even Cobra (in that order).Having said that, all I had was just a cheap knock off brand antenna I got at the truck stop, but kept me happy. Any antenna, including one I got at Walmart (Rally brand) was fine enough to bring in the traffic and get the NOAA broadcasts.

Good product, put together nicely and has tons of features.

Lots of upsides (well covered in other reviews) with some minor but annoying downsides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"Appears to work very well, supplied 'rubber ducky' works but you should use another type antenna for greater distances.

I could barely get 2 miles range no matter what I did or how I configured it. I used it on battery with a collapsable antenna and I used it in the car with an external roof-mount antenna. Both configurations produced a barely audible transmission at two miles (verified during a test with a regular mobile CB on the other end).As I was tightening the external antenna connection to the radio's jack, the radio's jack twisted inside of its sheathing and broke the wire to the jack. This was because the threads on the radio jack were so poorly made that the mobile antenna wouldn't screw on more than 1/2 turn. This is very poor workmanship and should never have passed out of QC.I sent it back for a refund. Spend another $35 to get a full-size name brand CB that is adjustable and tunable and you will be much happier."},{"rating":"2","title":"This radio can be out of sight when not in use...","review":"I installed this radio in a jeep TJ.

I wouldn't recommend that but if you were looking for a movie to please your kids then I'd highly recommend this movie. I think all kids up to the age of 8 or so would enjoy this movie. Basically the story is that this little boy all of a sudden finds that he can hear everything that dogs say. Supposedly there is a planet out there made of up all dogs & Hubble the boy's dog has just been sent from there to grade the dogs on earth.

It probably would have presented another level of drama if issues had surfaced right before the daughter was about to be married, or while she was preparing.

I found this movie to be a huge waste of time. There is nothing good about this movie. The main actors have NO chemistry. What were they thinking here?

Yes, with any romantic comedy, you have the cliche' happy couple who inevitably face some sort of problem and a potential break-up, which is most commonly rectified at the end of the movie. However, I thought the particular situation of this movie was very interesting. It attempts to examine how things change from the start of a relationship, through the engagement and wedding planning stage, and eventually to the actual marriage. The movie begins with the happy couple, Kellan Lutz and Mandy Moore, who prove to have incredible onscreen chemistry, getting married. Then come the relationship changes that inevitably come with living with someone, which are only accelerated by Moore's parents' divorce. The storyline has humor and heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"snoozefest zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"tried to hard to b cute and witty and not sure if it was the script or brolin trying to hard to 'act' or moore as a psychologist (about as believable as her being the president of the USA) but gosh it was hard to stay awake. kept fast forwarding till the pain was finally over and the movie also. i'm adding mine with the other 45 atm of 'used' copies to be sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not seems like original battery","review":"when battery die it just die instantly while original battery beep beep so many times i don't think this is original battery"},{"rating":"2","title":"cell phone battery","review":"what can you say about a replacement battery? it fits, it holds a charge, its just what i needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cell phone battery","review":"Bought this last summer when my battery got ruined because my son drooled alll over it.

The sound is coherent, the vocals go from normal to punk but not aggressive or snotty.If you are a completist get the 2 CD's Skinny Elvis (earlier work) or Fat Elvis (later work) or if you want a comprehensive compilation on 1 CD then I recommend this.On a last note, there is a hidden live track a minute also after \\"Start A Band\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This was an excellent fantasy novel.

Their section on oral sex gave both my husband and I lots of great new techniques to try.I was a bit skeptical about the \\"Full-Body Double Orgasm Technique\\" the book cover promotes, but I tried it with my husband. It worked. Wow! Did it work! I've never experienced anything like it. It's like huge waves of pleasure filled my body.

So I waited with baited breath for the next books - Ships of Magic not only didn't let me down it surpassed all expectations - my life was put on hold as it gripped me body and soul. Honestly I prefer it to Assassin's - perhaps for some of the most honest female characterisations I've found in any form of Literature - the mother, the daughter, the granddaughter all bound together to survive in a man's world - done so well I cried - dashing pirates with surprising soft sides - \\"hero\\" figures with addiction issues - and more mysteries to come - why do I have to wait so long for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i love this book!!!!","review":"The book was great, at first i was slow reading it but then i got into the plot and couldn't put it down!!!!

HOBBS has come up with a really great concept of \\"Liveships\\" (which by the by, is developed incredibly well in \\"The Mad Ship\\"), and gives us some great characters.The thing that I personally like most about the characters that populate this series, is that they are not wholely good or evil. \\"Bad\\" characters do good, and heros can have addiction issues.HOBBS also gives us readers an intriguing view into the mind, motivations, and interpretations of events from the POV of Captain (TOSSPOT!!!) Kyle HAVEN. She allows us to see from his POV, why he does what he does - all with the best intentions, but doomed to failure because of his inherent flaws.Not a series of epic proportions (ala MARTIN - succeeding, and JORDAN - NOT), but having a depth appropriate to the concept. It's very easy to lose oneself in this book, and its great to have some characters that one can really feel for!!Definitely worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous...Truly Catching","review":"Robin Hobb has definitely outdone herself this time.

This was one of those books that once I picked it up, all of life was put on hold until I finished it. I love the details of the worlds that she creates, they're so rich in imagination and detail that one can imagine living there, even as alien as they are.

Sure you have the typical characters etc., but the idea of living, feeling ships alone makes this series worth reading. Having also read the other two books in the trilogy, I can say that Ship of Magic is a wonderful start, yet would be an incomplete story without the other two. In other words, if you can't commit to all three, then steer clear of this book. However, if you're ready to tie the knot with three books at once, then go for it! The Liveship Traders trilogy is full of adventure and a facinating new world - one that is not far different from our own (except for the fingerprint of dragons.) Readers will quickly make connections with the ships themselves - perhaps more so than the human characters - but after all, it is the liveships that make these books a treat for fantasy lovers and ordinary readers both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin Hobb entertains...","review":"I loved Robin Hobb's Farseer Trilogy, so I figured I'd give her new Liveship Trilogy a shot as well. The first hundred pages or so were a bit slow, leaving me to wonder if I was going to be disappointed by an author who had so impressed me when I was first introduced to her. Lucky for me, she proved my suspicions to be unfounded! Soon after those hundred pages, I was eating up the story, truly enraptured in all the characters and their plights. What I love about Hobb is that she really makes you love the characters you're supposed to love and hate the characters you're supposed to hate. She illicits very strong emotions...at least from me anyway. I loved this book and I'm looking forward to reading the other two books in the trilogy to find out what happens next!"},{"rating":"2","title":"an extraordinary work......she surpasses the assasin series","review":"I have seldom been as quickly absorbed in a book as i was in this one. The characters are so well drawn that each time the focus shifts from one to another, instead of regretting the change you are instantly captivated by the new storyline. The sense of realism is magnificent, and so many stories are started with such masterful energy that the wait for the sequel will be agony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent start","review":"Since I've read Hobb's first trilogy (the Farseers), I still regonice some of the world described in this book, and her style of writing (in which I fell in love through the Farseer trilogy). This is a promising start on the new trilogy, and she still have a way of describing the world vivid enough to create pictures in your head as you read. You feel with the characters, and it's hard to let go of them when the book ends, and you get the feeling that you MUST know what happens next to them. This is a great book, and I recomend it to any fantasy reader, new as old."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"This is 809 pages of adolescent drivel.

This could be a five-star series very easily but it could also plummet like a paralyzed falcon.This is a multi-threaded work, following the actions of several characters. The world-building is excellent and the various conceits, such as the live ships, the serpents and the various geographical areas and their peoples, seem very strong.The non-sympathetic characters are notable for their depth and interesting detail. One of the most fascinating is the captain who knows what is good for everyone and sincerely believes that he would be the soul of generosity and kindness if everyone followed his plans. The pirate leader also manages to be more than a cardboard villain.The sympathetic characters are also interesting and far from stock figures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ship of Magic: The Liveship Traders","review":"Months after finishing this book, I could conjure up the characters and wonder how they made out in the sequel.

The concept is really cool, ships made out of \\"wizard wood\\" that come to life. Hobb creates compelling characters and has a great knack for storytelling.The only criticism I have is that I find the pacing of the story a little slow. There's nothing in particular I can point to. Perhaps it the internal dialogue of the characters. Probably I'm just impatient for the plot to resolve."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hated to put this book down, I'm ready for book two, now!","review":"As always, Robin Hobb writes a fasinating story that compells the reader to read on. Every book he writes he just gets better. This book is well worth the money and the time well spent. You will yourself not wanting to put this tale down.

I'm inclined to categorize it as escapism, which is not so much a criticism as a shrug. There's nothing particularly special about the setting (liveships included); there's nothing inspiring or unique about the writing (I can think of dozens of authors who sound just like this one); the characters are standard teen/teen-like holograms that the reader is expected to project themselves onto; and at 809 pages, it is what every fantasy fanatic expects of a book these days -- complication without complexity, characterization without depth, darkness without getting your hands dirty, and a rather flat/acceptable/non-threatening view of storytelling.It's about the same as watching a mini-series on the Hallmark channel. It'll pass the time, but don't expect it to have any sort of impact on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Original Idea....but","review":"I have been an avid reader of sci-fi and fantasy for nearly 50 years---I consider myself something of an expert. It was with great delight that I started this first book of the trilogy. There were some great new, inventive ideas...where would they lead? The author laid out some of these ideas and many, many mysteries which we knew were about to unfold. But who could hang on that long? I have finished all three books of the trilogy and in truth there is a good story here. You will find it in the first half of volume one and the last half of volume three. The rest is filler---it took me two years to trudge through it because I really didn't want to give up---but how many others would push through that. And then some of the mysteries---especially the who and what Amber is -- is a two sentence delivery as her whole purpose for being at the end. I can only imagine with the loose ends such as this left that it is set up for a trilogy sequel ... ouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the extremely imaginative only !","review":"After reading The Farseer Trilogy which was very promising, I decided to take another chance with the author and try The Ship of Magic series. This first book is very silly. The concept of a liveship which speaks to it's occupants was intriguing but it loses it's appeal as the characters were very annoying, and the magic was very unsophisticated. I tried very hard to find some good in this novel but it falls short of anything spectacular. Only for the extreemely imaginative and open minded.

This book is NOWHERE after 50 pages, and it was painful to even get that far. Each character is described in excruciating detail - not by actions, but simply by words and their own thoughts. This really helped me to appreciate authors like Terry Brooks and Terry Goodkind who can describe characters as the story grows, so that something is happening as you read.

This printer (actually this print engine, as it is used in several other Brother models) has a lower cost than some other Brother units, but you will make it up over the life of the printer as you buy higher-priced toner and drum units. The toner and drum units for this printer cost more than those for other Brother models, and don't last as long. Consider your printing needs and spend more upfront if you will be printing a lot.As long as you expect this going into the purchase of this printer, it is a great unit. It works as advertised, and Brother has very good drivers under Mac OS X. For the money upfront, you can't beat it.

Operation is simple.

Or, if it doesn't jam, the envelopes come out looking crooked. I called tech support twice, and first they told me that they can't help me because it's not their problem that it's printing crooked, but a problem with the software...That, of course, wasn't true because I was using Word, which is good with envelopes. The next time I called they told me that the envelopes I am using are too thick, which is also total garbage because I was using the most standard #10 envelopes in the world! They were just totally unhelpful!If you don't plan on printing envelopes, or calling tech support, it's a very nice machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow printer","review":"My office gave me this to replace my HP laserjet 1300.

I was feeling nauseous and I did not see any of the good effects other reviewers mentioned. NOTHING. I consulted with my doctor and she told me to stop taking this. So I did. My recommendation to other customers is to ask their own physician and be careful. This product is not independently tested and may hurt you.

The label says in part, \\"...compares to expensive mineral water....\\" It does not! Pure natural spring water loaded with the right minerals is alkaline, as confirmed by using the same Litmus test. We must drink alkaline water with the right minerals to stay healthy, according to published health literature.

I was already skeptical about the reports that distilled water is harmful because of the missing minerals, but for me this additive is not something I care to take my chances with. I've seen too much regarding the side effects of commonly used anti-depressives, and lithium is one of the most common. I've known people taking lithium and from what I could tell they were not doing well, whatever the cause and effect may have been. Lithium's metabolism is not well understood.

Now sporting a perky new nose and sexy Daisy Dukes, Tamara quickly becomes romantically involved with a rock star, a sleezy older man, and her childhood sweetheart. With a large cast and many subplots, this story of what really goes on behind the quaint postcard-pretty closed doors is full of laughs and tender moments and even some cattle stampedes.This movie is completely charming. The characters are all believable, the setting is idyllic, and the script is clever and quirky. All of the adult shenanigans are witnessed - and complicated - by a pair of adolescent girls, a kind of comical Greek chorus who tie it all together. If you like good, indie British films, you'll love this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly charming and totally British","review":"\\"Tamara Drewe\\" is deadly clever comedy of manners with a wickedly British sense of black humor. Post-plastic-surgery, the gorgeous Tamara Drewe comes home to her boring rural village -- ostensibly to fix up and sell her deceased mother's house, but also to show up everyone who was cruel to her when she was a bright, angry teenager with an outsize nose. One of those people was her writer neighbor, a serial adulterer who reigns over the fawning guests at the farm/writer's colony actually run by his devoted and ultra-capable wife. Throw in the hot local handyman, a couple of dangerously bored teenaged girls, the drummer from a punk band, and a mannerless dog. All kinds of trouble ensue. Don't expect any noble characters or heroic actions from this movie; watch it to enjoy the spectacle of people behaving mostly -- but not totally -- badly, and doing it in a generally clever and funny way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Laughs---with Depth","review":"Tamara Drewe is a funny English film that made me laugh out loud.

Well a few days later, it stopped working, either the contacts were damaged or something else happened internally.

It was twice the price, but i'm hoping for ten times the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"laptop surge protector","review":"Surge protector is a great convenience since you can keep it attached to the cord and its handy when you need to plug in your laptop.

After about 8 hours of play I have to say that it's easy to play but not immersive. I just can't get into it. Novelty factor 2 hours then I lost interest.

Ever wished that you could just go and in kick some [...]? World in Conflict is for you.True, a level of cerebal strategy is sacrificed. You can flank enemies, separate their forces with different units, and the like, but the strategy as a whole is more limited than in other RTS games. However, this applies mainly to the single player game (which offers fantastic cutscenes, voice work, and general ambience). Multiplayer games offer a greater chance to work your frontal lobes.WIC could also be known as Company of Heroes Express. It's a great game that really appeals to those of us who want to start playing right away, and it might be somewhat disappointing to those who want their RTS games to be like a protracted game of Risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome game, but....","review":"There is a new version of this game called \\"Soviet Assault-complete edition\\" that includes this game (World In Conflict)plus the Soviet Assault expansion pack for about twenty bucks.

What if the Soviet Union had invaded Europe and eventually the United States in the 1980's? Before this game my only answer to that would be to go rent Red Dawn, but now I can actually take part in this great what if scenario. The gameplay is refreshing for the RTS genre and I like the reinforcement system, just order units and go. The story is absolutely great and with voice acting by Alec Baldwin whats not to like? The graphics are superb as well, environments can range from lush forests to cities to snow covered mountains and they all look great.

To that end, if you're a Starcraft/Warcraft fan, you'll find this game extremely close-ended and unentertaining.

Each mission simply consists of you moving your units around to the designated spots so they can automatically shoot enemies for you. Simply put, there is no strategy in this game. The computer is looking for you to do something and if you do it, then you pass the mission.Those looking for a recreation of C&C; should go elsewhere.

I hate the fact that every new game only brings a couple new options. Meanwhile, the rest of the game is EXACTLY the same as last years WWE game. It's just a rip-off marketing strategy, in my opinion.At least this game has some wonderful graphics to make up for the lack of interesting new features. But the thing is, you don't need this game. Not just because there's already a million WWE games on the market that are all designed only to impress graphically-obsessed video game fans, but also because...The Playstation 3 happens to be responsible for the next generation of WWE games, and these games happen to have the best graphics to date.

The GM mode is hard because you can't keep superstars happy, they always get hurt, and you can never trade.

A paragraph that presents an argument about one century will use as evidence an example from 200 years and a continent away. I am a huge history buff and patiently plod through even the driest field, but I found his text exceedingly hard to follow.Perhaps Kamen is an iconoclast blasting away at received wisdom about the Spanish empire, but I lack the background to say what arguments he is overturning here.

Instead it was a movie from her best (male) friend's perspective, about how he thought it was a nuts idea, but because he had (secretly romantic) feelings about her, he would support his 'best friend' no matter what. In the end, it was not at all about her choice to pursue motherhood, it was about how best friends finally get around to speaking clearly with each other about their feelings, fall in love, and get married.

Jason Bateman provided both a funny and a heart-warming performance. Jason's scenes with the little boy were very touching. Jennifer was very good in this movie also. She got to show her serious side to some degree. The boy was adorable and Jeff Goldblum was his usual funny self. It turned out to be a very thoughtful movie despite the crazy concept of the insemination party. Good job everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow. Boring.","review":"I found this film predictable, tedious and not very smart. I don't watch a lot of romcoms, but gave this one a go since Jennifer Anniston is in it. Her last five movies received very poor ratings and this one was touted as one of the better ones.

We've all known and admired the abilities of Jennifer Aniston...but Jason Bateman has always been such an underrated talent, and especially so in The Switch! His natural delivery, his quirkiness, and his character development elevate this movie, and give it its warmth and depth! BUT...that being said, the ADORABLE little boy STEALS the show, hands down!! I don't know where they got this incredibly cute and talented young boy, who is SO CONVINCING with his insecurities...but he was indeed the icing on the cake for me in this movie!! I've watched this movie a few times, with different friends and family...and I've gotten something different out of it each time!! If you're looking for one of those hidden gems that celebrate love, and the human spirit, The Switch will MORE than suffice!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"Bateman and Anniston are great in this movie.

This film got a lot of mixed reviews when it was released last summer but I very much enjoyed this warm, and introspective look at what makes a family...well, a family! Bateman gives a solid performance, his character plays it safe in life. He is slightly neurotic and is afraid to take chances.

The rest of the movie wasn't really funny, and was predictable and reminded me too much of the back up plan even though they had different story lines. I usually like aniston and bateman but this movie just wasn't good. I couldn't wait for it to end once the Aniston's character moved back to NYC which was 1/4 into the movie.

Aniston portrays a career womanwho suddenly realizes that her biological clock is ticking and makes a decision to have a baby.Although she has a very close male friend (Bateman), she picks a sperm donor (Patrick Wilson) fromCraigs List ads. Why would Bateman not offer his sperm in the first place is beyond me? But,later on he switches his sperm with the actual donor's sperm while drunk. That is another contrivedsituation. How can anybody not remember something like that? If there is one funny thingyou take out with this movie, it should be Diana Sawyer! Really! :)If you like heart warming movies that deal with relationships, this could be a 3 star or a 4 starmovie.

Again, we have just another sex-neurotic romantic comedy (How many ways can this tale be told?) of dysfunctional, if not just plain strange, relationship challenged adults behaving like incompetent pre-juveniles. And, as a self fulfilling prophecy, Aniston again not only plays her self in her usual robotic airhead fashion but she also produces this film representation of herself. The \\"I Love NY\\" movies give us further insight into how the money attracting greed of Wall Street etc., can show no other side to itself and knows no other audience.Indicator #2:The quality of a movie is inversely proportional to the number of songs needed to fill and bolster it's content.

Due to a mix-up Fulton receives friendly ghosts instead of the murdering ghosts. The Dial-A-Ghost agency realizes their mistake. This leads to a tragic mistake. In order to clear things up they send the murdering ghosts to Oliver's home.Eva Ibbotson develops characters wonderfully allowing the reader to view them as friends and enemies with the characters.

Roughly a year later they relaunch their website and announce a new album. Music elitists excited for what may come next. About a month ago the album was leaked, the album was over hyped and everyone was disappointed (for the most part). There were 2 strong songs, though. Skullflower and My Horse Must Lose.

I consider myself open-minded when it comes to music, but this CD just comes across as a scam to make money. Half the songs are just crappy noises or some lady praying or something. Then comes Horses In the Sky, which is an amazing song. In fact, it's the only song on the CD that I can stand. The second part of the scam is that they posted Horses In the Sky on their myspace as a preview to the cd. However, it's the only song on the CD that is even close to good.

There's not a throwaway track in the bunch and several of the songs on \\"Levee\\" rank with the Subdudes' all time greats. \\"Papa Dukie and the Mud People,\\" the first single, is alone worth the price of admission, and the rest of the album is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes the sun come out on a rainy Monday","review":"This is the type of CD you put on when you're having the kind of day that makes you want to go back to bed. \\"Papa Dukie and the Mud People\\" is a great opener, but you get hope, humor, and happiness clear through the CD. \\"Time for the Sun to Rise\\" is a call to wake up and listen to the birds sing. \\"Prayer of Love\\" which closes the CD just leaves you feeing inspired.

No further empirical evidence needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album once again","review":"The Subdudes never cease to amaze me. Every album they release is as good as the last.

They removed their intricate and highly customizable 32 proffesion system and reduced it to 9 generic proffesions. They completely changed the combat system to a point and shoot system. It's hard to find people to group with to play the game now because so many people have cancelled their subscriptions. You won't find a lot of veterans helping new players, since most veterans have left SOE entirely and gone to play games from companies with much better customer support and respect, like Blizzard. Most of the things that made this game amazing have been removed, It's just too simple and generic now. Unless you're a very casual gamer, don't bother with Star Wars Galaxies.

I am also a fan of the new combat icons. The game promotes hunting in large groups, but one is still able to do solo missions if they choose.

I guess if you want the experiance of beta testing a game for a 15 dollar monthly fee and being a QA tester for a buggy game and having to pay on top of that, than this game is for you.

Originally we were assured player crafted items would always be the best, then with the addition of exceptional and legendary weapons loots became the best. Loot enhancers were the only way to make great weapons, then with some great wizdom the Dev team killed crafting in one swoop with the NGE. Now stats don't matter on components, enhancers are all useless and everyone will have the same weapons with NO DECAY.

My recommendation for any one considering this game is to start looking at other games that are not SOE produced.If you do buy this game just expect that you will be let down time and time again with promises made and always broken by Sony Online Entertainment.By the way they just released a revamped version of the game that is so full of bugs you can not play it decently."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Game Destroyed","review":"This was a great game.

It's not that it's hard, it just takes more steps than it needs.Also, the clock display is downright irritating in that it shows \\"PM12:00\\" as an example.

We get flash flood warnings at least once every few weeks at 1-3 in the morning (and we are in no likelihood of being affected by a flash flood). There is no way to set the unit to only alert you to certain threats - such as tornados, civil emergencies, etc. So, if you have your county (or counties) selected, you're going to hear it if ANY alert is issued. Sure, you could turn it off at night, but that defeats the purpose. Setting the unit up requires following the manual, as does just about any operation besides turning the weather radio on or off (the thing REALLY is tough to use - and I work in research and development).

And no, I ain't saying this because I like Beyonce; hell, if letoya really puts her all into her next album, she could be a real contender, but for now, she's alright.

Some of the songs have some pretty neat beats, while others, no offense, sound like they are supposed to be on a Destiny's Child Album. There really isn't a good variety of music selection. The vocals aren't strong, I feel that a lot of singers today shy away when it comes to showing their talent, and there are some who do it because they are advised to while others do so because they really can't sing. Would I personally go out and buy the album, probably not. Would I recommend it to others? If you like the sound and don't mind listening to vocals that sound like backups then your fine.

I think everyone is so caught up in the DC hype, and the additional hype of this having debuted at No.1 on the Billboard Hot 100, that they forgot the basis of a good album - the MUSIC.Of which there is none to be found here. Granted, LeToya definitely sounds better than most R&B; vocalists out there today (her desperate need to emulate Mary J.Blige is a little obvious though), but the material lets her down. The song \\"Obvious\\" is a wonderful showcase for her vocal abilities but then the rest of the album drowns itself in the common references to pimps, ice and clubs. I am so tired of that whole thing, seriously.LeToya is a novelty item in the market right now, thats about it. Does anyone seem themselves playing this five years down the line?

LeToya is a well-written, well thought out project. Her lyrics leave nothing to be desired. Her singing style is NOT contrived, in other words forced. Toya is a born Soprano, charming, intelligent, articulate, and humble...qualities evidenced by her music and presentation.Standout Tracks are:!!!Intro !!!everything in between!!!

There was not a single song that stood out. Every song was forgettable and could basically be sung by anybody and you know I'm right. There's nothing new here and Letoya's personality is barely present. The only good thing I could say about Letoya is that her singing doesn't irritate me like Beyonce's. That's pretty much it."},{"rating":"1","title":"dime a dozen","review":"her voice is decent,but nothing on this album stands out. in truth when i first heard some of the cuts&heard the name Latoya I was thinking about Latoya Jackson. it ain't that far-fetched because both when compared to being associated with a More Talented&Dominat person either in Family or in a Group both aren't in that league. Le Toya is a Sexy looking Chick,but a dime a dozen act. oh about 99 other chicks could have done about 60% of these tracks. she has some personality,but doesn't have any stand-out tracks here. not Badd,but far from making you think&feel Beyonce has something to worry about. this is just a Ok Debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"This CD is horrible!!

It's okay. The songs on this album are song that any other r&b; singer would put out. People want to make the comparision to Beyonce, but there is none. Yeah yeah she was apart of the Best Group Ever, but Beyonce as a solo artist is different, edgy. Letoya has talent but i think that she should have come harder. I think that the reason people are feeling this album so much is because we really dont have no new r&b; singers that do it except Mary,B& Alicia. Nice try Letoya maybe next time you will come harder and more original.Best songs: So Special,Torn,She Don't,Hey Fella,This SongActual rating **1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Let me first say that I was thrilled that Letoya came back. I got her CD because I wanted to show my support and I was hoping for something that would just blow me away. Unfortunately, this is not the CD. I already knew that \\"Torn\\" was a song with elementary type lyrics but they play it so much on the radio, I started to like it. Basically, the whole CD has that type of lyrics. The lyrics are not all that and the beat is ok, nothing catchy or something to consider \\"the beat\\". So, I bought the CD for 9.99 and turned it in to get 4 dollars which I was glad to get something, it beats nothing. And plus, I didn't want the CD cluttering up my car if I wasn't going to listen to it.And another thing, just look at the price Amazon is offering for it (7.99) and the price of the used CD starting off at 3 bucks.

She has her own unique sound in her voice to where she doesnt sound like \\"her\\" at all (at least not to me). I've been hearing alot of female singers and groups that sound like Destiny's Child (or Beyonce, take your pick). Although I didn't give the album all stars, I will make a honorable menton that at first I bootlegged it. But after hearing no trace of \\"her\\" on this album, I went right to Best Buy and copt her joint (sorry for the bootleggin...lol). The last album I bought at all was Will Smith, so it be known how skepitcal I am with music these days.

The singing is simply sweet (She Don't, Hey Fella), controlled and genuine (I'm Good, What Love Can Do). LeToya is relatively a new solo artist and she deserves our support. The CD is great and every single track serves a purpose for the broken hearted, club heads, gangstas (All Eyes on Me, Gangsta Grillz, and hopeless romantics (Torn, Torn Remix FIYAH!!!!). Don't be swayed by the naysayers. If you've seen LeToya in concert now you know for a fact she CAN DANCE and she CAN SING LIVE and HIT THAT HIGH NOTE...the young lady got talent.

Hope that important things don't always happen because someone with power decides to do something. I liked the idea that two unknowns, Stiller and Marlowe, may have had something to do with the saving of Java. I can't pass judgement on whether they really did or not.

I don't know how the model in the picture didn't show it, but I even tried putting a tank top underneath and it didn't look right. I finally decided to go to the store and buy a bottle of Ritt fabric dye. I changed the color of the shirt and that worked well. All except for the white thread, but it gave it a little bit of difference. My suggestion though, is that, if you are going to get any of these shirts, stick to the darker colored ones. Also, it is not a true scoop neck, but it doesn't ride your neck and does sit comfortably.

Parts shown but unnumbered and directions sometimes difficult to comprehend.If you plan to purchase this kit, construction will be much, much easier if you also purchase small tools with which to work. For example, when working with the ship's rigging, a regular pair of scissors are almost useless, even small ones. Small clamps will also be necessary to hold cemented parts together and in place while the cement (glue) dries.When complete, though, Old Ironsides will be something you'll be proud to display.

The sound was fine and the wireless worked well (they are infrared so the transmission doesnt go through walls, and the sound is poor at more than 10 ft. away), but the microphone for xbox live didnt work well at all. At first it didnt work at all, but when I put the mute switch in-between ON and OFF I was finally able to talk to my friends on live. But even then the sound was poor. When I put the microphone back on that came with the xbox they could hear me very well. Conclusion: the microphone stinks.Overall, the sound was good and it was cool having wireless headphones, but the microphone stinks. So do yourselves a favor: if youre going to spend $75-$100 for a pair of wireless headphones, get the good kind that transmit thru walls, etc. that dont have an xbox live mic, cuz you wont use the mic anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"great product with a few flaws.","review":"These headphones were pretty convenient to use, although it has a few flaws.

Once the game audio starting building, the volume would either drop or cut out completely. Rev an engine...audio cuts out...two guys shooting...audio cuts out. Other problems included the sound was reversed (noise on right side of screen came in on left headset, even though I had everything wired correctly) and horrible sound quality through the mic. No one that I was playing online with could hear me, even with the mic up against my mouth.Maybe I just got a bad unit...but it was so bad I didn't even bother to try a second one, I just returned it and got my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome when they work","review":"Well when these worked they worked fine other than the fuzz you get if you block the path to the receiver.

It simply wouldn't cut grass efficiently. I also found the automatic string feed to be unreliable...I would always end up with about 1 inch of string and I would have to tap it against the ground to try to get it to feed. Also, I found the unit uncomfortable to use - it's poorly balanced due to the heavy battery.This season I broke down and replaced the cordless trimmer with a small 25cc gas powered unit.

The show itself asks you to suspend reality. So no, not all of it is fact based. As it is based on a young adults novel, that should be an indication of the editing process it has undergone.

Riding shotgun (in fact it wouldn't be a shotgun) on a coach wouldn't be the sort of job you'd entrust to a half-wit.I'd like it better if it was Bjharrn on the planet of Sppljorrk.

Although I agree with the author's sense of awe at the 'fine tuning' of our universe and his admission that it could not be found to be otherwise, I find that this book does very little to explain or explore crucial concepts which would have made this book imensely deeper without neccissarily introducing needless complexity and confusion. All in all, I get the sense that the author writes in the manner of a high school student, who writes the same thing over and over again in only slightly different words because they didn't get it quite right the first time, and in order to achieve a requisite length. A sumary of this book, however, would likely be quite enjoyable as a substitution for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provocative for thinking about providence or multiverse","review":"The author skillfully describes the mysteries of the physical laws that govern our universe for a general readership. On page 2, he gives a list of explanations for the six numbers he uses in this book. Readers may feel it necessary to look back this list often while reading later chapters. For this purpose, the explanations are a little lengthy and lack the rigor of definition. However, this is a minor defect. The author ingeniously makes the readers wonder about the deep forces that shape everything from galaxies to life on earth to lead them to the final chapter. There they would be interested in guessing by themselves if the fine-tuning of the values of the six numbers is the result of providence or multiverse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I requested this book after a discussion group at a book club regarding religous beliefs and Rees name was brought up.

I have an amateur interest in astrophysics. I also have a group of friends who share that interest. I purchased the last two copies for two of these friends.

I ordered on the 3rd and they waited till the 19th to tell me they could not \\"process\\" the order. This was a huge inconvenience and I guess the price you pay with amazon's crappy shipping service. I have been frustrated with amazon's slow shipping in the past but this has sent me over the edge.

He has a very expensive alternative augmentative communication device, but it is too complicated for him to use effectively. Recently my husband had an appointment with a occupational therapist who had in her office a slant board very similar to this one. Seeing my husband work with that therapist inspired me to purchase this product. I put a dry erase whiteboard on this writing slope. I can adjust the slant board so he can see the white board, and he is able to write on it. He will not win any awards for penmanship, but this is by far the best aid to communication that we have found! Being able to communicate at least basic things makes an enormous difference in his quality of life, and mine.P.S. I like the slant board myself. It is very pleasing to the hand and eye."},{"rating":"2","title":"Infamous Jacky Faber strikes again!","review":"Thus far, I have read every book in the 'Bloody Jack' series. I ADORED this book.

Ween fans bit their nails as they waited for the next offering. They needn't worry - quebec is everything a good Ween album should be - that is to say that each song encompasses a completely different genre. Ween is a band that refuses to be pigeon-holed into a specific \\"sound\\", and thank God for that. . . Go out and buy quebec - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive Quebec!","review":"After a much delayed release (due to a label change), Ween strikes back with a vengence with Quebec. With a promise to return to 'the browner aspects of ween,' the album's opening track bears similarities to The Pod's \\"You F---ed Up.\\" From there it's a Mollusk-esque journey from Zoloft, which was obviously written under the influence of its title, to the quiet, although somehwat boring, finale of Alcan Road. Also on this cd is a catchy, bouncy and updated version of 'Hey There Fancy Pants,' which is of Crank Yankers fame. Probably the best track is the warped jam of So Many People in the Neighborhood.Noticably absent is the infamous \\"Where'd the Cheese Go?\\" song that was pitched for a Pizza Hut commercial and subsequently rejected. But it's omission is entirely forgiveable considering the scope of this zany album. Yes everyone, Ween is back, and they're browner then ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"My brain is swelling so bad that I have diarrhea","review":"If I don't get some relief soon, there is a chance that I will have to make some scrambled eggs.

But this track not half as strong. From here on out, there are no standout songs. The thing just cruises along in 2nd gear - with songs that sound like they are not quite finished or in slow motion.Buy the other Ween albums first, or -even better- the new Live CD exclusive from Ween.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best effort...","review":"I am surprised at all the positive reviews (especially the one from the guy who hasn't heard the album yet). I've listened to this album 5 times now, giving it plenty of chance, and only 2 songs have stuck out as good (So Many People in the Neighborhood and Happy Colored Marbles). The rest is really bad, especially when compared to other awesome Ween albums like The Pod, Pure Guava, Chocolate & Cheese, and the Mollusk.Buy a whole album for 2 songs? That's up to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think it's over","review":"No joke - I actually listened to this cd while driving through Quebec. I just think it's over. It's sad, but true. It's just not as interesting, just not as funny, just not as weird. I still think Mollusk is best. Ohh well, I love Ween, but I don't like Quebec - period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate and lovely.","review":"While this may not be the Weens utmost masterpiece, it is a stellar entry in their varied catalog. There is a little something here for everyone. Gonna Be Long Night will keep the headbangers oh so happy. Transdermal Celebration soars like a flaming golden bird. Many of the songs are laced with a quiet menacing intensity as the brothers of Ween dance on the edge of sanity. See Happy Colored Marbles and So Many People in the Neighborhood. And good luck explaining Hey There Fancypants to the newly initiated. They even revisit the country roots on Chocolate Town. Long live Boognish! Amen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quebec du Ween","review":"I had the priviledge of hearing a few of the songs off of this album during their last tour (Zoloft, etc.). Like most Ween albums, it has the one or two tracks to peak your interest right off the bat, and the rest grows on you like a fungus till it's part of your soul. This album expresses the evolution of the band towards the musical instead of pure comedy. There is something for every ween fan in it, but it is closer to White Pepper than God/Ween/Satan. I think it's the shizzle IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"z-o-l-o-f-t","review":"Quebec has been playing all day on weenradio.com .. It's pretty alright.

Thank you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Ween album","review":"This is the first Ween album I ever bought. LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING! It will be the greatest music to your ears ever! Even after exploring their older stuff (like, I've got Chocalote and Cheese, The Mollusk, and Pure Guava) this one still has the best songs and is overall the most listenable.

If you're not, maybe you should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product for the right projects","review":"The setup and cleanup is an overhead that makes this product useful only for moderate to large projects. This is true of $2500 sprayer systems I've used, however, so it may be endemic to power sprayers in general. I bought this for a house I'm remodeling, and I've learned to plan ahead and paint 2-3 rooms at a time with it to justify the setup and cleanup time. When the hose is pressurized, it is stiff and a bit ungainly, so you also need to avoid \\"painting yourself into a corner.\\" The spray pattern is good. Bottom line, I've saved a lot of time and effort and gotten great results with this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-time use","review":"As others have discussed, this product is effectively a one-use product. I don't feel too awful since I bought a recon unit off eBay for less than $100. It worked liked a champ for my painting of a large farm shed. Then, as others describe, the pressure dropped significantly. I was still able to use it to paint another small shed, but it was slow going. As others discovered the primary problem is the outlet valve. I ordered two replacement ones for about $30 and thought that would at least allow me to finish the other buildings, but both of these failed within two hours. Experiences seem to vary with this machine; maybe you'll roll the dice and get 30-40 hours before replacing parts. The gun and operation are excellent, however, so I will probably upgrade to a 9140 or 1420 so I can at least re-use the gun and hose."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are going to use it once no problem","review":"I purchased this product and the first time I used it worked great, no complaints. However, I recently pulled it out where I had it setup for long term storage poured some paint in the reservoir and tried to prime it...nothing. Tried painting with it....nothing. Cursed at it....nothing. Wanted to kick it but refrained...I had to maintain some semblance of control. For what I used to paint with it...I guess it would had cost about the same as hiring a professional so I guess I am even. Hell will freeze over before I purchase another Wagner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Junk-Dont Waste Your Hard Earned Money!","review":"Bought 2 months ago for my hubby to paint garage this month, so I cant even return the damn thing. We got primer on the shed and about two feet of a two story two car garage and the thing quit. Just stopped. We emptied the paint, cleaned the unit, primed it AND strained the paint just to be sure and started again, and got about another two feet into the job and it stopped again. Went down 22.5 miles to Home Depot and asked about the history of this unit, and they said it DOESNT HANDLE EXTERIOR LATEX paint very well. Well that is why I bought it!!It says it can handle that type of paint. What, are they just lying to make a sale?Bought a Graco, worth every penny.

Every negative review you read of this is true, every good review is from someone who only used it once. I just pulled this out of storage, about six months since I used it the first time. I followed every cleaning instruction to a T when I put it away, but I fire it up and sure enough I get nothing but a dribble from the sprayer.Now, I could clean and disassemble the whole thing, buy a $50 set of replacement valves and maybe get it to work another day, but I might as well buy a $50 sprayer and throw it out when I'm done. This product is junk, and the fact that there are so many \\"reconditioned\\" units out there should have been a red flag.Avoid at all costs, burn your money if you must to keep from spending it on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"The sprayer started out fine but quickly turned into a disaster.It did not respond to repeated cleaning.It would have been easier to brush and roll.

I think this sprayer is worthless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible design","review":"I still don't understand what Wagner took a very good design, like the 1620 which I now have, and said \\"screw it\\". The hopper on this machine is probably the dumbest thing in engineering I have ever seen. It makes it impossibly hard to clean this thing within a reasonable amount of time. I spent and hour and fifteen minutes one time just cleaning this thing. Even cleaning it thoroughly does not mean that it was cleaned thoroughly. You will have something left over in the machine which will destroy it. Even with this cleaning process after about 20 gallons of paint including drywall primer and kilz primer, it failed. I hate to waste 200 so I will get it working again only to sell it to someone else.Do yourself a favor. If you are going to paint anything either get a pro model 1420, 1620 or 1920 or get one of those hand held sprayers. Don't waste your time and money on this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"I purchased one of these at an end of season sale. I didn't get to my project for a year.

It does its job well for small to medium size jobs. However, if you don't mind spending countless hours trying to clean, fix and jiggle the thing to work and frustration that comes with it, it is a good product. Now to be fair, I believe all paint sprayers have similar problems and same issues with cleaning and maintaining. We sprayed our exterior of the house and three bedroom interior space with this product. When we went back to reuse it for another job, despite spending an hour to clean and following the manual for the maintenance, the machine did not work the second time around. I think for $200, was it a good DIY tool? I give it \\"YES\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow wow wow","review":"I read reviews on thsi before buying.Having just used this item I have to say it's GREAT. I sprayed an entire 18ft high 2 car garage and it took me about an hour. Saving me 3 times the time on roller. The spray head was easy to contol and one twist it sprayed more on to the wall. Cleaning was really no problem. I just put water into the system and spayed until it was spraying clear water. It sprayed great and control in small area's was a breeze. Wow. This is my new best buy. I did not have to dilute paint it sprayed latex with no thinning. That saved me time and quess work on how to much to thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costly in money and time","review":"I would only use the thing outdoors or for large interior jobs with an unfinished floor--at least that is where it would do the smallest harm. I am not sure it would provide much utility. I spent much more time cleaning up after the thing than I would have spent doing my interior painting with a brush and manual roller. It springs leaks freely (it is like a puppy that isn't housebroken), oversprays (even with ordinary latex paint), clogs easily, and requires rigorous flushing between uses. I used the product primarily for one job to repaint large interior areas of rough brick, but it performed poorly and it would be of negative utility for an ordinary size room with drywall that can be painted with a brush and common roller. I bought the sprayer for $199. I gave it away on Freecycle. I didn't think it conscionable to inflict it on someone who parted with cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Trash","review":"I can't believe all the positive reviews of this sprayer. I borrowed this from a friend and got less than a gallon of latex paint on the wall before it seized up. I needed to get my house finished so I went to the store and bought a replacement for the one that I thought I had ruined. That one lasted most of the day before it quit so I took it back to the store and they replaced it. I finished the job and gave my friend the nearly new unit. He told me that he had the same experience and the unit he loaned me had been replaced under warrany after 2-3 days of use.

The machine worked great the first time. Then, after spraying only a few gallons of paint, we had to replace the valves. Then it worked again for a only couple gallons. Apparently, if you are using a primer like Kilz a valve will only last 10-15 gallons. I just hate this machine. When you take the pains to carve out time for painting, you get really mad with a malfunctional machine.

I've also owned the wagner hand held sprayer which was junk, so I was reluctant to by the crew sprayer. I was caught in a jam so I needed to get something reasonably priced. Not only did I receive it quicker than expected, I thought I was dreaming at how great it worked. The self contained paint area kept paint from drying out and it sprayed incredibly well & consistent.

I thought the book would be a natural extention of Mr. Nesmith's wit and intelligence. I was mistaken. The book is well written, but the story takes so many turns in so many directions, as if to hit a mark in every genre, that the story falls short. Perhaps the novel would have been better if it were a collection of short stories. In fact, I would suggest trying to read Neftoon Zemora that way...It might make more sense and be more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantasmagoric!","review":"I read this book and was absolutely blown away.

I strongly doubt it even though I found the book to be somewhat of a master piece, for who says what perfect is? Since I don't have a clear definition of the word 'perfect' I am afraid I cannot give it more than 4/5. As I'm not a Monkees-fan (though I admit my choice of e-mail address to be very Monkee-ish) I may not have expected as much from this book as all my fellow reviewers. To be quite honest I didn't think that much of Mr Nesmith before, but now I respect the man fully and found his philosophical points in the book to be very interesting and worth to think about. The book was very much like a painting of a circle. Very intense and spellbinding. It took me four hours, non-stop, to read this book and that has only happened to me once before ( with Ernest Hemingway's \\"A moveable feast\\").

It captures the real man's sensitivity, imagination, complex views, and a little bit of how hard it must of been for him growing up in Dallas, Tx. It weaves a tale in the southwest that keeps you hungering for more. Instead of writing an autobiography, as others have done, trashing someone else, or blaming someone else for their artistic failure, this man writes a work of fantasy that includes heartaches and pain in the character of Nez while he searches for a legend and the woman of his dreams.

There is laid-off hotshot Ben Affleck, whose family loves him so much they even like living with the in-laws. (Downsizing is great for family values!) There is a really disturbing scene where Affleck chooses to work for his brother-in-law, Kevin Costner, instead of robbing a bank. (Pathetic!)

Really enjoyed viewing this serious, timely (the movie is realistic enough to make all corporate climbers, but especially men over 50, quake in their boots - the old days of corporate beneficence and loyalty to longtime employees are long gone) and outstanding acting. Basically, the AH turns out to be the CEO who betrays his employees in the interests of raising the company's nominal value in preparation for a profitable merger - sound familiar?.

It was pretty good. The problem with this movie is that it was not promoted or advertised nearly enough. I think they only realeased this movie in just over a hundred theaters nation wide?

The story is all too real with the tough economy the U.S.A. has been going through. Having seen it now, the pace of the story seems odd. There is so much time spent setting up the story and introducing the characters, that the end seems somewhat rushed and they tried to tie it up in a neat little bow and that just didn't work for me. I expected a little more substance after seeing the trailer.It's about corporate downsizing, loyalty, family and friends. The story is compelling but doesn't quite go anywhere. They could have rewritten the last 30-40 minutes and answered lots of questions that are just left hanging. If the price is right, get it. I did like it. Just don't pay top dollar for it. It is a little flawed. The cast can make up for some of that however. They are great. One thumb up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid work.","review":"In this film taking place during the recession, a sales executive loses his job, and struggles to accept the reality of his new lifestyle. Solid work here focuses not on the intricacies of what caused the financial meltdown, but instead presents the plight of one affected family. The movie also touches on the gap between compensation levels in the United States between the executives who run businesses and the people who ensure the companies function on a day-to-day basis. A strong cast ensures this film does not segue into sentimental tearjerker, though sentimentality does creep through a bit at the end. Overall, this is a strong effort that will capture the audience with solid acting and a compelling storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter taste, poision in a bottle!","review":"wasted my money! this product gave me a bitter taste in my mouth, made me dizzy, nautious churning feeling in my stomach, and sleepy.

I found it easy to shoot, although the sling is so resistant to pulling that it's a bit hard to aim. It is possible, however, to set the handle's flat base on a level surface, and that makes it easier to shoot. It's good for target shooting and for deterring varmints, but not with the ten or so shot that come with the product - they're too lightweight to be accurate over a distance greater than twenty yards. I'd recommend Barnett steel shots instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"It's a crib. it is an expensive crib so only consider if you can afford it, simply as that. If you like minimal, clean design, that's not fussy or old fashioned then this is a great option. It's such a lovely design piece and works so well for a girl or boy. It's solid, sturdy, easy to put together and my 18 month old has been in this since she was born so full marks all around.

My only concern (and I cringe that I have to give it 4 stars since I love the crib so much) but the open space without a railing is a problem if you have a kid that moves a lot in his sleep. Our son is only 2 years and 3 months old and we thought he was ready to move to a toddler bed, and while he loves the freedom of getting in and out of bed on his own, he did fall off the bed the second night. We have carpet and it's a low bed so he didn't get hurt but that surely startled him. Maybe he's not ready yet to graduate to a toddler bed but for now there's array of soft pillows around his bed so if he falls again he can land on pillows. If your child doesn't make 180 degree turns all night long, then this conversion kit is perfect for you, very sturdy, easy to assemble, and very elegant (just like the crib)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"My daughter is in the fifth grade and wanted to join band and play the trumpet.

However, having said that, this does have what to me is his most beautiful song If You Could See You (Through My Eyes). I really love that and would have been horribly disappointed if that wasn't on this.The other good songs for me that made it onto the cd is Make Believe and Never Too Busy. I think that if you are a fan of Kenny's, then you'll really like this, despite what you feel is missing from here. He really has the best voice around and I love his music.

I ended up giving it away. Don't get me wrong, it's a very sturdy and well made chair & ottoman (although one of the red buttons on the front fell off), it's just made of an upholstery that you cannot clean.

Jack Lemmon plays the young Parisian police officer who is a little naive and does not understand that being assigned to a red light district is a form of reward because of certain fringe benefits. Shirley Maclaine plays Irma, the beautiful prostitute. Circumstances bring about a drastic change in the police officer's life which turn him into Irma's pimp, but he has a problem because he does not want to share her with other men. That leads him into a life of subtrafuge as he tries to masquerade as another individual. The film has its moments. It was produced when Lemmon and MacLaine were at the peak of their careers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irma la flop","review":"This is one of my least favorite Jack Lemmon movies.

She looks great, like she always does, but the plot is very thin, the jokes are lame, and the movie is more than predictable. Lou Jacobi does a great job as the bartender, but he can't carry this thing, and Shirley hasn't enough of a part to make much of a difference. It falls to Jack Lemmon to redeem the effort, and although he starts off strong, he ultimately drops the ball. In addition, the DVD is ridiculously expensive. Save your money for something more worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated","review":"I don't recall if I saw this when it came out. I probably did because I loved Paris, Shirley MacLaine and Billy Wilder. What a difference a half-century makes.When I watched it now I was terribly disappointed. The Jack Lemmon character was silly, the whole premise was naive and it just didn't grab me. I hate to say it but I was also offended by the old timey view of prostitutes as good-time girls who really loved their work. I'm not politically correct or even much of a feminist, but I found portraying prostitutes in this way really offensice. There is nothing funny or entertaining or cute about prostitution and the women who endure this terribly degrading 'profession\\" sure don't look like Shirly MacLaine.

Breckinridge!!), it is surprising to discover not-so-veiled homophobia (the bit about Benjamin) and anti-semitism (the other bit about Benjamin) so prominently featured. Oh, Benjamin was fat and told jokes too, and smiled too much, and ate ham, and was rich. What is the point?

I can't believe this isn't getting more radio play (or maybe I can). Some recommendations: Lightning (an oddly gentle song about being electrocuted for murder), Guys Like Me (the one you might have heard on the radio), How 'Bout You (another in the long tradition of \\"this is who I am\\" country rockers) and Pledge Alligiance to the Hag (a Merle Haggard tribute that should be played at full volume).

Unfortunatly though, this record seems to be all over the place. It's almost as if Church has no idea what he wants to be. Some of these songs are molded in the vein of contemporary country (think keith urban or rascal flatts), while others are more \\"traditional\\" (think stuff that doesn't get played on your local hot country station). Even still, most of these songs add a southern rock vibe, which throws everything off all together. Now, none of this would be bad if Church could actually pull it off, but more often than not, he can't. Lyrically, the material here is pretty strong, but lyrics alone can't make an entire song.

Country music has become flat-out depressing (this from a fan!). It has become so utterly predictable, so utterly bland, so utterly the same. \\"Regular guys\\" like Church really don't need to play their music. We already know what's going to come out of their mouths way before they sing a note.Country music has become, sadly, a celebration of ignorance and intolerance, of W. and his war, of wrapping the cross in the flag (which is blasphemy, of course), of every man for himself (while simultaneously claiming to follow Jesus).

The graphics are definitely enjoyable, and I like the mix of CG and art for dialogue. Although having a different kind of cutscene rather than the game's general graphics would be nice, they work well enough.The gameplay is smooth, and the characters are very enjoyable. Playing through the games makes me feel like I'm playing through a well developed anime, one that is mostly simple and doesn't try to take itself too seriously, but obviously has more in store for you.I think it's worth the buy if you enjoy Grandia games, or just want a good game to play through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game/Idea But Mediocre Graphics","review":"This is probably one of the funnest RPGs I've played in awhile, it's much more interactive with battles and exploration (ie you can actual move on the battle screen and avoid enemies when in exploration mode). The only draw backs are the lack of stunning graphics that most of us have become used to with the Final Fantasy series.This game does have some high points though, the story line is fun and is based in a slightly modern world (they have airplanes for Pete's sake!)but it still plays into the fantasy of idea of swords, magic, and special moves.Over all, the two draw backs of this game are the lack of graphics, (they're decent, but it can get annoying when the character lines get blurry) and the over-dramtic voice acting. If you can get past these two things, you will have an extremly fun, if not interesting, experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun game","review":"The graphics in Grandia III are excellent. Everything is beautiful and vibrant.The various characters are interesting. Alfina looks good and so do the other characters. Most have an interesting backstory. The tension between Yuki and his mother is interesting.The combat is very fast. You can perform combos and kick your enemies into the air. The game keeps track of how high you kick you enemies. It's very fun but can be a bit too easy.I don't like how the game doesn't have a save anywhere feature.The story is OK. For the most part, it is standard \\"the fate of the world depends on us\\" stuff.Overall, I would recommend buying Grandia III."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my Top Ten favorite books.","review":"I first read this title when in my early teens.

No kidding -- made my hair smell like institutional floor cleaner mixed with sour clogged-drain odor, which you could smell at 10 yards away and lingered when I left the room. Scrubbed my hair with other shampoos for three days before a even small dent could be made in the odor, and to top it off, just one application of this essence de fishbait also left my hair looking like brittle straw covered with a film of old wax.Bought this as part of my search for something to replace the much-missed Silver Expression shampoo which recently stopped being produced. The search must continue ... I regret to say that somehow I accidentally bought two bottles of this junk, which is definitely like the old joke about first prize is a weekend in Cleveland, second prize is 2 weeks in Cleveland ... do yourself a favor, folks: learn from my mistake and save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a surprise!","review":"I was traveling to France to visit my cousin who had moved there from California in June.

It did make my hair a little shinier, but did not remove the brass from my dyed blonde hair. Also, it made my hair so tangled after I towel-dried it that when I tried to brush through it parts of my hair broke off. It also did not moisturize at all, but left my hair more coarse and dry than before. I tried it because it's cheaper than Shimmer Lights, but I guess you get what you pay for. I just purchased the Shimmer Lights shampoo in hopes of some better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as nexxus simply silver","review":"I ordered this because it had good reviews but tried it and it doesn't do the job toning down brassiness.

Ugh!!!","review":"CAUTION -- this is the same packaging but the formula has changed dramatically! Like many others I started using this Jhirmack product when Pantene discontinued its \\"silver hair\\" shampoo, and found it to be an OK substitute, but I just opened my replacement bottle and it's not AT ALL the same as previous Jhirmack bottles. This shampoo is runny and pale, dries out my hair, and creates wave after wave of AWFUL smells, both in the shampooing and afterwards: it smells just like a blender full of rotting melons and peaches coated with a thick layer of baby powder. If you are looking for another bottle of the Jhirmack Silver Brightening shampoo to replace the one you just used, BEWARE -- this has the exact same package but it is a radically different product inside. I will never buy another Jhirmack product again. If I could have given this negative stars, it would have been a -5. I wouldn't wish this shampoo on my worst enemy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This product works as well as most of the other silver shampoos I've tried.

The box had been damaged as if something had speared the box, leaving a hole in the fabric of the hamper.

Simply defines the cheesey B action/monster flicks of the 80's(a stupid groaning monster,a bogus storyline,a rambo head band,some bad acting,nonsensical explosions & a great baloob shot)truly one of Wes Craven's worst films to date.

Oh, and in one scene for DVD viewers only, bathing in the swamp for some gratuitous topless shots. That, in short, is about all this movie has going for it.Adapted from a DC Comics character, Swamp Thing joins the ranks of comic adaptations that should never have been. On the side of evil is a 2-dimensional evil botanist (Louis Jourdan) and an incompetent band of commandos (David Hess, Nicholas Worth, et al). The hero is a GOOD botanist (Ray Wise) who transforms into the rubber-suited title character (Dick Durock) and is lovesick for Barbeau. They all muck about in the swamp searching for the ultimate glowing green fertilizer.If you have a hankering to see director Wes Craven at his worst or Barbeau's breasts at their best, this is a must-see. There's no other reason to go near it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BUST","review":"Well, Adrienne Barbeau has a nice set of bazooms, but that's about the only thing worth looking at in this silly nonsense that might entertain a few ten year olds.

Afraid not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I laughed, I cried, I threw it away, and I damned it to Hell","review":"I saw this movie at a local video shop and laughed uncontrollably at the cover and storyline. I purchased Swamp Thing thinking it'd pack a rather hilarious punch. I cried once the movie was over because only then did I realize I wasted my 4 dollars. Thank God it was that price because I didn't hesitate to throw it in the trash. I thought about taking it to a church to have it drenched in Holy Water and ask the priest to damn that movie to Hell. The movie, unfortunately, wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent \\"B\\" horror flick","review":"The product was as described and delivered on time.What this is: The Swamp Thing is a legendary comic-book-turned-horror-movie.

So if your a fan of hers you may want to pony up for the banned copy. If you think this will drive your copies value down in price (if you own the original copy) think again. For whatever reason when a new edition comes out that deletes prior edition's content the value for the original edition goes up.That said, this is a typical B movie from the 80's.

Swamp Thing engages in the rapidly disappearing art of Camp - a movie that delivers inanity with such a poker face, it is hard to determine whether what you are watching is intentionally \\"silly\\" or not. And, ST succeeds admirably. This movie plays like a well-read comic book and the action is non-stop. Stand-out performance is Adrienne Barbeau's sidekick, a young boy with swamp smarts who helps her (along with the Swamp Thing, of course) out of her predicament. Swamp Thing is the most fun you can have watching a guy in a rubber suit."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tale of Romance... and Monsters","review":"What more can be said about this movie. It's a cult classic, and deservedly so, but it needs to be noted that this particular release (with the red title) is heavily edited compared to the previous version (now out of print) on DVD.

Campy, yes, funny, no. B-rated gimmicks and special affects are apropos to these kinds of films, but for a Wes Craven flick??? Maybe it's not meant to be sophisticated, but it's pretty lacking in the clever department as well. I did enjoy seeing some of these actors of a quarter century ago in their younger years of work. But I can think of other B-movies that go with a bowl of popcorn on a Friday night much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finally a rerelease but not the R (or unrated) version!","review":"In September (according to davisdvd) MGM will release Swamp Thing but only in its PG form. Why, when every other dvd release nowadays comes with an unrated version would MGM only release the PG one? A dual release for those who want it with or without the added adult content would be more welcome for this than say the upcoming Dodgeball Unrated (with a whole one minute of extra footage). If they did release both versions I BET the R or unrated one would outsell the PG. Perhaps they're waiting for everyone to buy it in September and then a couple months later the extended version will come. Isn't that how they all do it nowadays (to make everyone doubledip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can You Say Dumb?","review":"I was really disappointed in R.L. Stine this time.

Unfortunately, this book isn't nearly as good. I had no sympathy or empathy for the main character and there were no real plot twists except for the protagonist's deficient character."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Ridiculous","review":"This book tends to take the most simple sentence and turn it into a long, winded embellishment that sometimes makes the story hard to follow. The actual plot of the story is ok, a little ridiculous and outlandish, but entertaining.Amy has a crush on THE most beautiful and popular movie star of the day and it just so happens they meet through mutual friends, become involved and fall madly in love. The ups and downs along with the story are of course paparazzi and an infamous sex tape scandal from a previous relationship. It's all a little little too cliché and expected, but does the trick entertainment-wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused.","review":"I thought it would be cute and romantic.

The plot had potential but it certainly wasn't realized in this flimsy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Bridget but an okay interim read","review":"I was looking for something to get me out of my post-Bridget slump and this wasn't really it. The main character is someone you WON'T feel sympathy for at all (in fact, you'll wonder why the \\"hero,\\" Orlando Rock, has feelings for her at all!), kind of like Ally McBeal, you'll want to slap her around a bit. And then there is this strange, totally non-consistent, omniscient narrator thing that pops in at the weirdest moments. It just doesn't work. But if you're post Bridget and looking for something to keep you busy in the meantime, this is okay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very fun beach read!","review":"I read this book in two days while laying out in the sun at the beach . . . and did not notice my sunburn until it was too late! It is a delightful, cute, funny, quick read. So the main character isn't completely realistic -- but I think everyone can relate to her on some level. Who hasn't imagined being interviewed by People Magazine or Entertainment Tonight? Who hasn't watched the Oscars and imagined what it would be like to walk down the red carpet? Amy has her ups and downs and takes us along on her hilarious adventures -- it is a vivid and humorous look into a twenty-something's life. If you're looking for something more insightful or with more meaning, this is not the book for you. However, I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an easy diversion from everyday life. Only one problem -- after reading this, you start to think that it would be possible for a famous actor to cross your path and fall in love with you and your less-than-glamorous life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I should be sorry to say this, but I'm not: this is a HORRIBLE book. The style of writing was extremely hard to understand, and I had an easier time reading one of my economics textbooks than trying to read this. Not many books can give you a headache after trying to decipher a single page...and not succeeding. I even tried flipping through to see if the story got better, but it didn't at all. Aside from the writing style, the main character wasn't someone you *wanted* to read about. She just wasn't likable at all. I couldn't even finish one chapter before wanting to hurl it into the nearest trashcan, and that's saying a lot, considering I read pretty much everything. You're better off reading *Milkrun* or *Burning the Map* anything but this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next!","review":"This book was totally unbelievable, and I mean that in the bad way. The only reason I read it was because of the wonderful reviews, and I was very disappointed. Of course, I wasn't expecting too much from a book with a cartoon drawing on the cover, but I didn't think it would be written for a 12-year old reading level either. I'm giving it two stars because somehow, I managed to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if that was possible","review":"I bought this book because of the glowing reviews and was utterly dissappointed.

I can't understand all the five-star reviews--what did I miss?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was hoping for a frothy read along the lines of Bridget Jones but was sorely disappointed. Poorly written with a self-absorbed yet utterly uninteresting heroine.

The author's asides, like a hipper-than-thou Greek chorus, were cute, and amusing and valid observations about life are sprinkled throughout. The cleverness and archness can almost be too much at times, so it's best not to read in one sitting. A dash of Joan Collins, a large helping of Bridget Jones, a sprinkle of Katie Fforde, mixed together with the Cosmo \\"I can have it all\\" sensibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Guide for who?","review":"This was NOT the book I had hoped it would be. What an egotistical and self-indulgent person Amy turned out to be. She was dippy and conceited, and I had no sympathy for her whatsoever. And what was that weird narrator thing going on throughout the whole book? I felt like I was watching The Wonder Years, albeit a very, very BAD rendition. The one positive thing I will say about this book? Uh....hmmmmm....well, can't think of anything.... Okay, to be fair, despite the fact that the characters were less than appealing, the book was a total fantasy, so unlike real life, and that would quite possibly be some other reader's cup o' tea. Just not mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secondary Characters more interesting","review":"The problem with many chicklit heroines is that in the need to make these characters light and entertaining, authors have made them a little too one-dimensional. The girls often come out as pre-pubescent girls who never grow up. The hero deserved better and so did the reader. The most interesting characters were the secondary characters,especially Lucinda. She is the only reason this book rated two stars Lastly the writing style was--for lack of a better term--weird. Reading it was a chore. I felt like a middle school teacher grading a less than mediocre paper. Save your money and don't even borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass this one up...","review":"There is much better stuff to read - heck even better chick lit out there!

The back of the book describes a breasy light hearted romantic comdey. Unfortunately the book is nothing like the back description, and because of it I did not like this book. I wanted to read this book because it looked funny and at the moment I'm addicted to Brigdet Jones type books. Well, this book is not funny or comprehensive. I had no idea what was going on most of the time and I found Amy, the main character, not likable at all. So like I said save your time and money and get a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"I liked \\"Bridget Jones,\\" loved \\"Watermelon,\\" but found this book to be utterly insipid."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm So Sorry","review":"I bought this book hoping it would be light and entertaining. Getting through it was extremely difficult, if not impossible. The narration of the story was childlike and the characters were as attractive as unwanted chin hairs. Three fourths of the way in, I had to put the book away. I checked out the end in a final attempt to see if the book had any redeemable qualities but it was so predictable I was disappointed. Perhaps if the story had some better twists and the narration style revamped, the book would have been a bigger hit. Borrow this book from a library before buying it. I felt so tired getting through it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chore to read","review":"Yes, the old adage rings true here: never judge a book by its cover. That was my mistake, because it sounded quite good when I read the back. I was looking for something light and fun. But the entire book is so disjointed. Many times I found myself going back to re-read a sentence that was so awkwardly structured, you couldn't figure it out the first time. It really reads like a first draft that hasn't been edited. A pity, because it could be a charming (even if somewhat fluffy) tale to read.Another word of warning...there are LOTS of references to British Lit, so if you're not familiar with writers from Keats to Enid Blyton, you may not pick up on some of the attempted jokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Sylvester & Tweety","review":"These shorts are classic Late 60's, early 70's Sylvester & Tweety shorts, and have nothing to do with Space Jam.

The information is fairly basic and I just hated the use of so much BRICK in his garden designs. This might be OK if your just a beginner. You can not depend on hardscapes to make your garden. Besides, using so much brick and stone really skyrockets the cost of the garden. My clients don't need that.

This book is an account of his travels in the region during a period when momentous events were commonplace. His uncensored accounts of the happenings of that time related via moving and personal anecdotes of real people experiencing them bring the Islamic world in all its extraordinary beauty and violence to print in a way that is rare. This book is a vivid depiction of the human condition. On the brink of the abyss of horror he also finds hope and dreams. This is about the power of individuals to endure. Kremmer has a journalist's gift for making situations that most of us can barely even imagine come to life.

It made for really fun, giggly times as my brother and I would get up in the middle of the night to watch this while my parents were asleep and it inspired a lot of cool fantasies. My parents eventually did see it but over a year later because we decided they were ready for it and it became a permanent addition to our family movie collection. We are now in our thirties and still have vivid memories of it.

The visuals are superb, with incredible details, especially of crowds, crumbles of buildings, and dust. The sound is as good and detailed as it gets, and it surely takes advantage of all speakers.

The receiver has a handy onscreen programming capability and comes with a microphone that can be used for automatic speaker calibration. You'll still have to tweak the sound settings after the auto setup, but it will get you closer faster than you could otherwise, especially if you're a novice. This unit could do with some more inputs (There are only 2 HDMI in, and 3 Component Video Input slots), but with some creative input juggling you can connect a fair number of components as the receiver allows you to assign which input goes to which component. The receiver does put out a fair amount of heat, so be sure to place it in a well-ventilated location. Also, you will lose the video for a few seconds when switching inputs or when switching video resolutions on the same input, but I don't see that as a big negative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine was partially DOA","review":"I suspect that this is a super good value when it works. Mine had a dead channel and I therefor couldn't get through the Audissey setup, much less enjoy the features.Amazon service was superb. My RMA was processed very quickly and the return and refund process was totally painless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limitations","review":"The HDMI upconvert, does not give the best picture. Component video ends up working better, so I would seek other features in this price range, such as more connectivity. Quality video conversion comes at a higher price. If you're using component video, the instant status displays (volume adjustments, sound modes, etc.) don't come thru. So, although the receiver has all the latest features, they don't really work well yet. Onkyo Tech Support was no help and even seemed annoyed that someone would call them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor unit","review":"I purchased this unit and after about 4 months time it malfunctioned and produced no audio. Because the unit was under warranty, I sent it to be repaired by one of Onkyo's authorized repair facilities. They took 3 months to get it back to me and when I reconnected the unit it only lasted ONE day before it broke again for the same reason--no audio.Onkyo's customer service and management does not care about providing any type of customer service and I would not recommend purchasing any Onkyo products. I trashed this unit and purchased a Yamaha to replace it.If buying any Onkyo product buyer beware!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"Product works great.

I don't think you can go wrong with this box, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reciever, but buy a fan","review":"I've been very happy with this reciever, it's wonderful for an hd setup and surround sound. The only problem is what I already read about, that it runs hot, so I bought a silent fan that you can find for about $15 to $20 at the cheapest. I also have it raised up so air can come from underneath, with the fan on the top. If one of your appliances has an ac plug on the back, the fan will usually only be on if that appliance is on, which is really handy if it's something that is always used when you're using your reciever. But with that said, I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"I'm very happy with this receiver. This is the third Onkyo receiver I've seen in use (my brother had one 10-15 years ago, and my mother has one in her house) and this is just as good as the others. I have 4 Polk RC55i flush-mount speakers in the walls. My theater room is 13x30 and it is full of sound. I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This receiver is pretty nice! I purchased it because i had 2 HDMI & 3 Component video inputs, and 2 optical & 1 coax input. This is my third Onkyo receiver, and each one I've had is still in use somewhere else. They definitely last a long time. The onscreen video menus are very nice. The microphone setup really saves time; and its very accurate.My only complaint with this system is that, while there are 2 HDMI & 3 Component video inputs in the back, you can't assign all of these to a system button. For instance, i had everything connected, my last device being connected to \\"Aux\\". in order to use Aux, you have to have the audio inputs connected in the front. You can get around this by connecting your audio to another input in the back, such as CD, then selecting Aux to change the video input to Component, but select CD again to change the audio to CD, but leaving the video on Component. I wish Aux could be any digital input, but i must be the input on the front."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Receiver for the money","review":"I did a lot of research before purchasing this receiver, but having great success with Onkyo receivers in the past, it was more of which model to buy. I considered this, and getting last years 674 model at a closeout price. While the 674 had an extra HDMI port, what really sold me on this one was the HD sound capability which leads me to believe I will be able to use this one for a couple of years. It's biggest benefit over my old receiver is the ability to plug multiple items into the receiver and use the HDMI upconverting to transfer the signal to the TV without having to switch TV inputs. I have it hooked up with 5.1 surround and used the Audessey to calibrate the speakers and the sound is really great. It works great with my \\"old\\" HDTV as well as my HD Tivo and it is a great upgrade over my old Onkyo from 7 years ago.

I've connected by DVD player via component video to the Onkyo and audio via digital coaxial.The setup was pretty straight forward even though this was my first surround sound system. The automatic speaker calibration program worked great. I have only one complaint and that is that I have to crank up the volume (to about 45 or 50) in order to get decent sound.

There is no picture degradation. It can be set up in less than 30 minutes. The remote can be programmed by the Harmony Remote series. I wish only that it was a little more powerful (perhaps 110 watts per channel instead of 90). Still, the sound, even at lower volumes, is crisp and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great receiver, but...","review":"I got it to setup my home theater and it's really good.The sound is powerful and more than enough for a regular family room.The HDMI inputs are great.You can control every single equipment (DVD player, cable box, TV and receiver) from the receiver remote controller and you can hide all the others.But my cable box has a DVI-HMI cable, so I don't have the audio and video throw a single HDMI cable. Because of this simple detail, I wasn't able to use both HDMI input and get a single video signal to my TV.

Not so with Onkyo, as I was trying to run the sound through the receiver. Their installation instructions did not work. Onkyo support was unable to help me with an alternate solution, which I managed to find, myself.

Everything it does is awesome. The most features for your money. The only complaint is it down converts your 1080p component HD source to 720p if you go through the HDMI output on the receiver. It IS noticeable on your 1080p tv (grainy pixel picture). So you will have to run audio to your receiver and video directly to your tv if you want to preserve the 1080p output source."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does a great job for 99.9% of people","review":"I am a guy who is really into gadgets and gizmos. I also appreciate quality electronics and good value. This receiver is probably the best value you will find although I wish it had a few more HDMI inputs. Everything else does exactly as it says it does.OK, here is a comment of 0.1% of people out there, the amp in this - while adequate - has trouble producing midrange and there is the slightest interference from the transformer. You will have to really be an audiophile to notice any of this - and then probably only with fairly high end speakers. I only noticed it with headphones.Oh, and don't forget that this thing is HUGE. Make sure to measure twice, order once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Onkyo 605 Popping","review":"I was also cheated by Onkyo to find out that the 605 is a terrible receiver.

(I have not tested its HDMI capabilities though.) But it exhibits a problem that I have not read about in any reviews. The problem is that after it is on for a time (say, approximately 30 minutes) at a volume level of 40, or so, it shuts down (and the standby light continually flashes) when the volume is changed by at least 2 increments, increase or decrease. This occurs even without any wires (speakers and other component) connected to it. I have talked to Onkyo technical service a couple of times. Their diagnosis was that its protection circuitry was malfunctioning. They recommended that I take/send it back to the dealer that I bought it from for exchange, or refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"satisfied","review":"After reading other reviews of this product I decided to buy it in hopes of being satisfied with it's performance. I should have been more skeptical. I spent five hours setting this receiver up. The \\"Audessey\\" set-up didn't work after several tries. So I gave up and manually set up the speakers. After one week the receiver started picking up the infrared signal from my cable box remote. Every time I changed a TV channel the surround mode on the receiver changed too. What the heck!! Needless to say, It's back in the box on it's way back to the store.Updated:After sending the first receiver back for issues described above, it turns out the cable box was the culprit, not the receiver.Actually, the receiver has been a solid performer since I bought it.

At just over half it kept shutting down into protect mode. It was not even getting a chance to overheat. It was sitting on the floor out in the open and it couldn't keep up.

The setup is OK but Yamaha is much easier and user friendly. Bottom line is sound is good, the features are useless using HDMI. That's why we went to HDMI isn't it ? 1 cord for A&V.

My Onkyo was on standby, and even on standby, you could literally have fried an egg on this thing. I'm assuming that it has protection circuitry that cuts the unit off in the even of overheating, but as hot as it was, it would have to be melting the metal to hit this limit. I was also concerned with teh Blu-ray player that I had on the next shelf up, as the shelf itself was scorching.I now just unplug the unit when not in use, but I think that I'm going to be replacing with a much cooler Denon.

Depending on the age group, the teacher/parent might have to explain what a \\"merchant\\" is (a salesman), and what a \\"thug\\" is (bad guy). Other than that, it is a very easy story to read.This book works well in both a religious setting (to teach a bible story) and in a secular/non-Christian setting (to teach about compassion and helping others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dvorak never think of an Animal named Internet","review":"Just think off an expert that proudly claimed as speculative fortune teller who knows a little bit about DOS and Edlin, then after talking alot of the future of computing but never mention one word about the Internet.

It is very detailed, with abbreviations for series and exclusive series, and states how the publisher gets the listings, and the publisher's history. The changes in styles and variations of the plush pieces over the years, fun facts, \`rumors', and interesting tidbits, are described. There is a Paw Notes section at the end of the book that has information on particular pieces. The main \`text' of the book, of course, is listings of decoys, bears, and critters. Each listing has a clear, colorful picture with name, ID/number, size/height, retirement year if retired, if it is not retired, states \`current', and value/price. It also mentions specifics like \`old face' etc. An avid collector may be all too familiar with specific characteristics, but this book is extremely helpful to the newcomer to get familiarize with the plush animals in great detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited","review":"From the information I thought there would be a few other types of bears in the book for comparison but the book was very limited.

Though the octet of tales from other authors besides Ms. Kurtz comes from Deryni Archives: the Magazine, they retain their excitement and offer proof to how robust the mythos remains. Ms. Kurtz provides an engaging new story to add to the overall strength of the collection. DERYNI TALES is clearly for long time friends who have already fallen under the charm of the series. New readers are better suited to start with the novels for fuller understanding though this collection provides a well written taste of Deryni.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deryni Tales from the Deryni Archives","review":"A fine collection of some of the best offerings from the Deryni Fan community. These tales, originally published in the Magazine _Deryni Archives_, have now been polished and re-worked into a fine fan anthology. Ms. Kurtz also presents a new short tale of her own in this volume.Among this collection are some wonderful tales from author's I sincerely hope to see in print again soon. Lohr Miller's _Lover to Shadows_, a piece about Charissa's private life, is worth the price alone. Frankly I cannot praise this piece too highly.Arilan the Talmud Student, addresses the subject of Jews in Gwynedd. A thought provoking and well written tale.I could go on and on, but simply put there is not a tale in this volume not worth reading.

The hero also needlessly withholds information from the police that would assist in their investigations. None of his cooperation would cross the line on client confidentially.

Buy it, you'll be glad that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Lightweight Folding Stool","review":"I had been searching for the perfect lightweight folding step-stool with broad steps for some time until an occupational therapist recommended this one to me.One of the best features about this stool is that the top step is broad enough to sit upon, and I use this tool to do tasks such as reach the back of my pantry or clean out my refrigerator so I can work at the same level of the shelf. This saves my back, as I don't strain it by bending over and then stretching too far without support.This stool is sturdy with a high weight capacity and very, very lightweight, and that makes it very easy to tuck it away in a corner when you are finished using it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy little stool","review":"I purchased this stool to help me get in and out of our boat.

And in each case these were single step stools!I did what I usually do and searched through Amazon and checked the comments on several stools I thought might be the tool I needed.I chose this one based mostly upon the positive feedback by Amazon customers.I am very satisfied. This stool is very light and is easy to take to whatever location I need to use it at. It is very stable and at my weight this is a very valid condideraiton.

I think I will go back to Hitachi nail gun or maybe try Max nail guns.Follow up on this review after still having a problem with the trigger I took it once more and to my suprise Dewalt gave me a brand new gun. (Dewalt, you're O.K.) They took the old gun back, that I used almost every day for two years, for evaluation to improve their guns in the future. It's been about six mounths and this gun seems to be working well. My only complaint now is that the six position depth is not a fine enough adjustment for the perfect depth; one doesn't set them deep enough, the other is too deep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not a Hitachi","review":"I have used this gun for almost two years.

Lots of misfires, double shots, shooting out of the bottom of the gun etc. Lots of time wasted clearing jambs.

Taking a good look at the references shows one of the problems - many of the references are from newspapers and magazines, not journals or analytical works.

The language and style threw me at first, until I settled in to this slightly-educated community where just going to work was a matter of life and death. I am partial to stories about coal-mining towns because my beloved step-mother's father helped found the coal-miner's unions in America in the early 1900s.

Of course, he really has a heart of gold, which is brought out by the beautiful young widow who comes from a family of gold. This is a Harlequin without the label.There is a good mine rescue sequence that, unfortunately is offset by a horrendous courtroom scene.

This was one of two books I purchased.This wasn't a good to use to get started learning AutoCAD but may come of use in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story, and it is true, and good soundtrack","review":"I found the story very worthwhile telling and the soundtrack, being music of the 60's, was a pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Darker than anticipated","review":"Bought for, and watched with, my \\"I love all things Irish\\" girlfriend. We both concluded the picture was fairly dark, amusing at times, and utimately unsatisfying as the director manipulates the viewer with the surprise ending. The interconnected storyline was very contrived, good guys (Colin Meaney) as nasty as the bad (Colin Farrell.) If its clever enough one can watch a movie mostly about losers but this film simply wasn't that clever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, historical, earnest and heart-felt...","review":"\\"Made in Dagenham\\" received good buzz from critics and award committes alike, but I wasn't sure if I'd be watching another chick-flick. Rest assured, there's enough guy involvement to make this a generally pleasing true story about equal rights. The delightful Sally Hawkins is on hand to provide a strong and centered heroine, and the always reliable Miranda Richardson scores as hard-as-nails Barbara Castle.There will be comparisons to \\"Norma Rae\\", but this film isn't as character driven; rather, the ensemble excels as a whole to provide insight as well as strong entertainment.I enjoyed it more than expected; glad I saw it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packable tool kit for your Vrod","review":"I ordered this after a friend turned up with a kit for his Beemer that I liked and thought a smart idea. The tool kit is specific to a VRod in having metric and english tools. All tools appear to be of reasonable quality and should last for their intended use as a backup set (this is not a mechanics grade kit but the tools are quaranteed for life and better then the normal cheap quality tools out there). These tools are smaller then full size but just right for packing. I am adding a Leatherman to round out this kit but it seems otherwise complete and at ~$50 it beats pulling tools out of my regular tool box to take with me.I haven't had a chance to use them yet and hope to keep it that way but a must have for longer trips.My Two Cents!-Scott"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent scanner for my purpose","review":"This is a very good scanner. I have not used the film attatchment and probably will not ever, but it is a good attatchment for someone needing to scan film. It is very good for small spaces and does a good job on photo scanning. The software is not good and I have gone to other scanning software. The price is right and the scanner is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only trouble.","review":"Got this scanner lured by slim design and good price. I bought it over year ago - well it didn't work on my previous laptop - usb did not provide enough power to make it work.Then I got new computer - this time power is o.k, but drivers from provided software was defective, so it took me a lot of work to find online working one.So then finally I did try to scan and guess what - I can not scan anything as it fail to calibrate itself every time.It is piece of junk! I waisted my money ( as I kept it too long to be returned in hope it will work on newest laptop) and time.Look for something else, forget Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"LiDE 500F Scanner","review":"For slightly over $100, this is a great little scanner. The ease of operation is outstanding. I bought it for my office, but it spends equal amounts of time on everyone else's desk. One push button for PDF is quick and easy. The stand allows a very small 'footprint' on a otherwise crowded desk. I'd buy another in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for your film negatives!","review":"If you are planning to scan film strips (it does not even work with mounted slides) this is certanly NOT the scanner. It crops the image and you will expend the rest of your life moving the back light one frame per scan."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for the price","review":"a great scanner. well designed, small enough, and only around a $100. the buttons on the front are even usable. so many times the buttons on the front of these things bring up unusable software that leads you down a badly designed automated path. these buttons are customizable and make the scanner easy to use. scans are perfectly acceptable. (i haven't done any real tests on how good they are)usb powered is great. one less thing to plug into the wall is a good thing.my only complaint is that it is not very speedy.otherwise, i completely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you can get one of these, do it","review":"too bad it's end of sales, as this does meet all the postive reviews posted here. was looking for a scanner for general home use and photo scanning... the reviews for the newer versions seemed to be not as glowing as those for the 500F. Got a chance to get a refurbed unit and it's great. the photoshop editing software doesn't have the interface that one expects from Mac software, but functionality is very good. One cable for usb/power is very nice, and the combination buttons on the front (scan&mail) are convenient. all in all, this continues to be a greate little desktop scanner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scanner For Beige Mac G3 Running OS X 10.2.8","review":"I have an older Mac Mini Tower and I recently purchased this scanner and couldn't be happier. First, it arrived within two days using the Free Shipping, maybe due to X-Mas season. Second, there were zero issues installing the software and I didn't even upgrade because everything runs perfectly. I've put this scanner through most it's paces except for the scanning slides and the OCR, I am completely satisfied with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!!","review":"Twice on the web page for this item it states that you CAN backup 'slides'. You CANNOT!!! It only does flat 'film' strips/negatives.We will be regretably returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a bit of a let down","review":"Scans photographs OK, but there are blurry areas on other images, around the edges. I've been using scanners for many years, was tempted by the slim design...just didn't work out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for photos","review":"I tried 2 of these-- both made horrible lines through my photos. I wouldn't recommend it if that's what you want to scan. It's ok for b&w documents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cosa Exhaust on my 2007 Cadillac CTS-V","review":"I researched exhausts for months. Price wasn't the first choice. I wanted the best for my use and dollar. I work with steels every day and know 304 stainless is the best. It does not rust like 400 stainless steel that other brands use. I always say, you get what you pay for! Warranty as long as I own the car!!!!Received the system before the promised delivery date, and the packaging was great. No damage. Instructions were easy to follow, and a lift is advised to install. Took about an hour with 3 of us working on it.Now for the exhaust. Highway speeds, no drone and as quiet as my old stock system. No turning up the radio. My wife is just amazed how quiet it is because we travel expressways all the time. The shock is when you step hard on the gas and go through the gears. I had a smile from ear to ear! I couldn't believe it is the same exhaust. It just roars!!! I couldn't be more pleased with this exhaust because it does exactly what Corsa said it will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't read if you don't have to, and if you do, get out of i","review":"This book is no help and it should be stricken from the shelves, it is filled with mindless filler fro way too many pages.

It may not be as cool or high speed as a custom or name brand holster, it was made for the pistol by the pistol's company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"You get what you pay for. Flimsy and rubbery plastic. Deforms easily, Does not ride high enough for my tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"retention too tight","review":"Like another reviewer said, the retention is way too tight. The gun should easily snap out of the holster. When I try to pull the gun out, it hikes up my entire belt and pants! Definitely going to look for a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Range Holster","review":"Got this holster in the other day for my Gen 4 Glock 19. Brought it out to the range last night and it works great. Its a little tight right now, my friend that has one said it will loosen up some with time and still have good retention. Great deal for the money and worth getting if you want something to use at the range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain Holster","review":"This holster might look like it was just bargain basement but it is, infact, a superby thought out accessory. The biggest complaint of the holster is the wings that hold it to your body. When you get the holster just get out the heat gun and carefully mold the holster to your body shape. The result is having one of the best holsters you can imagine for your Glock at an excellent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed !","review":"Before I bought this, so called, holster, all the reviews were positive except one. Well the one negative reviewer was correct in his evaluation. Plenty of Re-tension... but the weapon can not be drawn without two hands. Also, there is no way to break-in this holster. Take your $15.00 and apply it to a better holster... don't make the same mistake that I made."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:x,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},M=["disabled"],C={key:0},N={key:1};function W(a,e,n,u,s,r){const c=y("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(o(!0),i(w,null,f(r.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:s.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[s.isLoading?(o(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",C,"See more"))],8,M)):b("",!0)])}const R=d(O,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-cfac457b"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/18.md","filePath":"quotes/18.md"}'),H={name:"quotes/18.md"},G=Object.assign(H,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(R)]))}});export{L as __pageData,G as default};
