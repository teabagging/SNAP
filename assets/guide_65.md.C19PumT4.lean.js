With the exception of Okinawa.\\" If so, what is with bunraku, kabuki, even ainu etc.? (You can argue here, what the author considers 'world music' (see foreword)) Furthermore, the recommendations for recordings seem to be not up to date.Sorry, for being a bit picky, but the two stars is for a general good and helpful concept, but this book lacks - as I said - here and there precise informations and a non-centristic attitude in writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas in Rome","review":"The production and performances and music is wonderful.

Other than that, you cannot believe how bad this film is. If you can view Liquid Bridge as a comedy, it's actually pretty good. Hey, I watched the whole thing! It's got more plot twists and turns than a grinder at Rincon. Pretty radical stuff. The lead character and his development is so unbelievable, again, gotta go for the comedy eyes. Some really beautiful surf photography though, I must admit.

I purchased Surf Riders before the game was released hoping that the game's developers had taken notes and studied Tony Hawk's Pro Skater. I was under the belief that gaming technology had reached a level that could positively portray the sport of surfing. I was wrong. This game disgraces the sport of surfing and is riding \\"Pro Skaters\\" coat-tails all the way to the bank.If Ubi Soft employs any real surfers I'm sure their heads are hung low in shame. But, based on how horrible the game is, I doubt there was a single surfer that helped with the developement of this game. If there were, I have only one question;How dare you?"},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok, nothing special","review":"this game is ok. its fun for like the first 2 or 3 days that you have it. once you learn the moves and bust some flip-spin tricks off the lip a few times the novelty wears off. the contest are tough and long and get kind of boring. i donno about how close to real surfing it comes, but the game play could use work and the view its kind of strange. all and all its cool but not worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"surf's up...NOT","review":"The ONLY reason that I gave this game two (2) stars is because it's the only one i've seen...after all, surfing is a tough sport to transcribe from the ocean to the video game console.Plain and simple: This game stinks. The game isn't worth borrowing, renting or even loading onto one's playstation.Just a few of the game's shortcomings include:1. Poor graphics 2. Rider difficult to control 3. Unrealistic scenarios 4. Rider can only go one direction (frontside, regular foot)So many other sports have been well-represented as games on the Playstation that are similar to surfing (such as snowboarding and skateboarding). I hope that the next time someone attempts to put out a surfing game, he puts forth a much greater effort.It doesn't give me pleasure to be so critical but I'd rather give someone the 411 than to have him piss away his hard earned money."},{"rating":"2","title":"book","review":"I love this book.

This book shows one way that this core works itself out in practical terms--through what the authors call religious vegetarianism.

To Mr. Sandford, I'd say: Let him go. Let Lucas go. He's tired.While I do appreciate the \\"Gods Down the Hall\\" name, there's little else I liked about the book. Something I especially disliked was Lucas' wife' name: Weather. What in the hell?! The stupidest name in fiction, maybe? Maybe there's some story about her name in a previous Prey, but jeez louise. Doesn't the author have an editor to kill some of these ill-conceived ideas?I've accidentally read this book twice. The first time, I got a kick out of the 100 best rock songs thing.

I didn't finish it. It was far too violent for me. Violent to the point of being sick. I like a good murder mystery as much as the next guy, but Sandford's criminals are too over the top for me. Even the attempts at levity that are mentioned in one of the editorial reviews weren't enough to lessen the horror for me. I actually threw the book out to be sure my kids didn't get their hands on it. The two stars given were for being a renowed author and for continuing to have books published. I'm not critical of Sandford's ability to write, I just don't care for his content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of the Prey series","review":"What Sandford did to one of my all time fiction heros, Lucas Davenport, is shameful. Lucas was frantic, running around like a chicken with its head off. Lucas getting along with everyone, a nice guy, no conflict with anyone (except the final Craislike shoot-out at the end). Unusual for Sandford, much too much gratutious sex and violence described in graphic form.

This author knows how to grab his readers and drag them along on a frantic hunt for a monster. You're right there speeding across a farm field during a midnight car chase. You can see yourself running blindly through hospital corridors seeking a mad man before he kills again.

Davenport is on the hunt for a serial killer and many clues have him focused on Charlie Pope, a mentally unstable and rather dimwitted criminal. Davenport, however, suspects that the execution of these crimes could not have been carried out by Pope alone because he's not smart enough to do so. Take caution. This is an extremely violent novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master of His Game","review":"After reading formulaic authors like James Patterson, John Sandord blows them away! He is by far one of the better authors in this genre!! His character is fleshed out and real and he doesn't use cliche driven dialogue (see above). I love Lucas Davenport!

Somebody is killing in the style of three different serial killers, all who are locked away, safe from society. But someone knows their methods of killing, knows things the police have not told the public. Brrr, is all I have to say about this book. Scary and good. I also liked the fact that Mr. Sandford made Davenport seem very much more human with his goal of finding just the right top 100 songs of rock and roll for his iPod. I love my iPod and was glad to see Mr. Sandford include one in his latest thriller, it is such a hot product and this is such a hot book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This latest in the Lucas Davenport series is the best to date! (&I;'ve read them all) The focus was on the main characters & the crimes committed, with few sidebars. Of course, I enoyed the \\"Best Songs of the Rock Era\\" sidebar, & NO BEATLES! I may go out & but an iPod now.Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Contrived, Too Long","review":"This book is about 200 pages longer than it needed to be. Much of it contains drawn out and completely unrelated and irrelevantnarrations.The story line is formulaic and predictable. Even the \\"exciting\\" scenes are trite and unmoving.Eventually, I just started skimming pages anxious to get this dreary read over with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distinguished looking gentleman gone to waste","review":"I am appalled not only about the story but also that a distinguished looking gentleman with white hair wrote this gruesome tale in a language dripping with profanities, teeming with the craziest, bloodthirsty sexcrazed scum of humanity in a plot where police-officers are inept fools and the scum maneuvers them around with \\"brilliance\\". This author is definitely off my list of things to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Hidden Prey","review":"After \\"Hidden Prey\\" I was kind of prey-ed out, didn't think it was one of his best (and I've read them all). The author's at the top of his game in \\"Broken Prey\\", can't wait for next year's installment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah. Um. Mmm.","review":"Broken Prey is just filler in an a series that's usually more engaging than this. Lucas Davenport goes bossing everyone around and doing whatever he wants in the course of his investigation into some brutal murders in Minnesota. The writing is barely passable, and the dialogue is sophomoric and punctuated with gems like \\"Ah\\" \\"Um\\" and Hmmm\\".There's no clever detective work, and Lucas grunts and swears for 380 pages until the killer's name finally turns up. It seems as though we learn in the first 30 pages or so that a nutter has to be stopped--but we blunder along for 300 pages basically learning nothing until Sandford decides to let Lucas find the key to the killer's identity.Folks, this is pretty junky stuff. I heartily recommend something (almost anything) else off your book list."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Sanford is the murder mystery master","review":"Sanford consistantly writes interesting and fresh murder mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent","review":"Perhaps I should have started the \\"Prey\\" series with the first volume, but this is where I began. And what a shock. Without going into plot specifics, as other reviewers have, I will say that the novel is one detailed gruesome scene after another. Gruesome scenes can be effective when used sparingly, for effect, but in this case the number is mind numbing. Did the writer think that violence and gore were the only hooks to keep the reader's attention? One must assume so.The plot, I might add, is improbable. In fiction, criminals are a too, too clever lot, but penitentiaries and hospitals for the criminally insane are filled with people with below average intelligence. The perp here is only silly.The other characters are a little better. The atmosphere, Minnesota in summer, could be anywhere. That's unfortunate, because a realistic locale is essential in fiction. There was nothing to mark it in place, only in time.If this is an accurate sample of the \\"Prey\\" series, I'll skip the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Lucas Davenport Winner!","review":"Lucas Davenport is once again on the trail of another vicious and twisted serial killer. And John Sandford once again makes it a fascinating tale, despite his usual serial killer formula. The story is full of red herrings, misdirection, and an over-the-top amount of blood and gore. Nevertheless, I couldn't put it down until the last page. Fortunately, Lucas' wife and kids are out of the country, leaving Lucas free to risk his life once again. The Davenport series suffers when Lucas is too domesticated! Bonus: Lucas' list of the top 100 rock songs of all time; and a very complete list it is!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great one","review":"Thought the book was great and it had alot of twists and turns enough to make it well worth reading. I have to give John two thumbs up for the thought he had to put into it. It will keep you guessing till the end. The ending was really great and I enjoy the prey novels because you never know whats going to happen next. Pure genious Mr. Sandford, keep them comming can't wait to see what you have in store for us next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying this!","review":"I bought some of these for my 4th grade classroom because Scholastic had them on sale for $1 each. I wanted to use them for a literature study group. Wish I had read the book first... it was that bad! Instead of a plot, it has the stream-of-consciousness rambling thoughts of a Jr. High girl-- ranting that comes across as negative, self-centered, and irresponsible. I was reading it with a group of girls, but we didn't finish because it seemed such a waste of our time. The books are now in the recycle bin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good practice of basic number concepts..","review":"This is a pretty neat game. I bought it for one of my students that is having difficulty counting. It really does not have the student count. Instead, it tells them to place seven tails on the bug or eight eyes... Some children can count but cannot relate the counting to a concept. This game gives them the opportunity to grasp the concept! It is a simple but effective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small Diehls","review":"This is the loveliest product yet. Not only is it a terrific mosisturizer but smells fantastic.

It is especially useful in assisting the gay visitor who is interested in linking up with Vietnamese guys, in both Saigon (Ho Chi Minh City) and Hanoi. The volume is patterned after the style of the famous \\"Men of Thailand\\" guide.Inevitably, as in all such guidebooks, some of the specifics, such as gay-friendly bars or cafes, are no longer accurate by the time the ink dries. Nevertheless, this has much valuable practical information, and is written from the perspective of a genuine friend of the Vietnamese."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"This book constantly compares itself to MEN OF THAILAND, but it is a pale shadow of that outstanding work. Thompson's book is long on fantasy accounts of his amorous adventures and short on information about gay sites - even being coy and saying he can't reveal some because friends want to keep the secrets to themselves! His attempts to introduce Vietnamese culture are weak at best, with none of the finesse of MoT. Internet sites give far more information and with greater clarity. Bummer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"IBM Top Page not ready for primetime!","review":"As a user of Frontpage I decided to try Top Page and see how it did.

If you've seen movie you know exactly what you are getting. Some excellent music is compiled here, all of which appeared in the movie.The DVD, however, is a very big let down. A very poorly animated short cartoon clip. Actually it looks more like Flash animation than actual normally done animated material.

What a mistake. It's completely superficial and not at all imaginative. The characters are one-dimensional and not particularly admirable. There's a great deal of time spent on poorly written sexual encounters. The book is not at all believable. There are far better romantic time travel books. For instance, Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must have had a time deadline!","review":"I enjoy Nora Roberts' books very much. I was totally disappointed in this one. She took what should have been a l0 page plot and tried to develop a novel. I felt as if someone were standing over her saying \\"get a book out at any cost--forget creativity and variety.\\" Then, to add insult to injury, she starts a second portion of the book having the protagonist's brother go through the exact same plot, barely varying even the dialogue. The only interesting thing that happened was the initial alien landing and the parents' visit. We knew that the aliens would fall in love with the sisters--but that part of the plot was developed with constant, boring repetition. I hope her next book is more in line with her previous books. Her time travel books and usually very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"An oldie but a goodie","review":"Although this was originally two books published by Roberts years ago, she hit another home run by combining them.

I could not even rate it as a good beach book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?!","review":"I should have listened to my gut instinct and passd on this one. It's not a bad or boring read, it's just that when I read a book I want to read something that keeps me really entertained I'm afraid this didn't do it for me. I'm a big fan of hers, but she blew it with this one. It's as if she didn't put her heart in it. Clearly not her best work. If you have a limited budget for books, you may want to save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time and Again","review":"This book shouldn't even receive one star. The plot could be told in about 10 pages. Ms. Roberts fills in the other 495 pages with a rehash of how the two brothers from the future fell in love with, and made love to, two 20th century sisters. If you do read it, be sure to have a bookmark handy; otherwise if you happen to miss a few pages, you won't realize it, as it repetitively goes over and over seemingly the same love scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ranks Above All the Rest","review":"I have just about all of Rev James Moores cd's.

There's hardly any need in the bland arrangements for more than competent amateurs. It certainly needs a singer and a rocket up the band.I am so puzzled by the five star reviews that I went back and switched on the CD.

The volume level changes abruptly every few seconds from adequate to absolutely inaudible, then back again, making it impossible to carry on a conversation. This happens at anytime of the day or night, so it unlikely that local cultural interference on the 900 MHz band is responsible. Both handsets behave in the same erratic way.Three emails of increasing intensity were sent to Uniden customer service, but they never replied.

No more Uniden for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"works fine for us","review":"This phone works fine for us. Glad I purchased the white color.

The battery life is terrible, both my batteries are going dead. Plus, if one of the phones go dead while talking it blanks out your phone line so you have to unplug the phone cord to the unit.

Turned up all of the way they are amazingly quiet.What a waste of money.I am so disapointed with this product.Shame on Uniden for ever producing anything that simply does not work.

Can't think of anything I'd change about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't beat the price","review":"I don't know what John M. Young from Texas is on about because these are great little phones. I've had next to no static with them, and the battery life is excellent. I've actually sat on the phone for 7+ hours and not been forced to switch to the second handset. Furthermore, I also found it rather useful that not only does this phone have caller ID, but the caller ID also works when recieving a call via call-waiting, which is highly uncommon. The memory dial and rocket dial are extremly helpful, especially when dialing long distance numbers that you don't often use. The range is great as I've walked half a block from my house and have only had a hint of interference. As an added bonus, they're light weight and it prevents them from becoming cumbersome during lengthy conversations. The only possible criticism I could possibly think of is that an answering machine is not included, but at 35 dollars who's complaining?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Also available in Dark Gray / Black","review":"Rated number 1 by \\" Consumer Reports\\", I gave these a try. The sound quality is outstanding and range is very good. There were a few little hisses when I ventured outdoors in front of our house and the backyard but nothing major. For $33 including shipping delivered to our door, It's a great deal. I found and purchased a dark Gray / Black version instead of the standard White found everywhere else. I wanted something darker than the White that would hide dirt a little more and found they do make a dark Gray version (DXI 986-2C) The last letter \\"C\\" for the Charcol color. Not mentioned is the LCD screen has a nice green backlight. The transfer feature to the second handset is very handy. You can put the second phone anywhere theres an outlet with no need for another phone line. Only the main base unit needs the phone line. To transfer you hit a button and the second phone rings and puts the first phone on hold until the other phone is picked up."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY POOR PERFORMANCE","review":"These are lovely little phones, but for us they have almost zero range and a tremendous amount of interference noise. Changing channels has no effect. No local reason, just a suburban home with no electical or industrial problems around.

One thing that annoyed me was that you can't have both phones on at the same time so that two people can speak from your home (this seems like it should be technically feasible). Worse, is that when a phone's battery dies, if the phone is on (i.e. you were speaking on it), it ties up the line for up to half an hour afterwards and disconnecting it doesn't help. This has been an issue for several glitches. But all this was worth living with until opne of the phones just died (and it wasn't the battery as I switched it out). That happened abround six months ago (I bought in May 2004) - so it has a life of two years. I am down to one phone and it has developed an annoying whining that seems to be random.

The soft, delicate sounds of music which were created to tell the magnificent story-line, realy capture the heart of this movie and make the characters alive once more.I enjoyed this CD very much and I would continue enjoying it at the future, whenever I require quiet piano melodys to get me through the day."},{"rating":"2","title":"This soundtrack is simply stunning.","review":"Cinema Paradiso is an incredible film that touches so many emotions. The soundtrack perfectly matches the film's emotional quality and is a joy to listen to; fondly recalling Toto's experiences with Alfredo.The quality of the recording is outstanding. One can hear every push of a key on a clarinet, saxophone and flute, as well as the breaths taken by the players. The vibraphone sounds simply incredible. On a high quality sound system, one will feel like he is in the concert hall with the musicians playing. The imaging of the instruments and soundstage depth are fantastic. Overall, a fantastic listening experience even if you have not seen the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another masterpiece!","review":"Already renowned for writing scores for a myriad of films that have earned much accolades in the film industry, Ennio Morricone yet exudes his brilliance with another beautifully mastered soundtrack. Like his earlier works from 'The Mission' and 'Once a Upon a Time in America' to name the least, Morricone possesses the subtlety to juxtapose the scenes in the movie with the themes played. The end result:audiences are left empathising with characters in the movie and overwhelmed with emotions. Like the movie, which is a must-watch, so is the soundtrack...a must-buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brilliant musical overcoat for a once-in-a-lifetime film","review":"The musical score for the film Cinema Paradiso is the surgeon's stiletto.

You cannot escape it's haunting beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO MAESTRO!!!","review":"Ennio Morricone touches everyone's soul with this beautiful music he composed to go with the masterpiece of Italian director, Giuseppe Tornatore, Cinema Paradiso.The music goes with the story perfectly as a result of the scheme Tornatore and Morricone follow with the soundtracks to Tornatore's movies: the composer becomes involved very early in the process, almost as the script is being taken into the screenplay process, so as to make the music of the movie an integral component of it. And Cinema Paradiso is no exception to this: you can almost follow the story throughout the soundtrack... The love, the sadness, the desperation. It's one of those musical pieces that will last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cinema Paradiso is Not Paradiso for All","review":"I adore the music of Ennio Morricone in any shape or form. I prefer his more emotional soundtracks like \\"The Good,The Bad, and The Ugly\\" and \\"The Mission.\\" This CD has its moments but not enough to suit my tastes. I've never seen this film but knowing Morricone and his mastery of musical emotionality I don't believe this movie would have been my cup of tea. It is still Morricone the Maestro of the movie soundtrack just a little weak in spots for me. For a audio delight buy the Ennio Morricone Anthology a truly great listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"diogenes","review":"This is the kind of book the authorities use to torture people, by reading it to them, with the promise they will stop reading if the listener cooperates.You hope it will get better.

I live way out in the country and the advice he gives for security in the country is laughable. \\"Make sure your farm buildings are well-lit\\". What difference would that make?

First the good. The translation is very good, nothing like the feminist NABRE. The Bible also feels good in your hand (leather edition) though it is not the best quality leather. What I do not like and what I don't understand is why they would make the color of the pages yellowish. Have you ever noticed the color pages turn when a book is really old? That is the color of these pages yet it is brand new. Very strange. The print is kind of on the small side but readable. I was also hoping for more study notes and cross references. I would not classify this as a Study Bible at all. If the pages were white and not yellow I would say this would make for a great reading/devotional Bible, but they are yellow so I don't know.

The leather edition has anti-glare pages which is amazing for reducing eye strain while reading for any extended amount of time. Something that I also love is how thick the pages are. You don't feel like they are going to tear in between your fingers and the print does not bleed through from the other side. My qualifications to comment on the translation itself would be marginal at best. The RSV has always been known to be a solid translation and has given birth to this translation and the highly revered ESV translation. Combine that with such a solid build and you have an awesome Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Value!","review":"This Bible is an excellent translation.

It was not until I read this book that I understood that simply trying harder, studying more, or researching deeper, would NOT improve my trading. And if fact, for reasons made obvious in this book, these pursuits can actually be detrimental.However, I really think that an appreciation for this book can not be fully realized until a trader has been knocked around a bit - much like most teenagers can't be \\"told\\".

But the powerful psychology at work when one trades can make or break a trader's success. This book should be read and re-read as it contains incredibly valuable insight into our own psychological forces at work that may well be hindering consistent or increased success. Yes you need a decent system to trade with but, the psychological traps that are all too easy to fall into can spell financial/emotional disaster and continue to make success elusive.

Pavarotti is great nothwithstanding his acting abilities. His singing is the tops.

Her singing and acting are absolutely riveting. Milnes is great - the voice seems to have started it's downturn at this point - a bit of struggling in the passagio, but it's not too noticeable.

I can't remember one thing I actually liked about this movie and that's sad. Needless to say, I would say you should rent this movie first, but I don't recommend buying it if you haven't already seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time!","review":"If I could give this movie a negative rating I would. This was absolutely horrible. I really want to sue the director and writer of this movie because I wasted 2 hours of my life that I can never get back again. I loved Bring it on, and this is nothing like it. I think they were confused when they wrote the script. It started out being about a troubled teen girl and ended up being a commentary on the scoring in gymnastics. What? I think next time they need to let someone read the script that is over the age of 15 to make sure that there is actually a plot present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome Stranger","review":"I loved this movie.

I fell for the movie \\"winnie the pooh's most grand adventure\\" right away. But, the end title song by Vonda Shepard and Barry Coffing is so beautiful. I've tried to find it and here I am. Listen to it. It's great. But I don't say the other songs are bad. They're great too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been An Essay","review":"This book must have been a struggle to write because it just does not contain enough interesting information to warrant it being book length. Yes, music is transformative and restorative in so many ways. We use songs as anchors to motivate and inspire us. Our musical memories are associative and connect us to so many events inn our lives. And iPods are great little devices that have become pop culture icons. This is probably the reason this book will sell some copies. I think it could have been a powerfully insightful essay, concise and poignant. As a book, it fluff. Boring, dull, poorly written fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for iPod fans","review":"Like the author, I'm a big fan of iTunes and iPod because they both have rekindled my love for my music. Though the author and I have different tastes in music, I appreciate how he shares his love of music and the ways it has influenced his life. Jones is a lover of all forms of music, collecting more albums and CDs that most of us will do in a lifetime. In between these chapters about his own life, he chronicles the evolution of the iPod and how Steve Jobs and Apple have used it to bring about a real revolution in the music industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for the Beginner","review":"I found this book originally when I was just starting out on my journey to being pagan. I found it informative especially at the time I was in my teens. It helped me at the time quite a bit, however even back then I thought the book was a bit fluffy. While it is informative to a point, the real meat of the book is only about twenty pages or so. It is still worth getting when all said and done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very repetitive, boring: More for pagans.","review":"This book is okay. First of all, it repeats the same things over and over and over. It could probably have been written in less than 50 pages. This book also seems to lean more toward paganism instead of offering general informtion. It talks A LOT about psychic vampires, elementals, voo-doo type stuff, and to be frank: the book was something I would find in a discount bin at a book store. I wouldn't recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly what I expected...","review":"It began really nice and that is why I purchased the book. But after I finished it, I was somewhat disappointed. Other than the 'tower of light' method, the underlying message I got was: Occultism is not a bad thing. The 'real' occultists are actually good people and do not mess with 'bad' magic.Thus, the title of the book is somewhat misleading... Robert Bruce's book on the same subject is far better than this one and to the point. But I have to say the 'tower of light' technique was a valuable thing out of the whole book (that is, for me--and I am no occultist, but just someone curious about the subject and would like to learn more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I am glad I purchased this on the recommendation of a friend.

Not only is it performed by a master of his craft, it is the 10th birthday celebration release of the finest club in the north of England. BacktoBasics has now been a Leeds institution for almost 12 years, and will always be my first choice for a smooth, funky, deep, sexy house vibe. Danny Tenaglia fits the Basics mould like he made it himself. The mix mastery of this double collection is simply breathtaking. All mix CDs promise to take us on a journey over a period of time, but none has quite delivered that promise in comparison to this selection of tunes. Danny takes us from smooth and mellow vocal house, with the superb Do It Now and those delectable bongos teasing us into something more tribal, then on to funky, then onto deeper and more twisted rythyms and vocals. Cass' 'Fever Rising' never fails to chill me with its insistent beat and spectral electronic noise. Then onwards and more sexy, until the final, shivery climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome bag","review":"This camera bag is really great. Really the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because it's actually a little TOO big. I can fit my digital camera AND my video camera (and it's not even one of those new tiny ones) and still have plenty of room for extra bags and cards and cords, etc. It's really great for toting it all, but if you are trying to go with the bare essentials, this is certainly not the bag for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ordinary quality bag with enough space for all your photo & video equipments","review":"This bag has enough space for still, video camera, a small compact tripod, power charging cords and all other cords, mini DVs.

But I didn't. The pacing was all wrong, with what turned out to be a very thin story almost lost amongst all the extraneous detail. Every time something happened there was a flashback, a flashforward, a lapse into poetry, a lecture on history, a reflection on the nature of women, and a lament for what Spain has become. There's scene-setting, and then there's too much information, and this book definitely has the latter. The odd shifts between first-person narration and third-person storytelling did not help, either.Hopefully the next books in this series have more likeable characters and more exciting action with better pacing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Not Much","review":"Captain Alatriste is the first in a series and, like a lot of series, you're really rooting for it to be a barnburner so you can go right out and buy the next one and then wait breathlessly for the one after that. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Captain Alatriste. The problem is that there isn't enough of Captain Alatriste in Captain Alatriste. It's told through his own Sancho Panza, Inigo, his steady sidekick, who has stories of his own to tell. But those stories only distract from the main story, which is paper thin to begin with. Throw in a lot of songs and poems and you've got a sleepy reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something Wrong Happened Here","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really tried to like it. Perhaps it was the translation. Whatever, I found many of the sentences needlessly wordy or downright clunky in construction. This awkwardness just got in the way. Then add the story itself. Nothing wrong with the basic plot, but it took too long to unfold, focussing on unneeded dialogue. The choice of narrator, though interesting, presented problems. I mean, how could this teenage boy possibly know some of the things that occurred to Alatriste? Overall, I don't think this book lives up to all the hype the critics have given it. It'll probably fade from memory fast enough. Meanwhile, I will continue to prowl the bookstore aisles for a return to swashbucklers that can entertain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"I like swashbuckling, and honor, and political intrigue, and all of that stuff. Sadly, this book lacks all of these.Alatriste is inconsistent -- a mercenary one moment, a hero the next. None of the political intrigue gels into anything interesting -- things happen, and we don't care why.The novel felt like the backstory for some larger work.

The characters are emblematic. The quest it introduces is fundamental. Where does it go wrong? Too much wordplay and character interaction unrelated to the story, and a story that wanders and makes no firm conclusion; it's too simple and too directionless. The character \\"Captain Alatriste\\" would be excellent fodder for future serials, but the complexity contained in this book (outside of wordplay, author asides, etc) is that of a dime comic book and no more. Lengthy poetic excerpts, scene-setting conversations, and rambling motion between places fail to enhance tension or tell a good story. As far as conceptualization goes, it's an A+, but as a read, the book is more like a C- or D."},{"rating":"1","title":"half baked","review":"This review pertains to the unabridged audiobook version of Captain Alatriste.I was pretty disappointed with the book itself, and with the audio performance. The story has some exciting moments, but in the long run not that much happens, and what does happens is dragged out far too long. At the conclusion, I felt like someone who has just watched an episode of an hour long drama on television, one that was merely okay, and which I wouldn't be going out of my way to watch the next time it was broadcast.The audio presentation was very melodramatic, nearly to the point of self-parody. It lacked the proper rise and fall of tension and release. Instead, the narrator read nearly every scene, every paragraph, with an overblown sense of import. It was irritating and tiresome, but I did manage to endure it to the very end, so I guess that is worth two stars at least, reserving 1 star typically for something so bad it isn't worth finishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Thinker's Novel.","review":"This was the first of Arturo Perez-Reverte's books that I have read. It so impressed me that, within the last 30 days, I have read all but one of the rest that are translated into English. Perez-Reverte rights a tight historical novel. He uses intelectual quotes and historical people to give the flavor of the times. His Captain Alatriste is not your typical hero, rather, he is a world weary veteran of Spain's interminable wars of the period. He is a hired sword with a conscience. I recommend this novel to anyone who likes historical novels that cause you to think."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a snoozer than a swashbuckler","review":"This was a difficult book to get excited about. While I think Perez-Reverte sets the scene of religious/political 17th century Madrid quite nicely and does a good job weaving in historical and fictional threads, the other elements of the book are so unremarkable that the novel isn't able to hold itself together. The characters and plot are stock choices, either the translation or the writing itself is clunky and stumbling, and the narrator is interfering and inconsistant. I understand this is the first in a five book series, which explains away some of the dangling incompleteness (nothing at all happens with two of the \\"nemesis\\" characters), but I think a finer writer (or editor, perhaps?) could have shaped this novel into a more suitable stand alone volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"PURE GOLD","review":"Man THE ELEMENTS NEVER FAIL ME!I just wish more artists young and old stay true to who they are and what they stand for!

Of course I love \\"Pure Gold\\" and \\"Show Me The Way\\", but I think the big hit on the CD will be the dance tune \\"This is How I Feel\\" or the balad \\"To You\\". Instrumental \\"Liberation\\" is in a class with the great EWF instumentals of the past, and the Outkast remake of \\"The Way You Move\\" is the perfect driving song.

There are 9 songs, 6 of which are ballads. In my opinion, the album would have been stronger without the uptempo songs. Those songs include \\"Splish Splash\\" (one of the weaker songs), \\"I Ain't Gonna Cry Tonight\\" and the smash disco hit \\"No More Tears (Enough is Enough)\\" with Donna Summer. The duet is a great song but it seems out of place on here. The songs have an aquatic theme, all about water in some form, so it is a concept album. The ballads are nice and Barbra sounds beautiful.

It is very cheaply made and a very poor trimmer. It may be fine if you like a short goatee but anything more and its just not going to cut it. Even after going over my short beard again and again it kept missing hairs over and over. It just does not lift and cut all the hairs evenly.As for the base its about as cheap as they come and wont hold the trimmer very securely and I also had a hard time getting the power cord to stay attached to the trimmer. It is very loose and wants to fall out with the slightest touch. I would but this in a $15 trimmer category and for goatees only.

The multi height attachment is poorly designed. With a curved head design depending on what angle you hold it at, it will cut different lengths! Despite all this, the trimmer it self pulls at your hair. I couldn't get through one trimming of my goatee with out it painfully pulling my hair over five times in two minutes. I sent it back.

I charge it for another night, making sure I am doing it exactly right. Nothing at all the next morning. of course I can't find my receipt, but will probably mail back the package to Wahl and try to get a new one as it says it has a 5 year warranty.

The Mavuki the witch smeller) tells her that she has to marry and old diseased guy with three wives. If she doesn't, her village will be cursed.

I was so eager to read this book, but it really started out TERRIBLE! It dragged on forever! The stupidest thing about this book was the glossary of African words.

The plot was interesting, but there is way too many details and people in the storyline that the basic story is lost in the confusion.

The book really demonstrates how someone can be very brave in a time of danger. It is about a girl, named Nhamo whose mother has died and father had left without a trace. She lives in Mozambique, a country in Africa just north west of Zimbabwe. All is well in her village until people start dieing from a disease unknown to the village. That is were the adventure begins.In this book you will see a young girl who goes on a great adventure and encounters African religion at it's greatest. You will learn as much as you would in a research book, about the African culture, with the excitement of a really good novel.Nancy Farmer, the author, did a great job using African culture in a great adventure and providing plenty of interesting detail. I would recommend the book for ages nine through twelve or any one that can follow it. So join Nhamo in a great African adventure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite book","review":"Not my favorite book. This was not one of my favorite books because I am not a big fan of girl against nature stories. Nhamo spent so much time traveling and going around the island when she could have spent that time with her grandmother. Once she was on her own, everything was about her survival and her struggles for food and shelter, against the animals, and finding her way. To me, it would have been a much more interesting story if we got to see her struggles against her cruel husband, his other wives and her mean aunt. I would have liked to see her stay and care for her grandmother and spend time with her while she was near the end of her life. Her struggles and the struggels of her parents and family were so sad even though she survived and came out on top. However, there is a lot of suspense, danger, action and a girl's fight for independence, survival and her family. If this appeals to you, then you will probably love the book. It just wasn't my type, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nhamo's Story","review":"Nhamo's story in the book, A GIRL NAMED DISASTER, is not a typical young girl's story. For example, how many girls do you know without a mother, without a father, and with family who either is not aware of her existence or hates her? Not many. In this book you are taken on a journey with Nhamo as she battles against life's hardships and finds where she really belongs.

In fact it is a Newberry Award Winner. It lets you travel to Africa without leaving home. The book is about a secret murder and a forced marriage, causing a young girl to flee to Zimbabwe. What should have been a short trip turns into a long journey with many challenges. By using the spirits of her elders the young girl finds her way.

This book was kind of adventurous, but I found it pretty boring. The book contained many Indian words and that made it hard to follow. The book was a typical survival story, with finding food, shelter, and facing problems like broken canoes and wild animals. This book was meant to be suspenseful, but it did not keep me on edge. The book was filled with spirits that the main character was constantly talking to, so this made the story confusing. There was a death in the book that really disappointed me and I did not think it was necessary. The end of the book did not satisfy me and I did not like it at all. I would not recommend this book to people if they want an adventure book because it was not very exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON1T WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK","review":"I disagree with the authors opinion on trying to teach us native language because it made it hard to read and very confusing.First of all, through out the book Nahomo's grandma had three names in the African language, which made it very difficult to understand. Second of all, there were some words which weren't in the book1s translator so I had to find a dictionary to look them up. Which was quite a hassle. Third of all, she (the author) made her sentence1s very confusing.

It was completely non-interesting, and it dragged on forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow-moving","review":"A girl's book -- boys likely would not relate to the very female nature of this book. Nhamo (whose name means Disaster) lives in the African country of Mozambique in the early 1980s. The native religion and customs of the time will be strange to a youth reader today. Because the spirits tell her family that she is the cause of a cholera epidemic, they send her to be the fourth wife of a cruel man in another town. She runs away, and much of the book consists of her adventures on a boat and on islands in Lake Cabora Bassa.Some of the adventures were a girl-in-jungle version of My Side of the Mountain, but Nhamo's constant communication with various spirits of her religion make the adventure a bit peculiar much of the time. Nhamo also becomes a woman during this voyage, which could make male readers uncomfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Homeplace","review":"Great story but very poorly written.

Then slight sexual tension when Grif decides he likes Anna after all. There was virtually no sex until the end of the novel.Throw in a family heirloom and a English cousin bound to uncover Grif's secrets and ruin him and you have a shallow, one-demensional novel. This book ran about 100 pages too long.However, the witty dialogue saves this from a 1 star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long dragged out bore","review":"At first this book really grabbed my attention. I was looking forward to reading it and Grif was, and is still, a great character.Sadly, this book dragged on far too long for me. Highlander in Disguise is 374 pages. I gave up reading around page 300 when Grif and Anna were still NOT together. Over 300 pages of nothing isn't worth another 74. I can take a guess at what happens anyway. They finally get together. Finally. It is not even worth finishing if it is only 74 pages after a 300 page wait. Even if it's page 301 where they finally get together- too late. Don't care. They get together, kiss, blah blah blah. Not worth it anymore. I don't even care if they got the 'bloody beastie' or not.I also felt as if Grif deserved a heroine more mature and less shelfish than Anna. She got on my nerves quite a bit.If you like a book to ruin your expectations and make you go from wonderment to disappointment, then be my guest and read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tail Gunner","review":"An excellent account, modestly written, by a very brave man.

Thank you for this fantastic book.Michael Duncan,Pastor and AuthorStarting Out: A Study Guide for New Believers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting rid of pretences and distractions","review":"This is a well written book. It has as its basic theorem the idea that many Christians do not fully get what Jesus Christ is really all about. Or they live saying they believe but live life as if Jesus is not a real presence in their lives.This book is excellent at skewering all the \\"I'm a Christian...but\\" arguments that many Christians make. Groeschel gently and clearly describes several problems believers encounter and then shows how to get through them. He argues well from clear examples and relevant scripture.This book will help Christians to challenge their understanding of their beliefs, and hopefully to deepen them.I can recommend it to Christians who struggle to fully grasp how much their faith could and should impact on their lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Take on the Variety of Christians","review":"I grabbed this text from my Christian bookstore hoping for an exciting read.

While I appreciate the author's attempt, he should not quit his day job.What I mean by that is although he made some good points about how a Christian can be living as an atheist, this book did nothing for me.The book has a tone more catered to a younger audience (High school or college students).Also, the paragraph structure is disorganized and jumps from one topic to another.I would not reccommend this book to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I loved this book.

I was headed towards this direction. It is moving how God used this book to renew my love and faith in Him. My only gripe is the over- and misuse of the term Christian Atheist -- mainly because a lot of the circumstances made me visualize an agnostic instead of an atheist.

Fortunately for me, the book was not what I expected. Groesche introduces a theme that seems to have plagued modern America...Christian Atheism.

Pastor Groeschel outlines the simple truth that we all fall short of the mark God sets for us and yet we are all equally loved by our Creator. He offers his own personal stories of failure as examples to help the reader unpack their baggage of self-disappointment and get busy accepting God's love and acceptance.

Well, I think blink was trying to put together real punk bands to make fans of punk become more turned on to radio-friendly pop packaged as punk thereby giving them a couple million bucks to go buy Hurleys clothing for their MCA loving poser selves. Besides, it's not one Alk3's shining stars on here, Midtown could do better, same for The Used. Finch is about the only band that shows what they've got on here. This album annoys me and so does Atticus trying to make people think that punk rock is a trendy style. Go take the 5 bucks you were going to spend on this and go get \\"All Hallows Eve\\" EP by AFI.

Name Taken rocks and Alkaline Trio is always good... but I think the best song on the CD is Finch's \\"Post Script.\\" They are a phenomenal band. The only track I don't like on this entire CD is Jimmy Eat World but it's okay because it's the last track and I can just shut it off when it gets to that point.

They usually look at the toys for a few seconds and walk away. But THIS catnip toy is THE favorite of all of them every year. In fact, since we \\"wrap\\" their gift every year (okay .. have me committed) and put it under the tree a week or so before Christmas, it is fun to watch and see how long it will stay under the tree. They usually get it and start chewing the wrapped package a few hours after we put it there.I don't know what it is about the \\"Cosmic Country Catnip,\\" but unlike other catnip I've ever bought, this stuff is potent.

The newer edition w/the CD is better for taking the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"quite okay","review":"This book is quite interesting but compared to the others which are realistic, I feel Tintin has a lot of narrow escapes and strangely escapes unhurt in every one of those which are not too realistic. The time he escaped from a sealed off cave through the passage of oil is too lucky and doesn't happen often, considering that Tintin stories are almost believable. Herge's reason for the stoppage of the train that almost killed Tintin, was a very remote one. I still cannot understand how Snowy could talk to Tintin in the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Tintin's weakest book","review":"Tintin's third album, originally published in 1931, is probable the weakest in the series. The young reporter goes to an America that looks like the standard Amerika of the European left: set in Chicago and the American West, the country is a commercialized hell populated by gangsters (whose leader is Al Capone himself, the only time a real person appeared in the whole series), greedy capitalists, uncultured rednecks and exploited redskins. As in the early albums, Tintin seems to escape from sure death at almost every page. Still, for those who accuse early Tintin books of being extremely right wing, it's interesting to see in page 29 how the expropriation of Indian lands for the exploration of oil is denounced. Also, in page 41 there is a very amusing satire of proto - radical environmentalism, as an old lady that is a member of an animal protection organization protests a mountain lion attacking a deer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Copy of the Book","review":"The problems with this version of this great Tintin story are numerous. For one, this copy is in black and white, and while that isn't that bad in itself, compared to other, color, editions, the black and white looks flat. The binding on this book feels very, very flimsy and I'm not sure the book would last many readings. The contents, the end papers, and the covers all feel like they were printed on low quality paper, so this book feels rather cheap.Positive aspects of this edition is that it is quite large, so it's suitable for readers who need larger words and pictures. Further, the book is extremely affordable for a such large version of this book.There are, however, much better editions available, so skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think this CD was really great!

The book takes the reader through basic concepts in a de-mystifying way, providing the intuition that got lost in the mathematics when I took statistics in college. The book strikes an excellent balance between substance and simplicity in going through the basic ideas and the math behind them, providing a role model for first explanations of substantive topics. It's nice to read a book that sticks to its task of helping the reader understand a subject broadly and thoroughly without the author seeming to be trying to impress the reader with how much he or she knows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The Figure looks nothing like the picture!!

It is filled with excellent photograghs of many of the main players of it's time, i.e., Pancho Villa, Emiliano Zapata, Madero, to name a few. The author writes with a seemingly accurate grasp for the times, pointing out military strategy and blunders as well as impenetrable guerilla tactics. Comparisons are made between the Revolution of 1910 and W.W. II with regards to fire power and its carnage. A must for anyone with the interest"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terse, Yet Thoughtful Scientific Explanation For Religion","review":"I inadvertently picked up a copy at a local library, intrigued by its premise. The authors must be commended for their plausible hypothesis accounting for mankind's religious faith. They show through neurological research - including theirs - why religious devotion has an important impact on human physiology. And then they describe, in convincing detail, how human neurology has given mankind the capacity to conceive and to embrace religious faith. Admittedly, I was highly skeptical when I started reading this book, but now I believe the authors have a plausible hypothesis worthy of investigation by both neurologists and religious scholars."},{"rating":"1","title":"more about philosophy than science","review":"I expected a book about \\"brain science\\" to be, well, scientific. I would categorize Newberg, D'Aquili, and Rause's book as philosophic, or perhaps mystic, but certainly not scientific. While the book contains some description of their method and findings, the description is so vague that the reader is given no understanding of how \\"brain science\\" can foster such voluminous speculation that pervades this book. That said, I was intrigued by the philosophy and the speculation about the origins of mysticism and its relationship to ritual and religion. And, if I wasn't so disappointed by the books title, I might have given it a slightly better rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great introduction into neurotheology and neuropsychiatry.","review":"The book starts out very well. The author uses logic and clear terms to explain everything. But then he starts making stupid assumptions left and right. Newberg explains mystical experiences and the \\"feeling of the presence of God\\" and then says that they're just as real as eating an apple pie because they can be examined in the brain. That's like saying that my conversation with God while I'm on coke is just as real as eating an apple pie because you can see the neural processes in my brain. In short he says that because it feels as real as eating an apple pie it IS as real as eating an apple pie.But don't misunderstand me; the book is a great introduction into the field. Just don't base your beliefs on everything this book says."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ground-breaking","review":"Here's one you don't see too often -- a scientific study of spirituality that attempts to explain the phenomenon WITHOUT also attempting to debunk it! The authors explain the neurological changes in the brain that occur with religious/spiritual experiences. In a sense, God is \\"all in our heads.\\" However, the authors also emphasize that that does not make God any less real because everything we experience is all in our heads. The authors also demonstrate that our experience of knowing God is hardwired into the brain. This book doesn't answer all questions about spirituality (what book does?!), but it's a good place to start."},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word...Boring...","review":"Unfortunately, this neuroscientist has no penchant for philosophical discourse and so his treatise was bland, pendantic, convoluted, poorly organized and inconsistent in its ideology.

The views presented in this book are uncritically developed, not nearly as supported by evidence as the authors seem to think, and nearly ruined by a strong theological agenda on the part of the authors. This book will please neither scientists, nor believers, nor atheists."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD science!","review":"The book deserves to be trashed because it is an example of \\"applied\\" science, i.e. the authors are Believers and are using science to support their beliefs. We live in a democracy so they have the right to write the book, but I certainly hope their fellow scientists shun them for the misuse of scientific resources (supplies and money). To think my tax dollars may have helped them to twist the purpose of scientific inquiry to prove God exists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why this book won't go away","review":"This book takes too long to get to the point. While I disagree with the book's substance, I would rate the substance at least 2 stars. But the verbose rambling style could not keep my attention, so I just skimmed this book. The style is like New Age writing, which I can't tolerate. This book could easily be shortened into a pleasant magazine article.But this book won't go away. Why? Because it tries to synthesize science and religion, and this has great appeal to many people. Critical reasoning makes clear that science and religion are incompatible. Anyone who truly understands either science or a religion will reject the final conclusions of this book. But the majority of readers who understand neither will find this book provocative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left open for logical attack, Read SB 1 or God by Maddox","review":"This author got started on the wrong premise and built on that, being worship is not real. Even from a evolutionary standpoint worship is a scientific part of our evolution in that our ancestors created god mentally hundreds of thousands of years past by simple belief in a creator or provider. If you support evolution then what is incorporated in us from evolution is real. Coming from a creationists point of view: If evolution is not real, then worship is very real (especially if God exists). This book is also way to short for this subject and really not much to comment on. leaves you a bit shy in general.Karl Mark Maddox takes a much more real and scientific premise on both stances which is highly supported in a surprising paperback I have to recommend, titled SB 1 or God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, wasted time.","review":"The author cites the evolutionary and empirical evidence of modern day science and presents a convincing picture for justification of God, then completely deviates from reason and fact and concludes that science is a type of mythology - that we know nothing.It was a boring read but I hoped for a climatic or at least informative ending...neither manifested."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pseudo-Science of God...","review":"Here I thought I was about to venture into pure, unadulterated scientific discovery only to find myself once again faced with another example of pseudo-scientific pablum.

Quote: \\"The neurobilogical roots of spritual transcendence show that Absolute Unitary Being is a plausable, even probable possibility\\". This writing would rate an \\"f\\" in any 7th grade science class.The writers further demonstrate their ignorance and perhaps even contempt for science with this statement: \\"Science therefore is mythological, and like all mythological systems of belief, it is based on a fundamental assumption: All that is real can be verified by scientific measurement, therefore, what can't be verified by science isn't really real\\".This book really is worthless, useless.

It attempts to use science to prove the existence of god. It reminds me of the archaic belief of Descartes that the soul intersects the brain at the pinneal gland in the brain.

This is not science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insipid","review":"It would be ok if the author decided to offer a scientific understanding of spirituality, but he vacillates throughout saying God is neuroscience and then that God is more than that.

They offer interesting speculations concerning the evolutionary origins of this neurological basis and explore their hypotheses in the areas of myth-making, rituals, and the origins of religion. Although the authors concede that they have not reached a proof of God's existence, they conclude by arguing that their neurobiological evidence makes it just as rational to believe in the existence of God as it is to believe in the existence of the material world. Why God Won't Go Away is recommended for anyone with an interest in the scientific study of religious experience but will disappoint the educated reader who seeks a cogently argued explanation for why God won't go away."},{"rating":"1","title":"unreliable as hell, hindsight would never buy a combo unit","review":"I've had so many problems with this model that it's embarassing. it was incredibly difficult getting it to use a USB adapter (even according to cust. support), and the clock kept on drifting off so that in 2 months time it was so inaccurate you missed half a 30min sitcom recording (needed to repeat hard reset until it \\"caught' the right time). once this trick didn't work i returned it for repair, with the refurbished replacement unit not even booting up. i sent that one back too, and just now got a message from toshiba that the unit i sent needs to be replaced as well, and offered me a credit.I'm genuinely embarrassed at the time i've spent on this. the ONLY reason i'm spending time writing this is that i'm on hold...to get my refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"After getting used to the product and the operations, I think it is great.

His voice is neither beautiful, nor very powerful, and unlike that of Andreas Scholl, it lacks projection, and careful control. On top of all this he has a unpleasnt wobbly vibrato. What is all the fuss about, he is so clearly neither as good as any of todays great countertenors - Michael Chance, Andreas Scholl, James Bowman, Robin Blaze or Charles Brett."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not great","review":"It's possible that David Daniels will prove to be something of a mayfly. His voice heard live in 1995 and 1996 was quite extraordinary; effortless, powerful and perfect, quite lacking the countertenorish 'edge' which had always been assumed to be a necessary evil to that voice. In other words, he didn't sound like a countertenor. Unfortunately however his voice, while still excellent, has now become slightly rougher, nowhere near as thrilling. The sad fact is that there were no recordings made to my knowledge before 1997, when this roughening had already started, EXCEPT for the video, available only in the UK and only on UK TV format, of the Glyndebourne production of Theodora in which he sang Didymus so astonishingly beautifully it nearly defies belief. Buy the Handel CD and enjoy it, but don't believe that it really represents an extraordinary countertenor at the height of his powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally blissful . . .","review":"One never tires of the freshness of Opera . . . it is always new. Daniel exudes the vibrance of a true lover . . . he embraces his work and his failings with as much gusto as his successes. You will hear a new turn of each phrase every time you listen to this CD. It's almost as if the CD rewrites itself every time you listen to it. So nice to have some (very small) inkling of what our forebears were able to experience as they sat basking in awe of the only true prima donnas in history, the castrati."},{"rating":"2","title":"An overwhelming performance.","review":"Musicians of this caliber are few. Add to that this unique, powerful voice. The ability to hear these works as they were written - with the heft of a true countertenor - is amazing. This is a rare and exceptional CD. I'm looking forward to his Met debut in Guilio Cesare on April 10!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A countertenor I can enjoy!","review":"This is a new musical world for me! Prior to Asawa and Daniles, I could not appreciate this voice style at all. The Met's recent \\"megahit\\", Handel's \\"Giuilo Cesare\\" was an eye opener for me this past season. To me Daniel's voice is smooth, rich, agile and sensitively used. I can give no other praise and appreciative words than to say he makes Handel's music accessible to me. Now I know what the fuss is about. I own the recording and I am not a devotee of Baroque music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Purchase","review":"Last year, we bought a similar hat from Babies-R-Us for our then 2 month old.

As soon as it arrived I raced home and stuck it in my Cd Player. The Requiem for Evita was very good and extremely eerie. then as I got further into it, I started laughing. This has to be the most horendous piece of music ever. I just love how the orchestra looses it's place a few times and runs over the actors'voices. And the wort part of this CD is that there is ony one track. You cannot skip over the songs. After an hour, it began to feel like the chinese water torture. how embarrasing for the actors playing these tremendous roles. Thank God that Eva, Che and Juan are dead because this terrible farce of an opera would kill them. I just want to know who Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice let this go on? Don't they keep track of how their plays are performed.Ick Ick Ick....Argentina is crying all right...and so am I - for my money back!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is only good for the laughs.","review":"I bought this CD because I thought it would be interesting to hear the score of my favorite musical in another language. First of all, apparently digital technology in Korea is way behind. The entire contents of both discs are contained on a single track. So if you want to listen to \\"Buenos Aires\\", for instance, you have to fast forward all the way to it or just listen to all that precedes it. The music has a bit of an Asian feel to it, which is interesting, but the orchestra is horrible. They obviously recorded the whole thing in one take, because you can hear hideous mistakes, most notably toward the end of the dance interlude of \\"Buenos Aires\\". The first time I brought the CD home and listened to it, I laughed the whole way through it. On a positive note, most of the singers (with the grave exception of the chorus) were pretty good. However, the translation often didn't fit the meter of the music.

The book would be a kind of book for a person who likes girl books or books about how it was like to be a little girl growing up. I think that the book also started out with a bad beginning.

The beginning of the book was some what boring. But in the end it got really exciting. I like the way she used a mixture of characters, their, feelings,actions, and religions. The people in this story were real enough for me to imagine and that is terrific. Frankly this book wasn't all to aweful.

It was a great book in a way because it delt with racism and how some people couldn't deal with a black family being in their all-white community. Even though I thing it was good in that way I also some what believe it was very boring and not very interesting for fids our age. The book also shows how people overcome some things that are happening and make friends with a black family and at the end helping them because they realize that in the beginning they were wrong.

I don't like to read about books that have something to do with racism. The book \\"Words By Heart,\\" starts out very boring. A girl named Lena is at a spelling Bee and it goes on about that and it becomes even more boring then befor. If this book was to have some action in it then it would be a lot better and maybe more people would like it then what they do now.

There could have been some form of fighting or something. The book was back in the black haters days so wheres the rioting and stuff.

If you dig this kind of music then by all means by those instead. ITMOM may well begin with some of the best electric guitar sounds ever, but the CD is not worth buying. A shame really, because Carpenter is a truly gifted musician."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very atmospheric musical score","review":"This is a very well done musical score by John Carpenter & Jim Lang. Of course, director John Carpenter has been known to create excellent music to go with his movies like Halloween, The Fog and Escape From New York and he continues to impress with the score to his Lovecraft-inspired tale In The Mouth Of Madness. The opening title track and Trent Makes the Map (track #6) are particular favorites of mine as they really touch on the mood of the film, which essentially begins as a detective story, but soon becomes a tale of supernatural horror. This is one of the CDs in my collection that I make sure I have in my car whenever I'm going on a long drive. It's great when you want the mood that day to be a bit spooky and atmospheric.

Sets don't exist, the stage is barren except for leaves on the floor and a chair or table; however, one can concentrate on the singers without distraction. Dimitri is gorgeous, elegant, and oh, so aloof. Renee is lovely, yet vulnerable. Ramon is a poet, sensitive yet quick to anger. I would appreciate sets that suggest Russia of the time, costumes that reflect the culture, and a truly grand Polonaise. None of this was in the Met's mix this time, but one can't have everything even though it is always permissible to dream. A good all-around choice.Amazon had it, sent it, and I'm enjoying every minute and sharing it with potential audiences here in the Los Angeles area to whom I present talks on the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Tchaikovsky Performance","review":"I had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Hvorostovsky in this lead role with the Lyric Opera of Chicago this season. However, nothing would have topped the experience of seeing this live production of Eugene Onegin by the Metropolitan Opera. This production had a solid lead cast along with one of the best Tchaikovsky conductors out there. Hvorostovsky and Fleming have great chemistry on stage. The last tweleve minutes of the opera alone are worth the purchase of this dual disc. You really get wrapped up in the experience. Vargas brings tears to your eyes with his rendition of Lenski's Aria. If you're a fan of Tchaikovsky, beautiful music and a great story line, you'll love this opera. The bonus footage is a huge plus as well. I loved the orchestra rehearsal footage with Maestro Gergiev and the late great Beverly Sills interview backstage with Hvorostovsky and Fleming. This would be a great addition to any opera fans collection.

Now and then an absolutely insipid movie, suchas this one, has a few good songs in it - but the music usedhere is as noisome as everything else.Perhaps there are men and women somewhere who slatherto have sex day and evening, and for whom brief periodsof celibacy might be arduous, but can this be enough ofa challenge to be worth an actor's time - a producer'sinvestment - or an audience's interest?

From what I had already seen and heard, I had already labelled it as an absolute atrocity! Well, in that respect, I certainly wasn't dissapointed!

Nothing great and I'm glad I paid only 3 bucks to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainless romp.","review":"40 Days and 40 Nights was the worst movie of 2002. I can't believe how many films Josh Hartnett is in, he is the dumbest actor of his generation, yuck! Shannyn Sossamon isn't much better either, I can see why she hasn't done a lot of work. The humor is childish and the plot is inane. Stay away from this turkey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross and Offensive","review":"If you are into gross and offensive humor than this is just the movie for you....if not, do yourself a favor and pass on it. Josh Hartnett is an attractive and talented actor....he should be embarassed by having starred in this trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BAD BAD","review":"This movie actually started out okay, and I thought that Josh Hartnett's character was sweet. I didn't think it was that funny at all, though, and once the friends make a bet that Josh's character can't last without any form of sex for the whole period of Lent it goes on a downward spiral from ok movie to very bad movie.Curious to see how it all ends and if he makes it, I stupidly keep watching. The ending is terrible! Let's just say I agree with the \\"spoiler\\" reviewer from Oxfordshire, England about what the ex-girlfriend does.I should've just watched Pearl Harbor again.

I didn't get it, sorry 1 star and not an inch more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but better then I expected","review":"Ok, I know that this movie will not go down as the best movie of anything, but we all know that. The reason why I love this film is because of the relationship between Josh And Shannyn. I like the story revalving around him finding a real women, letting go of his ex, and his struggle for redemption from pimping women. I think Josh did a great job showing how hard this vow of his was hitting him. You see when he's with Erica, hes really happy and isent in turmoil, but without her, you see him falling more and more. Not the best comedy, but pretty fair romantic story that makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pointless Sex/Romance Comedy","review":"The other day I was watching TBS and I saw this movie. The movie is just another pointless Sex/Comedy. It's like watching American Pie. This movie is about a guy who gives up sex for lint. POINTLESS. Josh Hardenent is a supar actor.

What little plot line there was is overshadowed by the sleazy goings on in the office etc. I was a Josh Hartnett fan but I can truly say I am going to be very leary about paying to see another one of his films. Josh, WHAT WERE YOU THINKING? I went with my 21 year old daughter and was horribly embarrassed and saddened that such a good actor would stoop to playing in such a horrid film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Movie.","review":"This is one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen. I can't believe that Josh agreed to do this film. I can't believe I paid so much money to see it. I can't believe I actually sat through the whole thing. Stay away from this one. It's not worth time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Sex for 40 Days and Nights!","review":"In an attempt to get over his ex-girlfriend. Josh Hartnett, swears off sex for 40 days and nights, not just sex but any form of foreplay all the way down to kissing. On his first Friday night, hiding in the laundry mat, he meets Shannyn Sossamon; and they begin to fall in love. Over the next week they grow closer and closer until Shannyn starts to notice his odd reluctance for sex.While Josh's relationship begins to fall apart, he becomes something of a spectacle as all his friends, enemies, and acquaintances begin to follow his 40 day marathon. There doesn't seem to be a woman in the city who isn't willing to have sex with him just to wreck his 40 days. The farther up the calendar the worse things get until Josh asks his friend to to handcuff him to the wall...It's an explosive, ridiculous, and surprisingly romantic comedy. I would recommend this to any team or young adult, being a great mixture of a chick-flick and a guy movie.movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need to know is...Shannyn Sossamon!","review":"OK, so this movie isn't quite Oscar worthy, but it has one major bonus that makes it worth watching...and watching...and watching...Shannyn Sossamon is a stone cold fox.And yeah, although some parts are lame (the premise, for example) parts are funny, and the acting is pretty good. Also, Maggie Gyllenhaal, who was a hottie in 'Stranger Than Fiction,' makes a cameo.And, did I mention Shannyn Sossamon is in it? Yowza."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"I been waiting for this movie to come out ever since December! And now that i watched it ... i will go watch it again!

Don't waste your money buying this title on Blu-ray. What a rip!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not so good","review":"this movie is stupid, why make a movies so dumb like this, oh well can't be perfect at everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surprisingly sophiscated sex comedy","review":"... The teenage ...-comedy genre has found success in recent years, and I thought 40 Days and 40 Nights would follow the trend. But I was pleasantly surprised to discover the ... jokes were for the most part not gross out funny, but were, in fact, almost sophisticated. ...It's a simple plot: Guy gives up sex for Lent, and deals with the daily temptations, especially when he meets a new girl. Soon everyone knows about the self-denial and starts placing bets when he'll cave-in.Despite its crude topic, this film becomes a touching romantic comedy, with Josh Hartnett dishing out one of his best performances. The music is well chosen and well timed, and the pacing works great.This isn't a life-changing film, but it, in my opinion, is the best ...-comedy out there. Worth checking out even if you don't like typical ... humor, you'll be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT RENT. DONT BUY. JUST BURN","review":"Save yourself the 90-120 minutes and do something else with your life. Read a book, write a poem... or realize there is nothing funny about being raped. Just do not under any circumstances watch this film. It is a waste of perfectly good light and I believe it should never be encouraged.Remember that they will stop making bad movies if we dont watch them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Some people might like it. Some might not. What I think, in my own opinion, is that it's pretty funny and usually, celibacy isn't really for the faint of heart. It's great that they tried to put two and two together and sometimes it seems like it's a little inappropriate, but then again, its an R rated movie so nothing really inappropriate. I liked how they had made love with out REALLY making love. That was cute. Overall, it was a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Streaming issues","review":"Loved the movie but had problems with the streaming. The movie kept starting and stoping on me was very frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rape!","review":"What an awful movie. It had an interesting premise that I was eager to enjoy; however the plot was terrible, the characters unlikable, and the rape was ridiculous. Who the hell makes a movie with such horrible people and expects people to like it? The best friend was trash and I was hoping somebody would actually be on Matt's side in all this but no, even Erica the girl he liked was a bitch to him. In the end the movie was just a crude excuse to make sex jokes and went over the top with the rape of the hero who is too stupid to even know he's been violated. What piece of trash! Did I mention there is a rape?"},{"rating":"1","title":"So preposterous, I couldn't finish watching it.","review":"An utterly atrocious film. Not only is the premise completely ludicrous, but the (literal) climax of the movie depicts the protagonist being raped -- raped! -- by his spiteful ex-girlfriend, who is awarded a sizable cash prize for her crime. The protagonist is then harangued by his volatile love interest for \\"cheating\\" and forced to apologize! And all of this is somehow supposed to be funny. What. The. Hell?! If the roles had been reversed -- if the rape and humiliation of a female protagonist had been portrayed as a comical misunderstanding -- 40 Days & 40 Nights would have been barred from theaters for trivializing sex crimes and poking fun at their victims. How can anyone find this kind of sexual double-standard acceptable, let alone entertaining?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Now granted this movie had some very funny parts in it, but the overall picture in my opinion was a giant letdown...To me a good picture has everything, good storyline, ending, etc., and while this movie did a wonderful job of getting you to root for the main character it loses a lot of fizzle at the end. When I got done watching the movie I was rather irritated with the ending (enough to write this review). So, in my opinion save the 2 hours of your time you would spend watching this movie and do something else, anything else. It would have to be better than this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross Movie","review":"If you are into gross humar or humar about sex then this movie is for you. I found this movie very weird and gross.Josh Hartnet and Shannyn Sossmen could have done a whole lot better acting jobs than the ones they gave in this movie and from a Knights Tale I expected more from her.If you want a good Josh Hartnet or Shannyn Sossmen film this is not it, you would be better off getting Pearl Harber or a Knights Tale. They are 100% better than this movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-joke movie","review":"Josh Harnett leads an ensemble cast in this finely nuanced exploration of sexual mores set against the spectacular urban scenery of San Francisco... Harnett gamely mugs through two hours of a single joke: What happens when you practice celibacy for 40 days. The answer is: Not much. The plot has to string this single joke out for an entire movie by predictable gags ... While the exterior shots of San Francisco are lovely, the interiors are some Hollywood designer's idea of what San Francisco looks like--not at all convincing.Anyone over 13 would find this movie sophomoric, and anyone less than 13 shouldn't watch it because of its \\"highly sexual themes\\" (although there's no nudity and as you would imagine, not much action.) Think \\"Week-end at Bernies\\" meets \\"American Pie\\" and you pretty much have the level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we give 0 stars?","review":"So boring I fell asleep!

I thought it looked hysterical in the trailer, but to my surprise it could be one of the worst movies of the year. The usually charming and intense actor Josh Hartnett is utterly embarrassing in this unfunny and uninteresting, dare I say, comedy. Slowly paced, rediculous dialogue and an annoying supporting cast make this film almost unbearable.Major fans of Josh Hartnett will probably love this film, and I have always been of fan of his, but he suffers miserably throughout the film. The only saving grace is the exquisite Shannyn Sossyman as the love interest, but even she can't rise above the cheesy plot. There also is a very sensual and romantic love scene involving a flower, but its about an hour and a half into the movie, and thats way to long for anything exciting to happen in any film. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Bad flick. It is such a degrading movie, I could puke. I am sick and tired of movies that degrade women! I am absolutely sick of it! Also, this movie is totally racist. The only colored person in the ENTIRE film is Erica, and the Laundry Lady, who is (of course) Asian.

This book was recommended to me by a friend. Last week I picked it up, and was reading it every chance I got. The story is captivating, it really grabs you.Not being a reader of Christian novels I was a little leary, worried it would be preachy. However, the style of writing has me hooked, and this author has a fan for life in me. Anyone who enjoys exciting works of fiction will enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and exciting","review":"I found this book exciting to read from page one until the very end. Aural, the main character, goes through many trials throughout the book. She can see angels and demons, which ends up putting her into a bit of hot water... especially when the demons decide to actually interact with the physical world in which we live in.This is an awesome Christian novel, but I wouldn't limit the interest people might have in this book to just the Christian genre. It is exciting enough for the average fiction reader as well... I would say this book would be enjoyed by people that say, enjoyed the Left Behind series.I'm really glad that I got my hands on this book, which happens to be my favorite at this time.

All this time, I thought I had a heart that was after God, until Dr. Bynum shared her story and I was able to relate to it. She reveals so much about herself and how some of us Christians have been tricked by the enemey to believe that we are pure of heart, when so much evil is hidden deeply in our minds and emotions. This book makes you question, \\"how saved are you?\\" This is a message that needs to be heard by the entire body of Christ. Not just young Saints, but everyone, including Prophets, Teachers and Pastors. We ALL need the new heart message. I'm giving this book to my entire family for Christmas, the saved and unsaved."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you aren't looking to change, don't read this book","review":"This message is definitely needed in this hour. So many people are being controlled by their own choice to go against God's ways and then give in their own fleshly desires and get caught up in strongholds. But what we really need to get up out of these is the new heart. This book had to be prayed over as it was being written, because I promise you it isn't an easy feed.

It is not overly ambitious in the scientific concepts it presents to readers who are at least aware of the current global warming discussion, and it remains respectful to the field of climate science.

Together they exhibit a humour which DOES belong in music, to which they owe their father, but they make it all their own with numbers like 'Doodledang' and 'Silver Lady Disco'.

I thought this presentation might help, but it provides very little.This video is very poorly done. Too much amateurish narration and not enough substantive information about documented evidence. No way of knowing where any of the very limited information comes from, so it's impossible to research. And the title is also misleading. I really didn't need the boring \\"sermon\\" on the need for me to perfect my spiritual self into a decent human being in relation to \\"the creator\\", whoever that is.This video provides some explanation for some of the \\"evidence\\" it portrays instead of allowing the informed viewer to think for him/herself.

And cannot find anywhere that Buddhism makes those claims of Buddha. Nor do they treat him as a god. Buddha isn't at all like how they describe in in this documentary. They do not claim he was born of a virgin, nor do they claim any of the other \\"Jesus like\\" things. So the lack of understanding of Buddhism really makes me doubt the similarities of other gods and Jesus. With the exception of Horus. As I have read many similarities between Jesus and Horus before watching this documentary. But even then they seemed to be misinformed. As I have read the Ra and Horus were two different gods. But they eventually joined together and became one. I think the documentary is good in that the Bible does take stories that were told before. But it seems to exaggerate on the amount and how similar Jesus was to other gods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facts from fiction","review":"Super DVD. Its a bit old but timeless in its content.

A single sentence of truth vanishes buckets of lies and this is a wonderful gift these men give to us.

It tells about the sixteen other crucified saviors before Jesus, and how the Christian myth was created by plagiarizing the beliefs of many ancient civilizations. The story goes on to explain how many of these old religions were based on the ancient worship of the sun as \\"the light of the world\\" and the giver of life; how the sun \\"dies\\" for 3 days at the winter solstice as it ceases it's movement southward in the sky, and then is \\"reborn\\" on December 25th as it begins to move north again. The connection between religion and the zodiac is also explained, such as Christians (who worship the sun of God) worshipping on Sun-day, while Hebrews worship on Satur-day (from the ancient Semetic worship of Saturn.)

If one is familiar with the subjects presented, one can also know that many of these myths have been refuted long ago. These same attacks have been made for thousands of years now, but the religions it claims to refute are still around strong as ever.It is a shame that people will beleive without question material like this, and assume it is accurate scholarship, and also not realize the authors may have an agenda in mind, i.e. to mask their religious bigotry and rationalize their rejection of religious truth.

This is very disappointing to me. I'm debating on sending these back but that's such a hassle.. The only way to see the battery level is to unplug the battery and plug it back in.

As might be expected, Coleman's sound on this disc is thus even rougher and tougher, streaked with a rock'n'roll edge. Joanna Connor adds her typical brand of raucous slide guitar on one cut.

For those unfamiliar with the band, think of the lyrical prowess of Dave Matthews combined with the wanderings of Phish, nicely balanced with a jazzy saxophone and heavy reggae undertones. This seemingly unwieldy combination comes off beautifully on this live album. One thing that particularly strikes me (I collect non-commercial live concerts from many bands, including O.A.R.) is this band's ability to shift tempo and mood so quickly and seamlessly.

Since then, I have seen O.A.R. every time they've come through the Washington, D.C. area, from their hometown of Rockville, Maryland (20 minutes north of me) to DAR Constitution Hall, to the Barns at Wolf Trap, and to the now semi-famous 9:30 Club downtown, where this album was recorded. I can say from personal experience that this album represents the TRUE O.A.R. - the O.A.R. that spent years touring college towns before ever putting out an album that, in my opinion, ruined the vocals completely.

Indeed, they seem to have run out of ideas, repeating some things from earlier episodes.But there is just a sense of fun. Most of the focus on this season is with the firemen, not the Hospital. So with the added time and emphasis, you get more about them. Including the captain's descent into paranoia about the new Fire Chief (which doesn't sound funny, but is hilarious in practice), to a episode where much of it is about the guys playing in a basketball game (again, amusingly, Chet turns out to be their secret weapon).It's probably not for people who aren't fans of the show, but if you ever loved this show, then this season is a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency Season Six.","review":"This is my least favorite season.

A+","review":"I've read many books concerning this same subject matter but there are few works that I consider to be as powerfull and insightfull as this one. In a very deft and concise manner Mr Swerdlow delineates the galactic history leading up to the colonization of Earth by numerous alien races and the eventual hegimony of the reptilians, what he calls the Draco, and their allies. This knowledge is based on his personal involvement with the shadow government experiments at Montauk and his Illuminati contacts. The only problem is that Mr. Swerdlow doesn't qualify some of his assertions, but since much of this information no doubt comes from Illuminati informants thre is no way to coroborate it. If you are someone who is intrigued as I am by this sort material and questions the seemingly-biased pablam we are fed by the mainstream media on a daily basis then this book is for you. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Which world to choose?","review":"The book itself is fascinating, and to a reader of both reptilian-oriented conspiracy works (Icke, etc.) and popularized books on theoretical physics, the implications here are enormous. Swerdlow begins with describing God-Mind, which can't really be put into any words that would make sense, so suffice to say that God-Mind allows and contains all, so that in some sense a popularized idea of many-worlds theory holds true and all possible experience comes to fruition, allowing God-Mind to experience itself. Why? Who knows. Why not! In this light I suppose any experience we label good/bad could be thought of as a gas bubble working its way out of the system. What a fart! Why are these reptilians doing this? Because it's one of many things that could happen, so it does. Why do we experience it? Same reason. Want to experience something else?

Much has already, of course, been written by this icon, but Kate (the book) is full of fresh and intimate looks at her life with more emphasis on her thoughts and memories than other more straightforward biographies. It becomes something of a cross between the introspection of a memoir blended with the fact-based details of a biography. Katherine Hepburn's own voice comes through clearly in the many quotes with which author Berg seasons his book.Wonderful. Highest recommendation for those who can't get enough about this very special woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good job of exploitation Mr Berg!!","review":"I came accross Scott Berg's book several years ago on the bargin table at Walmart. I should have left it there. Katharine Hepburn could not possibly be less than interesting, but I had to really work to finish this book. The book was more about the author and his agenda than the woman he called his friend. I found a man with a very big ego giving a less than flattering portrait of someone who he said was his friend. My impression of the author based on this book is that he was very good at exploiting his friend Katharine Hepburn. I hope I never have a friend like Scott Berg. Where I come from, friends protect and emphasize the positive qualities. For a loving look at Katherine Hepburn I would recommendAt Home with Kate: Growing up in Katharine Hepburn's HouseholdIt was written with love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I agree with the reviewers who have expressed feelings of disappointment. This book gives very little insight into the Katharine Hepburn, and too much insight into Scott Berg. I had hoped to learn some of what Katharine Hepburn thought and felt about so many things she experienced in her very full and interesting life. Not much of that is revealed here, and very little else is covered here that was not in Hepburn's autobiography \\"Me,\\" which I heartily recommend instead of this book. The author met Hepburn in her later, lonely years, and describes the deterioration of her body and mind in great detail. I doubt this is what Hepburn had in mind when she told him her story, and this is not what a true friend does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"If you want to read a biographical account of Mr. Berg's time with Ms. Hepburn as he learned of the facts of her life, buy this book.

I was extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Kate Remembered is more of the autobiography of interviewer A. Scott Berg than it is a biography of Katharine Hepburn. I get the impression that she gave him the run around in their so-called interviews and he didn't have enough to write a proper biography. Rather than strain himself with research he chose to write the book about his many travels to Hepburn's house and of course his glorious career as a writer and his life long love of the actress."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great star's biographer deserves no stars","review":"I read this book from cover to cover shocked that such an excellent writer could so suffuse himself into his work that he overshadows his subject, Katharine Hepburn. Unless you want to read about this author's contacts with the rich and famous, skip this book. The author has written his own bio. He obviously thinks that we will find his life more interesting than that of Miss Hepburn's. If ever he even thinks of writing another bio, he should make sure it is of someome whom he has never met. That way, he won't think he's so important."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"While this wasn't the detail-laded bio that one has come to expect from Mr. Berg, it was, in a sense, even better. Written as a friend rather than a researcher, Mr. Berg gives us some excellent insights into \\"Kate\\" The most touching part for me was at the end, when she is watching 9/11 take place on the television, commenting that it was a good thing they were in their Connecticut home. One wonders what she really made of this incident and how it affected her--at the time it happened, she was very near the end and didn't have the same sharpness and wit that she possessed most of her life. Perhaps that was for the best. How lucky Mr. Berg was to have shared what he did of her life. No, this book is not perfect and I've heard all the negative comments, but I'm thankful we have one more book on Katharine Hepburn to read. Thank you Mr. B."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful.","review":"A. Scott Berg is not only a wonderful writer, he knows how to write about people. His style is uncluttered, peeled to the truth, and elegant. Berg's unfawning approach to Hepburn is precisely the reason she welcomed his friendship: respectful but not overawed by her legend, admiring without pandering, and honest without being obnoxiously insistent, Hepburn star recognized that this was a person who would be straightforward in his approach to her. And that is what makes this gem of a book so appealing. Besides that, it is a beautifully played out account of a friendship that lasted until the end. Filled with marvelous anecdotes, telling observations and fascinating glimpses of Hepburn's inner world, this spellbinding book provides hours of sheer delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable read","review":"The criticism of Scott Berg as being narcissistic is unfair. Naturally, he'd insert himself into the book since it is after all, a memoir, and doesn't pretend to be anything else. The book is still most definitely about Katharine Hepburn and he leaves no doubt that he adored her and from his depiction, who wouldn't? He does the lady justice in every respect. She sounds absolutely delightful, with a terrific sense of humor, a great deal of warmth, generosity and intelligent as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"A. Scott Berg Remembered","review":"I purchased this book in the hope of getting some insight into Katharine Hepburn.

Highly recommended for anyone who is interested in the \\"Golden Age\\" of Hollywood."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I enjoyed this warm and respectful book detailing the author's friendship with Katharine Hepburn. It's the only book I've read about her so far, and I felt I received not only a satisfying glimpse of her personality but enough background to get a handle on the important moments of her career and private life (such as her relationships with Howard Hughes and Spencer Tracy). There were also fascinating glimpses of Michael Jackson (who has dinner with her, in one anecdote) and the monumentally egotistical Warren Beatty (who has the author convince her to appear in \\"Love Affair\\"). The only thing I found a bit strange about this book is that the author wrote a biography of an editor and mentions publishing and editing quite a bit - and this book has more than a few spelling and punctuation errors. I don't think it was a good idea to rush it to market. Otherwise, it's great. It was a refreshing and pleasant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"audio CD of \\"Kate Remembered\\"","review":"This is a beautiful and moving book.

Scott Berg has used Katharine Hepburn's unique life to relaunch himself and spread dirt using Miss Hepburn as his foil . I find Berg a gossip of the worst kind seeking the largest audience he can find. Most of the people trashed are dead and can't tell their side of the story. The others know that responding will only bring more attention to matters best left between the parties themselves.And all of it written in sheeps clothing as a \\"dear friend.\\" Save us all from friends like that. Shame on you, Mr. Berg."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a book about Kate-this Ain't It","review":"I found this book a self-aggrandizement of Mr. Berg rather than a revealing memoir about the Great Kate Hepburn. He does talk on and on about others he's known and speculates on why Spencer Tracy drank. Hepburn theoretically told him to write his spectulation down, hence it appears in this book. All in all, the Barbara Leaming book is 100x better and more interesting. Or for gossip about Kate as a friend, read Garson Kanin's Tracey and Hepburn. I really didn't need (nor do I think Hepburn really would've wanted us) to know how feeble she was in the last 10 years, with her memory gone, being depressed and lonely, etc.Mr. Berg should've taken a year or so to think it over and reread this which he supposedly really wrote in 1999 just waiting for 'the end'. She comes off well but he doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the photos?","review":"I've just leafed through \\"Kate Remembered\\" and I must admit that for a biography that was drawn from a 20 year friendship there are amazingly few photos that provide evidence for such a relationship, or indeed evidence of Kate's interactions with the world she lived in.Hopefully once I've read the text I'll be more impressed with what I was hoping would be a ground breaking biography."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star for Kate","review":"I had a running fascination with Katharine Hepburn from the time I was in boarding school, and wanted to be just like her. Scott Berg's appalling book reminds me of the girls in school whose pretense was soon uncovered. Using Hepburn as a vehicle for self promotion, Berg retells all the Hepburn stories that one has heard her tell in TV interviews or read previously. Preparing a manuscript and waiting for the subject's death to race it into print is clearly the work of a pretentious self-promoter. Read Hepburn herself. She is still in print. Or better still, watch her movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"This...is Katharine Hepburn? Not according to her Auto-bio","review":"Berg's book was well written, but wasn't a REAL biography-just an idiot wanting to brag of his \\"friendship\\" with such an amazing star. I feel that Berg knows next to nothing about Kate because he took all false facts from Leaming and Edwards-both authors THINK they are talking about the actress Katharine Hepburn, but really they aren't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Serving","review":"I give this book two stars because I am a fan of Katharine Hepburn. The only thing I learned in this book is that the author wanted to make sure everyone knew how much Ms. Hepburn adored him and how witty he was with her, and how much influence he had on her later on in life; and I found that kind of creepy. If you want to hear her voice without Berg's slant, just read \\"Me\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great memories","review":"Although the life of Katherine Hepburn has been chronicled elsewhere this is a charming book. It was written by one of close friends in the Autumn of her life and by someone who has produced great biographies of Maxwell Perkins, Goldwyn and Lindburgh.This book does not reveal anything really new about Hepburn. Most of this ground has been covered in numerous other biographies and in her Memoir. However, what Berg has done, because he interacted with her so frequnetly at times, is to give a real sense of what her personality was like. There is also a very funny story about what happened the night that Michael Jackson came to dinner. I think this is a wonderful addition to the books that Berg has already produced and look forward to reading his next effort, reportedly a life of Woodrow Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hype, too little substance","review":"As I read I kept hoping more substantive information and insight might become evident. Much had been told before through varied media and the redundancy detracted from the thoughtful insight I expected and never found. The first chapter was probably the most insightful of her idiosychrasies going downhill from there.A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not so much a biography as a diary of a friendship","review":"Mostly, \\"Kate Remembered\\" is Scott Berg's love letter to his mentor and friend. Hepburn shared her life with him through their decades-long friendship, yet made him promise that he would not release this memoir until after she had passed on.His recollections of their times spent together are moving, giving the world a unique look at a special lady we all long to know better and who we miss dearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Royalty Remembered: Kate Hepburn Speaks","review":"Oh, Mr. Berg, you have brought us closer to who Kate Hepburn was...as a friend, a lover, as a sister, wife, daughter, and actress. And, how different was the truth from the media stories...thank you. What you didn't warn me about, is what a truly funny woman she was...her one liners are fabulous. I couldn't put the book down..literally, until I had consumed her life through your eyes. Again, thank you. American doesn't have Kings and Queens (royalty, that it) but we certainly do put our Movie Stars on a gigantic, elevated throne from which we stare from afar, admire, and adulate. And occasionally rip apart in the tabloids. You have shown us what it was like for one of our Royalty to live in that environment, and how she survived. Beautiful, just beautiful. With humor, too, thank you. God Bless her."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is about Katherine Hepburn?","review":"This is about the author......who he knew, who he talked to, and who knew whom. Rushed into print, obviously, after the death of his famous \\"friend\\", it is beyond boring. If you are looking for a glimpse into the intimate life of this stunning actress, you won't find it here. Katherine Hepburn retains her mystery and allure in spite of \\"what's his name's\\" attempts to prey on an elusive connection......based on, again, who knew whom. Beyond disappointing, the book must have Miss Hepburn turning in her grave or whatever method she used to dispose of the famous body and mind which housed an extraordinary talent. It is not only disappointing.....it is trash. Buyer, beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Affair","review":"Having read Me, and admired Hepburn for years, I approached this book with little expectations. And, indeed, it is not a comprehensive biography of Hepburn, but rather an accounting of the last twenty years of her life, conveyed through her friendship with Scott Berg. It is, of course, filled with pithy Hepburnism, but what shines through is the clarity and genuiness of Hepburn, and the affection and admiration of Berg, which unabashedly informs the book and provides a key to her life. The writing is great, the subject is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only random bits of Hepburn's life","review":"Save your money and buy a more complete biography of Katherin Hepburn. The Berg book only gives you very brief and very random bits of her life story, with most of it centered around her later, rather mundane, years when Berg met her. You will not come away from the book with any added understanding of Hepburn the person or the actress. It was a very disappointing book. It's hard to understand how someone like Berg who knew Hepburn so long could have come away with so little insight about her. Also, much of the book is about Berg's life--not Hepburn's--so take what Berg says himself to heart--it's not a full biography of Hepburn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berg made me see Hepburn as someone I'd like to know...","review":"...instead of just as the cranky old egomaniac I used to think she was, and who I thought I'd rather just enjoy from afar. It's a funny little book, at times more about the author than about his subject, but it's utterly riveting, and a completely loving portrait of one of the true American originals of the 20th Century. Wonderful cameo appearances by the likes of Irene Selznick and the Hepburn family, admirably etched by the author to support his portrait of the \\"main event,\\" Hepburn. Worth the price of admission for Kate's crack after dinner with Warren Beatty and Annette Bening! Found a few irritating misspellings and typos that made me wish the publishers had cooled their jets for as long as it would take to have one more once-over by a proofreader instead of rushing this out so soon after Hepburn's passing, but that's the book trade for you. Anyway, I highly recommend this book to any Hepburn fan or lover of classic American cinema."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Because I've always admired Katherine Hepburn I bought the book about her life. It was a good read and I still admire her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile","review":"Some have criticized this book because they feel the author exploited Katharine Hepburn, and put too much of himself in it. And there's something to those complaints. But this is also funny, fascinating,and written with obvious affection for Hepburn. She had such a strong, distinctive voice, you can easily picture her in the stories Berg recounts. While there are a few places where I feel Berg goes too far in what he tells, it's mostly a good book. Hepburn fans will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Hepburn fans (like me) won't be able to resist reading this book, but it is truly disappointing. It's as much about Berg as Hepburn. Biographers should not inject themselves into the stories of those that they're writing about. I found the fact that Berg himself was a big part of the book extremely distracting and downright annoying. He comes across as self-centered and self-serving."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant summer read","review":"Scott Berg has written a zephyr-filled remembrance of one of America's cherished leading ladies. His twenty-year association with Katharine Hepburn was clearly a joy to both author and subject and his anecdotes are wonderful. Much has been said about Berg's self-infusion in this book but I found it to be not at all distracting. He passes on the warmth and quirkiness of Miss Hepburn with a good deal of affection.After finishing \\"Kate Remembered\\" I felt a desire to rent out some of her films. This is a nice way to continue the tribute to her. Scott Berg has helped preserve her memory and added to our understanding of this wonderful woman. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A. Scott Berg Remembered","review":"I purchased this book in the hope of getting some insight into Katharine Hepburn. What I received instead was a self-aggrandizing book that was more about the author than his subject. This book spends much too much time talking about A. Scott Berg, his education, his acquaintances among the monied classes, his life partners, and his previous works.A very disappointing work."},{"rating":"1","title":"choose another book","review":"If you want the definative KH book, this is not it. Berg inserted himself into this woman's life as a fawning, unobjective (granted, he concedes the point) fan posing as a biographer. Read th ememoir Tracy and Hepburn by Garson Kanin- the man Berg refers to quite harshly in his book (professional jealousy?).. Kanin knew his book was a loving reminiscence and it is quite fascinating without being fawning or cloying. Ms. Hepburn knew exactly what she was doing. Too bad Berg didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment","review":"I rarely buy a newly published book, but I've admired Katharine Hepburn for so long and the hype for this book was so strong that I got it. I wish I hadn't. It seemed like a perfect mating of author, subject, and timing, but something went wrong. The writing is amateurish and tedious, and Hepburn comes across as self-absorbed and shallow. I never would have imagined this book would be so boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just an idiot bragging about his relationsip with a star","review":"A. Scott Berg's book KATE REMEMBERED, is well-written, but shows false facts used by other authors (such as Anne Edwards, who THINKS she knows how to write a Hepburn Biography, but can't seem to get her facts straight), and jsut tells what his experience was with Kate. If he were going to write a book on Kate, and keep it a huge secret (it's been said that even Heburn's survivors were surprised, and appalled by this novel), thne relase it that they should at least give fans what they expect of a novel like that- a tell all book. Like KH had some huge secret she NEEDED to share with fans after her death."},{"rating":"1","title":"just an opportunist selling his supposedly best \\"friend\\".","review":"As a KH fan I couldn't be more disappointed.This book is just another way to serve Mr. Berg's career. He talks more about himself than KH. He uses weird excuses to end up talking about his Pulitzer price and his dull career (who cares about Mr.Berg???).The book won't give you any new information about KH!!! I don't need to know about dull intimacies that have no interest whatsoever for any true KH fan. It is just pure bragging of Mr.Berg.After reading this book I don't know KH any better (all info is already known by real fans) but instead I definitively know that Mr.Berg is not the kind of person I would invite for tea time.Had Mr. Berg wanted to pay a homage to KH, he could have done it writing other things about her that might have been more interesting.I suggest not to waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar example of simultaneous improvisation","review":"Stan & Gerry play beautifully on this recording. Their energy is infectious, their sound is full, and their ideas are spontaneous and creative.On almost all the cuts you'll hear Stan & Gerry improvising on the same chorus. They do it so well you almost don't realize it's happening unless you really listen. This kind of playing is impossible without the big ears both these guys had.The rhythm section is great as well, but the horns are what stand out in my memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Half Yes!","review":"Stegner is one of my favorite Western authors. I picked up a reference to this book in a Krakauer book and immediately bought this one. I found the opening chapters (first half of the book) very interesting, with the stories of the rapids and the quarrels among the explorers.The second half of the book was more political and geological. It was somewhat tedious to plow through that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a classic, though a little frayed","review":"This is a still a must-read for serious river rats, showing how our belief in the \\"big rock candy mountain\\" overruled the evidence before our eyes as we developed the West. This book was written in the early 1950s, and two signs of age were apparent. First, Stegner had not seen many of the river sections he describes, including the Grand Canyon of the Colorado and the Desolation-Grey Canyons section of the Green. The boom in commercial river running now makes many of us more expert than Stegner on that subject - kind of fun! Second, and less fun, the old boy has many subtle ways of downplaying the importance of women in the story. Small example: Stegner names Powell's brothers but only mentions the number of sisters, even though their roles in the story all quite small. These are nits born of his times. Still a fascinating tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important book regarding Western water","review":"Any history of the west has to deal with water. Stegner's biography of Powell describes Powell's career, in a largely engaging way. It's not a page-turner, but it gives you a good feel for the man. I appreciated it the most as I read it at the Grand Canyon while simultaneously reading Cadillac Desert. Stegner describes how Powell, a one-armed man, lead a rafting expedition down the Colorado river, complete with climbing up the sides of the Grand Canyon. Although some of the descriptions come across as a bit quaint these days, it's a valuable work. Reisner borrows from the story and its structure extensively when he writes about Powell in Cadillac Desert (probably the most important book about the water wars in the West)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Sleep","review":"Please don't sleep on this project!!!!!!!!!!!I've been a long time followers and personally know Pastor/Bishop McDaniel.

Enquist), it was probably the best accompanying text to this sort of introductory survey virology course. The book can be read through, skipped around or used as a reference - it shines in all three uses. A great categorization of viruses, explanation of all the myriad replication methods they employ, the book is more than an intro text - the references at the end of each chapter point you toward very very good sources for further research. Highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best in 30 years of Molecular Virology","review":"Watson & Crick take a backseat to the finest virology text in the history of science. The 20th Century has seen no scientist/editor like Jane Flint. Her incisive, detailed investigations into the genesis of Adenovirus study will likely not be equalled in the next millenium.Newcomers will be happy to know that this book is highly readable and I found that with a glass of Cognac and a cigarette after dinner created just the atmosphere needed to further a keen interest in Influenza virus, HIV. and the immense body of work that has gone into peeling back the layers of the actions of these killers and their close relations.Field's Virology completely misses the boat the Jane Flint sails, DiCaprio-like into the Atlantic.

A useful-sounding appendix giving a list of power consumption values (p94) and \\"specific consumption figures\\" (p132) is alas missing from the book entirely.

The author conveyed the emotional journey of her protagonist very skillfully and with much more depth than one expects in books of this genre. Frankly I couldn't believe it would be possible to turn the book into a watchable movie so I gambled a few dollars just to see.I was expecting poor film making, but I wasn't expecting the atrocious bootleg quality DVD that arrived. The aspect ratio is 3:4 (old fashioned TV screen stuff) and there are no subtitles. The film quality is grainy and looks as if it was ripped off a very old VHS tape. In short, I've seen Russian bootleg DVDs whose quality was infinitely superior to this product. It's worth perhaps $1.50 at the very most, so long as you don't mind the migrane you'd get if you actually tried to watch it for more than three or four minutes before ejecting it from your system and throwing it into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"about the movie ages of lulu","review":"I purchase a copy of region 0 uncut version of ages of lulu and the story is basically about a lady whom gets married after she have some 'fobia' about sexuality.

She did the above act since her husband brand her as 'dirty'. The code 2 version which I've lost from Tartan video is a censored version where the carrying sex is shorten to less than a minute, the portion(scene) before lulu give something to a man and lead her out of the house, how the actor touching lulu in a car(scene description) and the scene at gay club is a little longer.

The first one that went bad, Epson advised that you need to keep the equipment off when you are not using. So I did that for the others, but to no avail. The printer heads still dried up.My recommendation, we replaced these models with the Canon Pixma MP 780. These are great printers! The scanning feature is lightning FAST compared to this EPSON and the print speed and quality is definitely way better HANDS DOWN. For the money, you may as well get a good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"My biggest complaint is about the ink. I rarely use the color copy function because the ink is just to darn expensive. However, I think I've made one color copy since replacing all the color ink cartridges and now the printer is saying the color ink is out. I hate that if one of the color cartridges is out you can't even print a black and white copy. I only need black and white copies.... I don't even want color copies. I'm going to look for a new printer. Don't waste your money.Also, my friend had the exact same printer. She bought it at the same time as me and hers is completely dead. After paying to replace all the ink cartridges the stupid thing still wouldn't work. She won't be buying another Epson either."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 year Printer :(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(:(","review":"i have to agree with some of the other reviews. This printer just died yesterday.

Now I have to clean the printer heads several times before even printing one page or it is smudged or too faint to read.

The resolution field is also unmodifiable.The software is obviously a bad port from windows, as it does not obey the most basic keyboard shortcuts (cmd-W to close a window does not work, cannot tab between fields etc). The \\"Smart panel\\" is laughable, especialy its \\"advanced settings\\" that's totally useless.If I had known this I would not have bought the printer.And yes, I went to Epson site to get the latest drivers&software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't print without 4 full cartrisges","review":"DON'T BUY IT!

By that standard, Jeff Chaz is one of the greatest living blues musicians today; he is on every level a master. His amazing intellect is evident in his lyrics, with the emotions that rival any deep south blues icon's painful past. He exudes brilliance as a melody writer, poignant instinct as a guitarist, and is a beautiful singer with tremendous range and a style of delivery that bends one's heartstrings. Anyone that doubts his talent need simply to listen to a few songs like; \\"Instrument of Pleasure\\" or \\"Sweet, Sweet Love\\" to fully understand the depth of his abilities. For a kick in the pants, \\"I've Got To Be Clean\\" is just a whole bunch of fun!!

But in reality, the chair isnt that comfortable. It doesnt sit far enough up so that you can comfortably eat. The 'table' feature is virtually useless as there is no way to stablize it. It kind of just swings around - and you cant sit up far enough to keep it stable so you cant really use it for anything. As a foot rest, it works fine. All in all, definitely not worth the price. I bought two and I figure and would return at least one of them if I didnt think the return process would be such a hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this many people like this chair.","review":"When you put your feet up, the bar in front of the chair, that the fabric attaches to, pushes up on your legs something awful.The only problem is, who else makes a high back foldable chair with a foot rest? So I try and make this chair work. 2 things I did.First was I cut the tube that attaches the footrest to the chair and placed a piece of aluminum inside, to make it telescope, so I can extend the footrest away from the chair. This can be done really easy. But a pipe cutter for like 8 bucks and buy a piece of pipe, dowel rod, etc... and put it in the middle. (Takes literally like 30 seconds for the entire process).Second, I place a cushion on the chair to elevate my legs off of the bar. The only problem is, this places upir head and arms higher in relation to head rest and chair arms.Oh yeah, I removed the cushion in the head rest and placed a smaller one in.I still am looking for another chair though,"},{"rating":"2","title":"heavy","review":"A good idea and nice chairs but; the cup holders are cheap and not large enough to accommidate other items.

My wife and I were looking for a speaker-phone model but could not find one that matched our needs well enough. I must say that I have been thoroughly pleased with this Uniden, though. Reception and transmission are both very clear and the unit is very small and designed with a small footprint for desktop use. We do not use the caller ID so I can't offer any insight there, but the digital answering system seems to be quite clear and intuitive. All in all, an excellent value."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"I purchased this phone as a primary answering machine in my home based on my two previous Unidens that I loved and have come to regret it. It's a flimsy machine with poor audio quality. What drives me nuts is the volume - I can barely hear others, but when I speak I feel like my own voice is blasting my eardrum. If I decrease the volume I have a hard time hearing the person on the other end - increase it and I have to hold the phone away from my head when I speak. Nowhere near the quality of the other (more expensive) Unidens. It was so cheap I didn't get around to returning it to Amazon. Oh well, lesson learned. Now I'm going to buy a Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"Shame on Uniden for making this piece of junk. I bought it October 4th and the unit died completely on Christmas eve... under 3 months later.

It was only $25, but for even that much it shoud have lasted longer than 2.5 months. I've loved Uniden in the past, but those have always been their more expensive models which all have great sound quality and have lasted years. This model was purchased merely because I am living away from home for several months and decided my cell phone just wasn't cutting it so I decided to get a home line and an inexpensive phone with an answering machine. Guess I should have just spent another $25 to get something that would actually last. :\\\\"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money","review":"I have had this phone for at least 4 years now.

For the cheapest phone in the store, it worked out just great!However, I might need to replace the battery soon, and it looks like it would cost almost as much as getting a new phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!!","review":"I purchased this phone back in January of this year.

It seems to me, however, they are too concerned with trying to use big words in their songs rather than making good music. I do think lyrics are important, but it sounds like the lead singer tried to put words in at random where they don't really fit to sound smart and profound. Sometimes simplicity is a good thing, especially when singing about topics this band sings about. I also can't stand when the lead singer screams. It is probably the most annoying sound I've ever heard. It may even surpass the sound Jim Carrey made in Dumb and Dumber. This group does have potential so keep an eye on them, download Shatterday, and hope the next album is better.

Throughout the cd you experiences Zach Davidson's melodic screaming breakdowns until you reach the last song \\"P.S.-Love The Black\\" which ends on a melodic note. You won't be disappointed with catchy songs such as \\"Stay Home\\" with the chorus repeating \\"You said son, I didn't mean it there's something wicked living on the inside of me\\" to \\"Opiate Summer\\" which helps your appreciate the summertime when it gets there with lyrics such as \\"Because it's summer where you are/ Summer, I'm in love/ Summer you were just a universe.\\" Overall, this cd is a winner and should be in everyones collection.

I think these \\"emo\\" bands should be engineering their songs to allow the screaming to either;A. Make sense in the placement within the song (Or ask yourselves, \\"Does it make sense to scream at this point? Or are we screaming just for the sake of trying to identify with teen angst?\\"B. Why are we screaming? Don't have a great song running along the tracks and all of a sudden put a H-bomb where ever you like.In other words, try crafting your song to make sense.Shatterday was a great example of that.

I have a guitar playing friend who said that the strings might stretch out eventually and it should hold a tune better then, but I don't have much hope for that.

They also just feel different than actual LSAT problems, and are substantially more difficult, though not in an educational way.This book is riddled with errors. Some of the rules for the games directly contradict, making entire problem sets worthless. Some of the answers are incorrect, too, although it's impossible to tell because they don't diagram any of the problems out.

The instructions also suffer when the text describes the use of specific diagrams which are never drawn out.Even so, I only decided to return this book when I found substantial errors in three of the first 15 puzzles I tried.

Finally, on game sixteen I decided to check out the internet to see if I was just plain missing something. I wasn't, the book was--which prompted a retrograde check of answers previously marked correct in the book. I am not only disgusted that something so poorly edited and reviewed could be so wrong so often but a piece of me has just plain died that those were the answers I came up with in a time crunch.

You have to flip up the keyboard stand tab and the button is under there. Once I found it, I hit the button and both the keyboard and mouse are working fine.

Her Native American influence is evident in her music, and is so stirring that you can almost imagine the sun shining thourgh the trees of an ancient forest, as you lounge in its shady nooks. In addition to Liquid Silk, I would also recommend another CD from Marina, titled Snow Falling On Silence. This collection offers peacefull harp sounds that fluidly compliment Marina's flute.

Which are hard to tell whether they are joke or genius.We are still trying to figure out if \\"Half Japonese\\" is an urban myth.The talking heads in this movie, expressing their bitterness over the fact that this band never made it big are also from central casting and really add the spice to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"This is a documentary about crazy people-not Half Japanese.

The movie faltered in its message, finally arriving at the antithesis of itself and seemingly suggesting that unheeded progress was, after all, a beautiful and organic process -- EARLY CHAOS THEORY!

The last few minutes of \\"Resources\\" has a chafing strength, and that familiar opening chant is just as foreboding as it was the first time I heard it.Someone who's really crazy about this music will probably need to buy both editions, as the fuller version of \\"Grid\\" on this recording alone necessitates that.I enjoy listening to this cd; it is unique among the Glass compositions that I have, although it is not my favorite (I like the Violin Concerto and Facades, currently)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetition...repetition...repetition...repetition...rep...","review":"Has an echoic, cosmic sensibility but nonetheless a big disappointment.

I couldn't tell if that was the complete score.This piece is one of the great compositions of the last 25 years. In this form, some of the best aspects of the score are just gone. About halfway through the movie, there's a dark, incredibly beautiful dirge tapped out on the synth with a plodding beat behind it that is my favorite section of the whole piece.

Although it is in B&W and not updated every year it is still a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves it's purpose","review":"Nice for a spare bedroom. I do like the different positions you can set up the futon. A good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little frame","review":"This frame comes in completely non assembled pieces but it goes together extremely easily and only took me about 2 hours with my 2 year old \\"helping\\". A rubber mallet makes it easier since most of the assembly requires pushing together pieces connected by wooden pegs, and the wood is soft so a regular hammer leaves marks in the furniture. I ordered a \\"full\\" size but to me it seems smaller than my regular full size real beds. I am using this outdoors in my covered patio as a day bed. The wood is natural and unfinished so I bought a can of wipe on poly to seal and protect the wood before it is exposed to the weather. The biggest draw back to this is that it sits very low to the ground, even lower than I expected so it will be hard for an older person to get in and out of. Just make sure you check the measurements carefully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it","review":"I bought this several months ago for our basement area/game room. It doesn't get a whole lot of use but serves the purpose well. The product itself is well made, was easy to put together and seems to be sturdy. It's a little bothersome to transition to the other positions. Delivery was very quick. I received the wrong item, however. But the company replaced it quickly with no hassles whatsoever. I was extremely impressed with the company and very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplicity is Key","review":"This is a great book! I have plenty of books on achieving my goals, physical fitness, and dieting, but this is the first book that ties it all together. Now, I can throw the others away. Sam Varner's 12 steps are well laid out, and they are fun and easy to follow. He stresses that your total well being is not achieved in isolation. It is not wise to exercise a lot, if your diet is horrible. Diet, sleep, exercise, deep breathing, and prayer all lay the foundation for a slimmer, stronger, and younger you. The style of this book is very easy to read and absorb. One can easily read this book in one or two days, and his plan is not overwhelming. I have been following his plan for almost two months ,and it has made a tremendous difference in my mental, spiritual, and physical health. If you are a Christian trying to improve your quality of life, buy this book. If you are not, buy this book anyways. It will make a difference in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy of a book","review":"I was a bit surprised to see all the favorable 5-star reviews for this book. I suppose if you're really new to ideas about health such as drinking lots of water and cutting out refined carbohydrates, this may make a very basic introduction. There's something nice about keeping things simple. This book really contains about the same amount of information as an article in a health magazine, the rest being padding and filler. ALL of these ideas I have seen many times elsewhere, there's nothing new here. As a matter of fact, if you want to know what this book is about, skip everything up to page 171, where he summarizes the entire 12 steps in 3 pages. I got this book at the library, I'm sure glad I didn't buy it. It's just not worthy of an entire book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get carried away","review":"I purchased this CD just because it looked interesting and enjoy eastern music. I was delightfuly surprised. The combining of the east and west influences brings a wonderful result that will transport the listener away from the tensions of the day.

When you get them you will find out they are not. I informed them that they have pictures inverted with the in-ear lanyard, but they don't care, and didn't fix it. I've had three of them now, and they are all the wrong ones, and had to be returned. The original product, which is the right picture, is the best thing since sliced bread. It allows you to hang your Ipod around your neck, and when you can listen, you just put in the earbud. No long cords to get caught on everything and yank them out of your ear. The lanyard without the bud hurts your ears, but the ear-bud is comfortable. they are very fragile, I've had about 15 pair, and they have all broken, but it's worth it because I love them. Everytime I have them around my neck, I get comments from people about how great they are, but you can't find them anymore, Apple disconinued them, probably because they are so fragile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get these!","review":"When I got the Apple iPod Lanyard the earpieces hurt my ears and wouldn't stay in until I bought the Griffin Technology 4039-EJAM EarJam Earbud Sound Enhancing Covers.

I was wrong. The sound quality is horrible (significantly lower volume) and they refuse to stay in my ears! Will be selling them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earplugs fall out","review":"The absolutely worst headphones I have ever had. Trying the different sizes, the earplugs just don't want to stay in my ears (even standing still). The headphones that come with the I-Pod, and the earlier version of lanyard headphones were both much better. The sound was fine, but not any better than the standard headphones. A poor product. I was very disappointed, as I have had good experiences in general with Apple in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a Costume party","review":"Good sound, but makes you look like a 22nd century rapper wearing this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Fit, But Still Not Perfect","review":"I first bought the less expensive Apple lanyard headphone, but, since it has no adjustable earplugs, I was killing my ears cramming them in (my ears are pretty normal size, by the way). So I bought these, and they fit well. The only drawback is that sometimes I pick up the wind whistling in them. I have seen reviews of both Apple lanyard headphones that complain that they don't plug in snugly to the iPod and thus the iPod can fall off. Those must be defective lanyards or iPods, because both lanyard headphones have attached firmly to my iPod; you can even hear it click when they're properly attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"you get what you pay for....","review":"i was so excited when i found these lanyard headphones had been marked down from $50 to 14.77...then i found out why..no matter what size ear cover you use they just don't stay in your ear!! i still like the idea of the ipod hanging around your neck, but i think i am going back to my original ear buds and might try a arm band...these were really disappointing ;-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"The sound is really great, but there is one problem with this headphones they keep falling from my ears no matter what rubber caps (they come with 3 different sizes) I used.

They look like they are, but the packaging was distinctly not Apple, and since only one earphone works on each set (I bought two sets) they certainly did not make it through Apple product testing. If I had to guess I would guess that they failed Apple testing at the factory (Guandong Provence) and were sold out the back door to some enterprising wholesaler who then sold them to some retailer who then sold them to me. Whatever, they are junk, unless, of course, you are already deaf in one ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"All plugged up","review":"Even coming with three sizes of of \\"ear gasket\\", using the smallest I'm afraid these headpohones still don't fit comfortably, and the 'seal' it creates on the ear is terrible. If you work out and sweat, it becomes even more atrocious, and as you adjust the headphones, the gaskets slip out of place; they're keyed to the headphone, but they don't stay in place. I am fairly dissatisfied with these In Ear headphones, and would not recommend them to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money","review":"this product stinks.

I personally did not really know any of the author's books nor had I ever heard of her either. I started out excited due to the synopsis. I was so wrong, in fact in my almost 50 years of reading, there are very few books I start and Fail to finish...This was one of them. It was boring from beginning to middle (because that is as far as I got).I mean , I could not take any more of her descibing how she sewed her quilts and how she came up with the patterns and designs. I guess it will appeal to you if you sew quilts and go the quilt conventions....Other than that, I would not recommend it. Not one person in our Book Club finished reading it.In fact even the person who chose the book, sent an email out, that she withdrew her choice and we could skip over her book, she could not continue reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bummer","review":"Happenstance was the selected book for our book club...first it took a couple of weeks to get it from Amazon then I had to power thru it.

Perhaps it is too kind on the later Baudrillard (Baudrillard's photography material is basically self-serving), but it is a fine, fine book, with amazing range."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOMMY'S LEGACY LIVES ON","review":"This is a wonderful tribute to absolutely one of the most gifted and talented guitar players/singers of all time. I love Tommy's music and own quite a bit of his music, solo, Deep Purple and James Gang. Glenn Hughes leads this band into songs of Tommy's, Purple's, James Gang, and Glenn's own solo material. Glenn is in great vocal form and puts his heart and soul into the entire performance. Even some of the songs sound like they were meant for Glenn to sing like the excellent Gypsy Soul and Dreamer. Glenn does boggle some of the lyrics a bit but I have to give him credit for doing an excellent job. The rest of the band consists of unknowns except for Tommy's older brother Johnnie, who occasionally drummed in Tommy's band. The two guitarist to fill in place of Bolin are great, so much you actually feel like Tommy is on guitar. All-in-all, a wonderful album, and a must own for all Bolin fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring fable","review":"This story about a humble mouse who goes on a journey and gives part of himself to help other animals in need. He gives so much that one fears he has nothing left for himself and his own goals. However, it was through such selfless giving that he achieves more than he ever imagined. The story is wonderful for children, but I have given this small book to those I love who are going through transitions or dying, to give courage and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartwarming book of sacrifice and adventure","review":"I read this book for my children's literature course and it is one of my favorites. Jumping Mouse is an adventurous mouse full of compassion for others and confidence in his journey. I would say it is a book of sacrifice and adventure. The black and white illustrations are incredibly detailed-nature lovers will love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"jumping tale","review":"This is a great book. THe artwork is worth the Caldacott medal and the story is a good one for all ages.

Like Maupassant, he is a master of the surprise ending.As the introduction notes, those wanting rich characterization had best look elsewhere--say, Chekhov (excellent in his own right). Yet Dahl's stories work on several levels--they are horrifying, witty, sexy and imaginative. And unlike today's gorehounds, Dahl can evoke terror without shedding a single drop of blood. The economy of Dahl's prose makes for repeated reading--I never get tired of reading any of these tales. \\"Royal Jelly,\\" \\"The Great Switcheroo,\\" and \\"Genesis and Catastrophe\\" are especially good, but every story in this collection is a winner. The battle of the sexes is a recurrent theme here, and I can't help but wonder if that was a reflection of his turbulent marriage to Patricia Neal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: Muzak Alert!","review":"The liner notes describe this CD as \\"Oriental AOR\\". \\"Fusion/muzak sprinkled with a coating of chinoiserie\\" would be more accurate. The torturous, \\"smooth jazz\\" elements predominate over any authentic Asian musical sensibility, despite the presence of some heavy hitters like Mia Pang-Teng on erhu/niko. This soporific effort from Naoyuchi Onda is best left ignored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one","review":"He's good at it, too. Not what you're used to hearing from John Coltrane, but that doesn't make it bad by any stretch of the imagination. In fact, Coltrane could make an entire career of playing music like this. \\"Blues to Elvin\\" is a swingin' good time, \\"Blues to Brechet\\" features Trane playing soprano sax, which is always excellent; and \\"Mr. Syms\\" has the best melody on the album, as well as a fine piano solo; \\"Mr. Knight\\" gives Coltrane a lot of room to stretch out on that tenor sax, and he makes it excellent. A couple of the songs don't quite make the cut (\\"Blues to You\\"; \\"Mr. Day\\") - neither are horrendous, but both have a secondhand feel. No, it's not an insanely creative masterpiece like A Love Supreme. Nor is it the traditionalist triumph My Favorite Things. Try to find it, though. It's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extende versions or The King Biscuit?","review":"The truth is that this is just a rehash of the King Biscuit Live recording - minus a couple of tracks.

This is NOT the case.This is a wonderful reference for anyone who wants to teach their children using the montessori method at home.It is filled with ideas on how and what to teach your children using this method along with with full color photographs demonstrating what to do for each activity.The back has a section that you can copy so you can make your own materials if you don't want to buy the expensive (but beautiful) wooden ones you find online or in stores.As someone who had only heard of Montessori, this book was an excellent guide in demonstrating how to teach my children using this method."},{"rating":"2","title":"A go to book for my kid","review":"My four year old loves this book. she is always wanting to look at it to find \\"activities\\" . it has a large format with a lot of big pictures and white space. for instance, it dedicates two full pages to dissecting the activity of buttoning a button. yes.

I am forever indebted to John for his words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Gift","review":"Awakening From Grief is wonderfully different from other books on this subject. It allows you to rediscover and embrace the memory of someone who has died rather than forcing you to \\"get over\\" the loss. As it turns out, the cure is not trying to forget, but encouraging you to remember, to allow yourself to feel the joy the person who has died brought you and still brings you.John Welshons manages to pull this off not by resorting to Hallmark platitudes, religious quick fixes, or amateur psychology...but by simply telling his own story in a very compelling way.I've now given this book several times to friends who have lost someone. The last person I gave it to (who lost a teenage son) told me it was the most wonderful gift she's ever received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Received before expected date","review":"This book arrived ahead of schedule, in good condition and the price was right!

She was born in 1945 & died in 1987. She made her debut at age 16, & played the famous Elgar concwerto for cello in E minor at 20 with the London Philharmonic on a Stradivarius (she had two). There was a wonderful movie on her life called \\"Hilary & Jackie\\" I immediately ordered this album after seeing it. She was forced to stop performing at age 28 with the M.S. How someone with that short a career could achieve such internatiopnal acclaim is beyond comprehension.The concerto as played by Jackie was both \\"contemplative\\" and \\"elegaic\\" not to mention passionate and moving. If you are a lover of the classics, you MUST have it in your collection; otherwise your collection is very incomplete.I thank you for reading my review, & hope you enjoyed reading it as much as I enjoyed writing it.I also hope you will find it helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it for the Cello Concerto, forget the rest","review":"The Elgar Cello Concerto is performed wonderfully here--just magic. The legendary team of Barenboim and Du Pre plus her famous way with this piece are known to all classical music lovers.Barenboim alone as a conductor is another matter. I've never cared for his willful, sometimes even goofy performances, and the other Elgar pieces he conducts on this disc show him to be at his irritating worst.

However, other books provide similar information. The biggest issue is that the book does not cover much of what I was asked about as a fellow and it did not cover multiple critical topics for the boards. For example there is no section on radiotracers and their properties to name one of many topics left out of this book.I thought that the textbook by Iskandrian was much more helpful for the clinical side of the test and the book by Chandra was extremely helpful for the physics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The full and complete teaching from Adi Da","review":"If you want to know Adi Da's full teaching on enlightenment this is the book for you. It covers everything from meditation to love. It is not an easy book to read, but reading it aloud I have found that the divine speaks through the words and touches my heart in a way that other words have never done. It also confronts my sensibilities and my need to hold on to illusions in my self and the world. It is a serious spiritual book by a serious spiritual teacher and should not be taken lightly. Adi Da has become so aware of the divine that he no longer separates the divine from 'him'. Therefore, he gives us a glimpse at the world of the divine that is not available elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deep, but full of arrogance","review":"Adi Da is definately a deep spiritual teacher. I love to learn from. This book has a lot of meaning of being, even just holding the book. Reading it is quite the opposite. The arrogance says a lot.

It appears to be mainly a sales promo aimed at VB6 programmers. It is a very brief overview that is filled with errors. The code download and errata are not available on the given site. The code in the book is mere snippets that constantly refer the reader to the nonexistent code download. Net framework 2.0 is frequently referred to as version 1.2 making it difficult to know if they meant version 1.1 or 2.0. It is not possible to run any code with the snippets they provide.

I ordered that version specifically because it contained 11 tracks from the \\"Alexander the Great\\" soundtrack. When I ordered the item, the picture of the product even showed Classic Hollywood Studio's CD album (made in 1996). I was very precise when I ordered this product.Instead, I got a 1989 CD album made by Legend CD5 which also contains the soundtracks for Barabba/Alexander the Great. However, Legend CD5's CD only has 8 tracks from the \\"Alexander the Great\\" soundtrack.This is not the product I paid for. The album covers for Legend CD5 vs Classic Hollywood Studios are radically different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review Is Actually of the CD - An Excellent Recording","review":"The Sabri Brothers, who hail from Pakistan, perform the qawwali music of the Islamic Sufi tradition in arrangements both traditional and modern. This is intense music that typically consists of a lead singer, a backing vocal group that follows his lead in call and response fashion, and accompaniment on the harmonium and a variety of rhythm instruments. The songs are sung in Arabic, but liner notes included with this CD containing English translations that expose the religious nature of this intense, hypnotic music. No, this is not music for everyone, but all I can say is that if you like the energy of Pearl Jam, then you ought to love the Sabri Brothers, who sing rings around Eddie Vedder in songs that make a lot more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reflections","review":"Deacon Rich's book is not the kind of book I normally read.

Some are better than others, but all are surprisingly engaging.","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this video. I was curious whether the idea of interviewing people's introduction to, or some special emotion engendered by, the Beatles would resonate beyond their own kith and kin, but I found myself fully engaged in the stories. Swirsky's editing is also nicely done to avoid the \\"talking heads\\" problem common in many similar productions. He also cleverly has a second camera that captures him filming the interview from time to time, a device that works well and adds another layer to the production to keep it interesting. The content of the interviews themselves is also surprisingly interesting, which shows that the Beatles were indeed a phenomenon that had many different -- and important -- meanings to different people. The selection of folks to interview was diverse and, therefore, resulted in stories in general that were delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"So interesting!","review":"It's amazing how The Beatles touched so many.

Seth Swirsky's film is extremely well done, unique, and absolutely fascinating!! Ardent fans who think they have seen it all, will be happily surprised at the people Seth chose to interview..... sound engineers, musicians, stars, fans, and even old loves. No dirt, very upbeat and respectful to all parties.Beatles Stories is like a postscript to those documentaries we have all seen with historical footage of the Cavern Club through the breakup years. Seth skips the obvious and takes us in a different direction. I laughed, I cried, and remembered the joys of being a teenager in love with the Fab Four who, collectively, became the greatest band in rock history!! Highly recommend!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...a fresh perspective","review":"If you are a Beatles fan, this film is just what you've been looking to see.I have seen so many of the movies about the Beatles, and while most are enjoyable, Beatles Stories offers something that most of them do not - a fresh perspective.You are literally treated to dozens of new, never before heard stories about various peoples personal encounters with the Beatles. From Academy Award winner Ben Kingsley's dealing with them in the 60's to common folk, such as the Apple Scruffs, the fans who would wait outside the Beatles London studios.I put this film on with relatively low expectations, ?I mean, what could possibly show me that I had not already heard a 100 times. Boy, was I wrong.Beatles Stories is a treat from start to finish, and well worth seeing more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"My students love it!","review":"Personally, I think this movie could have a little more details to it, but my 6-8th grade Religion students really liked it. We got about halfway through the VHS version but the tape kept jamming and I couldn't ever get is past the halfway point. They kept begging me to let them finish watching it! The used DVD prices were pretty good so I ordered a copy and they were thrilled to be able to finish watching the movie. Christian Bale was a hit with the girls. One even commented, \\"I know it's wrong, but Jesus is hot!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely UnBiblical. A Pagan Fantasy","review":"This movie, while full of great acting, is nothing but a fairy tale presented with just enough fact to fool those who have never read the Gospels. Jesus is shown to be nothing more than a man whose whole wisdom and knowledge is gained not from God but from Mary. If this movie is to be believed then by taking her out of the picture Jesus would of been nothing, let alone the all knowing Son of God. The most disrespectful part of this movie, which is full of disrespect for God, is early on when the young Jesus doesn't even know he is God's only begotten Son. Watch this if you want a good story, but keep in mind that it is nothing more than that, a fairy tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing choice of roles","review":"I am a Christian Bale fan. I think he does well acting out the intricate complexities of the human psyche, whether he plays Batman or Jesus, or a boxer,,,,,his talent as an actor strikes me as very powerful and intense. So even though I have not watched this movie yet, I am looking forward to it, as I enjoy watching Christian Bale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite Unbiblical","review":"I couldn't finish watching this movie because of the serious inconsistancies with Scripture. There were three advisors listed in the credits, two priests and a rabbi. I wonder how these Catholic priests allowed their names to be associated with this movie.You can say it is inspirational but if key details are wrong and false, it will ultimately not lead you closer to the Real Jesus because the details are important and relate to the Incarnation as foretold in the Old Testament.Showed Joseph angry, accusational and cruel about Mary's pregancyOmitted Elizabeths greeting of Mary as \\"Mother of My Lord\\"Implied Mary had pain at childbirthOmitted presentation in the TempleShowed Mary as the decision maker in going to EgyptImplied by Jesus' questions that he didn't know he was God.You can learn much more about the life of Jesus looking through the eyes of Mary when you pray the Rosary (which after all is simply the prayer of the Gospel)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided","review":"While Mary Mother of Jesus has some decent acting for a TV special, its portrayal of Mary is fundamentally misguided. The Mary portrayed here is a cross between a feisty feminist icon and the sinless, deathless Goddess of Roman Catholic piety.The Mary that ISN'T portrayed is the Mary of the Gospels - a good woman with her own set of strengths and flaws who ultimately played a key role in salvation.Note: the theology of this film is PURE Roman Catholicism and is likely to offend other Christian groups. (For example, John the Baptist is shown dribbling water on people and saying Catholic-sounding comments like \\"Wash your sins away with water.\\" I doubt the Baptists in the audience appreciate that much.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jesus & Mary: Strong, Wise Down To Earth Characters","review":"This may very well be my favorite Jesus movie ever. I think this movie has not been given the full attention nor credit that it deserves. The movie starts off showing how Mary was kind, wise and brave in spirit and thus why she was chosen to to give birth to and raise to manhood the Son of God. Nice too is the fact that Jesus while Savior to world is so very down to earth. Mary is respectful to Jesus because she knows he is savior to the world and yet Jesus is respectful to her because she is his earthly mother and the movie that great friendship as mother and son between them. What I like about this Jesus movie it that it is true to Scriptues, noting that Jesus was/is the Savior and Son of God..but ever so tactfully avoiding the the trinitarian vs. the unitarian issue. This is a great movie and I would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall","review":"I love the TSO, and this CD is no exception to the rule.

Boy was I in for a disappointment. There is a wide range of different musical types on this disc and they just don't seem to \\"blend\\" together to create a nice collection. One minute you go from bluesy, to the next song being a high soprano, and then to almost hard rock. I love Christmas music of varying kinds, but this is just unlistenable. Wish I could get a refund!

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're looking for traditional Christmas music, skip this","review":"I saw those darling children performing on the Today Show and thought this album would be more music like that.

This is not traditional Christmas music and certainly not easy listening. I found myself skipping to the next song to find a good one; sorry, not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"If Queen had made a Christmas album, it might have sounded something like this. Either that, or there's a Broadway production somewhere waiting for an incredibly lame score. I bought this based on the very pretty \\"Christmas Canon\\" song, but soon found out that was the lone good song. The rest of the album is so overwrought and pretentious that I could barely listen to it. The 70's style electric guitar was especially annoying. And I won't even go into the singing. This album makes Meat Loaf seem subtle. Unless you're a fan of 1970's prog rock, skip this cd and go for other Christmas music instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"There are a Few Rather good songs on this album, Christmas Cannon is quite beautifuly done, however the rest of the album is more like hard rock with a christmas theme. certainly not more of the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad for Amazon's \\"Song Sampler's\\"","review":"I heard \\"Christmas Canon\\" on the radio and loved it so I thought I would buy the CD.

However, almost all of the music is buried under heavy metal like noise that can only be described as annoying and agitating. I only managed to pick out two songs on the whole CD that I actually could tolerate (and they were actually fairly mellow). Now that I opened it, I wish I could take it back to the store for a refund.I also cringed when I heard in several songs what was supposed to be singing. It was awful.If you are looking for traditional Christmas music in a classical sense, don't even think about purchasing this.

If you always thought that your holiday music didn't have enough electric guitars mixed with a New Age sense, then you came to the right place.How about this. How about the first two Manheim Steamrollers Christmas albums. They have carols dating back to the Middle Ages, many somewhat unknown, played in the classic style, with classical instruments. And yes, others are new age. Luckily, they don't really mix them in the same songs...and NOT with Meatloaf style electric guitars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than ever","review":"Absolutely incredible.

The reader is told that a character feels a certain way, then the dialogue that comes out of her mouth is totally at odds with this. This is a pattern in the book, and is at its worst with the main characters, Regina and Jules. In addition, not one character ever really comes alive or seems three-dimensional. Regina's mother, supposedly a warm, loving person, gives her daughters platitudes for advice, doesn't act in a way consistent with her supposed \\"illness,\\" and is improbably connected to anyone who can move the plot along.Too bad that this inventive plot was squandered with stilted writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow as Molasses in Winter","review":"I just could not get through this book. I've enjoyed other works from this author, particularly \\"The Unexpected Wife\\", but this one was just too slow.

Miss Carroll's treatments of the best of the popular songbook are beautifully structured; she can swing with the best, her bop-inspired piano rapping out great excursions through \\"The Surrey with the Fringe\\" and \\"But Not For Me\\". When she slows down, she can turn an instrumental like \\"Lotus Blossom\\" into a ruminative, wistful tone poem.Also listen to her understated vocals on a late-night classic like \\"Glad to be Unhappy\\", where every nuance of Lorenz Hart's lyric is perfectly communicated. She also does justice to a Coleman and Leigh song, \\"A Moment of Madness\\", the bittersweet lyric perfectly matching her wry songspiel.Barbara Carroll is one of those rare performers with whom quality is a given: her repertoire is fresh and stimulating, her musicianship exquisite. Do yourself and favour and listen to her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martex miPillow - Nice Pillow -- Irritating Sound System.","review":"This Musical Pillow seems like a good idea and it does work but the sound is terrible. It has all the audio fidelity of a 1950's transistor radio playing under your pillow.

While the pillow worked as designed, the design needs improvement. The reciever and the transmitter should be activated and shut off through the music player.

I can find nothing about the author at all. No matter, this is without doubt the funniest and most unique book I've read in years. It's hard to pin down the story - it's more a free-flight fantasy into the minds of marginally functional people desperately clinging to their version of happiness, fighting the insanity of the \`normal' people that surround them.

I don't mind resources that are a bit older (i.e. \\"classic\\") but this particular title suffers from the verbosity so fashionable in it's day yet so annoying now. It just too text heavy. Using words to teach light and shadow is like using ducks to teach chemistry...in other words, ineffective. This is a concept best explained through illustration and while there are some here, there isn't enough and they aren't very effective.

In the late 60ies and early 70ies Dario Argento produced three memorable slasher pictures, most notably the violent, surreal \\"Bird with a Crystal Plumage\\". Ennio Morricone wrote the soundtracks. Being used to the timeless, hard and classic soundtracks of Argento's later films, one has to admit that the sound of Goblin contributed far more to the Argentoesque feel of his films than the rather standard, workmanshiplike 70is soundtracks by Morricone. It's all very hip and spaced-out, and some tunes are haunting. Nevertheless - a Morricone Soundtrack is after all still a Morricone Soundtrack. For the good and for the worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Mitch Seidman appears on other Brownstone CDs and has a lot to offer. His playing is always clear and lyrical, with an absence of the showier improvising that is part of the Jazz guitarist's stock in trade. Some of the most delectable moments of this album come from Seidman's duets with bass player Harvie Swartz, who is a highly inventive and imaginative soloist. On several cuts Seidman is joined by two reed players, including the excellent Leonard Hochman, and these numbers swing more and have more oomph than the subtler trio numbers. The sound engineering is clear and well balanced, not focused exclusively on Seidman. Afficianados of Jazz guitar playing should find this CD very welcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gettysburg Screen Saver","review":"This so called \\"music video\\" for Gettysburg is a farce.

With a combination of still and live shots, including both re-enactors and actual photographs from the Civil War, the powerful, terrible story of Gettysburg is told in all its grandeur and tragedy.To make a modern reference for those who don't understand, more men died in three days on that blood-soaked battlefield than the US has lost in four years of war since 9-11. The Battle of Gettysburg was awful, and tragic and grand, and, ultimately, necessary for the preservation of our nation.

There is definately too much chatter and not enough information. The list of tattoo studios in the back of the book is not a very good resource, as the information there is highly likely to change, such as addresses and phone numbers. There are a lot of black and white photos, not \\"many in color!\\" as the back of the book claims, and most of the pictures can be found in any number of other books on the subject.

As for the DVD, good picture, but I found the dialogue difficult to hear at times - audio recording not the best considering the environment being filmed in? I found the scene with the Jew attacking the camp confusing - why? what was the explanation? It just seemed like a forced scene to cause the Knight to lose it.

I picked up Dispatch and started reading it and I have to say it, but I hated it. For me, the constant descriptions about being a letter writer and how important it was was like nails on a chalkboard. I get that he loves writing letters but it doesn't have to be on every 5 pages. I will still read Bentley Little's novels because they are great. This one, however, I didn't care for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not his best","review":"Bentley Little is a master at taking ordinary American situations or things and making them terrifying. In a Little book going to the store or buying insurance is a direct trip to nightmare land. Dispatch doesn't measure up to his other stuff. The \\"hero\\" is a jerk and deserves to have his smug, superior little existence shook up. The plot takes one turn that was so ridiculous that it made me roll my eyes and when the Big Bad-- the monster is finally revealed it's not impressive at all. If this is the first Little book you've looked at try one of his others instead. I'll still read Bentley Little but I was not satisfied with this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"The horror novels of Bentley Little are always a little brainier and more socially conscious than those of his peers. Even when he's writing about vampires or haunted houses, he's tackling subjects like racism and conformity. In DISPATCH, Little examines not only the power of the written word, but he takes us on a darkly satirical journey through the last half of the 20th century. Closer to THE IGNORED than to his other novel's, it's a first-person narrative that riffs on Little's usual bete noires and concerns a man who can accomplish anything he wants by writing letters. A brilliant novel by one of contemporary fiction's top talents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not Little's best work","review":"I LOVE Bentley Little's books - but this one was a bit boring, and certainly not his best work. As I read it, I was constantly reminded of the Ignored; I think the writing style and the main characters were similar.I had a hard time maintaining my interest with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Horror Novel that is Horrible","review":"This was my first Bentley Little novel and the only reason I gave it 2 stars is because, like so many other reviewers have stated, the first 200 pages of the book are very good. As soon as he took the mysterious job (the whole premise of the book) it went downhill fast. The ending was just plain stupid. At NO point while reading this book did I get chills, I never felt any rush of fear that a good horror novel brings on. Frankly I just finished reading the awful thing just to see what/who the Ultimate was. I am going to try another Little book because I think the books sound really good but I sure hope the Resort doesn't fall apart like this story did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting idea gone astray","review":"This was a pretty good book up about two-thirds the way through it then it just got goofy. George Washington? Abe Lincoln? Are we serious here? Scissors? I will admit that it kept my interest throughout. For the first two-thirds or so it was a good thriler that kept me guessing and trying to figure out where our totally unlikable hero was going. The last third of the book was just a trip down ludicrous lane where I was fascinated by the ridiculous turn of the plot. The Ultimate battle, and I do mean Ultimate, was simply silly. Kyoto deserved a better fate. And what about Stan? The idea of who/what Stan was is something I saw in an early episode of Doctor Who. Then what about Vicky? How to contact her? He had to think about that? He was a Letter writer for goodness sake!!! Anyway, this wasn't a terrible book, but it isn't one I would recommend as a great read either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Entertaining!","review":"Who said what starts off slow finishes with a heavy impact of a ten-pound hammer to the brain?They were right.Fans of Little will see a change in this tale, a change that is neither good nor bad.

The pen is mightier than the sword in this saga. Scary in that it may sometimes be closer to reality than one wants to imagine. Jason, the main character, son in a dysfunctional family, finally discovers his voice, writing letters that get results. The bizarre ending was a little off (thus only 4 stars), but I would rate it equal to The Store and The Association."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not read Bentley Little!!!!!!","review":"This book started out well, but it wore itself out due to monotony. Examples were given over and over and over again about how the main character writes letters to get free stuff and bring about change. I had to stop reading because I said to myself, \\"I get it! You write letters to get what you want, now get on with the story.\\"Bentley Little's books are all very similar. He takes an ordinary entity (writing letters, convenient store chains, mailmen, college, homeowners association, resorts, insurance policies) and he turns it into an absurd oppressive force that involves violence and sex. I don't understand why he is so famous or so widely read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Above Par for Bentley Little","review":"As a longtime fan of Bentely Little's works, I've found this one to be the most intriguing to date. It follows the standard format for a Little book, in which an everyday character falls into what at first seems to be a normal situation, but which grows worse and worse until it has reached the point of supernatural. Very comparable to The Ignored or The Store in it's style, this book impressed me by leaving out some of the cheesy imagery and lackluster endings that have played such a major role in Little's last few books. The author offers more than a few surprises and poses enough questions to keep the reader interested. If Little can maintain the quality of this book, I look forward to his future works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I Have It!","review":"This tote accommodates my Viking Scandinavia 200 with space to spare.

Probably of the 3 reunion records, this one is the 'most tolerable' but its hardly on target! The fire and intensity is, for the most part, left out of the production. Instead we get 'chimey' new wave interludes through 'Cosmic Jazz\\" and yet we get a KAROKE version, too, egad! The only two songs that cut it to the bone are 'Walk on Water' and 'Keeper of the Light', which rekindles some of that magic and spirit from the early days.

He was a man who slaughtered teachers, health-care workers, farmers, college students, school-children and trade unionists, some who were thrown into his private zoo to be eaten alive by wild animals. All this occurred with the enthusiastic support of US presidents (including Jimmy Carter) who backed Somoza to the very end, contrary to the lies of another reviewer here. If you want a glimpse into the twisted mind of a mass murderer who attempts to lie his way into history, pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Powerful and Truthful Book","review":"I first read NICARAGUA BETRAYED more than 25 years ago, and it really opened my eyes to the often filthy power politics played by Washington and by some of our Presidents, such as Jimmy Carter and covered-up skillfully by the mass media.Though President Somoza writes (wrongly) glowingly of himself, this book is an eye-opener because Somoza names names, dates, instigators, what they did to help the communists, who helped the communists (including Jimmy Carter) and a wealth of information which can easily be verified through U.S. Government documents which are not classified. I verified many of the claims myself using the Government Documents repository at the U of M library in Miami. Somoza tells the truth about Carter and his involvement in the handing over of Nicaragua to a communist dictatorship. I highly recommend Nicaragua Betrayed.You will never look at American politics and foreign affairs the same way again after reading this powerhouse of a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's all true","review":"I lived my elementary school years under the Somoza administration, as did my familiy, uncles, cousin, etc. etc through their adult life. I picked this book up to try to make sense of what happened to Nicaragua, and I can say that the testimony of Somoza is all true. Nicaraguans enjoyed all the rights that Americans did. Even those who opposed and attacked his administration. There was no question back then that the Sandinistas were communist. Any citizen that respected life,and liberty did not have any problems with the authorities. Those that claim otherwise did not live in Nicaragua in those years, or was a terrorist him/herself. If Somoza was so bad, NIcaraguans would have exiled in mass like they did after July 19, 1979. Even if the problem was the name \\"Somoza\\", the problem could have been constitutionally solved. This was a conspiracy all the way, which turned Nicaragua from a productive society to a welfare state."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun","review":"My nephew loves playing pirate and he immediately started to imagine all the things he could see through the scope.

Needless to say, I threw caution to the wind and purchased, \\"Full Stride.\\" I'm very happy with my selection. Every cut on this CD was written and played with total musical aplomb.

I own all three editions and I am mostly happy with all of them. That being said there are some major drawbacks that should be recognized.1. As others have pointed out there are many typos in the equations. I learned of some of these typos the hard way. I had to go back to the original journal papers in some cases to find the correct form of the equations...after much wasted time and confusion.2. Each edition seems to drop information on certain topics.3. This book is not a stand alone book, which is ok, but the author should do a better job of pointing the reader to the most useful references and noting where he is skipping steps. This point is especially important to recognize when working through the derivations of K, J and CTOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I was looking for","review":"I'm currently writing my thesis, this book is perfect for anyone dealing with any kind of material that needs a fracture mechanics book.

This is a riveting story of the intersection of vision, ego, politics and the battle between commercial interests and publicly funded efforts to do nothing less than lay the foundation for the technology that will likely define this century.This is not a dry chronicle of the scientific methods, technological and computational breakthroughs that made this great accomplishment possible. Rather, Shreeve manages to guide the layman through the intricacies of all of the above, while never loosing site of the more interesting story of the personalities and interactions among the key players in this story. There are lessons here for anyone - integrity, vision, politics, business, perception and the law of unintended consequences.The best book I've read this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down","review":"It was a gripping account of all of the events that transpired during the human genome race. There were many characters in this book, most of which stuck around from start to finish. The book is told from Venter's vantage point. You know what the ending is already, but it is interesting to hear how it was arrived at. There were lots of interpersonal interactions in this book. It was noteworthy to read about the conflicts between science and business, public vs private sectors, the bottom line vs the common good. That is what I felt I really took out of the book, narrative elements aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not far from thriller","review":"This book describes the race to sequence human genome. Main competitors are private sector (represented by Venter) and government funded consortium. The writer spent some time in the headquarters of the Venter's institute, and had a chance to witness both the actual lab work, and meetings and interactions of the key players. The book contains sufficient technical details, but can be read by non-scientists. Furthermore, this is one of the few books that shows what happens in the 'backstage' and how contemporary science works. For me, as a scientist, next to the actual research process, it was very interesting to see how key players interacted. The book is written in a way, that once you start reading, it is difficult to stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A zesty story of a great struggle for discovery","review":"The business, science and controversial politics affecting genome studies are outlined by James Shreeve in The Genome War: How Craig Venter Tried To Capture The Code Of Life And Save The World, a history of the race to map the human genome.

These are not extended studio-versions, but all live-, or acousic-versions of songs that have already been released on previous albums.

From the first chord it struck me as an \\"MTV Unplugged\\" version of their songs, covered by an unknown, low-quality garage band. In most of the songs, it is literally hard to identify the songs as being performed by the Fixx. I still have some doubts. Even if you are a hard-core Fixx devotee, this CD is of such poor quality that it is not worth purchasing, in my view."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want extended, listen to the original twice","review":"I really expected to hear the original \\"Saved By Zero\\" and other great Fixx songs extended or maybe remixed by digital means or whatever...but come to find out these are really pathetic (yes, pathetic) versions of these songs. The vocals are poor, the cool intricate guitar licks are replaced by 90's style leads, some songs are so poorly mixed you can't even hear the keyboard...and I swear some are actually in mono...mono?

The first CD is much better than the second. Tony Moran can take even crappy songs and turn them around, though he is at his best when he prescinds with squealing diva vocals and does what he does best- mixing superlush thick harmonies on top of a crunchy athletic bass that exudes dionysiac masculine energy.

Even the few guests I mentioned earlier can't save this LP from being a disaster.Don't buy this album. \\"Hold Ya Head\\" is the only above-average song on the whole thing, and it's not worth it to spend $15 for that one song.

Then again when I think about it BIG didn't do anything but spit about fantasy gansta stories, Kristal, and women, so maybe he would've done some of the songs that are on this album.

Eminem and obie trice tear up the cd with the song It has been said, which curiously doesnt feature the king of new york himself. another track not featuring biggie is I'm with whateve featuring jim jones, lil wayne, and juelz santana. all and all i feel that this venture by the didster could have been much much better.

Zero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad...even for a B.I.G. CD","review":"Diddy might have taken his time in getting every big rapper and producer onto one album as a tribute to the late Notorious B.I.G....but that doesn't mean he took his time in regards to the quality of the album. The guest spots feel insanely forced, especially the single with Nelly and Jagged Edge. Not a good song! \\"Spit Your Game\\" with Twista and Krayzie Bone is a rehash of a much better song called \\"Notorious Thugs,\\" although Krayzie does rip his verse.Overall, about as low as the \\"newest albums from dead rappers\\" trend can get, do not buy this album. Save some money and buy something you really want."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guarentee B.I.G. is rolling in his grave","review":"Pure garbage. Every song on this album sucks. Rap is dead and Puffy killed it. I love how a lot of other reviewers think many of the tracks are like 6 or 7 stars out of five. Come on, the only artists on this album who deserve any respect are Big and Pac, everybody else sucks. How you gonna put BIG on an album with artists like Nelly, Korny, Fat Thug and T.I.? Somebody needs to let CheesePuff know the deal and tell him to stop destroying BIGs rep. Biggie's rhymes are still sick, but only in the context of his original beats. These new cuts and remixes don't fit with the lyrics at all and they make Biggie sound terrible, which he wasn't. If CheesePuff wanted to do a remix album with Biggie's music, he should have done it right and kept himself and wack artists away from the mic. Buffy, stop making money off your boy and let him rest in peace with all the respect and honor he deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad boy took a good album and ruined it for me","review":"Well, the music and remixes/remasters are worth listening to...some good stuff one the disc.HOWEVER, since Bad Boy so intelligently blocked computers from recognizing the CD, I can't import it into my iTunes library. I will NEVER be buying another BAD BOY album. This is the #1 reason people turn to file-sharing services, even if they have legally purchased the artist's album just like I did.DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disrespectful","review":"this was terrible, i only gave 1 star cause u can't give zero. worst choices for guest appearances, people BIG never would've worked with and every beat was unlistenable too. Every biggie verse was off=beat and poorly remixed. The only tollerable tracks was What You Want cause it lacked a bad guest performer, even though this track wa also very poorly remixed over a beat that didn't fit w/ big's vocals. if u're a Biggie fan, stay away from this cd, if u're a fan of whack mixtape sounding albums like Loyal To The Game or anything put out by GUnit, Eminem, Kanye, etc. then go ahead bump it up, but thaz cause you're a friggen retard hahaha...boycott this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating is low because of production, otherwise i'd up it another star","review":"I just got this album and I gotta say, its not bad. I didn't really know what to expect, except that gay daddy was behind it. Like the other reviews on here say, there are no new verses by big poppa. Although I am a strict 2pac fan, I respect B.I.G. for the rapper he was. The production is alright, verses from fellow rappers are alright, so therefore, this album was alright. Best songs on the album are living in pain, ultimate rush, and mi casa (not because of r kelz, but because of the verses biggie spits). If you wanna cop one of the best albums of 2005, get Carter II by Lil Wayne."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diddy please stop !!!","review":"Being a huge Biggie fan I rushed out and picked it up the day it came out. I was somewhat disappointed after listening to the whole album a few times. This is the same old raps played out to different beats and choruses. Just Diddy trying to make some more money off the only good artist on the bad boy label. I was even disgusted listening to Diddy on track #2 talk about how he took BIG from coal to diamonds, molded his mind, and calls him his frankenstein like Diddy was the mastermind behind the success of the Notorious one. Anyone who knows anything about rap is laughing at Diddy right now. BIG's flows were incredible and would have been hits over any beat chosen. If you are a true Biggy fan, get Ready to Die and Life After, stay away from this one. Diddy please stop digging up Biggy every couple of years. Stick to making your terrible bands on MTV and leave the legend alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.I.G. Mistake.","review":"Why have people played with Biggie Smalls' music? This album is a pathetic attempt to revive his legendary music.THE ONLY GOOD SONG IS \\"1970 Somethin'\\"!The collaborations are below par, and do not deserve to be put under B.I.G.'s name. Pathetic.

Biggie was cold on the Mic&He was something else for a Minute.had to give Him dap to tolerate&put up with Puffy.Puffy is back to Milking off Biggie.alot of take or leave cuts.the first single truly stanks. Puffy can't create no hits no more,but then again he never did in the first place,but that's another time&topic,but here at hand is a Album which was basically thrown&tossed together to generate some Holiday Buzz. I just want the Biggie Greatest Hits package&then Puffy should leave it alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tricky......","review":"Diddy does what he does best, and thats making money. BIG only had 2 albums in his short career. In my opinion, one stellar album. \\"Life after Death\\" a two disc postuhumos LP, could have been shorten to one disc to be satsifactory. This is basically worse than \\"Born Again\\" This is another wasted album, with a lotof guest appearences, you can read them. Of course, they rhyme and its good. But you heard these verses before. Highlights: \\"Hold ya head\\" with Bob Marley \\"1970 somethin\\" with Faith Evans & The Game\\"Running your mouth\\" true brooklyn track download it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This is total disrespect to the best MC of all time. They took his amazing style and talent and mixed him with subpar rappers, with sub par beats.Absolute garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old Stuff","review":"Everyone has already heard all of these lyrics before there is no point to making this cd, other than Puffy being puffy reproducing old lyrics to make a new cd to get more money from a struggiling bad boys companyThe instrumentals are weak andI think puffy is losing his mind by making the Legend B.I.G. colaborating with some wack rappers on here he even has korn on here??????????This is not a Biggie cd to get get all of the others though"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best with the Worst","review":"The Notorious B.I.G. is one of the greatest emcee's of all time, and his first two albums are classics. But this so called Duets album is a joke. Sean Diddy Combs has dragged Biggies name through the mud once again. This album is nothing but recycled rhymes put to some of the weakest beats I've ever heard. One of the best emcees teamed up with some of the worst rappers that have ever picked up a mic. For exampe: Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Ludacris, The Game, Diddy, Lil' Wayne, Dipset, T.I. ect. Forget it, the whole line up is wack. Beats, artists, and concecpt is garbage. Diddy should burn in hell for puttin' this together. Please pick up Ready to Die, or Life After Death. Die Diddy, please.

Very disappointing quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Compilation But Some Repeated Tracks","review":"Here's another good compilation of Goblin's music but be forewarned: the first cut Profondo Rosso is not an alternate take but the original version we all know and love which is on The Goblin Collection. Death Dies is also on The Goblin Collection so there is some repetition here (four other Profondo Rosso cuts are also included). For me, the main reason to have this CD are the three excellent tracks from the Cherry Five debut album which to the best of my knowledge isn't available on CD. Rounding off the CD are good tracks from Suspiria, Roller, Squadra Antigangsters, and Contamination. Overall, this is a good CD to have in any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rapport","review":"Too verbal and wordy. Can't make head or tail of it.

What to say. Although I like some of the descriptions, the book drudges on and on about wars and poking holes through a frozen lake and breasts... I like breasts don't get me wrong, I just don't care for this book. I find it hard to keep focused on it even for just one chapter, and I'm a rather avid reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader","review":"This is perported to be by one of China's best contemporary writers.

Sadly, I was quite disappointed. Perhaps something is lost in translation, but even though I always appreciate historically based fiction the story is at times tedious for over-description and then confusing due to lack of detail. Not what I was expecting at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"hated it","review":"Loathed logging along through misery after misery. War forever. Crudeness of the characters beyond measure.

I know that this is the first book in a series of 5 but it was so slow moving & the characters weren't all that great. I've read a couple other of Susan Grant's books & didn't find them very good either. I'm an avid reader & the really good books grab you from the beginning & draw you into the story with the characters, plot, action & love scenes. Susan Grant's books fail to do so & I would rate her a mediocre writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a stand-alone book","review":"Maybe this would be better if you could read all of the five books at once. Didn't fare well on its own. Not enough substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect blend of romance and sci-fi action","review":"This is a great book to expand your reading horizons if you like romance, but think you don't like science fiction, or if you like science fiction, but think you don't care for romance.For the romance reader, lucky Banzai gets to choose between not one, but two gorgeous, powerful men. One is a maverick treasure hunter, one is a prince. Yummy either way.For the science fiction reader, the future world is vividly real and full of action and intrigue. When the heroine was put into her 200-year deep-freeze, I was as horrified by the technical process as she was, before she lost consciousness.I can't wait to read the rest of the 2176 series."},{"rating":"2","title":"great adventure","review":"The writing is super, as Grant always is, but this book is rather different. A reader looking for a true romance, needs to understand, this is very different. Most of the book is focus on the heroine, the romance is not motivation of the story, just a part. I went in expecting another romance, and it took me off guard. The writing was super, but I just was not prepared for this different pace. I truly enjoyed the writing and the adventure. But you should really with the anticipation this is different and really not finished. The story is left hanging, but I understand there is a second part coming later in the year.So if you would like something very different and original, take this high flying adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fine performance from Miss Valente","review":"While not quite as good as the live CD/DVD of the 1968 Heidelberg special, this is still a very enjoyable performance from the legendary Miss Valente. The sound quality is not nearly as bad as a lot of reviewers would have you believe. The Heidelberg concert was professionally recorded, possibly with a live album in mind; this show was probably taped just for posterity by the nightclub owner.Look, as much as we would all love to have performances like these in pristine digital video quality and 5.1 surround sound, sometimes that is not always possible. We are probably lucky that many of these shows exist at all - who thought, 40 years ago, that people would still want to watch those shows on DVD or listen to them on CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ladybug S & P Shakers","review":"The Ladybug Salt and Pepper Shakers were great.

In addition, it's a darn good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LET ME BE YOUR FRIEND","review":"Gotta agree with all the others. This is a great album/disc. Had the album, bought the disc. The harmony and the arrangements are just right on this. What A Shame, Let Me Be Your Friend and one other song that escapes me at the moment, are worth almost any price you can pay for this disc.

This book is a general, high-level overview of the core features of XSI, accompanied by tutorials covering most of those features. Although I am very familiar with most of the information presented, there were still enough tidbits of cool info to make the book worth the price for me.If you are an advanced user - or looking to examine any of XSI's features in depth, however, you will probably be disappointed.

Make sure to get a Phillip head impact wrench to remove the 2 screws that hold the disc in place. It would make it a lot easier to remove the old discs with the impact wrench.

Night after night I laid on her favorite old rug crying, engulfed in loneliness and sorrow at her passing. To me it was the end of the world and no amount of comforting by my parents or friends could ease the pain. She had been my faithful companion, and since I was an only child she was in many ways my sister. As I grew older the grief subsided but the all of the lovely memories did not. When I read \\"A Cat's Life, Dulcy's Story\\" by Dee Ready, I knew there existed at least one more person on earth ( and one more pet in heaven!) who felt EXACTLY as I did. It made no difference that Dulcy was a cat and Tina was a dog; they were the same in spirit to each of us.

If you aren't familiar with the Players' catalog, these are the cds to get: Pain, Pleasure, Ecstasy, Skin Tight, Fire, and Honey...with Honey being the best. Contradiction has about 3, maybe 4 good songs, with \\"My Life\\" being the only one not available on a compilation. \\"Orgasm-Best of the Westbound Years\\" and \\"Funk on Fire\\" will take care of any other songs you may want from the group.

DJ Hurricane (of BEASTIE BOY fame) does an EXCELLENT job on tracks 7,9,10, & 12. A.J even hands the mic over on track 10. Very creative. There are not any tracks that I didn't like. Even the hidden track IRISH MAN LOST IN SPAIN is cool. If you have ever seen Vallejo live, you can completely imagine them closing the show with this one!

They dig the tank out and fix it to use for their escape from the desert. One of the crew finds a treasure of jewels the Nazis stole from the Arabs, hidden inside the tank and he plots to keep it for himself.Arabs attack the tank to retrieve the jewels while the other crew members do not understand why. There is a lot of action in the running battle. The story line unfolds nicely with the severity of life in the dessert intensifies the struggle.Morality prevails in the end. All the bad guys get their just due. The bad guy on our side repents sacrificing himself to save the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steel Lady review","review":"This is a very well done adventure/mystery that is probably missed by a lot of people! Rod Taylor and Tab Hunter do an exceptional job of acting and the plot is very interesting! Getting the old German tank running again to save their lives is a hoot! It's a picture well worth watching!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I resemble that remark","review":"Having grown up in a small town in the \\"HEARTLAND\\", and being involved in the raising of four children myself, I can identify with many of the situations described in the book.

The vocab lists seem to be an afterthought, with no consideration regarding parts of speech, gender, number, etc. Very many typos make checking your work an adventure. Frustratingly does not spell out the more complex paradigms, clearly in an effort to conserve space, and therefore money. (eg, \\"Doubly Weak Verbs\\", p. 91).

Now, however, we're also treated to right-wing propaganda. This \\"novel\\" is a thinly-veiled brainwashing tool to convince susceptible teens that the separation of church and state is a bad idea, that public schools are evil places, and that only those who follow contemporary American conversative Christianity are good people.Again, the publisher and author should be ashamed. Keep your kids far, far, far away from this drivel. With so much high-quality YA fic on the market that really challenges kids to think, something this absolutely, horrifingly simplistic, condescending, and bad does not even deserve a readership."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Alright Read","review":"This book is just average at best.

I'm not talking about his \\"orientation\\" --that is something he seems to be well comfortable with, I am just saying this man is too envious of the women he writes about. It is almost depressing the way this envy is displayed in an otherwise charming book. He always has and always will want to be a wacky woman. And so he wrote a book about a hand full of women who have lead note-worthy and interesting lives. There is good material and research in Doonan's project,and it would make a HOOT of a film! But the book. . . let's say, with a tad bit of regret, is skippable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your Time","review":"From the other reviews I thought I'd like this book.

Of a style i have not experienced with any other playwright, i have seen two of these shows performed and both of them were thougroly enjoyable. Cartwrights hard hitting style really gets you going if you are easily upset then you may be offended or indeed upset by the content. The dialoque in the playes is a mixture of surrealism and hard hitting realisting arguments. Many isues are dealt with such as mental illness suicide extream politics abuse and others. some of them are dealt with in a very subtle way that if you catch them they really make you think.

This lavishly illustrated book explains the cusine's most exotic ingredients (cloud ears, bok choy, szechewan peppercorns and much more) in a way that's accessable to the uninitiated. Also included are invaluable explanations of Chinese cooking techniques (red cooking, stir-frying, steaming) and a short section of recipes. Even if you've never picked up a wok before, this book will have you cooking like a pro in no time. Especially valuable is the book's small size, which makes it perfect for trips to the Chinese grocery, which can otherwise be more than a little intimidating for newbies. Hom explains what brands to buy, and which to avoid (soy sauce from Singapore is lousy). My dishes have improved 1000% since I starting using the authentic ingredients. With this book as your guide you can't go wrong.

In my mind's eye, I can see StarChild conducting an interstellar orchestra on the intro to \\"Long Way Around, and Bootsy draggin' the whole P-Funk gang behind while his Space Bass walks through \\"Let's Play House\\". Indeed, Funk Is Its Own Reward...PEACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not essential P-Funk!!","review":"I only recommend this to hardcore p-funk fans. This has got to be the weakest of all their records. It's a matter of taste though, and if you like synthesizers and that obscure 80's funk sound, minus the drum machines, then you might like this. Bootsy is all over this one too, which is I why I was surprised by its weakness. He must have been more focused on his solo work at the time. The only reason I gave this any stars is because it is Parliament. Out of all the p-funk records, only two are below par, and this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As The Frist!","review":"This collection of Kipper stories is as good as the \\"first\\" video.

I recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for a Two Year Old","review":"I like Dr. Sears and his parenting advice and I appreciate that this book shows pictures of breastfeeding, cosleeping, etc. However, my two year old found this book to be terribly boring and isn't interested in it enough to read through it even once (and he loves to read books!). The illustrations are just very flat and the story is extremely boring. The book goes into every aspect of what you'd want to teach your child about potty training- but I've already told my son these things (wash your hands, etc.). I guess I didn't need an instructional book for my son, but a book to get him excited and actually wanting to try using the potty once he understood what was involved. I recommend the books \\"Super Pooper\\" and \\"Potty Pirate\\" for this purpose and he also loves the movie \\"Potty Power\\" and will sing the songs from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"All of the principles meshed with my own","review":"I LOVE this book because it reinforced principles that I agree with.

THANK YOU SEARS FAMILY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"After all the rave reviews this book has gotten I was surprised to be disappointed. My 21 month old daughter who LOVES books found this book to be utterly boring. (We began potty training about a month ago.) I tried reading it to her on several occasions but she lost interest after a couple of pages every time. Maybe it would be better for an older child. It seemed to have too many words and was very long.I liked that they showed a baby breast feeding and a father being involved with everything. However, the illustrations were uninspired. The text is very straight forward which is either a plus or a minus (clear or boring?) depending on your point of view. It is definately instructional.I will just have to keep looking for a potty training book I like. Or not. My daughter seems to be doing just fine without one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on potty training.","review":"This book and \\"My Big Boy Potty\\" are the best books I could find on potty training. Realistic situations addressed.My son appreciated the introduction reviewing that he used to be a baby and needed lots of help from mommy and daddy, but now that he is growing up he can do big-boy tasks. This helped him feel that going pee/poop on the potty really were events that helped differentiate him from babies.Good photos - appreciated the attachment parenting references."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great engaging toddler book","review":"My daughter loves to read this book. It is simple and has great pictures. She has had some initial hesitation with the potty, but there were several reassuring messages in the book. One page shows a child sitting at the potty and reassures them that its ok if nothing comes out. Also, there is a page that deals with accidents being ok. I also liked how the authors referred to kids at this stage as \\"growing up kids\\". Definitely a great book and very relevant if you have practiced attachment parenting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"My son (2 1/2) loves this book.

His voice is a beautiful combination of gospel, country and bluegrass with hints of hillbilly!

Her exquisite vocal quality and her professional approach to each song are just a tribute to her years of singing meaningful lyrics.

And Barbara Cook is keeping it all alive. I personally prefer the ballads to the upbeat tunes, but only because the upbeats don't really do justice to her lovely voice. \\"I Can't Give You Anything But Love\\" and \\"Exactly Like You\\" are a little too campy. But the other ten songs are absolutely perfect.

I mildly enjoyed the first track but to me the rest was simply boring.I do understand that people may be looking for slow, relaxing music in order to reach altered states of consciousness, but if this is what you are looking for, I already have a collection of CD's that I think are much better at it.To put it plainly, this album is neither good for active listening, nor is it for passive listening.I also need to add something: this is the second time I buy a CD basing myself on its reviews, and it it the second time I get disappointed. I wish there would be more realistic reviews out there.

The only instrumental accompaniment needed for these albums was lovingly provided by Norman Paris (of \\"I've Got a Secret\\" fame) and his trio (piano/celeste/accordion, bass, and guitar). Norman was a marvelously gifted musician and arranger, and put great loving care into his arrangements, keeping Portia's voice as the focal point.Sadly, I found out that Portia passed on some time ago, but we are fortunate to have her music around for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Miss You Orange Spice Latte","review":"I have in my possession a very lonely, empty can of General Foods Int'l Orange Spice Latte.

It starts with a quirky musical duo involving vacumn pipes, I lacked any appreciation of this. I appreciated the human kindness side of this DVD but I found it lacked interesting outcomes. This is about a lovely lady who is doing her masters in storytelling. So it was mainly about her doing a show to show her skills. I learnt what she was like as a child and some of her family members. She has good potential for more in depth storytelling, but this show just left me cold. I ended up with a hunger for content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atlas Snowshoe tote","review":"The bag is plenty big and fits the shoes easily, but the zippers are very small and not rugged at all.

She was doing fine on 1996's Moods...Moments (it did go gold, after all). When I heard \\"Touch It\\", which only sounds good in the club, I knew that no good would come out of this album.There aren't many good tracks on here (well, there probably was back in 1998 when I bought it, but there are none worth remembering today). In fact, the only good song is the very last one, the gospel-flavored \\"I'm Loving You\\". This album made me not want to buy her following album, Home (but I don't think anyone else bought that album, either). If you wanna hear great R&B, I recommend her first album, but definitely NOT this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I can't believe people are allowed to write music like this.

If you have ever tried to use a PSP to veiw video you know the speakers are not all they could be. The product pictured clearly shows speakers, a headphone jack, and a stand all integrated into a recharging dock. However the product delivered does not have speakers, the power jack is of very poor quality and unreliable and as a stand it isnot very secure. So all and all it actually works worse than the stand I already own with an actual slot to plug in the SONY power cable and full back to support the PSP. Plus it cost 3 times as much. Maybe I was just the unlucky one who didn't get what he ordered, but for me this was a total letdown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Upset","review":"I thought for sure I would be getting what the picture shows however, I did NOT.

This is practically a scam, isn't it? Of course, there is no speakers, and if you got slim, you won't be able to charge it using this because the the power thing doesn't actually gets plugged into it. Unless they meant that it gets charged through USB, than sure. It's pretty much a plastic to put your PSP on.

Unfortunately the female fight club part of the plot never develops. Instead it's seven sex scenes strung together by humorous dialogue and bad acting. Joslyn James character Cindy has sex with a cop, a jail guard, her lawyer, a crimeboss, and last but not least, her fight club rival Sascha played by Kylee Nash. Kylee Nash also has sex with the cop and crimeboss. I was disappointed in the lack of catfights but was impressed by how hot Kylee & Joslyn are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seascapes","review":"I am very pleased with the service I received ordering this CD.

I so loved it the first time I heard it (1989) that I vowed to have it playing at my wedding and in 1996 I did just that.

One of Ms. McBroom's greatest qualities is an ability to draw you into the music. With her you do not only hear the song, you feel it....in a way that is genuinely heartfelt, rather than neurotic. I have to say that my own personal favorite is \\"The Dieter's Prayer,\\" a song for anyone whose love of food is as great as their love for music.

True, this CD is very inexpensive, so $$$-wise it's not a huge loss. My problems is that I already bought this as \\"One Night Only\\" and now I bought it again.

I was fortunate enough to see it at Princeton's McCarter Theater when it premiered 3 years ago. Griller (which I have now read but have yet to see performed) is a fun backyard piece featuring a handful of personae Bogosian developed in his solos. But I think my favorite of the three is Red Angel. I had the great pleasure of seeing Bogosian perform in Angel in Williamstown 3 years ago and it's a very powerful play, sort of a postmodern Pygmalion.

I lived in Viet Nam for five years. I have been to Phu Quoc island and seen the fish sauce factories there, as well as those in Mui Ne and Nha Trang.

It's enjoyable reading also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this book, improve your life","review":"This book is an outstanding reference. Michael Murray has written a book that will help change your life. I have lost 22 pounds in the past 3 months and improved both my health and well being using the recipes and guidelines in this book. As part of a healthy diet, juicing can change your life.I bought this book after reading the many other reviews and wanted to take the time to come back after I had actually used it to provide some input. This book combines a wide variety of recipies with nutritional information and very helpful advice, of all of the books I have reviewed and/or purchased, this is by far the best - buy this book, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Juicing","review":"This is a wonderful book for all your juicing needs.

However, I agree with a previous review that it is poorly organized. It isn't what I expected and sadly, I am probably going to return it.

Forgot about it. When I finally picked it up and read it, I could not put it down. It has a wealth of information for anyone interested in nutrition.

In this version, the illustration and text don't even match. The troll is described as having a nose as long as a poker and eyes as big as saucers...but the troll in the pictures has a bulbous nose and unremarkable eyes. I don't know if it's an exact translation from Norwegian, but the grammar is occasionally ackward. The metaphors in the speech given by the biggest Billy Goat to the troll have to be explained to a younger audience...which isn't bad in itself but contributes to the uneven flow in the text. The pictures are good, too bad the writing isn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"unhapy with this book","review":"I was looking for a few classic titles for my 3 year old son. This came up as a suggestion.

I was never quite the fanatic when it came to this band, so when I first heard this album, I was blown away at how good they have become. I was always a fan of their R n' B flavored work, especially the \\"Uptown Avondale\\" EP back in '92. This album is that good and more, much much more. It's a lusty, sweaty rock record that follows poor Greg Dulli from one failed relationship to another. He quotes Nas and Pink Floyd, he includes pounding piano solos and gospel backgrounds, and basically shapes together one of the most solid albums of the '90s. Think mid-eighties Replacements, early seventies Stones, and a little Bauhaus thrown in for good measure. While critics were peeing their pants over the latest French techno bores, this album went unfairly unnoticed, but if you buy it, you can avenge the Whigs fate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Ain't Angry Anymore","review":"Boy oh boy is 1965 a good album. Where it lags in burning intensity (you have to truly love women to have understood that Dulli's 'Gentlemen' was a labor of love, not a condemnation of the fairer sex) 1965 shines in slick beauty and funky optimism. We're talking saxaphones and drum triggers, folks, but I'm here to tell ya...it works. '66' is a must hear...every women I've played this for loves it (however noone cares for it's Dulli-lovesexy intro \\"Sweet Son of a Bich\\"). On '66', Dulli finally reveals why he has dwelled for so long and so ardently for the hotty's: \\"Come on come on come on little rabit, show me where you got it cause I know you got the habit\\". Way to be boys. I still love the old boy vs. girls madness of Congregation, but on tunes like 'Uptown', 'Crazy', and '66', the Whigs finally let the girls come up to the treehouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afghan Whigs-1965","review":"This CD features cover art with a border around the astronaut photo.

Even though I didn't like it one bit the first time I heard it, I thought I would give this album a fair chance, so I listened to it several times. I bought it for the song \\"Crazy\\" which I do like, however, everything else on this album is just plain boring and awful. I don't think this band is very lyrically talented, and the song with the chick moaning is very trashy. I was listening to it at work, and it's a good thing the boss didn't walk in or I would've had some explaining to do! So needless to say, I got rid of it, and will never buy anything else from this band. Don't take my word for it though, because the other reviewers seemed to like it. I just didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dulli and the Whigs display rare genius...again!","review":"Modern, smart, and unlike any other band anywhere. Who else can you say that about? Most tracks are strong on lyrical wisdom and have more music goin' on behind them than any 3 bands usually produce. Greg Dulli has a fresh \\"tell it like it is\\" bluntness that appeals to those who want thier music to strike closer to the bone than most commercial radio BS does today. Not as stellar as \\"Congregation\\" (please bring back drummer Steve Earle! ), but still one of the most under rated recordings in recent memory. Buy all Whigs albums NOW, before everyone else finds out about America's best band since R.E.M."},{"rating":"2","title":"<><><>","review":"I hate to start this review with a negative comment but it boils my blood when people give a two star review to thisrecord because it's not up to par with Gentlemen or of allalbums, Up In It.

Yes, Gentlemen was a turningpoint, but not a final nail in the the coffin. If you wantrepetition listen to ac/dc.

And the 3-D effect was pretty good. The problem with this set, which is why I gave it only two stars, is that while the first two discs are ostensibly in 3-D, you don't get any glasses with it. The back cover claims the video features \\"incredible depth perception optical illustions when viewers wear 3D glasses!\\", but there are different types of 3-D glasses (red/green or polorized), so I doubt that many people are just going to happen to have a couple of extra (and compatible) 3-D glasses lying around. A 3-D video without the glasses is, quite simply, not in 3-D.

This is one of those books, but it is very good. The author peppers the book with plot twists that keep the reader on his toes.

I recommend it to all Ann-Margret fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ann-Margret reveals her true self","review":"Ann-Margret is one of the most private Hollywood Legends ever...her candid tale is so riveting and just terrific, it's not to be passed up! She is truly a legend and always will be...you will respect her even more after reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too narcissistic for my tastes","review":"I had the audiotape version, read by the author, and was surprised at how hokey it sounded, given that she is an actress. I mean, I expected a better reading. Not sure how well it represents her, but the book makes her come across as a bit shallow. I've enjoyed her movies, but found this book a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great autobiography by one of the best!!","review":"She has always been one of my most favorite entertainers. She is a truly remarkable woman and reading this book reinforced that fact. I enjoyed every page. Well done, Ann-Margret!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Some may think that Ann-Margret showed class when writing this but actually it's just boring.It goes along like a freight train, no depth, substance or insight. Comes across as an extemely vain woman who is manipulated by her manager/husband. Where was the gossip, this is what sells a book, not all the rubbish in this.Avoid at all costs. Totally void of any depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glorious combination of pure beauty and intelligence","review":"What a joy: a CD that can be enjoyed for the pure sound: a voice that that makes listeners gasp. Part of what is so shocking, apart from Ms. McDonald's glorious vocal range, is the intelligent choice of music she has recorded. Ideas emerge. She does not rely on familiarity, but rather nuance and meaning. Every word as well as every note should be savored. Racism and abortion? I have not heard another debut CD that addresses such subjects with such emotional vocal clarity, without losing the rage or the joy."},{"rating":"1","title":"She has a wonderful voice, but this was not for me.","review":"I bought this CD solely on the strength of a rave review in the Sunday paper. It was difficult to find, but I did track it down at Borders. Imagine my surprise when the music was modern, confusing and unrecognizable. This is simply not the type of music I enjoy; if I don't have the urge to sing along, I don't enjoy listening, either. After several listens, these songs are still too free-flowing for me to grasp. The subject matter of the lyrics is controversial, which would be OK, but there is a distinct judgmental christian attitude that will be offensive to many. I will listen a few more times, but I think this was $16 down the drain and I'll probably give it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"A brave but disappointing debut CD.","review":"Having loved Audra McDonald in \\"Carousel,\\" \\"Master Class\\" and \\"Ragtime,\\" I eagerly awaited her debut CD and couldn't wait to get it in my CD player. But this is a collection of songs that is quite difficult to wrap your ears around. The lyrical content is good, but the melodies try very hard to out-do Sondheim in terms of atonal histrionics. The result is a screeching mess. While McDonald should be applauded for taking artistic chances, I had hoped this CD would showcase her superior voice in a better way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long awaited bridge between Classical and Broadway styles","review":"You can't compare her to anyone before her because she is truly original. She does what the Opera singer is not allowed to do, which is express in gush loads, and she does what the Broadway or Pop singer can't do which is sing effortlessly, without technical restriction. No ugly, nasal honky, sounds here!For those who gave her a low rating because of the \\"inaccessible\\" tunes, my suggestion to you is to crank up the sophistication level of your listening. Oversimplified commercial music is death to the future of a growing art :]"},{"rating":"2","title":"When I'm old, I can say I listened as a star was born!","review":"Hereing this CD gave me hope for a broadway great and a legendary singer. Her angelic voice gives you no choice but to feel every lyric of the song. Originally spectacular is my way of describing this CD. I am proud to have seen her take her own road with these lyrics. An obvious risk in our day, when so many just want to here the same oldies, but goodies. That risk is a tribute to Audra and her art. I believe this CD is the beginning of a legendary carrier. If that's the road Audra chooses to fallow in years to come. I love a girl with enough in her to strike her own key in show business. After all. Didn't all the \\"greats? Musically she has opened a door for new thoughts and ideas. I admire her. I look forward to hearing more her music. Audra's voice bring these lyrics to life. As should any profound singer. You ahve no choice but to feel the songs along with her. Keep 'Em coiming Audra!!! <3"},{"rating":"2","title":"You Need To Buy This CD!","review":"First of all, her voice is utterly amazing. I will admit I was not fond of some of the songs at first, but the best music is the music that grows on you. Believe me, these songs will grow on you. The \\"Stars and the Moon\\" alone is enough reason to own this cd. I cannot stop listening to that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly moving; exquisitely done","review":"I bought \\"Way Back to Paradise\\" in 1998, when I was a junior in high school, and it has yet to leave my CD player.That's a testament to the supreme musicality of this CD and of Audra McDonald's oceanic talent. She is, without a doubt, one of the most gifted and transparently honest singers of all time.\\"Paradise\\" grew on me, and I keep finding the subtle power in each perfectly executed song: \\"Dream Variations,\\" \\"Daybreak in Alabama\\" and \\"Song for a Dark Girl\\" are splendid interpretations of Langton Hughes' poems; the title song, \\"Way Back to Paradise\\" combines McDonald's voice with Dawn Upshaw's; \\"Come to Jesus,\\" \\"Mistress of the Senator,\\" \\"Tom\\" and \\"Stars and the Moon\\" are presented with such character and depth that they each song becomes a musical theater journey; and \\"Baby Moon\\" brought so much joy -- and optimism -- to my heart I just had to keep on listening.This is marvelous debut and a stunning achievement. It can't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diva magic","review":"Not easy at first as you are probably expecting the \\"standard\\" Broadway fodder, but so worth persisting with.\\"You don't know this man\\" from \\"Parade\\" is truly wonderful especially if you know the context in which it is sung in the show.These hitherto unknown songs have made me appreciate the works of Adam Guettel and Jason Robert Brown (congratulations on the Tony!) in particular.Audra is debuting in London at the Donmar Warehouse in August 99 in the \\"Divas Season\\" following on from Patti Lupone. It should be a good month for us diva fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice 10 Songs 3","review":"Brava to Ms. McDonald's championing of a new generation of theatre composers -- too bad their songs aren't better. Most of them seem to be aping Sondheim's worst flaws -- dreary tunelessness, vague muddy tonality and harmonies, fussy overly-self-conscious lyrics -- while NOT aping Sondheim's real strengths -- his fierce theatricality and turbulent romanticism.The songs on this album are vaguely, weakly experimental but ultimately academic and inert sounding. These songs are NOT the future of the American Musical Theatre, I hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true disappointment","review":"With such a magnificent voice as hers, I was hoping it would be used for songs which are at least \\"singable.\\" The songs here are way out in left field. I, like a handful of others, have listened once and that is all. I hope future albums by McDonald will be full of songs which emphasize her wonderful voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"an atonal mishmash","review":"After reading a glowing review of this CD in the newspaper, I could hardly wait to buy it. I have loved her voice ever since I first heard it. What a disappointment. Not a melody of any kind in sight and nothing to spin around in your head to enjoy when the music ends. Now, if I just knew someone to give it to who doesn't like music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"C'mon folks, let's get real. Audra McDonald is quite a talent, no doubt about it. I've seen her on stage four times and she's riveting. But the material on this CD is awful. If these guys (Adam Guettel, John LaChiusa, et al) are the future of musical theatre, we're in big trouble. During their formative years, they should have mixed a little Jerry Herman and Cy Coleman into their listening habits, instead of nothign but Sondheim and Kurt Weill.Even Audra can't rescue this dreadful music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Micros are GREAT!","review":"I can't believe I missed these guys when they were active in the '80s. I have been listening to jazz for most of my life, since the '50s, and have seldom been so entertained and pleased by music. They are odd, they are quirky, but do they ever swing! Many of their songs stay in my mind long after I have heard them, especially their Lobster songs. If you like music that provides unexpected moments and a sense of humor, you have to get this CD. While you are at it, get their other CDs as well. Volume 1 is just as good as this one, and their latest effort, \\"Lobster Leaps In\\", which came out recently, is also a winner. Any band that plays a song named \\"Waltz of the Recently Punished Catholic School Boys\\" certainly deserves your attention!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now out-of-date","review":"This version has been eclipsed by Acid Music 2.0. The differences between the versions are significant, and it's well worth the extra money to get the latest version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date","review":"A fair amount of the information is now out of date. For example, costs are shown in Irish Pounds but the currency of the Republic of Ireland since January 2002 is the Euro. A fair number of the listed restaurants have closed. I'd wait for the next edition or be sure to carry another book or two."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had a Blast!","review":"I used this book just a few months ago and was thoroughly pleased. It appeals particularly to a younger age group, when it mentions the glam clubs and pubs. I will use the Hanging Out Series for later travel abroad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable","review":"This dull book suffers from all the weaknesses of Pope's writing and none of his strengths. Reading this book was like wading through the LaBrea Tar Pits. Way too much detail on trivial matters and little action and suspense. Just when things begin to get interesting, Pope pulls the rug out from under the reader and leaves him wondering what is going on. This happens over and over. There simply is no climax to any of the episodes. They just fizzle out. And they aren't filled with anything to keep the reader interested. The whole story--Ramage capturing several bomb ketches, sinking two frigates--should be a jolly ol' read. But it isn't. I'll keep plugging along with this series, but hope the next one is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pshhh","review":"The candy was completely stale.

Glad I got it cheap and second hand!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful to hear again!!!","review":"This album was Kellee's debut, and a great lite-jazz effort it was. With the exception of one track (\\"Soul Daddy (Lady)\\"), this still sounds current - not dated (it was originally released in 1973). Though, Kellee (former Miss Indiana) had the habit of attacking a note just under pitch, she never stayed that way, but hit each note correctly once her vibrato kicked in. True, her voice was on the nasal side, but it worked. She should have made more albums in this vein - not to take away from her other albums (especially her last two, which were more disco than jazz or R&B), but this release was the most cohesive. Even the lyrics were topical (i.e., \\"Magic Wand of Love\\"), but also timeless. This is probably the best sounding, sonically, of the reissues of Kellee's albums that I've heard. Her small catalog of releases should all be given the tender care that this stellar release was given. Whatever happened to Kellee Patterson?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great camera case","review":"This camera case works great for digital cameras.

It seems to very durable and sturdy with plenty of padding in the camera pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great case at a great price","review":"This case is great. My Canon S100 fits in it perfectly, with a little room to spare (its not a tight squeeze). The extra pockets are a little slim, about enough or an extra memory card or an extra battery, that's about it. But its a great, well made case, that is perfect for carrying around, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains hydrolyzed wheat protein - not Gluten-free.","review":"Be aware that this fish sauce is not gluten-free.This brand of fish sauce was highly recommended by a popular food blogger who posted an enticing recipe I wanted to try. I figured I'd try her favored brand of fish sauce... until I saw the ingredients. The inclusion of hydrolyzed wheat protein is a big disappointment. I decided to pass on this one.I did find another fish sauce that looked promising, based on the reviews:Thai Fish Sauce - 24 oz. Ingredients: anchovy extract, salt and sugar. That's all that's needed. I just received it and cooked with it for the 1st time - love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CHILD DEVIANT","review":"I love this album and I'd like to give it a five start rating, but the same complaint I have always had with VAC is present on this album as it is on all VAC albums....there are always too many songs where the vocals are recorded too low to understand. Asside from that one complaint...there are sooo many good things to say about this album. In my opinion ( and yes, I am a total Electrohead) this is the best album in the \\"Between The Eyes\\" series released by Metropolis Records. My favorite songs on this album are \\"Sex Desease\\", \\"Let's Kill These Mother*******\\", and \\"The Calling\\". If your new to VAC, I would describe them as Neo Industrial/Heavey EBM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Stones Live with Mick Taylor !","review":"Great Compilation album.ALL Bonus tracks Are Live with Mick TAYLOR!

If you call or email them, you get a response or person on the line quickly who will walk you through assessing the problem and will send you out a replacement part, at no charge, asap. Companies like Baratza(and amazon.com) still understand how to create customer loyalty. If you need a conical burr grinder (any coffee enthusiast does), you'll get years of use and enjoyment out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This grinder lasted only 12 months and 3 weeks before completely breaking down.

Yvonne's voice held such a passion and emotion for the song that I knew I would need to hear more. I did not know that she had been the original Mary Magadelene until later.Great voice. This collection holds all her best stuff including most from her first solo album which I loved each song immediately. My personal favorite is \\"She'll Be The Home\\" which sings as if she is standing in front of the person she wants to love. This collection of Yvonne Elliman's is better than you think if you have not heard any other song but If I Can't Have You from Saturday Night Fever soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"4Elliman fans","review":"Yvonne Elliman achieved success in entertainment.Personally I enjoy listening to her vocalizing.I am biased to her being Hawaiian.Her collection of albums have not been issued on c.d.s.This c.d. highlights many of her more moving songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book on FX trading!","review":"The last 5-6 reviews were written by the same person with multiple ID's to boost the overall rating! The language is nearly the same. This book was written by someone with a basic understanding of FOREX; probably thumbed through a few books. The writing is terrible to follow and does not cover any material to allow you to grow as a trader. I doubt this guy ever made money trading FOREX!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Comprehensive","review":"Not recommended for beginners reading. I would think that the reader is hiding alot of knowledge from us and he would be writing another book to complement this.

J. murphy be better i think.Cant get much out of this book yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical Analysis Applications in the Global Currency Marke","review":"I like the method of layering the technical analysis instruments. My previous experience with charting had been incomplete at best. After reading this book carefully, I am able to apply well some of the methods. This doesn't mean just remembering the concepts, but also being able to be confident in using them in my daily trading. And I enjoyed the CD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical Analysis Applications in the Global Currency Marke","review":"\\"Technical Analysis Applications in the Global Currency Markets\\" is a truly comprehensive work that comes in handy for anyone who needs to make a living either trading or advising clients.The author doesn't take sides in presenting different aspects of chart analysis. He introduces a variety of charts, such as candlestick and point-and-figure with plenty of examples, allowing the reader to choose what is best for himself.Just like my fellow traders, I like very much his complete approach to moving averages and oscillators. We also liked the parabolic, a study that we came across many times on our charting systems, but never knew how to use properly. We do now, and we use it in all trending markets.I didn't quite get the Elliott Wave analysis, but after reaing the chapter a couple of times, I found that my Elliott software reader finally made some sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely lovely","review":"I personally prefer poem anthologies where the poetry is from a mix of poets, not just a collection of one poet's work. Americans' Favorite Poems will give you some very famous favorites, and also might surprise you with the works of lesser known (but still wonderful) writers.What I also loved about this treasure of a book was the comments. Robert Pinsky compiled the poems that people from around the US sent him and printed their comments as to why each poem was their favorite. Reading the comments of all these people - firefighters, students, forest rangers, doctors, homemakers, basically people from all walks of life - is often very moving, entertaining, or surprising (you'll see some of your best loved poems from new and delightful angles). You get a feel for why people love poems as they explain that love, that attachment to a particular poem, in their own words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rata Blanca: Greatest South American rock band","review":"1.

The author provides the meaning and the historical context of Leonardo's work, the publisher provides an outstanding outlet to showcase the immense work of Leonardo the painter, the engineer, the architect, the sculptor, the anatomist, the genius ahead of his time. The book is divided in three parts (each one a book in itself): Life and Work; the Complete Paintings; the Graphic Work. The book is beautiful to read and to watch and whatever is the price, take it!

I expected elaborate constumes and floats, but the grandeur and the color were spectacular. Although I would love to see it in person, I think a trip there might be even more fun when there were not such huge crowds. I was surprised by the beauty of the surrounding locations.

If the manufacturer could care less about what they put out there, I could care less about that manufacturer.Given every line has better and worse products, but this one is just the spit in the face of a consumer.

It pretty much ruined the entire meal I made it with. I also agree that it is VERY expensive and my one dinner I made with it took the entire bottle, yikes!

There were ones cheaper online, but I chose this one because it's claimed to be a Sony original product with the same capacity as the original. 2 months later, the battery has completely died and doesn't charge. Even before that, the battery's spring tabs that lock into the computer were completely flimsy. It didn't take much for the battery to pop out, causing my laptop to hard-shut down. The battery doesn't look like the original even though this is advertised as a Sony product. The case has differences in markings, color, and texture and the sticker is upside down compared to the original. I would say with confidence that this is a Sony knockoff.

However, I found that the book was not very useful for a less-than-experienced reader (specifically, me).The main thing that bugged me was that the cover makes it sound like a complete reference for everyone, but if you dig deep enough into the introduction, you're told that the book is written specifically for VB6 developers - and the rest of the book very much bears that out. If you are not a VB6 developer you may feel like this book was not written for you, and that's correct - it was not.This VB6 slant is so pronounced that I believe the front or back cover should have stated - very clearly - that this book is wirtten with the VB6 developer in mind. Better yet, the title should have \\"for VB6 developers\\" in it somewhere.

But the preparation and the subsequent life and post-life of astronaut Jerry Linenger was also fascinating and informative. It kept my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A window into the real world of an astronaut","review":"As Jerry Linenger capitvatingly and brutely describes his experience with the Russian traning center and MIR leadership, I was both shocked and amused. To the average person, it is unbelieveable that the Russian Space Program was so adhoc, unscientific and unorganized. The disorganization that is described is so prevalent that I wonder how the Russians could manage any space travel sucessfully.Before I read this book I imagined the life of astronaut was a hero's life, little did I realize the patience, team work and politics involved in Space travel.Recommended for it's great story and window into a world very few of us will ever experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"This book read like a novel.

But this book is 253 pages of self praise and I could barely get through it, particularly the first few chapters. \\"I am formally Dr.,Dr.,Dr.,Dr.,Dr. Jerry Linenger\\" \\"My name properly written is Jerry Michael Linenger, M.D, M.S.S.M.,M.P.H.,Ph.D.\\" The words 'me,my, I' predominate. Other people in the book are glossed over and no one is as smart and clued in as Jerry. The sequence of events is also organized in a disjointed way, it leaps from the present to the future to the past all within one chapter, and there are 27 chapters. It reads like a collection of articles. And he states and restates the same facts over and over. The book does cover some interesting ground, but overall it was disapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brave man, horrible author and book","review":"What a wasted opportunity. If Dr. Linenger could only have put aside his \\"mildy\\" egocentric personallity, and let someone else write this book--I wonder if an editor was even allowed a glance. Yeager, by Chuck Yeager and Leo Janos is a far superior read for someone interested in space pioneers. Too bad the services of someone like Mr. Janos were not employed. I believe everything Dr. Linenger wrote and yet the book had a very defensive tone. He cares too much about what other people think of him as evidenced by his endless rambling-on about how wonderfull he is. Somehow this encredible story comes across as a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Jerry Linenger belongs in space -- the earth is not big enough to fit his ego. The book is pretty boring and repetitive. How many times do we have to be reminded that the shuttle orbits at 17,500 mph !

A lot of the rest is constant reminders of how highly Linenger thinks of himself interspersed with tired space cliches.

Jerry Linenger depicts with incredible and touching details the five months he spent on board Mir. His hopes, his fears, his anger. The three heroes of Mir-22, Korzun, Linenger and Kaleri had not only to fight against technical failures, a fire, a near collision, but against the ground controllers as well. This book shows how a real hero faces loneliness, danger, death, and the grim conditions of life in an old space station. Any young American should read this book as an inspiration. Linenger has a very pleasant writing style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ego trip","review":"The book has some interesting anecdotes about life on Mir, but Linengers ego and continuous whining about the Russian space program makes this quite a challenging read.

Unfortunately, it's a baaad primer. Dubrin writes as though leadership can be reduced to a simple set of steps that almost anyone can master. I could almost hear someone on a late-night infomercial hawking: \\"You too can be a leader! Make more money; wield more power; have more people looking up to you!\\" Leadership is for the benefit of the followers, not the enrichment of the leaders. Leadership is something that one does for others, not for oneself. Dubrin's attempt at simplification is misleading at best.

Without the holder, it read perfectly in a variety of different locations around the rear-view mirror. I wonder if having less solid plastic might help resolve this issue.The other design flaw I saw with this unit is that you slide the E-ZPass to the left (when mounted on the windshield) to remove it from the holder. This doesn't work to well if you mounted the holder to the right of the rear-view mirror, the alternate mounting site suggested in the E-ZPass documentation I received.

The tension from gripping an EzPass pulls against the suction cup mounts until they deform and point in three new directions, opposite the curve of a windshield, and they'll never stay put again.

Before writing this review I read the 1 and 2 star reviews and I have to agree with some of what they are saying but in the end this author really pulled it off. The beginning is slow and being a big fan of authors like Clive Cussler and Vince Flynn this is not the action packed type of spy novel and Andrea is no Mitch Rapp, and neither is Karl Voss but that doesn't make the book bad. To call this a thriller is over stepping though. The book has exciting parts in it but it's a dramatic and very romantic (not smut) book.

Wilson spends plenty of time developing his characters, and you can feel connected to them throughout the tale.The story starts during The Blitz in London and is broken into three parts, each taking place roughly 25 years apart, although nearly all the action takes place in the first two parts.The plot is rather intricate, and if you'll have to pay attention if you want to have any idea who's on what side by the end, but it's basically a real-world, as opposed to super-hero, spy story.Wilson's writing style sometimes bogs down, particularly when describing places and their names as characters move about. If I was from Lisbon I probably would have enjoyed the turn-by-turn directions from street to street, but since I'm not it became somewhat tedious. Also, characters occasionally speak languages other than English without translation.All in, a good story with plausible characters that keeps you entertained."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reality of Spying","review":"I found what I liked most about this novel was its portrayal of the mundanity and unremarkableness of much of what a spy does. Most stories concentrate on the excitement and the intrigue of the espionage game but this treats it more realistically as a long winded grind of a process, punctuated with isolated instances of action and adrenalin. These spies have real lives that are totally unromantic but everything has a context, everything has a beginning and all actions lead to consequences. Wilson's spies are at turns both critical and meaningless to the cold war that spawned them. It spans about 50 years and ends as you would think a spy's life would, and I loved the authenticity of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Company of Strangers","review":"I think this book is better than the last few LaCarre books. And that's a pretty high standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring spy thriller","review":"This novel probably wins my prize as the most boring \\"thriller\\" I've ever read. I waded through the whole thing just to see if it would ever improve. It didn't, but I persevered right through to the disappointing ending. The main problem is that I didn't care about any of the characters. The female lead, a math genius turned spy, just drifts through life letting others manipulate her. The book had great potential but never grabbed me. Robert Wilson may be a fine writer, but he doesn't keep the pages turning for me the way Jack Higgins and the late Robert Ludlum do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused","review":"I love a good spy novel, so I ploughed my way through this even though I sometimes found it not credible. I loved the first part set in 1944 Lisbon with all of its Casablanca-like atmosphere and intrigue. Supposedly the heroine had led a sheltered life; yet she is sent off at age 18 to engage in a most dangerous game, and she actually comes across as quite worldly. I found the whole idea of inter-generational spying not very believable. At the end I found my self paging back through the book to see if I had overlooked a key character in the plot. I don't think I would go out of my way to read another by Robert Wilson."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"I'm sorry, I wanted to like this book. It is well written. However, it is written in what I would characterize as a pretentious style. I'm sure many may enjoy this style, but I prefer a more realistic, down to earth narrative. Tolstoy was literate but he wasn't usually pretentious.The main woman character also bothered me; she was just not believable. Maybe there are women who kiss men within hours of meeting them, but I don't know of any. (An expansion of my circle of acquaintances might be in order.) Possibly this was written for a more romantically inclined spy novel audience. I don't know.Rarely do I not finish a book, but this is one that I didn't. I would recommend Alan Furst over this author for a WWII spy novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A romance for men","review":"I am new to Robert Wilson. This book is the third Wilson book I have read. All I have read are entertaining and informative because they put a human face on historical events. The Company of Strangers is very interesting. The only negative, if it is a negative, is the life long love at a distance between the two main characters reads like a \\"romance novel\\" for men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Literate Espionage Thriller","review":"This book was a natural to win me over. First, it talks about the world of espionage in a fairly realistic way and puts some characterization to the players involved. Second, the writing here is really strong. The scenes come alive for me. The description of the burning piano in the first of the book really grabbed me and made me want to read more.This book will not appeal so much to thriller fans as it will to those readers who value the skill of the story-teller and his ability to \\"hook\\" the reader into the story line.I've got to read some more stuff by Robert Wilson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ending DOES Matter!","review":"An excellent sweep through 50 years of espionage, and the writing is excellent. Unfortunately the ending RUINED my enjoyment of this book. Things seemed as though they were about to end in a somber yet placid way, and then Wilson botched it. There will always be those who don't mind a sad ending, especially if the tale was already grim in nature and subject. There will, I'm sure, always be a percentage of us for whom such an ending will make us less likely to read that author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Parties What Do I Do? Buy This Book!!","review":"This book has Christmas Spirit on every page, with holiday games,crafts, and goodies from all around the world. It really brings out the child inside us all. With an added bonus of 13 pages for New Years Eve. I am a Parent and Day Care Provider, to me this book is as much a part of Christmas as the Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disctinctive musical conversations.","review":"If you are after 'groundbreaking' or 'revolutionary' or 'innovative' or 'new' you won't find it here-at least not in the sense one is used to hearing these overworked, misapplied adjectives. No, this cd runs more toward subtle, discrete and elegant. By their nature duo recordings tend to be conversational in nature, two performers engaged in give and take. 'Songs We Know' emphasizes this quality of sharing and finding common ground. Both musicians have distinctive individual sounds and a great part of the beauty of this recording is the spontaneous way in which their voices merge and join together-two voices of one mind seemingly. Introspective, thoughtful, yet extremely generous music making. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice system but will it last","review":"I bought this item from WalMart Aug 2006 and it is not working well now.I was very happy with it and used it almost every day for 2-3 miles.If it is only going to last 6 months then i need to think if i want to buy from them again. I sent a message on their web site but no response how to tighten belt up.The 90 day warranty 'is' an indication of how long you can expect it to last!Otherwise it has good options and fan, but wish it wouldn't drop the data when the safety ribbon lodges loose. I think I paid about $360 so is a $60 per month workout item. I may upgrade and pay more for a unit with better warranty and a year or more protection.I do not shop at Walmart anymore so will most likely buy online from another manufacturer.

Its $150 to replace it and I just bought this treadmill brand new 8 months ago for $400 and I already have to spend another $150 on it? Until it broke it was a good machine.

Routledge is shirking it's responsibilities by denying the book to those of us who can't afford it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Routledge should be ashamed of the price","review":"This appears to be an important book about a fascinating poem. But the price, $75 for a short book, is an insult to people who love poetry. It assumes that only academics or people who have access to a university library should be able to read this book. I am going to avoid buying books from Routledge as much as possible until they rethink their pricing.I hope the author continues to work and finds a new publisher, one that will price books so that the general public can buy them.Omeros itself is a wonderfully deep and constantly changing poem, worth rereading."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredible prices...","review":"why only this foolish prices...?

By all means, read the poetry of Derek Walcott.DO NOT buy this book. The notion that this author's ideas about Walcott's poetry are worth WAY MORE than the *book* its studies are about tells you immediately that whoever stuck this price-tag on *this* book DOES NOT understand art, or poetry, or value."},{"rating":"2","title":"W.C. Spencer Does It Again!!!","review":"W.C. Spencer is a one-man Blues band who has been entertaining audiences on the East Coast for several years now. His first CD, \\"Bluescat\\", was a great premiere effort that showed the talent of Mr. Spencer and should dispel the myth that One-man Blues bands are a thing of the past.On this recording He again treats us to a nice selection of Blues standards as well as a few gems that he wrote himself. With very few exceptions, Spencers plays the drums, bass, guitar, harmonica and sings, (all at once), and does it with the authority of a fully-manned Blues band. The results are genuinely fun to listen to and I'm hoping that we will hear more from this gifted artist in the future.i definitely recommend you give this recording a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"History is clearly worth the money","review":"Dune is one of my favouritebands, so off course I love this album. Their best songs put together on two CDs as well as some new songs and a PCgame(!) Some of the songs are also remixes of Dunesongs, indcluding one mix from beam & yanou. You shouldn't expect any of their classical pieces or more hardcoretechnolike music, these tracks are mostly taken from their eurodancelike period and sadly not even the original mix of hardcore vibes is present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay she sings....","review":"now she needs an arranger. I love Elaine Stritch but these songs for the most part sound the same. Elaine is often her own worst enemy and ends up just showing off (hey, I saw her years ago in Private Lives.

Ann learns that due to ill-trained wardens/guards and poor conditions \\"Prison makes the man who enjoyed beating fellow drunks in a barroom come out wanting to kill a policeman\\" (272). However, like in many of Lewis's novels, a solution is presented. Once a prison superintendent herself Ann preaches the virtues of better trained and better paid employees, cleaner and more humane conditions and an extended parole program. While at times Ann's ultimate destiny feels a bit unrealistic, overall, a solid portrait is painted of possibilities of the New Woman of the early twentieth century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit 14\\" register","review":"Not only did this flimsy deflector not fit over our 14\\" register, but the magnets are so weak that they would not stick to the painted metal.

The sound of Bag's Vibes and Trane's horn set the mark for quaility jazz. They trade solos so smoothy that they seem like the same thoughts just different instruments. Coltran's playing here is different Than his other stuff like African Brass or A love Supreme. It is straight foward and very smooth. Of course Milt's playing is top notch as well. Stairway to the Stars and Bags and Trane steal the show. This is a tremendous CD. It is in the Top five of the Fifty Jazz CD's I own"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some wonderful interplay and fine soloing","review":"There is some very nice interplay between Jackson and Coltrane on this album. It's the best I've ever heard Milt sound, as a matter of fact. I don't think he quite keeps up with Coltrane, but who can? \\"Three Little Words\\" is a Coltrane soling clinic, and \\"Blues Legacy\\" is a marvelously arranged and executed song as well. \\"Stairway to the Stars\\" litls along dreamily, the way a song with that title should. As mentioned, Jackson has never, in my opinion, sounded so fluid and confident and uninhibited. A great CD to add to any serious collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product is Mislabeled","review":"I bought this CD based on customer reviews and after auditioning the free audio samples on Amazon.

Analog vinyl LP's or magnetic tape (as a distant second) is the best way to go. You will NEVER know what you are missing out on without a decent turntable and tube amplifier. Try listening to this, Miles Davis' \\"Kind of Blue\\" or Kenny Drew's \\"Undercurrent\\" mp3 album and then find someone who owns it on vinyl and listen... you will never buy another cd or mp3 again and you may want a refund for all those mp3's you bought. Digital jazz is garbage and should only be used while jogging or when not really paying attention to the music (i.e. mowing your lawn)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Translation of this Ancient Text","review":"By far this translation stands out as the absolute best in my eyes. We will never have a \\"word for word\\" translation of this old book, and so we are left with comparing one translation with another. I study and practice Zen, and although The Tao Te Ching in a technical sense is not considered a Buddhist work, I would dare say it should be included as a Buddhist Sutra. This translation, for those of us who speak primarily in English, is quite illuminating and very deep.After having compared Richard Wilhelm's translation with 3 other sources, I've concluded that his is the most alive. I feel that my practice with Zen allows me to see this more clearly, so to me this work is synonymous with Zen Buddhism. I recommend that anyone, of any religious affiliation or philosophical background, grab this book immedietely. I don't think you will at all be disappointed.Enjoy!:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tao Te Ching Junk","review":"This crappy little book is overpriced and over rated.

It was more like a 10pm news trailer -- woman found walking city streets with nothing on but a hockey mask. I was expecting a book to explain what specific font conveys.

I learned a single fact which I had always been curious about - that the letterforms of smaller-point type are different from (not just smaller than) larger-point type in the same face - and that is a pretty elemental thing that most people interested in type are already aware of.More suprisingly, there are some serious issues with the layout and typography of this book. Some sidebars, which are in small type, are set in yellow. Small yellow print on white paper? Surely a legibility no-no. Also, each page serves as its own mini-essay (and I do mean MINI; on most spreads, only the right-hand page has any text, and even then sometimes only half a page) but lacks a headline, so the reader has no idea what the page is about.The only useful element in this book is the various type examples, which could easily be found elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!

The book does a very poor job of providing thorough definitions for a variety of technical terminology (i.e. page fault or virtual machine). Instead the author likes to use analogies to help put it in perspective I guess for the \\"non-technical\\" individual, but it really doesn't help. I mean if someone is using this book it's most likely going to be because they already have some kind of technical backround... you would have to in order to understand it. I personally appreciate more comprehensive definitions as opposed to cute analogies (i.e. like driving a vehicle and whatnot). On the flip side of that, while they try to appeal to the beginner \\"techie\\", they also uses some acronyms that they do not even include in their glossary much less explain them at the time they mention them in the book.

I reccommend it to anyone that wants a stunning ring without having to pay a high price for the real thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"a beautiful catalogue","review":"This book was produced for an exhibition at the metropolitan musuem of art in 1994. It shows how visions of 'the exotic' in places like asia and the middle east have affected western dress over the centuries - right up to the present time.This volume is illustrated with numerous lovley colour photos of the exhibition pieces, which range from the 18th to 20th centuries. The text is quite light and easy to read, and the book does not have an index.I give this book 4 stars for the photo and presentation content, but I'd have to drop one off for the text content.

This album appeals to the traditional listener as well as the contemporary listener. If you need something to groove to in your truck, it's on the CD. If you need worship, it's on there.

There may have been many people who were not expecting much from him before going to the show, but those people were probably proven wrong. With just one performance of \\"I need you now\\", he made a big impact in a circumstance such that he could be easily ignored or forgotten.Besides the powerful hit song \\"I need You now,\\" his debut album features songs in traditional style such as \\"Still say, thank You\\" and \\"Praise Him.\\" Also, some influence by Stevie Wonder can be found in \\"It's all abou You\\" and \\"Same sad song.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"I NEED YOU NOW....","review":"THIS SONG IS SOOOO BEAUTIFUL!

It is a refreshing gospel album, especially being a male artist. Music in this category has been dominated by a select number of artists. This strong tenor with smooth velvety tonal qualities has a message along with his unique sound. At times, while listening to the tracks, it seems as if his voice has been around for years. Hopefully, the world will share this album by word of mouth so that the gospel that he shares through song will touch even the secular music enthusiast. There is something especially moving about the title song of this album. It is a timely and gripping message for the world as well as the individual listener. I am sure that Mr. Norful will have much success in his ministry of song. I hope and pray that the industry does all it can to welcome and celebrate his gift.

It has been a joy to hear him sing at church and an even greater one in hearing his cd. What I appreciate about Smokie is that he seems to introduce a new skool feel to his music, while maintaining that old skool gospel flavor. His music is a real, true testament of someone who has a strong yet humble relationship with the Lord. I say to buy this cd for all of your relatives and friends, for any occasion, because Smokie's lyrics speak to things and situations we have all encountered at some point in our lives...\\"After all that I've through, I just gotta say thank you....\\" And his music is so easy to groove to that you will want to hear the cd at all times of the day, no matter what kind of mood you are in. Please support this brother, y'all! He is a lover of life and Christ, and is indeed a blessing to Gospel music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it","review":"I must say that for a first project Smokie is banging with this one.

I love \\"I need you now\\" I find this to be a true love song to the father that is so well written as well as sung. Smokie voice has a flare to it and is never really boring.

In ones or twos, the stories are excellent. However, I don't suggest sitting down with the intention of reading the book cover-to-cover, as the effect would prove painful. Each of the stories leads to some unfortunate conclusion, a little reminder of the pain of human interaction or existence itself. The innocent and the guilty alike come to bad ends, as a human or cosmic malice seems designed to overtake all.A Freudian might feast on the clues to unhappiness found in Bowen's short stories; the rest of us might just note that heavy current of bitterness that pervades them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better for review than first-time study.","review":"Erik Friis' book, \\"Mastering Norwegian\\" is better for use as a review or second-year course than for first-time experience with the Norwegian language."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been waiting for some new material from Oops!!!","review":"As in the bonus track \\"Walk On By\\" which is MARVELOUS!Ratings out of 5:1.

But, the single was just lacking. There were only 4 tracks, it was less than 15 minutes long. The \\"Instrumental Version\\" of the song was pretty cool, I wish they would include those on more singles, but there wasn't much more on this single. \\"Walk On By\\" is a nice little non-album track, not the best I've heard, but it was pretty good. It's more of a slower song. The one remix included was pretty short. It's a cool little slower remix, not that dancy, but good nonetheless. I was expecting more remixes on this single, which would have been nice. This single is recommended for Britney fans, but not many others beyond that. All in all, this is just an o.k. single, and worth passing up.

Priscilla used Michael for his modeling connections and Michael used Priscilla just to be part of Elvis's world. I felt Michael was more in \\"love\\" with Elvis than he ever was with Priscilla. What he wrote about Lisa Marie I thought was really sad. She was a neglected and sad little rich girl. When Michael wrote about himself his actions were embarassing and egotistical. He was always comparing himself to Elvis. Priscilla sounded more into herself than with him or Lisa. It certainly did not help his career after his involvement with Priscilla Presley. The pictures in the book were wonderful! I think the book would of been better if Michael had help creating the stories in a format with better wording and deleted stories that had no basis to his life with Priscilla and Lisa."},{"rating":"1","title":"rubbish","review":"Not even worth a look I wish now I hadn't. He sometimes assumes things that Elvis did or said as if he knew him. Mr. Edwards didn't come into Priscilla's life until a year after Elvis died.This guy is a major creep and throughout the book it's as if he really thinks he's something. To say that Elvis and Priscilla decided to have Lisa Marie because their marriage was failing was pretty ignorant to say since Lisa was conceived during their first month of marriage and was born exactly 9 months after their wedding.I can't believe this guy admitted to having sexual and romantic feelings for a girl who is the same age as his own daughter (and in her early teens).I felt totally creeped out by this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bullshit","review":"Hi, I think this book is a piece of crap. The guy who wrote this book is a big looser. He has not comparision with Elvis at all. He wants to be better than Elvis trying to describe Elvis like stupid, fat and dump. He showed Priscilla like she was too much for Elvis. Also, this guy was kind the sick describing how he wanted to have sex with mother and daughter. I feel bad for Priscilla that had to live with this guy for 7 years. I actually this book make me feel soory for her. In conclusion, I don't believe what he said."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doorway To A Treasure House","review":"Wales has one of the richest poetic traditions in the world but it is not easily accessible, even to the Welsh. Most is in the Welsh language, which is famously difficult to translate. There is also no substantial Anglo-Welsh tradition as strong the Anglo-Scottish and Anglo-Irish: Wales has yet to find its Sir Walter Scott. This collection is a wonderful introduction to the treasures of almost 1,500 years of eclectic poetry. It begins with 6th Century epics, including part of \\"The Gododdin\\", the \\"Iliad\\" of Wales, and ends with some delightful \\"englynion\\" - short lyric poems that are distinctively Welsh in character. It can only give a flavour of the extraordinary range of poems from different periods, but these consistently beautiful translations include enough of the best examples of each to leave one wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welsh Poetry","review":"You have to be a nut to want this book. Welsh poetry is a strange, lyrical beast that cannot really be translated into English. We only get a flavor or the cadence, complexity and the sound of the language.

That's why I bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just to put it in one word: marvellous!","review":"I can't find words good enough to describe the performance level of this artist, as my English is too poor to express what it is really like.

Compay is always at his best, but the accompaniment here truly shines, a fine sugar coating on the tip of this pungent old Cuban cigar.The reviewer below was dead on. Segundo's sound truly is unique and irreplaceable. This is definitely \\"the best of life\\". Great stuff! Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Guitar magazine review:","review":"Ninety years of age seems a fine time to bring out a CD. Cuba's elder statesman of music, Compay Segundo, first found a wide listening audience in the USA with Ry Cooder's formidable Buena Vista Social Club album. But Segundo has been playing in his native land for almost seventy-five years now. Still, it's never to late to catch onto a good thing. This new, solo album features Segundo's haunting vocals front and center, accompanied by his armonico guitar, a seven-string creation with only six tones, the third string repeating a tone. He is joined by a variety of musicians, incuding Raimundo Amador and his flamenco guitar, and many others. The sound of Segundo's sons and other songs is a lilting, bouncing feel, propelled by the soft percussion of bongos and maracas. The music is sweetly evocative, perfect for dancing or staring into the bottom of a glass of beer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great example of the \\"undiscovered\\" Cuban music greats","review":"If you like Buena Vista Social Club, you'll love this CD. This CD features several examples of the incredible rich contribution that Compay has brought to the Cuban music scene. One of the things that stands out in this CD is the fantastic voices that Compay brought together to collaborate with him. Compay himself has a unique baritone voice but mostly he is backup vocals for others. Especially interesting are tracks with Martirio, a Spanish singer, and Felix Valoy whose sound is reminiscent of Benny More."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"This has got to be one of the best books I have ever picked up.

Well, it did not. Without color pictures, maps and other fancy illustrations I was not as keen on proceeding. That maybe tells more about my reading habits then about the book. So I bought \\"The New Sotheby's Wine Encyclopedia instead\\" which is really inspiring and I am reading it enthusiastically and gaining knowledge. At this point I am founding Daniel Johnnes's book to be good resource to help me find wine values.

It wasn't until the Bomp label in the U.S. issued a compilation album 'As Approved By The Committee', that they caught my attention. Coming so long after that movement had seen its heyday, I could never have imagined being so blown away by something that had slipped beneath my radar years earlier. So when I heard Bomp was reissuing the group's 'Untitled Second' with bonus tracks, I was very excited to hear more. And this record, like the previous one, does not disappoint. Maybe it's a weird kind of nostalgia that makes me appreciate this music now, or maybe there's simply a timeless quality to this kind of British Rock that will always be appealing. Whatever it is, it's music you can put on, and lose yourself in.

It is a collection of VBA implementation of some algorithms used in finance.The algorithms implemented are the simple ones, mostly of no practical use.You better buy a VBA book and Hull.

The original six songs from the 1945 movie and one from the '62 remake have been augmented with others from ALLEGRO, ME AND JULIET and PIPE DREAM to create a full Broadway score. The songs have been so beautifully interpolated that they all feel like they belong in the same show telling the same story. The orchestrations really swing, perfectly capturing the '40's post-War big band feel of the period in the extensive dance music.

We thought he would build it once and that would be it but now that he's got the hang of it, he likes to break it apart, put other lego people in the coach and try other ideas. The different speeds are fun, too. It's amazing how well the train stays on the tracks even at the highest speed which really whips it around.

He uses very simple melodies and hooks in this solo recording and it is genius.This is my favorite David Lanz. I enjoy this solo work much more then the other full instrumentation albums that tend to wash-out the woodsy resonance and intimacy captured by solo piano.i also reccomend another NARADA artist, Michael Jones, and his solo album \\"seascapes\\" & \\"sunscapes\\". Also the \\"music box\\" compilation.Michael Jones's creations are more virtuostic and abstract in their nature, but less melodic and demanding on the listeners attention then the simplicity of David Lanz, which is the beauty that his piano playing and this album, \\"Nightfall\\" represents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightfall...","review":"Having only recently been introduced to David Lanz's music, but having been acquainted with a diverse collection of other New Age work, my expectations were very high.This album as a whole did not catch my breath as some other New Age albums, but three songs in particular not only caught my breath, but also blew me away - 'Leaves On The Seine', 'Nightfall', and 'Courage Of The Wind'. Personally, these songs are up there with some of the most beautiful melancholic melodies ever created.A great tribute to piano music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off Artist Bundle","review":"Be warned, this listing is meant to rip you off.

This was precisely the sort of record that kept your parents out of your bedroom. \\"Why do you want to go and waste your money on this rubbish?\\", my Mum would say if she entered at the point in most Henry Cow tracks where it had disintegrated into a series of atonal improvisations and hittings and scratchings.The arrival of the Slapp Happy mob, in particular the voice of Dagmar Krause, imposed a song structure on some Henry Cow tracks, but it didn't stop them meandering off into many random avenues. Krause's delivery is almost operatic. You couldn't call it Lieder, but it is germanic.But this is very heavy stuff.

The best songs would have to be the 3 leading singles, \\"Living Dead Girl\\", \\"Dragula\\", and \\"Superbeast\\". The album is kind of short, coming up at only 38 minutes, but it's awesome nonetheless. The dark, sort of creepy theme of this CD is really cool. If you're looking for some good \\"horror rock\\", check this album out."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good but...","review":"Rob Zombie's first solo album may be good but it's not as good as his stuff in White Zombie. His solo stuff is more Nu-Metal than regular metal and is also kind of industrial. Don't worry as it's not completly Nu-Metal just like System of a Down as it has some guitar solos. The big problem is the song and album length. The whole album is only 39 minutes long and the songs are around the 3 minute mark most of them. White Zombie had longer songs. However the production quality of this album is awesome and the album has all the horror references are still top-notch unlike those horribly cheesy horror samples that plague the band Mortician!

The only swears are on the Song the Ballad of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore, which here is just titled the Ballad of Resurrection Joe. So you get one edited track! Count it, 1. Also the artwork is screwed around with. The Pentagram and the x on Rob's Forehead are removed, as well as artwork in the sleeve and no lyrics are given. The skull and Crossbones along the side are also gone. I purchased this by mistake a long time ago because it wasn't clearly labeled as a clean CD. that only infuriates me even more. This Edit is absolutely pointless and most of all, Stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Weak Edited CD's!","review":"I dig Rob. The man's music is awesome.

Rob Zombie's first solo work after he took a short leave from White Zombie. I remember telling fans that he'll go solo ONLY if this debut of his sells good enough for him to spark up a solo career. Looks like I was right, as Rob never went back to White Zombie since. Tracks here that will remain as true 'extreme metal' gems to us loyal long-timers include \\"Call Of The Zombie\\", the *ss-stomper \\"Dragula\\" (still like catching the video for this song), \\"How To Make A Monster\\", the awesome mosh-pit staple \\"Living Dead Girl\\" and \\"Spookshow Baby\\". Simply a must-have, if there's still anyone out there that doesn't possess a copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninteresting.","review":"You know, there's not many things I dislike about this album, so it's very hard to pan it. But there's also nothing I really love about it either, and therein lies the problem: The best music provokes the most extreme reactions. Zombie's earlier work with White Zombie certainly did. In being banned from performing in myriad Bible-belt states (can't remember which ones exactly), White Zombie were a lightning rod for outrage, with their Satanic imagery and lyrics.However, Rob Zombie's solo work doesn't do anything for me. It's not at all challenging musically, and the lyrics are very bland. It's not that Rob made a bad album; he made a safe album, and THAT's the problem with Hellbilly Deluxe."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the kiddies....?","review":"I'm sorry, but this new Rob Zombie is nothing next him with White Zombie. White Zombie was sheer madness and an excellent metal band, but now that Rob has went solo his music seems more like something you'd hear on a Goosebumps episode on Fox Saturday Morning For Kids or some crap. White Zombie was nothing like that. White Zombie was some dark stuff, but Rob is amusing for the first four songs and then you realize that it is just stupid, unoriginal, and very annoying. I think Rob Zombie's main fan base is centered more around 7th graders than real metal fans......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Living Dead Girl","review":"YOU GO ROB!

IF you felt the same way, look into Powerman 5000. Those guys are MUCH better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is one of those CDs you only buy for a few songs. The only good songs on here are Super Beast, Dragula, and Living Dead Girl. However, he just could not keep up with the great heavy sound that he produced in the first three songs. The rest of the album is boring and repetitive to the point of just plain BAD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have kept White Zombie together","review":"The post-White Zombie gets off with a whimper. Overproduced to the point it is a bad parody of what White Zombie did well and way too techno for a guy who put together the best metal album of the 90's in La Sexorcisto.

What's changed now you ask?? ROB has finally produced an album with a fair amount of consistency and energy. It's more focussed than any of his previous efforts. However, this album isn't a major departure for Mr.Zombie and tends to become repetitive towards the end. The constant reliance on electronica is occassionally irratating as well. Overall, Rob has successfully conceived an extremely vibrant, fresh and entertaining slab of sludge metal coupled with electronic elements that should please his long-term devotees as well as fans of heavy music in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're hard core, you'll love this","review":"I was really impressed with Hellbilly Deluxe.

I think that it is cool that he got new band members but whitezombie is still an awesome band . The new guitar and bassist is Blasco and Riggs. The best part of white Zombie and Rob Zombie is his voice. Rob Zombie can still draw pictures. This is one his best but just a little to anti-Christ for me. The way he wrote the lyrics was a little strange, he mixed them with his drawings. The CD is mostly good but after 4 songs you will lose interest until around track 10 and 11. This is a Must Bye.Reviewed by Ryan Schmidt 13/1/99"},{"rating":"1","title":"UG! But if you must own....","review":"This is your typical Rob Zombie outing. Sounds very much like his old band White Zombie. There are two great songs (Dragula and Superbeast), and the rest is pretty poor. It is no wonder to me that most of Zombie's concert material consisted mostly of old White Zombie tunes. This is perhaps because he knows that material is better than this. But if you must own this c.d. get the explict version. The edited edition is missing about half of the material in the c.d. jacket and the lyrics are missing. Also the music is edited. Swears and ojectional phrases have been deleted. Therefore compromising Mr. Zombie's artistic vision. This is not a great album, but is worth getting for Dragula and Superbeast. Makes you think, \\"If I had a dime for every time Rob Zombie said Baby....\\" If you want great Zombie, buy Astro Creep 2000 instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a light...over at the Frankenstein place...","review":"Man, I am so glad this album came out.

Then I found myself playing 'Spookshow Baby', 'Living Dead Girl',etc. in my head. Rob Zombie's 'Hellbilly Deluxe' just creeps into your soul with its infectious heavy metal-techno-pop grooves.

The production on this album is really brilliant. I just LOVE the awesome guitar sound !! Rob did some really cool stuff here and John Tempesta is sure one helluva drummer !! The songs are really catchy and groovy, but the techno touches are just one too many for me. However, this still stands out as one of the best metal releases I've heard this year !!

Dragula, Living Dead Girl, SuperBeast, Demonoid Phenomenon, Spookshow Baby, and The Balled of Resurrection Joe and Rosa Whore are all Good. The rest just seem a little under par. I wish I could give this cd 3 and a half, but it was closer to 4 then 3. If you like Powerman 5000, Korn, or Static-x you should get this. If you like this, then buy Supersexy Swingin' Sounds by White Zombie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spookshow antics are less amusing than obnoxious","review":"Most people who liked Astro-Creep seem to have enjoyed Hellbilly Deluxe, so I certainly can't recommend White Zombie fans to not buy this album. Still, here's why I didn't like it: I enjoyed the pumping, furious pace of Astro-Creep, which is nowhere to be found in Hellbilly. In the latter, the \\"scary\\" melodramatics added a humorous touch to an intense, energizing experience. In Hellbilly, the creepy facade is all that seems to be present in the repetitive, ho-hum songs. Sure, Zombie's lyrics have never really meant anything...it's all about the music. But any decent tunes on this CD seem to be repeated so mercilessly that I can barely resist skipping to the next song just for something new. I miss White Zombie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, but far too short","review":"I love every single song on this album. Rob Zombie kicks some major as* and I think he has great music.

But this CD (in my opinion) shouldn't be so popular. There's only 4 songs I like, and 3 of them are beginning to fade. They are \\"Superbeast\\", in which Rob Zombie sings with his trademark demon voice. The Girl On A Motorcycle mix is better, and you can get it off the \\"End of Days\\" soundtrack or \\"American Made Music To Strip By\\", Zombie's remi album. The 2nd is \\"Living Dead Girl\\", which I beleive was Zombie's first single for this album. It's very eerie and reminds me of a horror movie. The 3rd is \\"Dragula\\", which is getting very old. The 4th and last is \\"Meet the Creeper\\", and it's without a doubt the best.I reccomend this to anyone who's a fan of White Zombie, Powerman 5000, Ozzy Osbourne, or Marilyn Manson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy","review":"One of my favorite zombie albums post white zombie its has some great tracks and is an all around great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands down, a modern day classic metal album!!","review":"Definitely one of the classic modern day heavy metal albums and will be a classic beyond our years.

William Nicholson's Slaves of the Mastery isn't just a book for children and teens. It deals with mature issues such as slavery and violence. If you read The Wind Singer and didn't like it enough to read the sequel, reconsider, because this book is so much better. Kestrel, Bowman and Mumpo are unique, appealing characters and there is always a new spin on the story. As for me, I'm anxiously awaiting the third book in the trilogy. Read this book- you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The depressing but exremely gripping and everything book.","review":"This plays with your emotions. I dont understand how Nicholson can think up these things. Well, however he does it, it works. It is extremely gripping and clevery written. The characters are better than Harry Potter characters and match up to artemis fowl's, but with more variation and less sarcasm. It is full of family love and emotion. It is an adventure you musn't miss! Buy it. That's all I can say- buy it. I'm serious!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fabulous!!!","review":"This is an outstanding book. All the characters are different and unique in their own ways. I was glued to this book: I've read it twice and still love it. It is advanced reading and great for ages 10+. I loved it and I'm sure you would too. But it would make more sense if you read the first book, The Wind Singer, first because it would explain the characters. This is a great book and I have no bad thoughts about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked at the dark content!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the first book in this series so I was eager to read the second. I was dismayed at the dark turn this book takes. From the intentional burning of people to keep others in line, to the manaxa dances in which men wear knives and \\"dance\\" against an opponent with the \\"hopes\\" of inflicting injury and/or a kill, to the end of the book where the dejected suitor intentionally slashes a character's face in anger to destroy her beauty, this story is violent start to finish. There is also an erotic undercurrent with the wedding dance that must be performed by two of the main characters. Overall, I was disappointed in the tone of this book, especially for the age group it appears to be directed towards, (the back of the book recommends ages 9-11). I think the recommended age should be at least 13-17."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like dark, tribal, twisted and seemless mixesses? Come in!!","review":"I know everyone likes his Nubreed Mix but for me it has nothing on this cd. What I like best is that he uses some less popular songs and twist them so dark funky, it's just awsome! When I first listened to this cd I could not even tell when some songs ended and when others begun...Thats awsome mixing!! my favorite tracks are...well all of them. from track 6-7 on cd one the mixing is just unbelievable. With this cd and the Saeed and Palash cd out right now, with Lawler's light's out! cd out also, tribal house is back in full force.Keep hurting us Pappa!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep, dark progressive at its best","review":"When I heard Anthony Pappa was coming out with a new cd I was pretty excited. This mix not only encompasses a fantastic track selection, but the mixing is seamless. The first disc starts off progressive and slowly gets deeper and darker, chugging along the entire time. By the time you reach track #8, you are so deep into the groove there is no escape (not that you'd want to). CD #2 is dark from beginning to end, keeping you in an altered state of consciousness the entire time. This cd is definitely not for the faint of heart. If you are just getting into electronic dance music, this is an excellent place to start. This cd is intelligent and well thought out. Each track melts into the next as if they were meant for each other. If you're a fan of Diggers, Sasha, Howells, Kleinenberg, or any of the other Prog DJ's, check this one out. It's a solid 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"I purchased a refurbished laptop to save money and got an excellent deal in this HP laptop. It does everything I wanted it to do and more. I'm also very pleased I could get it with the operating system I wanted -- XP.

I also own an HP Pavilion desktop, so I am very pleased with the laptop and the Pavilion platform."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ubiquitous clear broth","review":"In Chinese, Vietnamese, and Japanese restaurants I've always been served this delicous clear broth with onions floating in it. I've always wondered what it was and if I could buy it in a store. After having bought a packet of this item at my local Safeway I've determined that this is the one and same. It tastes great and makes a good warm drink. Adding a small amount of sliced up green onions makes it even better. The only downside is its rather expensive at over a dollar a cup for what you get for free with a meal in many East-Asian diners."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item","review":"the C.D. \\" More songs of love and murder \\" is by a bunch of American folk musicians ( banjos and fiddles etc ) and is not by Henry Cow .The photo of the cover showing cowboys in a bar is not an ironic Henry Cow statement , but a picture of the C.D. cover - indicating the appropriate audience for the music on the C.D."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for the real enthusiast","review":"This book tells it like it is in his own words. Since the famous outlaw wrote it himself it's obviously covering up the truth for some parts, but how much closer can we really get to the truth, and it's a fascinating study from his side. Historians will talk about the details from others' point of view, but how often do we get to find out what he was doing when others were looking for him, and how he felt about each act, and what really made him who he was. You can almost detect his Texas accent as if he were speaking directly to you. Just don't try to read it while the TV's on. It's way too important, and you'll find yourself entirely wrapped in this book until finished. It doesn't take long to read, but it's action packed and the timeline and events mentioned are real."},{"rating":"2","title":"people stickers","review":"these are so cute i got them for my dad for Christmas as a joke so i haven't seen how well they stick. but they arrived on time and the packaging was fine :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not sure worth the money","review":"For the money I would have expected this to be more professional looking. As is, it looks like something bought at a dollar store.Looking at the picture associated with the product, one would expect to receive a flat package titled 'Decal Kit' as shown. Instead I recieved the decals which appear cut from a larger sheet, between two pieces of cardboard, wrapped in black plastic and tons of tape. This was bought as a gift for my sister and there was no way I was sending it as is to her. I had to come up with a creative way to package it.The decals themselves are cute, and I hope my sister enjoys them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Those are not good","review":"The kids all almost the size of adults, you can get better ones out there. However they do the job if you already have them!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Focuses on School Setting","review":"The main reason I like this book so much is that it focuses good, solid self-improvement information in a specific setting: the school; which, as an educational administrator, I can easily use. The examples of better communication are situations that I run into every day. This makes it easier for me to remember the lessons I learn from the book. Some of Sam Horn's suggestions are based on common knowledge, like the Golden Rule, and some are quite creative, but all are based on \\"real life\\" situations in the educational workplace. If you're a teacher or school administrator--even a student--this is a great book to improve your communication, your relationships and your life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"what to say in difficult situations at school","review":"One of the things they don't teach in school is constructive, practical dialogue techniques that can help focus on solutions. I liked Tongue Fu! and I like Tongue Fu! at School for the same reason. These easy to learn techniques can literally change the dynamics of relationships between parents and coaches or teachers and vice versa. She doesn't waste time on theory and understands we need real life, right now help when we are trying to help our children. Perfect for educators at all levels and for parents who have children in school. Great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Not \\"Night\\"","review":"Elie Wiesel is stuck in Buchenwald. The book keeps harking bsack to his days in the concentration camp.

I recall starting to view it years ago and not liking it much and not finishing it. But when i saw Amazon was selling the movie in an uncut edition and at such a reasonable price I decided I would buy it and look at it again. I am glad I did. The acting is great all around. I recommend it to anyone who is interested in what it was like in those days in Italy as interpreted by the director. He does a wonderful job on the second disc telling why the movie was shot the way it was shot and why it needs to be seen uncut. ( Not having the special features would be a mistake.) The movie is more than fiction, more than just a story and even though it may seem it glamorizes some politics over others, at its heart lies the truth. We cannot escape our birth, try as we might."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tiresome to sit through","review":"An interesting idea for a film but not well executed. Much of the acting was so broad it was annoying or not believable (part of that was due to the dubbing). Too often the actors are overly emotional. There are too many scenes of characters being very exciting or angry or yelling or crying. Also, some of the leisurely scenes that don't really move the plot along were of little interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent folly","review":"It is hard to credit, let alone convey, the full catastrophe that is the creative disaster of Bertolucci's execrable film \\"1900\\".What could he have been thinking? How could he abandon narrative integrity to the cheap tricks of propaganda? How could any serious film maker spend millions making a film where no one does anything that is emotionally believable? This film is blatantly didactic, but even in that it fails because Bertolucci lacked the simple discipline to confine his work to a single didactic purpose.The enormous talents of Robert De Niro, Gerard Depardieu, and Donald Sutherland - all wasted by the unmitigated self-indulgence of Bertolucci, whose reputation stands badly dented by this film.Unredeemed by insight into human nature or the emotions felt by real people, this film is five hours of blithering nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattle on Arrival","review":"I was really looking forward to watching this film, and the package that arrived was rattling. I opened the dvd case and the second dvd was out of it's slot and completely scratched!I need to return this item for a full or a resend from amazon.com, because i still am yet to watch 1900."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"who wouldn't want to check out a historical epic directed by Bertolucci (whose \\"Last Tango in Paris\\" and \\"Conformist\\" are terriffic and thought-provoking), and starring Lancaster, Sterling Hayden, De Niro, Depardieu, etc.? Don't waste your time. This film has all the earmarks of a \\"genius\\" director's overinflated vision, a grand statement, and as such is totally contrived and UNreal, from the behavior of the actors, which is ludicrously like a grade-B horror movie, to the script, the editing, and the story itself. We are whacked over the head with many socialist cliches about the wonderfulness of peasants and the decadent cruelty of the ruling classes, and the romantic drama is boring, boring, boring. Even the music by Morricone was used awfully! I was laughing out loud. A mess. What a disappointment! The ending is the epitome of ridiculousness. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"just awful","review":"I have seen hundreds of movies in my life, and this has to be the worst. Because it is apparently trying to make some important point. Because it includes big names Bertolucci and DeNiro. I apologize for not being able to adequately express how bad this movie is. The acting is bad, the cackling incessant, the music irritating, the dialogue often ridiculous, many scenes just disgusting, and so much more... I must admit, I was captivated by it for 5 full hours, it was so bad I could not stop watching it. I just sat there, mouth agape, shaking my head in (alternately) bewilderment and contempt. Just awful. Wow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has moments of brilliance, but still highly over-rated.......................","review":"The camerawork and some of the acting are stunning, but the staging of many scenes are laughable. Inparticular, check out the ludicrous \\"sex\\" scene between De Niro, Depardieu, and Stefania Cassini--beyondembarassing............"},{"rating":"1","title":"hours wasted","review":"A terrible example of Italian filmmaking at its worst - vastly overlong, overblown, without a single sympathetic character (including those meant to be), full of stereotypes (especially overdone salt-of-the-earth peasants - you begin to sympathise with Atilla the villainous overseer...), full of bad acting and bad history, and -like so many Italian films of this period - little more than a Marxist fable with a Morricone soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you enjoy seeing a kitten getting killed","review":"I saw this pretentious piece of garbage in the 80's in the Z channel. Noteven the nudity and the graphic scene of two young boys fondling theirpenises to compare their foreskins makes it worthwhile to witness thesmashing of a ginger kitten done by Donald Sutherland's head toward theend. I hated this clown face actor ever since and have had to put upwith him in some movies because I wanted to see these movie because oftheir stories (Six Degrees of Separation,Invasion of the Body Snatchersto name two). Sinor Bertolucci repeated this trend in a scene of TheLast Emperor where a disturbed young emperor throws a mouse into a wallto kill it. You can see the blood left on the wall from the poor animal.Good work sinor famous director, why don't you make a movie about thecruel, barbaric art of bullfighting?. By the way, meant to use no starsbut it seems is the only way to post my review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bertolucci Deserves Better","review":"Many versions of Bernardo Bertolucci's \\"1900\\" have existed. It had been cut by Bertolucci (and others) even before it debuted theatrically. This version from Paramount home video is not the full-length version Bertolucci would like everyone to see, but it is superior to some far shorter versions that have existed. \\"1900\\" is not Bertolucci's best film, but it has its moments for those with patience to sit through a dramatically and politically rich epic from a cinematic master. However, the picture quality is a major disappointment. It is not letterboxed and the picture quality is so poor it looks like a 16mm print transferred to video. A master visual stylist like Bertolucci and two-time Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro deserve far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"bertolucci's beautiful if somewhat long masterwork","review":"key word here is long.. This film is a visual treat - often evoking Visconti's finer moments.. a richly decorated screen. There is much to love here: a complex social commentary, fine acting, beautiful rural italian landscapes. It is certainly worth the time (an exausting 5 hours). Perhaps not as finely edited as some of Bertolucci's other movies.. although it would be a daunting task to edit such a broad monster of a story as the history of italy from 1900 to ww2. it is easy to criticize the mass of this undertaking.. but even easier to appreciate the effectiveness of a fully realized story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abraham Verghese does it again!","review":"I was moved by this book as much if not more than his first. While I was reading it felt as if I was there with Dr. Verghese. His writing is so expressive that you can actually visualize being in the hospital as well as the streets of his town. And he showed that men care for other men as deeply as women care for other women. Much respect for Dr. Verghese it saddened me to near the end of his book due to the fact that I knew it would soon be over. I look forward to the next book from Dr. Abraham Verghese."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tennis Partner","review":"My new favorite author is Abraham Verghese!! I am so looking forward to reading his book, \\"Cutting For Stone\\". He makes the world of being a doctor so understandable and emotionally compelling. The firm mental grasp he has on his profession alongside his wise and sympathetic relationship he has with his interns is outstanding to read and believe. I wish every Doctor had Verghese's sensibilities and love of profession!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"Worth reading. Good look into dynamics of addiction and impact on those around the user. Verghese is an engaging author and captures the attention of the reader quickly. While not light, the issues he tackles are real."},{"rating":"1","title":"A friendship?","review":"I am amazed that someone can consider type of relationship discribed here to be one of very close friends....the book title more aptly displays the depth of feeling, in my opinion. This book might be enjoyed by someone who adores tennis; as one who has no specific interest in it, those long segments of the book have no appeal...they might as well be discussing bowling...anything physical. This allows the writer to skirt issues instead of allowing close human interaction. I am amazed that what most women would consider an aquaintance, this writer considers to be a close (only?) friend. I think he has emotionally arrested development, though he seems kind, and most likely is an able physician."},{"rating":"2","title":"powerful, well written, insightful !","review":"I found this book hard to put down even though you know from the cover of this book that he loses his friend. As a retired R.N., Verghese's observations regarding physicians is astute and accurate. As a person who loves the game of tennis, his metaphors for life based on tennis are absolutely stunning. I will always remember the last sentence of this very well written book and I look forward to reading his future endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for tennis players","review":"I am in the medical field, and a tennis player, so I naturally loved the book, as there were many parts that were interesting to me. Not really a book for non-tennis players though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. I continued to read it, thinking it would improve. I was so impressed by cutting for stone that I was expecting the same level of writing. However, the story dragged on and was almost predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big disappointment","review":"I had looked forward to this book, expecting an inciteful analysis of friendship and drug addiction. I loved \\"My Own Country\\", and lookd forward to enjoying this book as much. I was sorely disappointed; irritated by travel book descriptions of El Paso, smug case histories of patients, egocentric self-analysis of the author's relationship with others. I found little to explain WHY the two men were friends, outside of being tennis buddies, and almost no incite to the problems faced when a friend has a drug addiction. Perhaps my expectations were too high, you can't always hit a home run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tells us something, but perhaps not what the author intended","review":"I found \\"The Tennis Partner\\" disappointing because ultimately Dr. Verghese has little insight into his friend's heart or mind. The use of his friend's life as a taking-off point seems exploitative. The repetitive passages on Dr. Verghese's self-described insightful diagnostic methods and his obsessive meanderings about tennis strike me as simply egocentric. That the book derived from journal musings is all too clear. It is marred as well by some writing errors, for example, the feeling that his head was caught \\"in a vice.\\" It does serve as a warning about the misshaping of the person that can take place in the medical pressure cooker, but I believe not, ironically, in the way the author intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"book purchase","review":"i had fast delivery, the book came, as promised, in excellent condition and it was also a fabulous read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tennis Mania?","review":"I purchased this book because of editorial reviews. I found it so boring I couldn't even get half way through it. I guess if you are a tennis fan it would be interesting. Otherwise, it plods thru at such a boringly slow pace that I just had to put it down, something I never do. The backround stories about the narrator's life growing up were just as tedious as imagining the sound of a tennis ball bouncing back and forth, over and over and over... Sorry I bought it. I've donated it to a charity, so maybe someone else will find it interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Study of a Special Friendship","review":"This is a profound book about friendship and the human soul. Verghese is a perceptive physician who has studied the human body and mind and is able to share his insights in beautiful prose. He has made many keen observations of the motivations and behavior of physicians and perhaps all professionals. \\"A child will always feel insufficient and powerless in a world of adults\\" is an example.Adults find themselves on dark paths. They can come out by reaching to human connections.\\"Keep the ball in play. Keep your eye on the ball. Follow through. These are admonitions for both tennis and life.\\"My comments do not capture the insightful mind and pithy writing of this author.A friend described this story as very sad. That may be true but the writing is spare and clear and the author has described the meaning of friendship with extraordinary feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addiction and Medicine","review":"I have read both of Dr. Verghese's other books and while I think both of those are more moving to me personally, I appreciate the reality told through fiction of this book. The focus of this book is on a medical student, David, who has a drug addiction problem and Dr. Verghese's failing marriage. Together the two become fast-friends and find a common bond in tennis. Their \\"ritual\\" of tennis becomes what stabilizes one but cannot help the other. The parts of the story that I personally found most moving and were that even as medical professionals, those dearest friends to him were still somewhat able to overlook the symptoms that David was exhibiting to potential relapse. It was a true description of the consequences of drug-addiction, what it does to the body, what medical complications occur, and the lifestyle. Overall the story was obviously emotional to share even in semi-fiction and I think many readers can appreciate that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A moving important story","review":"This book was not what I expected, but so much more!With the drug problem we are experiencing in the world today, this novel opened my eyes as to how pervasive and devasting addictions are and how far reaching the effects spread.Beautifully written and the characters were so well developed as to come alive and stay with me long after I finished reading it.Looking forward to reading his newest novel, CUTTING FOR STONE as this author is a master storyteller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"I am currently a training physician at Texas Tech Univeristy in El Paso, where this story took place, and it really hits close to home. I picked it up and couldnt put it down. Really an amazing and heartbreaking story. Dr Verghese came to lecture recently and that was what motivated me to read his book. He is truly a scholar who is a master in the arts and sciences, a very compassionate physician and a great teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick and Entertaining Read","review":"A well written book. This is a touching and sad story but ultimately uplifting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored","review":"This was a complete disappointment. The first two books, by this author, were really well-written and good stories. This one, however, was BORING. I skipped through the whole thing, read the last chapter, then threw the book away. The doctor's obsession with this young man was unrealistic, boring, and repetitive as were the myriad of tennis games they played. Maybe someone who is a tennis buff would find this interesting but who really cares. I did not and am so sorry that I spent money purchasing \\"boredom\\". I would think that the doctor would have so much to write about with his experience and background. Not a thing about this book was engaging. I'll think twice before purchasing another book written by this author. I feel \\"duped\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anatomy of Addiction and Relapse","review":"Dr. Vergesse has great powers of observation and uses them in a powerful way to record the demise of his young friend through cocaine addiction.For persons (especially medical Doctors) without intimate knowledge of the power of addiction this should be very informative. For those with personal knowledge (especially medical Doctors) it should also be helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book from a good writer","review":"The author of My Own Country seems to have lost his touch. Nowhere in The Tennis Partner do you see the same charm or honesty. His prose continues to be elegant, and his images vivid. But this story is simply not as compelling as the one he had to tell in My Own Country. The fatal flaw in The Tennis Partner is that you never really understand the basis of the friendship between the doctor and David. What, besides tennis, did they have in common? David is Verghese's intellectual inferior and the doctor's fascination for him is puzzling. Another problem is the structure of the book. He juxtaposes long italicized segments on tennis that have nothing to do with anything, with themes of drug addiction, medicine, loneliness, marital breakdown, David's relationships with women, and travel-book descriptions of El Paso. The book simply does not cohere. I hope Dr. Verghese can give us more in his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAKE FOR SURE","review":"THIS IS CHINA TOWN KNOCK OFF!!!

I had to return mine under the warranty it was so poor in quality. We used it for pleasure while sitting at the airport in the shadow of the tower and it wouldn't even pick up the tower frequency on scan. Poor, poor signal even as the plane taxied in front of us the signal was so scratchy, garbled it was nearly impossible to understand, also this scanner is impossible to program, you need a PHD degree and after awhile whatever was programmed it, disappeared! No way, big mistake, run, don't buy. We are still awaiting some kind of decision on what solution Uniden is going to come up with for us. Time is moving on and we don't have any scanner, but we listen to the Radio Shack of our friends, it's real nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uniden BC72XLT HandHeld Scanner","review":"I bought this scanner it only has 8 hrs of battery life!

I have a masters degree in English, maybe the fact I'm so far from being an engineer has something to do with it.

Other than NOAA (the weather channel) and a few moments of aircraft and ham chatter I received very little else. I searched online (with the websites suggested) for local police, fire and other local channels and monitored those with no success whatsoever. I went to a few local Radio Shack stores for assistance (since they sell the same unit) and that was a total waste of gas. I used to just purchase a crystal for a certain channel, plug it in my old bearcat scanner and done. I'm not saying there is anything wrong with the unit it just did not meet my expectations for a simple turn on and scan type unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uniden BC72XLT","review":"The Uniden BC72XLT is a great, handy radio scanner. Pick up your local police, trucker radios, business radios or whatever els you want. I like the bank storage. It lets you put 10 channels in up to 10 banks so it is mor organized (i.e bank 1 - police, bank 2 - trucker radios. ECT...) The reason I gave it 4 stars was because the numbers/words on the keypad start to dissolve. By the time that might happen, you'll have already memorized the keys. All in all it as a great tool.

Unfortunately we did not get much use out of them. After purchasing the codes needed at the track we found the reception to be terrible. We were told half way through the Sprint race by a person using a Radio shack brand scanner that we needed the shorter antennae for them. We were told that would eliminate that frequent static interruptions, and loss of the channel we were experiencing. It seems that since these are sold as 'NASCAR' scanners they would be equipped for NASCAR races. The instruction book could also be a little more 'understandable' then it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"A SCANNER THAT EVERYONE SHOULD HAVE!","review":"This scanner is everything that I expected it to be. It's small and compact, it's easy to hear, it's easy to program, and it's very useful. The price was very reasonable and it was well worth the money. I don't go a day without listening to it and it goes everywhere with me. The only negative thing about it is the batteries don't last long and when I have it in the car, the signal isn't very strong. If you purchase it, make sure you use rechargeable batteries with it, or if you are home, just keep it plugged in using the adapter that comes with it. Other than that, I highly recommend this scanner to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"o.k scanner","review":"This is a good scanner if you do not mind having the 800 mhz unavailable. Easy to use.

I don't think you can find a better 100 channel scanner for under $100USD.My only complaint is the small keypad, hence it makes programming tedius. Even a simple \\"lock out\\" involves a function key, then another key. Most won't need to re-program them very often and you can turn banks on and off by simply pressing the corresponding number.It uses the same NiMh AA batteries that came with my digital camera, so I didn't have to buy a new set for the scanner. They charge right in the unit with the included AC adapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe it works...Maybe NOT!","review":"i will be honest with this product...i live in Alabama - Mobile and i got the unit today.And i did some research about this product and my area too before i buy this device.Unfortunately this morning (before the UPS guy delivered the package) i figured out that the public safety in Mobile County use the Trunking System!And the only channel it picks is the Weather Channel.other than that no Air-Medic or Police channels can be listened with this device.I dont have a problem with the device but since it doesnt pick up any other channels even with Close call function or entering manually i cant tell you this device good or bad.It didnt work for ALABAMA - Mobile County AND if u looking for a device for listening Police units or Paramedic Talk....Than DO NOT BUY THIS UNIT...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"My first scanner, and not too bad. Reception is good, and close capture works decently.

Overall pretty easy to use all of the features once you get familiar with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has to be digital!","review":"All scanners have gone to digital. If you buy an Analogue, it won't work. Just like the TV's.Learned that yesterday in a store by a very nice Sales Rep. Beware! BTW.. digitals cost at least $400 now. They will go down in price, if you wait.Just an FYI.. you also can't use the digital ones now without knowing a \\"special\\" code. I assume this mean, if you want it for a police scanner to know what's going on around your home, you would have to know a police officer or maybe a fireman. Boy.. I guess the \\"old days\\" are gone for good :("},{"rating":"2","title":"A super scanner","review":"My first portable scanner after years of the old reliable Radio Shack desktop models. The Uniden BC72XLT Handheld is working splendidly with excellent reception in my area and clear sound. Choose from A/C adapter, non-rechargeable and rechargeable battery power. Note the switch inside the battery compartment for the two AA battery types. Have a clear head when you sit down to enter the frequencies, so that you get the sequence of button entry correct. The instruction book's instructions for entering frequencies had me baffled, so once I got it right, I wrote down the steps that made sense to me. Possible a personal problem on my part. You may catch on quicker. Bottom line: Very pleased in all respects."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first Scanner!","review":"Scanner was received quicker than estimated and at the best price thru Amazon.(as usual) My friends have owned scanners for years and recommended a portable unit.

Luckily, it starts out with two of Snakefingers best works, The Spot and Smelly Tongues. The version of Smelly Tongues in this album is a song I can listen to over and over again. Unfortunatly, it ends with some cuts from the Snake's worst album: Greener Postures. Highlights, outside of that mentioned before, are \\"Kill the Great Raven\\", \\"Here Comes the Bums\\", \\"Picnic in the Jungle\\".If you really want some good stuff by the Snake, look for the CD \\"Manual of Errors\\", and scrape around, and see if you can find \\"History of the Blues\\" on LP. Unfortunately, both are out of print, and both are sorely missed by us fans.If you're a Snakefinger or a Residents fan, get this album. If I could have, I would have rated this 3 and 1/2 stars. But, 4 will do in a pinch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Musical Time Capsule","review":"This video is well worth your time and money if you are a fan of either T-Rex or Roxy Music. They don't make 'em like this anymore. Marc Bolan and Bryan Ferry were incredibly charismatic frontmen. This DVD is a great showcase of the last years of rock before the corporations totally co-opted it. T-Rex has hard rocking power pop; really love \\"Jeepster for Your Love\\". Roxy Music has great music and marvelous silly glitter rock costumes. They really rock. Bryan croons and dances, Phil Manzanera burns it up on his guitar, Eno plays a wild synth, and Andy MacKay is an incredible sax/oboe player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For Serious Roxy Music Fans!","review":"A Club/Concert video from Roxy Music's early days.

For those who dont know TREX will recognize the song from a recent automobile TV commercial.I give the TREX portion 4 stars.Now the Roxy section.........Too old and dated. There musicianship is lacking in the early years but it is interesting (to say the least)to see Brian Eno.also interesting is the clips are from multiple years so there are two iterations of the band. Of course Phil,Bryan, and Andy are great. But I saw Roxy live in 1977 and again in 2001 and they are so far superior than this DVD exhibits that if your not familiar with them this would not peak your interest to check them out.

Every now and then when I'm feeling sluggish and I need a boost or before a big project like preparing for a yard sale I reefer to her book and I am eager to get back on track. The 15 Minute Organizer is a great book with many great ideas and point of views perfect for women (or men) who are looking to get more organized not only in their home but in their mind! I love how she adds Bible scriptures to teach and motivate as well.

I bought this CD and can't stop listening to it. He has inventive lyrics and multi-layerd melodies, consisting of string instruments (like the prominent presence of the cello in Dear Sarah Shu), synth sounds, pianos, guitars, and much more.This CD is just what I needed.

By Chapter two I was already confused and although I read, re-read still did not understand the basisc's of their explanation of measurements.This book is defantly not for beginners just wanting to learn how to sew nor is it for anyone looking to gain more knowledge on how to use their sewing machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"This is a very good reference book for those who want to learn about the basics of sewing, fabric choices, techniques, etc. It is always good to have a book to come back to on hand that goes through things step by step and makes things appear relativity simple to do.That being said, this is not a book that is easy to read (honestly not many sewing books are so gripping that you cannot put them down). The projects are - kind of boring and more challenging to a beginner.It's a good book to have lying around when you need help, I highly recommend it for that.And if you are looking for a book on how to sew with your sewing machine check out books like - Me and My Sewing Machine and Stitch by Stitch: learn to sew one project at a time. Both are very well written and go through the basics of sewing as well, it will be a lot of repetition, but for a beginner - like me - that is a good thing.

Superfically flicking through the book it looks great, it's only when you sit down and need to do something that you find that this book doesn't equip you with enough explanation of the terms and skills needed to allow you to complete a simple sewing task.It promises much, but it lacks thorough, simple and clear explanations and a beginner will still need other resources to learn how to sew basic things.I don't know who this book is targeted at, as it isn't for the beginner, yet the concepts it covers really are basic and I doubt experienced sewers would get much out of this book for this reason.I guess it's not a bad book, just so-so. I tried to edit this to make it a 3 star, rather than the 2 I initially gave it, as that seemed fairer, but I can't edit the 'stars.'

If you want to pig out now and again-it's much better to do it on jelly beans and hard candies rather than chocolate and potatoe chips.\\" I understand that sugar gives energy but for low blood sugar folks and diabetics this isn't really good advice.

It is a good read, but with some flaws. The main character can be far from the \\"Superman\\" lead in some books - in fact he some times makes so many mistakes that you figure that is why he is out of the service.Lots of detail from someone who seems to know which end is up. The ending leaves a bit to be desired. If you read the Amazon review, it will ruin the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately Boring Read","review":"His book \\"Remote Control\\" was good, but this is just boring.In this book, McNab frequently goes into excruciating detail on sneaking, stalking, snooping and other military type activities. But instead of being interesting, there is simply too much detail and it ends up being tedious. So much so, that I found I needed to skip parts of pages and sometimes whole pages where nothing that advanced the plot was happening.I also found the ending to be poor, but I can't elaborate without spoiling it for others who decide to labour through this unsatisfactory book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tedious Read","review":"Very slow moving and it would be a better read if the pace was faster. The plot while topical is not as wide ranging as those by Frederic Forysth or Tom Clancy.Pages were devoted to how Nick Stone kept watch - some readers might appreciate the details. For me, it just took so long to move the story forward. The balance between attention to details and story telling needs to be better.In addition, the ease of smuggling a weapon into the White House on the pre-text of forgetting to bring the camera is just too incredulous."},{"rating":"2","title":"5*, Its wonderful, creative and just out-standing!!","review":"Well crisis Four, what can i say about it?Its just a out-standing book, yes!!, if you'r intreasted in the SAS and there ways and like undercover things buy it now!!! I've read all of the Andy McNab books and i have seen the Bravo Two Zero video and they get better as they go on!If you'r going to buy this book i would recommened that you first buy \\"Remote Control\\" so you know who Kelly is and what happened to her and the rest or you will be saysing \\"what?, whos this lass then?\\", so read Remote Control then read Crisis Foru or you will mise out on the fun!!Andy, i love all you'r books and you will still be my NUMBER ONE!!

It does have some nostalgic memory associations for me, so my experience with this album may be biased, or exeptionally loaded. Nevertheless, this album is absolutely the most beautiful, soothing, melancholic \\"new age\\" work I have ever heard.I am particularly skeptical of the new age genre. Although I do love ambient, atmospheric music, I am very selective. Trust me, this is a wonderful series of compositions that will sooth your heart and take you away dreaming. And not in a generic, shallow, meaningless way - in a real way. It will remind you of who you are, your good and bad memories, those you love and things you regret.

I wasn't ready, though, for how weak a CD their eponymous 1993 release is. Songs like Gas Girl, Trailer Mama, and Wave That Flag are forced at best. Both the lyrics and music sound like they were written in a rush. The melodies aren't catchy, and the attempts at cleverness come across as trite and dumb. There are some more heavy-duty country songs in here, but they don't fit with the rest of the CD. Kerosene and the heavy Rural Route are the two standouts, though I'm still not sure if the former is meant to be serious or a joke (it's about people who died in a trailer fire because they put gasoline in their kerosene heater: \\"if kerosene works why not gasoline?\\"). A major disappointment for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me A Break, Part II","review":"Don't know how anyone can label this effort lyrically weak. This CD captures the essence of small-town Missouri (and small-town USA, I imagine) better than anything you're likely to hear. This aint no pretty boy, my-baby-hurt-my-feelings rock and roll; this is straight from the soul, stink-in-the-boots stuff. The boys have perhaps surpassed this one musically, but lyrically this is the strongest CD they've made. I'd urge anyone who digs the Rockets' later music to go back and pick this one up. Do it and you'll gain a deeper appreciation of Mr. Henneman and the rest of the fellows from Festus."},{"rating":"2","title":"This baby kicks","review":"This cd is great. I got it in 1993 and still listen to it about every month.

Thirty-seven years later, time stands still when those four minutes are played.And the rest of this compilation is excellent. Jesse Colin Young and Jerry Corbitt's voices complemented each other perfectly, almost clairavoyantly; Banana was one of the 60's most versatile musicians; and Joe Bauer was the great overlooked drummer of the era.Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Youngbloods.","review":"The Youngbloods were one of the best bands of the '60s.

I shouldn't have. Goldman has not aged well. He doesn't have enough fun \\"Hollywood Insider\\" stories left to tell, he's painfully ill-equipped to teach screenwriting (You wouldn't think so, but it becomes obvious very quickly), and he's REALLY out of touch. (Is he the only writer who didn't understand the Coen Brothers' THE BIG LEBOWSKI?) In general, I'm surprised by the poor quality of this book. Goldman's prose is first-draft quality, and his observations are no longer interesting, much less incisive."},{"rating":"1","title":"out of touch curmudgeon","review":"Goldman, who hasn't written a good film in a quite a while, states that the 90's was the worst decade in film history. Which only shows that he's an out of touch curmudgeon railing against \\"kids today.\\" Cranks like Goldman can't appreciate or acknowledge the excellence of such newcomers as Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson. There are many other excellent filmmakers from the independent film movement, and their cumulative work has created a genuine renaissance of film art. The 90's were as fertile as the 70's. There were a lot of bad 90's movies, to be sure, but most of them came from the major studio \\"factory,\\" where Goldman certainly made his contribution."},{"rating":"2","title":"I bought it, I liked it--I'd like a new Goldman novel more","review":"With his great style, Goldman points out a lot of the mechanics to making a good story work on the screen----but skip all that.

How a screenplay comes into being, how many hands touch it, what happens when they get done with it and how it actually becomes something seen on the screen, is all in this book. The politics, the deals, some back-stabbing and some back-slapping are all here. One of the better books ever written about the process of making movies. He begins with a few admissions - no one called him in five years, even after winning an Oscar and later a bigger admission the great flop \\"The Year of the Comet.\\"Because of the honesty of the admissions, Goldman, makes the book more readable. The process of inventing a character that didn't exist in \\"The Ghost and The Darkness\\" and a critical line in \\"A Bridge Too Far\\" and why it had to be done that way for the movie's final outcome are discussed. A must read for any one interested not only in screenwriting, but the process of movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story of life in Atlantic Canada","review":"Classic story of a girl with determination, guts and brains who strived to live life to the fullest.

She is an inspiring example for girls and women of every generation.

This is one of my mom's favorites. I have always liked the movie so much that I never felt it necessary to read the book, but I'm so glad I finally did. The book is even funnier than the movie! The movie is pretty true to the story and where it varies it is still very true to the story's essence. The book is very entertaining and moving. It may require a hanky for some. I read several chapters outloud to my husband, who also very much enjoyed it. Mark Twain calls Anne, \\"the most moving and delightful child of fiction since the immortal Alice.\\" I have to agree. Alice in Wonderland is another of my favorites. Both characters are supremely curious about the world around them.

This book is set in the late 1800s. I liked this book because I could relate/connect to the twelve-year old's thoughts and problems. The best part about the book was that I realized how lucky I am to have parents and a best friend. This book was so memeorable that I remember every detail from the book, and the book made me laugh.

I would recommend this book to anyoone who can read and is above ten years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"An imaginative and wonderful story","review":"I cannot put into words exactly how much I enjoy reading Anne of Green Gables. She is the most imaginative and lively girl who also spreads goodness and hope to whomever she meets. Anne is hopelessy romantic in her ideals, and I love how she embellishes on simple things such as when she changed the name of \\"Barrys' Pond\\" into the much more appropriate \\"The Lake of Shining Waters.\\" Another example is how she insists that Marilla call her Cordelia Fitzgerald instead of Anne. Overall, the story makes me laugh at times, cry at others, but essentially every part of the engrossing story should capture minds that enjoy the descriptions of an inviting rolling pasture called Green Gables, the perseverance and laughter of Anne with an \\"E\\",and appreciate all the love and joy that Anne gives to the characters in her life as well as the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"*****ABSOLUTELY THE BEST BOOK-A MUST READ!!!!!!!!!!*****","review":"I fell in love with this book after the first few pages.

Anne is far to happy and giddy to be a realistic character; especially keeping in mind the time in which novel takes place. L. M. Montgomery went through similar experiences; she was lonely and left to live with her elderly grandparents ( could this be where Mathew and Marilla came from ? ) and was never the happy woman that Anne grows up to be. Montgomery's life story could almost represent the story of Anne, only without the happy ending.

However, around age eleven or twelve I realized I had outgrown Anne. You see, Anne is perfect. She is pretty, imaginative, intelligent, talented, friendly, kind, moral, popular, etc. Yes she has a quick temper but this hardly seems to be a flaw, and her scrapes are always done with the best intentions. The author brings up her unhappy childhood many times, but after a while it loses its effect.

It's beginning was slow, and I was sort of irritated with Ann(oops, sorry, Anne)for chatting so much. But as the story started to get faster and you got to know the characters a little better, I couldn't help but loving her! It was rather funny, too. Anne was always getting herself into scrapes, but she was so well-meaning. The characters are so delightfully different from each other, but they all bind together to make for one good read. The ending was also good, although I didn't like the fact that Anne was grown up. It's one of those endings that leaves you satisfied, but begging for more, if you know what I mean. I can't wait to read the rest of the books in the series....but somehow, I can't believe, try as I do, that the others could be half as beautiful. I hardly ever cry over books, and yet this one opened my heart.

But it turns out great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book!","review":"When Mrs. Rachel Lynde learns that sister and brother, Matthew and Marilla Culbert are going to adopt a boy, she protests. Though, it turns out there was no need to. The Culbert's friend thinks they want to adopt a girl and brings one home with her on the train. Anne Shirley, as it turns out is a very interesting girl. She wishes to be gallant and romantic and wistfully wishes her hair was auburn instead of bright red. Matthew thinks her humorous and Marilla thinks her very audacious. She wonders if Anne will ever learn to not let her mind wander. It remains to be seen if the Culberts will ever think of Anne Shirley as family and care for her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anne Shirley","review":"This book was wonderful the moment I picked it up. The literature flows and is beautifully written. Anne's story is full of tragedies and comedies. Like the time she was stranded in the middle of the river and was shamefully rescued by Gilbert. It tells the story of a girl's transformation into a woman. With the help of her friends, and her 2 caretakers, Marilla Cuthbert; Matthew Cuthbert. Who were hesitant into adopting her at first, but Anne was able to find her way into their hearts. And into the hearts of everybody in Avonlea.Though beautifully written, those parents who are considering reading this book outloud to their 6-11 year olds might think again. The words are sometimes complicated and hard to understand. They might not be able to fully appreciate this book.Overall, however. I would definatelly recommend this book to kids over the age of 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart-warming Fiction for Everyone","review":"Anne of Green Gables is a spirited Orphan of the Annie vein. Young, intelligent, headstrong, and loving big BIG words, Anne comes to live with her adopted family, a spinster brother and sister. Imaginative, intelligent and lonely, Anne soon wins over her foster parents and becomes the smartest girl in school, and befriends a local girl, Diana.I really enjoyed Anne of Green gables. In particular the 'hometown' feel of the life on Prince Edward Island. The narrator was wonderful and this book left me feeling warm and happy inside.

Anne wants dearly to stay, and wins the old couple over with her \\"quarky\\" ways...and especially when she shows a likeness to Marilla of years before.

It's a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for girls","review":"Anne of Green Gables is about a skinny red haired girl who has both a short temper and a very colorful imagination. She really loves the little farmhouse but the Cuthberts might send her back to the orphanage because Matthew needed a boy about 11 or 12 to help him on the farm.Sometimes her imagination gets her in trouble. For instance when Marilla asks her to get a pattern from Mrs. Barry she doesn't want to because she imagined the woods between the houses were haunted! The book tells about her life growing up in the 1930's. As she grows, she learns many lessons and meets many friends who help her to become Anne of Green Gables.This book is wonderful.

This Anne of Green Gables was a horrible disappointment. We can hardly bear to listen to it because of the very poor acting of the \\"Anne\\" character.

Some of her antics include dyeing her hair green, accidentally making her best friend drunk, and taking a dare to walk across a roof, falling and breaking her ankle. This story takes place in Prince Edward Island, Canada, in the early 1900s. Anne isn't sure if the siblings, Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, will keep her because they wanted a boy from the orphanage, not a girl. It turns out that they become attached to Anne and keep her. Soon she meets a girl named Diana, who becomes her best friend. A lot of people are surprised by her at first, including the local busybody, Mrs. Rachel Lynde. Pretty soon a lot of people know and like her. I really liked this book and recommend it to anyone who likes humorous stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I have been a fan of Lucy Maud Montgomery since I was a small child and I love these books no less as an adult.

The depth of this writer's imagination is sometimes astounding. In this novel, Gaarder weaves into his plot the issues of destiny, synchronicity and family ties in a most remarkable way. In some ways, you could think of this book as a fairy tale for adults.

Also, you'll never look at a pack of cards the same again! This book was in the adult section at my library, but I personally think it's for everyone. The main characters are Hans Thomas and his father, who are on a quest to find Hans' Mommy.

True, most of the jazz up through the 50's was based on preexisting songs, that is indisputable. But those songs lived on their own without lyrics, so instrumentalists could play them and make them live. Most of the musical part of pop music today, let's face it, is a life support system for the lyrics. Without them, the music is one-dimensional and uninteresting. Belden has skill, to be sure, but his well-worn formula of parading out current stars' music so that he can try to popularize himself is just another example of me-ism of the 60's and 70's culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent General Marketing Research Text","review":"I am an MBA/Graduate Marketing Research adjunct professor at Lindenwood University in St. Louis, MO and I am currently using this text for my class.

If it were just the abysmal sound quality, I would persist; however, the ensemble work is out-of-tune and sloppy, the solos uninspired, the rhythm section like someone building a garage.My guess is that someone hired a few 'ringers' for this show who simply didn't know the book. That, or half the band was soused, which I doubt Kenton would've allowed.I profoundly agree with the above reviewer: save your money. If you want something approximating what Kenton actually sounded like, buy the \\"Stan Kenton Today\\" live CD, which is a reissue of the double-album vinyl \\"Live in London\\" first released in 1972: it coos and screams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stan Kenton's Lost Concert","review":"Frankly, this DVD was disappointing. The sound is reasonable but the picture was bad. It was only possible to recognise individual musicians at times, Stan was just a blur, and there was no clarity at all throughout the concert. That was a shame as I have been waiting for a filmed recording of Stan and his Orchestra for a long time. It is obvious that the filming was done by an amateur and maybe the camera operator was unaware of the fuzziness that his/her filming produced. Unfortunately such an event cannot be repeated. The music was good and enjoyable but I sincerely hope that, with modern technology, someone can improve the clarity of picture for an what was possibly a memorable concert for those attending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Concert","review":"I have been a Kenton fan for almost 50 years.

They destroyed some great arrangements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this at all costs","review":"Despite hyperbolic publicity claims by the producer, who features himself and his name all over the place, this must be the most truly awful visual record of a performance ever offered for public sale. It looks as if it had been shot using a static home video camera producing images so weak that I defy anyone to identify a single member of the band - and no personnel, composers or arrangers are provided: truly unforgiveable for a release that is aimed at a specialised viewer.

Wrong. This is absolute drivel from beginning to end. Only Virgin records could give a band like this such free reign to doodle about. There is one decent Firth guitar solo and the rest is firmly in the Ornette Coleman/Free jazz idiom. Totally unlistenable. At least parts of 'leg end' (nirvana for mice) had some semblance of continuity, but even that was lost by the middle of side two. The thing is the band can play, so why this obsession with strange time signatures and weirdness? They reached an absolute nadir on the live 'greasy truckers 2' the most pretencious musings since Terry Riley in the late sixties.

As every reader probably knows, general relativity and quantum theory are both extremely successful, predictive theories, but have yet to be brought together in a single, complete framework that seems to clearly apply to our universe. Smolin did an excellent job in this book, already several years old, of discussing approaches to the problem, with emphasis on Loop Quantum Gravity. As usual while reading it I wished that I could plumb the depths of the underlying math, which of course the author did not attempt to present.Since the predictions of relativity seem to be holding up so well, I can't help wondering whether the current vogue is correct in assuming that gravity is much the same as other forces and is mediated by \\"gravitons\\". Might there be some deeper path to unification?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written","review":"This book addresses some extremely interesting topics, including string theory, quantum loop gravity, and halographic models of the universe. Unfortunately, it does not do so successfully. The author merely glosses over these topics and many deep subtopics as the disorganization of them and muddled writing ruin what otherwise might have been an interesting exercise in the comparison and contrast of approaches to developing a model of quantum gravity. The writing is so poor that I often gave up reading this book in frustration, only to return to it due to the interest in the subject matter, however ill-rendered. I recommend seeking a better treatment or treatments of the subject matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightening","review":"This is a great book for understanding what the scientific community has been up to in the field of theoretical physics in the last ten years. This was my introduction to both loop quantum gravity and to black hole thermodynamics. I learned some new things about string theory along the way. The only complaint I would have with this book is that it is a little less focused on the nature of the actual theories than I was led to believe. It comes off as a little bit more of a history of the theories and who contributed what, etc... But it is an excellent book for what it is, and so I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book got me started on a 2 year study of QFT","review":"Smolin's presentation of the three theories was so thought provoking for me that I realized that I wanted to learn more. I had majored in Physics 35 years ago so I had QM and SR under my belt but nothing more modern. One thing that I particualry liked about Smolin's presentation of the three theories currently being worked on - superstring theory, quantum loop theory and blackhole thermodynamics - was the balanced way he kept saying how all three undoubtedly would contribute to the ongoing progress rather than trying to say one has to be right to the exclusion of the other two - it's simply too early to tell. I've spent 2 years (with a tutor) studying QFT in order, hopefully, to be able to at least approach the mathematics behind these theories. I've just ordered a \\"First Course in String Theory\\" and realized that I had never written a review of Smolen's book to so-to-speak thank him so I now fill that gap."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for science lovers","review":"This book is divided into three sections,namely 1) Points of departure:deals with new conceptions like a)there is nothing outside the universe,b)in the future we will learn more,c)many observers,not many worlds and d)the universe is made of processes,not things.Next section is 2)What we have learned: deals with black holes,hidden regions,accelations and heat,\\"knots,links and kinks\\"(appears quite taugh for me)and strings. but still these two sections are mind blowing. The last sectionis is 3)The present frontiers: divided into a)the holographic universe,B)how to weave a string and c)what chooses the laws of nature? This section ends by summing up future possibilities for a complete QG theory with a hope to be achieved by 2010-2015.I also refer to the readers of this book to read Lee Smolin's highly readable article \\"Atoms of Space and Time\\"(Scientific American,January 2004).It will serve as a good starting point ."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disorganized in trying to get the point across","review":"First, this book has excellent and valid information, describing practically all aspects of the newest in theoretical physics. The only down-side is that whenever the author is trying to explain a concept, he would jump from one point to another, in a way that when you almost understand what he's trying to say, you suddenly become confused.I've read \\"A Brief History of Time\\" by Stephen Hawking, \\"Principle of Relativity\\" by Einstien himself, and 95% of the physics lectures by the Nobel Prize Winner Richard Feynman. I completely understood all these books I've read, even when it deals with heavy mathematical areas.I believe this author is quite knowledgable. So, this unfortunate situation must be due to his skill as a writer or communicator. Back in university, I've had professors who have multiple PhDs from prestigious schools, but are simply poor communicators and therefore give students an impression of incompatency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn almost nothing","review":"I have a pretty good background in math and physics. But I learned almost nothing here. I think someone with less background would learn even less. The problem is he never really defines anything, never makes clear whether he means a 'loop' is a real thing or just a calculation tool, etc.It is all just so mushy.Plus he talks a lot about theories that have no experimental tests, and none presently envisioned. This seems like metaphysics to me.You want a real popular science book that explains real science to a layman? Read QED by Feynman. Read Relativity Visualized by Epstein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooh Look, Quantum Black Holes","review":"I loved this book. Lee Smolin goes out on a limb in a lot of places, making unsupported conjectures. It might not be academically appropriate, but it's entertaining, the sort of thing that makes you sit back and think about why or why not they might be true.The book does have reasonable explanations for the fundamentals of quantum loop gravity (waving hands to avoid showing equations) and good explanations of the fundamental problems involved in creating a unification between general relativity and quantum physics. The author manages to give a layperson a glimpse of the beauty underneath - space as graph, information content within a volume & its relation to entropy; I hope I live long enough and remain sound of mind long enough to see the end result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Smart: Building Brain Power in the Early Years","review":"I am the mother of three children-for obvious reasons- a stay at home mom.

Otherwise, this CD is a cultural footnote and nothing you could actually enjoy listening to. Be warned -- this is nothing whatsoever like Kingsley's other work. The synth music is minimal and incidental, and the focus is on Jewish prayers/songs/something-or-other, all performed by a man who can't sing (or at any rate, whose voice is not compelling).I went from the high of finding this CD to the low of thinking, \\"What on earth is this and why did I just waste money on it?\\" within the first 20 seconds of track 1.

So I am a little confused about where the late 1960's/early 1970's dates in the item description come in.'The First Commandment' seems to have a decidedly un-1970's drum loop on it too - I take it that some of these tracks are remixes?The rest of the previews sound awful though, Kingsley seems to have been the less talented of the Jean-Jacques Perrey & Kingsley partnership, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"God is a Moog no","review":"Synthesizer music should focus on a synthesizer.

His phrasing approach is dragged and uninspiring. His attempts at scatting sound more like mis-timed ramblings. His band sounds good enough, and are the only redeeming element of the 60 minutes of pain the cd represents to me.I Dunno what his live performances are like, but the cd is VERY unimpressive.

Guess I was wrong. I was actually able to crack the case with the included tools (on the 2G I had to resort to a chisel). The instructions talk about prying up a locking clip with the tool so that you can remove the ribbon cable. I dutifully did that, but as it turns out, there is no locking clip, at least on mine there isn't, and prying with the tool simply breaks off the connector. The ribbon cable was in there with simple friction, so you could easily just pull it out and later push the new one back in. There was also a black sleeve over the end of the ribbon cable that needed to be removed (not mentioned in the instruction video). Knowing these two things, I could now successfully replace my battery, but instead I've got a broken iPod. Caveat Emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken battery connector","review":"I had the same experience as two other reviewers.

Absolutely fascinating! The reviews of this cd here on Amazon were so positive. And from what I understand, Bert Jansch is very influential in the folk scene. The cd art work is very nice, the guitar playing here is drop-dead beautiful, the tunes are all good, but why does he have to sing lead on most of his songs??? One kinder reviewer here related Bert's voice to a sinus infection. I believe it is worse. He regularly drifts into degrees of flatness, has awful phrasing, and frequent unintelligible mumblings that are simply not musical. Sort of reminds me of another great, John Renbourn, only not even that good.I will not continue to listen to this cd, despite the great guitar. too bad for me.

The performance dispalyed a lot of talents and sophistication of the fingerstyle technique. The music is enchanting and graceful, with many melodious chords and creative styles, and a consistently temperate character. Tracks 1, 5, 6, 7, & 10 are all mellifluent songs sung with swift-flowing guitar melodies.

You will learn more about vodou however at the same time you will learn other highly important and valuable magickal systems that will improve your life if you can manage to understand and keep an open mind. It does not go into great detail of the magickal systems however it does give the ideas and spells needed to start producing your own magick.

This book was disappointing (to me, at least) for the following reasons: too basic, not enough information, and it does NOT include photograghs of the finished landscapes.

Obviously, that means that we are not Jewish, but the book has an appeal for almost any faith or culture. Most mothers display the same types of behavior that Dan attributes to his mother, such as looking worried and pained but insisting that nothing is wrong, and reminding everyone that someday they will be gone and won't be bothering us anymore.

Is this a dream the Residents have for themselves? This is a part of the entire Mole legend that the Residents dreamed up, and have used in four previous recordings (Mark of the Mole, The Mole Show Live, The Tale of Two Cities, Intermission) However, as a whole, the Big Bubble is not a success. Using some of the most unlistenable singing the Residents ever released, and some of the most unlistenable music. I say this from the angle of a long-time (since 1978) Residents fan.There are some interesting cuts, especially Cry for Fire (which can be best described as bad sex followed by an incredible orgasm) but get this only if you are a die hard - gotta have it all fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw.","review":"This is the Residents doing yet another concept album.

I know this because I work for a firm that puts out units with these cards built in all the time. We actually had to do a re-call due to all the irradiation going on during the anthrax scare.

Took the first image (Nikon 5000) and had to double check that my image settings weren't changed. The camera wrote the image to disk faster than other cards I've used. To give an easy comparison, in 'fine' mode it writes as fast as it did in 'normal' with an older flash card.Then while uploading the images to my Mac, the files transfered almost twice as fast. i haven't timed it but it is definitely faster.Needless to say, I no longer use my other flash cards.

This Ultra II card comes with some worries. Since CF doesn't write at 9MB/sec, it uses a \\"buffer\\" to write a small amount (like 4 megs) to an ultra-fast buffer, then the image is slowly transferred to the main card. And there's the problem.I lost every \\"last image\\" on my trip to Italy. When I powered on the camera, took say 5 pictures, it would record 4 and lose the last image. This is because I was turning the camera off after taking the 5th picture. I needed to leave the camera on another 20 seconds to be sure the memory card finished transfer of the images. So it's very fast, for a small burst of pictures, but LEAVE THE CAMERA ON. I did a lot of \\"that's cool!\\" pictures... you turn the camera on, take a picture, turn the camera off to save battery life. Mistake.

Giovanni is quite brave here - he acknowledges and embraces the eroticism and desire associated with the male member. Cropping out their faces removes the distraction of personality, and allows Giovanni to accomplish his goal of having the reader focusing on the variation, individuality, and overall beauty of the organs between these men's legs.The images push the boundaries of what is regarded as art, but the photos are never vulgar or pornographic.

My hat's off to Pratchett for his brave invention, but in this case the results are mixed.The jokes, puns, take-offs, etc., fly about in rapid-fire, but the author's coyness eventually becomes tedious, and his characters cease to convince. In fact, the best ones--Igor, for example--disappear from the real action in the last third or so of the novel. So does the author, actually; toward the end he seems to lose interest and merely outlines a denouement. Quite a letdown. . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Pratchett is one of my favorite authors","review":"I look forward to every book.

Pratchett satirizes Zen, mathematics ( he may have written the only characterin all of literature based on a mathematical bifurcation), death and Death, kung-fu movies, accountants and a dozen more. If you've read a couple of the series, you'll understand this one. It does start a bit slowly, but Pratchett has a lot of setting up to do before all hell breaks loose with the Five Horsemen of the Apocalypse. Yes, five. There is just *a lot* in this book. No wizards, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but Pratchett's done better","review":"I'm a longtime fan of Terry Pratchett and the whole Discworld series, and it's rare for any book not to completely grip me. This is one of those rarities. It's not a BAD book by any stretch of the imagination -- it's always a treat to see Susan and Death take center stage again, and the bits about the Auditors struggling to grasp their human forms were pure gold. For some reason, though, I didn't quite get pulled into this book the way Discworld does at its best. Oh well -- you can't hit a home run every time. I'll still be back for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stephen Briggs Reading of Thief of Time","review":"The Stephen Briggs reading of Thief of Time is great, in keeping with his outstanding readings of other Pratchett books. I originally bought the less-expensive multiple-reader recording. Unfortunately, it was painfully jarring. It distorted the characters, humor, pacing, and the whole tone of the book so badly that I couldn't bear listening to it, and stopped partway through. What a waste of money! Fortunately, I saw the Stephen Briggs recording at the public library (bless some wise librarian for purchasing that one!). I listened to it with relief and laughter. Now I've ordered my own copy here at [...]. For some reason this Briggs recordig is more costly than the other, but it is still the one to buy. I'll listen to it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry does it again! And Susan's Back!","review":"If your a new Terry Pratchett reader, be warned, these are no ordinary fantasy books. They will take on a wild ride through a flat world that sits on the back of four elephants who themselves stand on the back of a giant turtle. And that's just the beginning! In this book, Terry has his beloved characters take on the nature of Time. DEATH's grandaughter, Susan is back, dragged kicking and screaming into the adventure. This is the kind of book that you savor every line (and every last chocolate!). The author's comic, but astute observations of human nature make this much more than a simple fantasy novel. If you've started with Thief of Time and loved it, then go back and read these others, you won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The return of Susan!","review":"Let me start off my admitting I have read nearly all of the disc world books available on audiobook. I was very excited to see this one offered at such a reasonable price, compared to previous books from Isis Audio that are double the price of this one. The reader changes every few pages of text, which I found rather annoying at first, but I got used to it. If you liked the character of Susan Sto Helit, death's grand daughter, she figures as one of the leads in this book. The other leads are all new. It had Pratchett's usual blend of hilarity and plot. Though this plot was more complicated than usual, so I may have to listen to it a few times to REALLY figure out what was going on. That's OK though, because disc world books are more about process than outcome, and the more I listen, the more I get my money's worth, right? :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it.","review":"I've never read any of Pratchett's stuff before. Someone bought this book for me as a gift. I tried reading it. I got to page 120 and just gave up. This book is boring, pedantic, and tedious. Maybe I just don't get the jokes. Maybe I need to be more familiar with \\"disc world\\" or whatever it's called. But this book sucks. There is no character development. There is virtually no description of what the characters look like. This book is simply a plodding nightmare with a confusing plot and pretentious philosophy. I know, the book is supposed to be tongue-in-cheek; and the philosophy is supposed to be an in-joke, but I don't get the joke, and Pratchett never takes the time to explain it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming visit to Pratchett's Discworld","review":"I'm not giving this a lukewarm review because it's shabby or poorly written or otherwise sub-par, only because it simply didn't turn out to be my taste. \\"Thief of Time\\" consists of vignette after vignette and conversation after conversation on the nature of time, humanity, and the absurdities of life, all done with a humorous Monty Python-esque and Douglas Adams-ish bent. Individual scenes are somewhat amusing (I like Monty Python and Douglas Adams) but the whole thing sort of meanders and spins its wheels. I like momentum and story and progression, even with humorous satires, and this just sort of lost me time and again (no pun intended). But, as stated, strong fans of offbeat humor and satire may like this more than I did. I hear a lot of good things about Terry Pratchett, so I'll probably eventually try another of his \\"Discworld\\" titles (apparently it doesn't matter where you start).

Tugs are part of the unseen infrastructure that brings us food and cars--we don't take them for granted so much as ignore them completely. This is unfortunate, because tugboats are a fascinatingly complex subject. They are built-to-order, specialized for open water, harbor and river service. They push, they pull, and they put out fires. This book assumes no knowledge of the subject, making concepts such as towing and thrust propulsion mechanisms accessible and interesting.

Racism is a part of the human condition, in fact, Black Americans who state that people of color cant be racist, are, in actuality, planting the seed of racist thought. Feagin does not seem to understand that white's from Kant to Jefferson were actively questioning why certain races of people where seemingly culturally advanced and why others seemed to be stunted. Throughout history people have made war or dealt in other ways with different culturers, comparison naturally begins (race being a factor of many such comparisons)..example: in the 12th century Arab traders in the South of Africa noted that the inhabitants were dirty, drank to much and behaved in a lewd manner to their own women. Rightfully or not those traders formed a comparative opinion; much of what we now call racism is just that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero Stars Doesn't Seem to Be an Option","review":"As the old adage tells us, \\"If you can't say something good, then don't say anything at all.\\"With that in mind, since a review would be pointless if I said nothing, I must obviously say something positve about \\"Skills of the Vagabonds.\\"Hmmm....let me think a moment.

Jack Finney may be the most well known and capable at his craft, but Peter Delacorte earns high marks for this story of time travel to the 1930's Hollywood. Delacorte has grappled well with the consequences of travel in time and leaves much unanswered, which is as it should be. The Hollywood of yesteryear is captured here in small nuances that do more than descriptive prose. Not many books willwake me at five in the morning for a good two and a half hour bleary eyed read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best novel I've read in the last five years","review":"Read this in 2000 or thereabouts and just finished re-reading it. Absorbing story, very intelligent writing. But it seems to me the ending is supposed to be a kind of cliffhanger. So, come on! Where's the darn sequel??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read !","review":"Peter Delacorte's novel Time On My Hands is the best read I've had in years! From the very first page, I was hooked. The premise, of being able to travel back in time, to alter history, had me trying to guess what was going to happen on the next page, or even the next paragraph. Just when I thought everything was going to turn out the way it was supposed to, a wrench would be thrown in! Then, to my delight, it seemed like the whole toolbox was thrown in!Let me tell you...I have been made a huge fan of Mr. Delacorte's writings from here on in. If there is to be a sequel to this novel and I sure hope there is, you can count on me being one of the first of his many fans, to line up and purchase it.Thank you Mr. Delacorte for opening up so many discussions with this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelieveable!!!!!!!!!","review":"Peter could build the tension so vivid, but at teh same time he can turn it into laughter. This book makes me wonder wheter time travel is possible or not, but the most prominent thing is wheter it is a worth-trying travel. Never heard of Peter's name, he is absolutely not as famous as Ernest hemingway, Shidney Sheldon, etc, but He has the thing that makes him different and stunning."},{"rating":"1","title":"confused political polemic disguised as time travel","review":"I'm a fan of time travel from way back. Finney's novels, Matheson's Bid Time Return, Allen Appel's books, and others. Time on My Hands starts well, but bludgeons you with anti-Reagan propaganda. I'm not the former president's biggest supporter, but I thought Forrest Gump had wandered into the plot. The time travel aspects are really confused, as Delacorte's understanding of time travel has several holes in logic. The ending is a complete cop-out, almost as if he had to meet a deadline. Its questions on the hazards of time travel affecting one's existence aren't well-thought out at all. You'd be better off re-reading Time and Again, or something like Ken Grimwood's Replay, Darryl Brock's If I Never Get Back, or even Kinsella's Shoeless Joe, which has elements of time travel. But skip this one and travel to anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"time on my hands","review":"This was light entertainment that ultimately disappointed. Borrowing heavily from Replay, Back to the Future, and Jack Finney (old photos to lend credibility) this comes across as the plot of a Quantum Leap episode. However, the highly negative opinions expressed about a highly regarded American are too heavily handed and the main character has some glaring character flaws that are too easily glossed over. I missed the bantering between Sam and Al. Needs a sequel to remedy the letdown of not even a hint of a solution. If you want to devise your own alternative endings then write your own story! Again, ok for an afternoon on the veranda but I preferred the Delorean over the boat. Keep trying Peter, Matheson and Finney are hard to match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stopping Ronald Reagan","review":"I enjoyed this book. The main charactter is sent back in time to alter events so that Ronald Reagan does not become President. The use of old photographs works pretty well throughout the book. Its tough to further describe what goes on here without giving away cool parts of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trouble from the start","review":"The first hurdle you have to overcome with this book is accepting the fact that the best use for a time machine in 1994 is to go back and prevent a two time, democratically elected president from being a two time, democratically elected president.Once you get past that, you have a pretty shallow story. The lead character isn't very likeable, there is no character development and the circumstances surrounding young Dutch Reagan's second passing are just plain silly.On the bright side Mr. Delacorte does a fine job taking the reader through the golden era of Hollywood and the Los Angeles area circa 1938.In summary, if you hate Ronald Reagan this book is for you. If you're looking for a good piece of fiction then look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"time travel lover","review":"I enjoyed the basic story in this book however Mr. Delacorte needs to get over his Reagan hatred or at least subdue it a smidge!Sheesh, the repeated cheap shots and Reagan-ranting came close to ruining an otherwise good book.

I'm a Henning Mankel, Jo Nesbo, and Michael Gruber fan, so this series just doesn't cut it for me, so far. I hear it's a fairly popular series, and I'm willing to try one more novel in it.

But there are core problems, which I have experienced in the 8 months I have owned it. I frequently grind spices.The first problem is that it is hard to load. The bizarre engineering requires that you open the grater in the middle, which causes all the whole nutmegs to fall out. It is awkward to keep the nutmegs inside while also loading the nutmeg which is currently being grated.The more important problem is a fatal design flaw in how the nutmeg being grated is held. Generally, it grates a nutmeg part of the way, and then the \\"teeth\\" inside which grip the nutmeg strip the nutmeg (like stripping a screw), and you are unable to continue grating. The result is that I have a lot of half-grated nutmegs.It might, nevertheless, be your best option."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy","review":"I bought one of these 2 years ago when I was traveling through Paris.

Grating nutmeg on a typical grating board always made me nervous that I might take some skin off my fingers.

Although all of the songs don't rank with Paul's best, the production is warm and cozy and the playing is nice and raw. This is what Mono should have been. That was a great album, but this one is better, in my opinion. I think as long as Paul doesn't overproduce his records, they tend to be good because his personality is so likable that it overshadows any sloppiness in the writing. Pick this up if you like early Rod Stewart. Think cloudy days and shag carpet and a big glass of brown ale.

I think the one and two star reviews are just people looking for anything in life to gripe about. Folker ranks up with 'Mono/Stereo' and '14 Songs' as Paul's best solo albums but takes longer to fully sink in and appreciate. The only song I could have done without is '100 dollar groom' but gems like 'Now I Wonder', 'Anyway's Alright', 'What About Mine', 'Lookin' Up In Heaven', 'As Far As I Know', 'How Can You Like Him?', and 'Gun Shy' more than make up for it. I bought a lot of albums last year and this one was tops."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another grower!","review":"Great direct melodies, words that allow thought and rock n roll as only Paul Westerberg seems to know how to do. Such a tuneful rock n roll album!

We're so lucky, he's sustaining me for one, though many listens are neccesary just like with all the greatest music, for the charms to surface. Wonderful that he can put out such excellent albums as every single one since and including Suicaine Gratification, so regularily. I manage to get to the point where I totally appreciate *and love* one he's released just one year before and even before I reach that point, there's another for me to buy of the same high quality, alhtough very different again from all of the others, apart from in its intensity.

So I gave it try and I loved it. It was most intriguing and inspiring, not mention really scarey in some parts of the book.

The plot is just a mix of a hundred other movies you've already seen, but it's done in an off-beat way that actually makes it pretty original ... And the zombies! No shambling people in white makeup here -- each one is a way over the top gooey disgusting mass of trailing eyeballs, bulging brains, and bloody sores! One of these things looks like nothing more than a pile of bloody flesh! Great acting? Ok lighting? Adequate production values? None of the above -- but I still recommend this movie hands down over most of the unoriginal by-the-numbers trash out there ... it's obviously done by people without ANY money, but with a lot of love for the genre ... and a lot of really gross zombies, too! Loads of fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gore galore for fans of schlock horror","review":"Enjoyable zombie butt-kicking and gore are a little let down by a slow first half with way too much padding and overall dirt cheap production values.

Speaking of fulci, the dvd cover is totally a rips off of ZOMBIE but whatever, this is a pretty good pack of cheap thrills and blood. the scene where the guy hides in the room at the end is funny plus the whole fan scene made me laugh ... how did it slice up the BACK of the dude's head???!"},{"rating":"1","title":"if i could rate this zero stars i would.","review":"I am a huge zombie flick fan. in fact, i prefer low budget horror movies over most genres. i was really really excited to watch this movie despite what other reviewers had written. i am like other fans of the genre: give every movie no matter how low budget a chance. this was a mistake. the footage was horribly shot and the acting was horrible and the ancient looking zombies looked like trash. i wanna see fans killing people, not just red liquid splattering on the floor. give me gore. gore isnt just cheap fake blood running down the tiles of a floor, its ripping flesh apart, its decapitation, its not Flesh Freaks. Believe me DO NOT buy this movie. find someone who was stupid enough to buy it and try to watch it. i couldnt even get through the whole movie. that is absurd. the only other movie i couldnt make it all the way through was that David Spade movie \\"Dickie Roberts.\\" horrible horrible horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goofy Zombies and a build up that goes nowhere","review":"There was no flesh tearing whatsoever in this film.

The plot is solid and the challenges the players face can range from deadly traps to puzzle solving encounters, it's up to the DM.

While it is very much a teen book, it is not so immature that it is impossible for an older reader to enjoy. I am 20 now and am truly enjoying my second read-through.This is one of those books which I believe has been unfairly overlooked by readers, as well as one which I hope to see in the limelight someday.

I would recommend The Hobbit or The Lord of the Rings to any reader who enjoyed The Wind Singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The Wind Singer by William Nicholson was an unexecptional fantasy, parts of which were downright banal. As the author is an experienced screen writer, one would expect more freshness in plot and dialog. Instead, parts of it read as if it were written by the 7-10 age group, instead of written for them.The book started with promise, but became mired in cliches, well-known plot devices and too many unbelievable things--too many even for a fantasy. It is the first of a trilogy, but I have no intention of reading the rest. If you are looking for fresh, interesting children's fantasy, stick to Harry Potter or give The Thief Lord a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked some of it...","review":"I think I liked this book until I got about halfway through.

What a wonderful beginning to a trilogy! The finesse and sheer brilliance that has gone into writing this novel amazes me. As an avid fantasy reader, I believe that it is very important for a fantasy novel to contain elements such as those displayed in this novel. I certainly rank this up with the best: Harry Potter and LOTR. Not only is this book an enjoyable read for junior-high students, it is also a valuable gem to be read by all ages. It teaches lessons such as the importance of individuality, a valuable lesson indeed. I was captivated from the moment of Pin-Pin's first test to the shockingly clever end.

Another \\"plus\\" is that microfiber dries much faster than traditional cotton terrycloth.

Our power outlet in the back seat is in the rear of the center console near the floor.

I have enough shame facing the world in my overweight body.

First off this book is small and is more of a booklet than a book. Now at a price of $6.95 I might be ok with that but a list price of $16.95 is just insane. The other problem I have with the book is that there really isn't much information about fly fishing for bass. More than half of this little book is spent on the biology of large and smallmouth bass, and the locations and structure you will find them in. If that is what your interested in you can get this information from any of the other numerous books written on this subject. The one chapter on fly selection is ok, but again nothing ground breaking for anyone who is more than a complete novice.I am still waiting for someone to put a decent book together on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitly worth reading","review":"If you are starting out fly fishing for smallmouth bass this book is a must have. The information is very good. The real primary target is smallmouth bass fishing in rivers but there is a lot of good tips and information in general.A person can save a lot of time and expence with the right information, and this book has just that. I read it over and over to try and get all the information possible. If you follow the advise and use the information provided you will improve your fly fishing experance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I was not a fan of this skimmer.

No instuctions either. It doesn't have anything to adjust the air or bubbles. And one of the reviewers wrote that this is better than a Coralife. No way.

I could have put it down any time and not continued.

As a teacher, I would highly recommend it. It offers a mixture of photographs, drawings and text. I personally liked the back and forth style of the book.

The setting started off about six main characters about how they were in sent to camp. The characters are Cotton, Goodenow, Lally 1, Lally 2, Shecker, and Theft. This story was written in third point of view and I really didn't like it being in third point of view because it just didn't make any kind of sense to me. I think it would have been better written in first person. In this book they had a lot of flash backs. The flash back I liked the most was when they were talking about Cotton's mom and how she was obsessed about her face and not getting old. The rising action started when the six boys high jacked the truck and went to a buffalo preserve. The symbolism was when they one first place and got the buffalo head. I think they should of just got a trophy because it's stupid to get a buffalo head when u could just buy a trophy instead of killing buffalos!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A stupid book","review":"The book was very hard to follow it jumps back and forth too much and had very random flashbacks. The point of the book was six kids got dropped off at Box canyon boys camp by there parents who don't care for there kids pretty much going to save buffalo for being brutally murdered. The characters all had some talent that had potential but they didn't follow one another, no team work. There was little symbolism in the book pretty much they had a buffalo head as a trophy that represented first place at the camp. The story took place in Arizona; the point of view was third person and it was best in third because you got to see the misery in all the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real life expierence","review":"This book was amazing. I believe it is extremely helpful for teens discovering themselves, where they fit in in the world, and how their own past has effected them.

I have many friends, great grades, and I play sports. However, this doesn't mirror my past. I have had troubled moments, just like anyone would expect to have growing up. I have felt some of the same insecurities, just not to the same extremes. If you are reading this for English, I would deeply consider paying attention. You will better understand your own actions after you read it.
