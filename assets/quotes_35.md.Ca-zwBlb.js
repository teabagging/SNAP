The Ultimate lines is rehasing the already overdone weapon X angle,but I got to say this turned out to be a rather enjoying read that I finished in one sitting. Nightcrawler,Juggernaut,Sabertooth and Rogue are all introduced in this collection (though on the exception of Sabertooth they're all brief). Colonel Wraith isn't anything special as a villian but he's done effectivley and you just can't wait to see someone finaly get the better of him the whole time. Nick Fury is probably the weakest of the characters handled in this volume but what is added to the character of Wolverine more than makes up for it.Overall Return to Weapon X is a fast paced action packed second part to the Ultimate X-Men line.

In this series Professor X's team consists of Cyclops, Marvel Girl, Iceman, Beast, Storm, Wolverine, and Colossus. But this volume introduces the characters Nightcrawler, Rogue, Juggernaut, and Sabretooth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Overall, this comic compares very unfavorably to both the regular X-men titles and to the other Ultimate titles (especially \\"Ultimate Spider-man\\" and the flagship \\"The Ultimates\\"). I understand but don't agree with the decision to launch the series with an all-star line up of the most popular X-men, rather than with either the traditional classic or modern teams. The problem is, it doesn't feel original. Rather than a re-imagined team, this team is a cut and paste from various other sources (Iceman and costumes from the movies, Cyclops from the 90s comics, etc), and the whole thing seems a bit lazy. The writing style is very similar to Millar's work on \\"The Ultimates.\\" The dialogue is worse (characters all have the same voice and mannerisms), but the basic pattern of visual exposition with grandiose, movie-like shots is maintained. That worked well with larger-than-life characters like Captain America and the Hulk, but doesn't fit personality-driven characters like the X-men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facts are what counts","review":"I found this book well researched and stuffed with proven fact. The author hardly ever goes as far as speculating. I find comments such as that by reader JJMcGrath particularly stupid because they try to evade seious discussion by joking their way out of it. A book like this is a good opportunity to ask the question: If all the information, the testimonies by pilots and ex-airforce top ranks, the eyewitness reports from hundreds if not thousands of people, the tons of classified documents crafted by Army, Airforce and various government agencies, if all that is just wishful thinking by some UFO-lunatics, where is the book that relates proof that all the counts against the US government are totally untrue? I haven't found a single one yet, and I would really like the McGraths in this country to tell me."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does Randle Sleep at Night?","review":"I often wonder how Kevin Randle sleeps at night. Then again the reporters for the World Weekly News sleep through the night just fine! Shoddy research that ignores even the basic techniques (as well as any information which disproves his case)is a hallmark of Randle's work. But I guess it is a living because so many people want to believe in the mythical government cover-up which is spoon-fed by scores of Hollywood movies. Anyone who has ever worked for the government would know that a conspiracy or a cover-up would not last. It would be much more likely that the \\"Roswell saucer\\" would be accidently routed down main street like a parade float than no one would talk for 40 years! Even Monica talked!

Assuming that one reads at about one page per minute, it's difficult to believe that one could recoup the five to six hours invested in reading this long-winded, tired, poorly written, poorly organized book in saved time. The time management pointers are very basic, and have been written about many times [this book is essentially a 'compilation' (to be polite) of past research]; the author (Marshall Cook) seems to 'borrow' liberally from many sources, and particularly from Stephen Covey's far superior '7 Habits of Highly Effective People'. I recommend '7 Habits' or Brian Tracy's 'Eat That Frog' -- a short (113 page), easy-to-read book that gives better information, but can be read in an hour or so."},{"rating":"2","title":"love at first sight","review":"wonderful selection of images. at home on a coffee table as well as on your night stand. best gift for any dog lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dog lovers book!","review":"Beautiful photos and thoughtful words.

Liddell Hart presents Scipio Africanus in a prose that is easy and interesting to read. I heard of Africanus before, but until I read this, I did not know how much of a brilliant tactician and strategic General he was. Ruthless on the battlefield and loyal to the Emperor's of Rome, he was either a valuable ally or a fierce enemy. One of Western Civilization's greatest General's. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating account of Scipio and insight into how society treats heroes","review":"My only regret after putting this book down is that I had not read it much earlier. I had not heard of Scipio in school (Caesar is more popular yet less successful and honorable) so I was very surprised that he brilliantly defeated Carthage and Hannibal using so many 'trick plays'.I was also struck by what an honorable person he was and how his friends and military enemies revered him for it.It was also fascinating to read about the social issues that remain timeless even until today. This includes the crowd's tendency to be eternally fickle and forgetful; the opposition politics he encountered--due to vices such as envy and jealousy--with their lust for revenge at another's success; and the tendency for proud senate members to be short-sighted about the national situation and future threats.I think everyone would benefit in reading this book about a great person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Read","review":"This book was entertaining from beginning to end. It provided me with a good in depth look at Scipio and his succesful campaigns that did not put me to sleep as many books do. Its best quality is how Liddell-Hart went in depth on the personal side of Scipio as a man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work","review":"I do not give 5 star ratings on much of anything that I review, this was an exception. I had barely heard of this great general before and now I know much more about him. That is what a historical book should do, but this one was also a joy to read and went too fast. For every statement about Scipio there is explination and justification. I'm sure he was a much more complicated man than even this book can go into, more's the pity, but a great general he was....possibly the greatest.A must buy to the military reader and should be required reading for not only historians, and soldiers, but heads of state as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exercise video that delivers","review":"This is the most challenging, yet satisfying exercise video I have ever done.

I got so frustrated that I quit the video. If you have reservations about tough choreography--this video is probably not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Synthpop/futurepop dreck","review":"This album is nothing more than a catalogue of all of the synthpop/futurepop dreck that has been masking itself as goth and industrial music since the late 1990's. Having heard these bands played in clubs I can honestly say that I couldn't tell one from another. Why? Because ALL of them sound exactly the same.They have the same exact beats and same exact angst driven lyrics. I can see why some teens would like them, but if you are above the age of 30,like I am,they will most likely annoy you and make you want to bang your head against a wall.To those of you who have been calling this music goth please think again. In the 1980's there was a clear distinction between synthpop(Depeche Mode,Book Of Love,etc...) and goth(Christian Death,Sisters Of Mercy). Please don't confuse the two, because they are not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not goth, but still good","review":"Goth? No...Good? Absolutly! This is for any cybertechno/kind of industrial fan. It also is a preview to awesome bands such as Hocico and The Birthday Massacre. My one problem is the \\"goth\\" in \\"neo-goth\\"more like cyber....yea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hahaha Stupid....","review":"\\"Neo-Goth\\" is definantly not the right title for this compilation when there is only 5 actual GOTH bands on this release, most are EBM or Industrial bands. I am giving this 2 stars only because the actual Goth bands on this release are good (and even some of the Industrial tracks, even though they shouldn't be on such a misleading compilation).

Once into it, however, one finds that the author was primarily concerned with publishing a book and less concerned with providing useful information. What is positively maddening about this book is the lack of specifics. A chapter will begin discussing the importance of, for example, nutrition yet conclude without imparting any real information beyond the basic generality that nutrition is an important factor in fitness. The author almost admits the lack of substance by admonishing the reader, albeit in an indirect way, to search for the missing info in another location. So in the end all the book has done is illuminate subjects on which other books should be purchased. Luckily, I kept my receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Discworld, only not funny","review":"I bought this DVD because I am a huge fan of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. This animated series is faithful to the novel in every respect but one: it's not funny. All the clever narration and humourous observations that are present in Pratchett's work are completely absent from this DVD. It's 147 minutes of sheer boredom and disappointment. Please, save your money and don't buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the books instead!","review":"Being a BIG Terry Pratchett fan doesn't change the fact that the animation is terrible, and the characters lack the details that make them Esme, Gytha and Magrat. All the subtleties are gone.The look of the witches is all wrong; Granny Weatherwax is not intimidating, Nanny Ogg is not naughty, and Magrat, for some reason, is sexy. Of course Christopher Lee is going to be brilliant for Death-- who else would you pick?! But if the rest of the visuals become painful to watch, and the witches are flat, then the video is a waste of time. Read the books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"In all honesty, I didn't watch this movie through completely. I couldn't. It was just too painful.I've read Pratchett's Discworld novels for years and was thrilled to see that they had adapted one of his stories to animation. The transition from words to action was poorly executed, however. None of the subtleties of his humor come across in the cartoon.Nor was I prepared for the choice of animation. This type of cartooning is far inferior to that which can be seen on television's Saturday morning lineup.Save your money and buy the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really...","review":"The book is better, it's as simple as that.

If you're a Disc fan, You'll really enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad!","review":"I'm a HUGE Pratchett fan, own all the Discworld books, but this is just dreadful stuff. Poor drawing, poor animation, poor voice work, uninteresting music. Too bad, really. I bought both this and Soul Music, and wish I hadn't!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book!","review":"If you've read \\"Wyrd Sisters,\\" the book, then this DVD will be both more enjoyable and redundant. The animation is horrible, and the voices are too cartoony at times. If you've read the book, then you'll understand what's going on, but if you haven't, you'll be confused about a number of things. In short, skip the DVD and read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Too bad there aren't negative star ratings. I had great hopes for this after watching Hogsfather... I was extremely disappointed! The voices were annoying (especially Magrats which was akin to a dentists drill and fingernails on the chalkboard... at the same time) and the animation childish at best. Coming from a genious like Pratchett I was expecting great entertainment geared towards adults, but this was so dumbed down for children that it was painful to watch at times. But I did watch it all, hoping against hope that it would improve. It didn't. I'm sure glad that I only rented it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy the books, burn the dvd","review":"Isn't there a rating below 1 star?Don't buy this, don't rent it, don't even borrow it for yourself if you like any Pratchett book. It is perfectly suitable for children under about the age of 9 if they aren't very smart and can sit staring at Saturday morning cartoons for hours at a time.The screen writer apparently didn't realize that leaving out all the great puns, hilarious allegory, and brilliant dialog created by Terry Pratchett, would leave you with a really pathetic movie.Buy ALL the Weird World books but if you buy this DVD , don't blame me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful adaptation of a great book","review":"First off, I should warn you that I am a Pratchett fan. I love the Discworld stories, and am very fond of his witches.Whenever a beloved book is adapted to a screen, be it large or small, there is the risk of the director or the screenwriter botching the job (_The Postman_ comes to mind). Happily Keven Costner had nothing to do with this production.The animation is of high quality, the voices were well cast (Christopher Lee does a splendid job as YOU KNOW WHO) and the story kept me and my children (ages 6 and 9) involved and amused.Sure there are some plot elements that were shortened up, but I guess they didn't want an epic (speaking of Kevin Costner). And why in the name of Nipper did they put 1:48 of vid on 3 tapes? I recommend the DVD version just to save the shelf space!Overall: A fine entertainment, not just for Pratchett fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very faithful to the book","review":"This video collection is an excellent adaptation of the book, faithful but simplified. It's definitely an English comedy -- the humor is low-key and conversational. Not a knee-slapper by any means, but still funny. Two previous reviews observed that the animation was either excellent or awful. Perhaps the best adjective is \\"thorough\\" -- it's not primitive or cheaply done in the style of some throwaway American cartoon animation (i.e. no cheesy animation \\"loops\\" or other shortcuts) but the drawing itself is in a style that people might not care for. Some American viewers might have trouble following the dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as the books","review":"Terry Pratchetts books have always provided us with an often sarcastic but always funny look at our own world portrayed through in weird and wonderful worlds through the eyes of equally strange characters such as the witches. So it was with great excitement that I watched the tv movies on our TV. However I was a bit dissapointed with how they had come out. To me they had lost that sense of strange humour that Terry Pratchett had put in his books becoming stale and not at all interesting. Both the characters and backgrounds became flat, with voice acting that also was not that great. To me if you want to get into Terry Pratchett read the books dont watch the movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't regret buying this cd at all","review":"A lot of people that I have talked to about Arsis claimed that this was their worst album, nowhere near as good as Celebration of Guilt, so I was a bit skeptical of buying this cd. After seeing them last night in concert, I immediately bought this cd, and I have to say that this is FAR from being their worst. The songs are incredibly catchy, melodic, but brutal and unrelenting all at the same time. The only complaint I have with this cd is that it is WAY too short, but that's nitpicking at best. Arsis is by far one of the kinds of Melodic Death Metal these days, and this album proves that. I would recommend this for any fan of In Flames, Dark Tranquillity, At the Gates, and even some american bands such as Trivium, and Lamb of God. Don't waist your time!

I grew to enjoy the original series because the characters were done so well, even if the science is iffy. CSI-Miami, however, leaves a lot to be desired. A friend of mine bought this for me because I watch the original show. My problem with this show? 1st of all, if Eric Delco was working in a real lab and bought marijuana, he would have been fired!!! No questions asked or explanations accepted!! I hate Delco's character. He gets away with so much borderline behavior that this show becomes unrealistic.

After a little research, I decided to try this product of the many that are out there. This software is not expensive and for me, it does what I expected it to do. It is easy to set up and use, and I am using it with an Audio-Technica PL120 turntable. The first LP I converted was Stevie Wonder's Innervisions, and with this album in particular, the songs run together, i.e. there is no separation between the tracks. This software allowed me to create fairly accurate tracks so I could access individual songs. I also cleaned up some background noise with the \\"one click\\" noise reduction, and the music from this old album sounds great. This is my first software for this purpose so unfortunately I cannot compare it to others. What I can tell you is that it is inexpensive, easy to use, and it does what it says it will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - lousy customer service","review":"I was ready to purchase fairly expensive, high-end authoring software for converting vinyl into CDs until I read a review on this product.

My main complaint is that when I upgraded to the next version, I did not get the upgrade discount and after sending 3 emails to customer service not a one of them have been answered.

The only reference to using it for a lid (e.g. toy box, blanket chest, etc) is the Amazon description.The low rating is simply a reflection of the product description, I have no reason to doubt that this item would be fine when used as intended.Alas, there was no picture on the page to show what this item looks like installed or the inaccurate description would have been apparent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too flamboyant.","review":"\\"The Salt Letters: A Novel\\" was a book that interested me greatly from its plot summary. I had not read about anyone coming from Australia to America via a boat, nor have I read about unmarried women making such a voyage. I ended up learning nothing about these topics. Author Christine Balint made her story much too artistic. It left me thinking, \\"And the point of this was...\\" True love? Perseverance? I have no idea. I would rather she have focused on the taboo relationship between the cousins rather than the voyage, since that was the most difficult to read and understand.

For all of you first time buyers out there do not even consider getting plastic gears they'll break easy and jam easier. This gun also comes with 8k of bbs, which is convenient just because you don't have to pay extra shipping for another package. My only problem with this gun is the way the battery loads, its both hard to get out and get in so don't expect to do any battery switching in the middle of games unless you scrap the plastic around the barrel and just tape it on (something i'll probably end up doing.All in all though this is a great gun for the priceI highly recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"good gun","review":"I really like the wieght and the feel for this gun it is very accurate.Pros:wieght & sizelooks sweetmag cap.semi/full autostockcons:you have to move the bbs into the feed sometimesbattery is ok(it gets cold when its in the cold temp. for to long"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam gun, never buy","review":"I've been airsofting for 4+ yrs, this was my FIRST gun.

She loves dragonflies and is constantly in the yard, so I thought this would be a nice addition. The battery in one of the luminaries could not be placed in because of the soldering which protruded out directly above where the battery needed to be placed. Most disappointing, is that the other luminary (which I could get the battery in) doesn't even work, meaning it does not light up. Lastly, the product arrived quite poorly and unprofessionally packaged. If I purchased this for myself I guess it would be ok, but I'm disappointed because I truly wanted my Mom to enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Her instruction may be very good but this was filmed in the early 1990's.

But most of the sample questions don't reflect how the real test is like. You don't find complex logarithms on an AP Chem test, and ETS won't be nice enough to ask you which elements are considered Alkali Earth Metals. Avoid this book! It costs more than most other AP Chem tests. Instead, try the comprehensive Princeton Review AP Chemistry. REA may be good at covering AP history topics, but when it comes to science, try another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away: it is full of unrealistic questions and errors","review":"This book provides six full-length practice exams. Unfortunatelly after going over them with my daughter I have discoverd that the questions do not realistically represent the coverage and the level of dificulty of recent AP tests. Even worse the book if full of errors, omissions, and logical flaws, in questions themself and in the provided explanations (and I know what I am talking about since I teach chemistry in college)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just The Straight Stuff","review":"The entire REA series is great if you want a book with no B.S., with neither colorful anecdotes nor silly digressions. The Chemistry book is great because it provides a subject-by-subject \\"method of attack\\" for the real AP test. The sample tests in the back give a great sounding of how much you've learned, and the short-answer explanations are really informative. All around the best way to get ready for the AP. If you want regents level, though, this book is going to strike you a little abstract. Definitely AP only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Better Accessories Separately!","review":"This looks like a good starter kit, but when you price them altogether, you're better off buying them all separately. The earpiece/microphone doesn't stay in your ear even with that silly clip, so buy a Sony model that wraps around your ear or a headset or Gel accessory by Jabra. The charger is cheap and flimsy, so I'd go with Sony Ericsson's Premium Vehicle Power Charger (also reviewed) that is a much hardier design. As far as the belt case goes - forget it. It's flimsy and cheap. Get a Sony \\"belt holster\\" (also reviewed) or a more expensive leather case holder for your belt.

The ear-piece from my set did not work at all and the ear bud is quite large and very uncomfortable. The leather on the phone cover is VERY cheap (as expected as the item only cost 9.99). The 2 prongs/jacks, which need to be inserted into the bottom of the phone, have to be jammed into the phone just to get them to seat properly because they are bigger than they are supposed to be (compared to the Sony factory size prongs on the Sony charger that came with my phone).

The supply company we ordered from (only one time) sent the pen samples in an attempt to entice us to order more. But all of their pens sucked, and this one was no different. Its barrel size makes any attempt at writing anything unwieldy and difficult at best. The ink flow is comparable to a .29 cent Bic.

There are almost no facts in it about Seabiscuit. The acting and writing is low-quality. The Irish trainer stuff is pure fiction. I wonder if most of the real people involved in Seabiscuit's life refused to sign releases, so they blatantly fictionalized them.

This one isn't worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Shirley Temple, not Seabiscuit, fans.","review":"This movie trades on the name Seabiscuit, but isn't really about the famous horse.

Keep in mind that Almay pads was Allure Magazine's Best of Beauty Award Winner.Neutrogena's remover easily removes waterproof mascara without irritating my eyes, which Almay's didn't quite do. The reason why I didn't give it 5 stars is that your eye area is still left with makeup residue after using the remover.

I was a little nervous about the sturdiness of the product after unpacking it. Once I assembled it (easy) I was pleasantly surprised. It is sturdy and I wasn't worried about it tipping over. It comes with everything you need except the propane tank. The picture doesn't show the regulator and hose but it's included. The burner is strong and heats the oil to temp in about 10 min. The large pot looks too samll to fit a large turkey but we fit a 16lb turkey with room for more. (the booklet lists 18lbs as the limit) It only took 55min to cook and used somewhere around 3 gallons of peanut oil.

This is it! the sound I've been waiting for. 'Gold Fronts,' the second track is sublime, the drum-roll builds into the up-beat rhythm, the music starts and sends a shiver through the ether; a buttholeSurferistic collage of orchestral manouvers entwined with a gruesome hoppin' beat. I can't hear it enough times. Track five, 'Treason,' which features a screechy guitar with a neurotic voice telling us \\"turn-turn, turn up the volume, it's gonna be, a bad day\\" is another favourite.

There is a lot of nostalgia here for those of us who grew up in the '70s. I enjoy almost all of the songs, but the ones that were added after i grew up have less appeal to me. The Multiplication Rock songs sound the best, since they were taken from the master tapes. Most of the other songs were recorded directly from the cartoons, so they aren't in stereo and they include the sound effects from the cartoons. This generally isn't too bad, but I find the abundance of sound effects on \\"No More Kings\\" to be somewhat annoying. One other minor complaint: the \\"Scooter Computer and Mr. Chips\\" songs are too dated. Computer technology advanced so fast that they were almost immediately obsolete. But fans of Schoolhouse Rock should still get this collection.

I think not. Again, I'm sure the author is more successful than I would ever be. The book has been around for awhile.

Unfortunately, from the first downbeat to the end of Act 2 nearly 100 minutes later there is absolutely nothing but plodding, lifeless noise. Reri Grist's voice is especially cloying. Let's just say Klemperer's stick is flaccid and the ensemble never gains momentum.

What an insult to our intelligence. I won't reveal here, but it felt like a complete \\"screw you\\" to the viewers. The show was obviously in syndication when I saw this, but I did vow to never watch another repeated episode of Roseanne again, and I've maintained.

It took a lot of will power just to sit down to watch it, so over the top, so unreal, not at all the family situations that made us love the Conners. Lost all sense of story, reason, or purpose. It's not just indulgent on the casts part, but it doesn't care if it entertains the audience at all. The writers must have all quit at the end of season 8. This is not the Roseanne that should have been. The ending, explained away that it was just a book Roseanne was writing and that Dan had really died the year before and that all this fantasy was just that wasn't good enough to bring back the hours of wasted shows that came before. If you want to remember this show as great, avoid the ending series and stop at 8."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"So disappointed in the final season of Roseanne. The normalcy and everyday life element was lost to explore fantasy in the head of Roseanne Barr. The only highlight was the explanation given in the final episode that was sad a realistic in its attempt to show how Roseanne Conner was dealing with her grief through her imaginative writing.

I usually fold it in half and put it behind the passenger seat when it is not in use.

Without the heat shield it takes a lot of time for the air conditioner bring the temperature down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Ordered to fit my 2011 Chevy Avalanche and fits perfectly.

The only thing is that the Velcro strap that secures it when rolled up is a little too short. So you have to be diligent about rolling it up nice and tight or the strap won't reach. Not too big a deal, but a strap that's 2 or 3 inches too short is enough to take one star away in my opinion.Overall though, I'm happy with the sunshade as it does what it's supposed to: It keeps UV rays out which protects the dash, keeps the interior cooler and it stows fairly easily when not in use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dial is hard to read","review":"This is an attractive looking watch, but the dial is so narrow and the markings so small that it is very difficult to read, even with glasses on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and easy without being boring","review":"I really enjoy this album - kind of upbeat, a little bit sexy, but still quite mellow."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Masterwork","review":"This is a tremendous piece of work. Musically and lyrically this work stands with Janis' finest work of the 70's. On this CD she touches the listener deeply and also hints to what must be a great sense of humour. For anyone who loves intelligent songwriting and supreme musicianship this CD is must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lose The Gimmicks!","review":"Janis-sure liked you a lot better when you were more stripped down musically! Far too much studio wizardry on this one, especially on tracks like the title song. Get AFTERTONES or BREAKING SILENCE if you want the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"A consumate recording","review":"Janis Ian has a way of taking any genre and making it her own. Listen to her deep, emotionally charged songs and you will hear that same soul-full honesty coming through any of her other songs. From disco to jazz to country, Janis Ian doesn't adopt and \\"affected\\" style of singing, but adds her uniqueness to the genre and embraces it as her own. Her latest effort shows how completely she is able to offer herself as an artist. Each track is it's own treasure and together they are a wonderful gift to those who have long-appreciated Janis' work, as well as those who are just discovering it. Some songs will sound like old favorites, some will surprise. They are all delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw the show, bought the CD!","review":"I saw Janis live last night in Nashville - drove over from Kentucky at the urging of friends. What a talent! And I bought the CD after the show, have been playing it over and over since then. I'm a brand new fan, and this woman is a monster.

It's simple and edits very well. Buy this, it's perfect!! After bad experiences with other capture cards, I thought I would never be able to get a good capture card. So, I gave up. Since people knew I wanted a good capture card badly, they gave me this as a gift. I thought I was going to be disappointed again, so I didn't have high hopes. However, once I started capturing, I couldn't believe it was perfect. It even has a magnificant built-in encoder. It's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked right out of the box!","review":"I got this because of its good reviews and because the other ones get such poor reviews. After reading the package cover I was worried because it mentioned XP as the required OS. My machine has Windows 2000. I tried the installation anyway and hoped for the best. The installation was very simple and the USB connection was trivial. They even supplied the cable :-). 30 minues later I was capturing video on my machine. For ~80 $ this is a great solution particularly because it is so simple.I highly recommend this to anyone planning video capture on their home PC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked once......then quit","review":"I guess I'm the only one that has had a bad experience with this product.

The White version DOES NOT come with the extra software - the 2 extra disks, one a QuickStart Studio or something, and the other a bonus disk. It just comes with the drivers for the device, and will only make DVD VOB files, no AVI or anything else which I wanted, can't even edit in MovieMaker. I'm returning this today. As for quality, I have my DVR hooked into it, and when \\"monitoring\\" it seems like VHS quality, but the resulting VOB files seems a bit better when played via VLC Player. I have a Toshiba laptop that just makes the minimum requirements, but the output from the laptop is S-Video'ed into my 32 inch TV, so I can see the difference between when the DVR goes to the TV directly vs. via Dazzle/PC to TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy to use","review":"I bought this so I could transfer all my home videos and taped shows onto DVD. I thought it was very easy to install the software onto my laptop(which runs Vista). I did have to go online for one of the drivers for the editing program, but I have not used this yet since I haven't tried to put any new home videos onto DVD. I find that it's very easy, I just hit play on the VCR and start recording on the program and the movie records to DVD while I can still do other things on the computer and watch something else on TV, as long as I hit the TV/VCR button. I have had it stop recording 2 times, not sure if it was my computer or the program, but other wise no problems. Very easy to use over all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpredictably Deffective","review":"The 1-Click DVD feature makes DVDs that appear to work, but have unpredictable defects.

The product will cause your computer to crash, showing the blue screen of death. Another big problem is that it freezes up too easily, meaning that you will need to restart your computer, then restart whatever it was that you were watching. This gets to be rather expensive if you choose the direct to dvd option since you will also be wasting a blank dvd.User beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe plug and work for you, but not me...","review":"Somewhat finicky in setting up the Dazzle. Just getting software upgrades installed was not straight forward. Getting USB port recognition correct before seeing video was a challenge.After 8-10 hours of work, still have yet to produce a DVD.So, maybe with a higher performance system (>1.99 GHz AMD CPU, with > 2 GB memory, ? video board) you may have better luck than I.2 stars, since it does work and is not a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not recomend this item!","review":"I recently purchased this item.

In fact, I did have some trouble installing the software -- one of the three CD-ROM's kept hanging up during the installation, until I selected the option to install only certain programs and avoided all the sample images and video. But after that, I was able to plug in my old VHS machine and create AVI movies from 25-year-old tapes. (Eventually I'll make DVD's.) I have yet to look at any of the instructions, and I was nonetheless able to add titles and simple transitions between scenes; the movie editor seems quite similar to iMovie on the Mac.

After months of trying, and help from my Elec & Comp Engineer friend, I gave up. He even tried to use it on his XP computer, no good. I cannot get the Studio to work at all, and Instant DVD Recorder only works for certain types of small files.

With Pinnacle's support I did numerous installs, manual software deletes, registration deletes, Windows Installer Cleanups, and uninstalls. It took me days to get the Dazzle to work. One final problem was the need to turn the sound off on the source camcorder.The Pinnacle Studio Plus v10 software is also a disappointment. I have yet to be able to burn a DVD! I was forced to buy a $5 update just to read a common MPEG2 file. Silly! And I have entered about 6 long registration codes. Too much!

It's the software that's questionable.Instant DVD Recorder works, although it's limited in what it allows you to do as far as themes and menus go. I can get it to crash reliably when using a certain supplied background music piece. This results in wasted time and a wasted DVD. The version of Studio supplied is a joke. From poor documentation(or maybe the program just doesn't do what it's supposed to do) to a poor user interface to amateurish themes, it's not worth the trouble.

You can install and record directly to DVD, but you can't edit without the incompatible software.The software update is available for download (1.4 GB), but mine was corrupted twice using their file manager. I downloaded directly, and that file was fine. . . except their own Vista FAQ points to the wrong file, so I had to download a fourth 1.4 GB file.I also had to uninstall, use a registry deletion tool, and then discover that the serial number failed.So, be very careful!

This album is a perfect example of the timelessness of Stan Freberg's comedy--not over-the-top, and certainly not beneath one's intelligence. With only a few references that might be lost on those whose knowledge of history and pop culture is limited to what they have seen on Oprah, this collection clearly demonstrates why it deserves to be an American classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful author, bad book","review":"Dr. John Lukacs is one of the premier intellectuals alive today. However--and it pains me to say this--you'd never know it by this book. It is unfocused and choc-a-bloc with longueurs--the worst, however, are the gigantic footnotes that extend to subsequent pages...truly a cardinal sin. Don't read this book, and if you have, don't judge Lukacs by it alone. Go to c-span.org, click on bookTV, click on In-Depth archive, click on the year 2000, and then click on Lukacs's name. Judge him by that, not this minor misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compact, absorbant, dries fast!","review":"I took this towel on a sailing trip and it was great--much better than a large cotton terrycloth towel.Despite it's smallish size, it absorbs effectively (more than enough to dry you completely), then dries itself quickly so you can use it again.The built in loop with a strong snap are a great bonus that let you attach it to rigging to dry without fear that the wind would blow it away (as it did with other people's towels).It's small size made it fit effortlessly even in a small carry on bag.I brought two towels, this one for drying off after ocean swimming, and an even smaller Aquis one for drying off after fresh water showers. Even the smaller one is enough to dry you thoroughly (and then dry itself quickly).These are GREAT TOWELS FOR TRAVEL and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THEM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swimmers best friend. Dries your skin in one pass.","review":"This towel will dry your skin off on the first pass. Some other pack towels I've seen and normal towels take one or two passes to dry your skin. Aquis sucks the water right off you in one pass. Even after its very wet.I swim 4-5 times a week and this saves me so much time. Its big enough to wrap around me for deck changes.no trouble in the wash or dryer.It is very light when dry.Sand does not \\"stick\\" to it. I used this at the beach and went to dust it off and the sand had already fallen off. one or two wackes and all the sand was off it.

I prefer to use this towel to wrap my hair rather than one of my thick heavy cotton towels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Towel","review":"The only problem I encountered with this item is that I had specifically requested it in seafoam green but instead received what appeared to be blueberry. But even though I was disappointed with the color, I will say this towel really gets the job done. After swimming, it leaves me completely dry and doesn't take long to dry itself after I hang it, unlike ordinary bath towels. The next day, it's ready to bring to the pool again."},{"rating":"2","title":"When Is Less More?","review":"I have seen my wife and sister use Aquis Microfiber towels for years. Their specific use tends to be as a head wrap following a hair wash - presumably reducing the time it takes to dry their hair when they are ready. These incredibly thirsty towels are good for so much more than that. Not to get too personal, but I have all but ceased to use the nice fluffy, expensive spa like towels in favor of my trusty 19 X 39\\" miracle! I'll probably never understand how or why the Aquis towels work - but WORK they do. If you need super efficient effectiveness in a small package - look no further!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aquis Adventure Microfiber Towel, Graphite, Large by Aquis","review":"We have used high performance synthetic camping towels for 8 years. The Aquis are much better than previous generations of the blue or yellow camp towels. While they are compact and dry quickly, the feel is like terrycloth - soft and luxurious. You know what I mean if you've ever used the older versions. These towels dry your body well, dry faster than terrycloth as well as the old camp towels they replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up to it's description","review":"This towel was very absorbent. It was great for wriging out clothes in because it would absorb a ton of the water out of them. Unfortunately, wringing it out is much more difficult and since it holds so much water, it doesn't actually dry very fast. If you really soak some water into these, they take quite a while to dry hanging by their loop - it certainly won't dry completely overnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Towel","review":"This is my first travel / microfiber / adventure / whatever towel..While it is NOT a regular towel, it does get the job done.I got the medium sized one. It is a little smaller than a normal bath towel, but it is easily sufficient to dry yourself with.I would rather use a real towel, but this one serves it's purpose. It's compact and it gets me dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Show, Excellen Quality Video","review":"I always liked this show and had not seen it in over 20 years.

Anecdotes about Mickey from friends, teammates, and notable fans whose lives he touched. It's a fun, fast read as each story gives you a new perspective on one of the most colorful Yankees of all time. Unlike the standard-issue biographies out there, this book reads like a series of quick conversations and it is fascinating and entertaining to hear from such diverse names as Yogi Berra, David Halberstam, Regis Philbin, and Willie Mays. I learned a lot that I didn't know about Mickey, and I highly recommend this for you other Yankee fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's so good it's VENDISSINO!","review":"This soundtrack is explosive with hits and the songs take into the world of Tony Soprano.

Like some earlier reviews, I find that some more memorable songs could have been added, like \\"White Rabbit\\" by Jefferson Airplane, but don't let that discourage you from getting this CD, its beautiful, capisce?

There is a song on here for everyone. The first two songs cover the funk, Frank Sinatra is on the album, Bruce Springsteen (hey the show's about New Jersey) and Bob Dylan are here for the rock people, there is British rock (Cream and Elvis Costello), and there is even hip hop (Wyclef Jean). This album will not disapoint anyone. The music is just as good to listen to as the show is to watch. It was fun (for me anyway) to try to remember what episode each song is from. Buy this album, if you don't you'll have to answer to Tony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Mob Hits For Your Enjoyment","review":"\\"The Sopranos\\" soundtrack is an eclectic, entertaining mix of songs from past and present. You don't have to be a fan of the HBO series to enjoy this CD - especially when you have memorable tracks from Bob Dylan, Frank Sinatra, Bruce Springsteen, Cream and Bo Diddley. A3's killer remix of \\"Woke Up This Morning\\" and R.L. Burnside's bluesy \\"It's Bad You Know\\" are particular standouts. Overall, this is one musical compilation that really delivers."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unexpectedly good soundtrack","review":"I almost never buy soundtracks unless they have a rare song by an artist I like. I bought this one mainly so I could have a copy of \\"Woke Up this Morning\\" and I have been pleasantly surprised by most the rest of the work on it. I can't give it five stars b/c it isn't perfect but my four star rating is uninhibitted.Chief among this disc's virtues is the variety - there's something on here for almost any taste. That means, of course, that there are probably a couple of songs you won't like but it also means that you'll get some exposure to some good stuff you hadn't tried before. This was certainly the case for me. Not a bad deal.There's a lot of music out there to spend your money on - you won't regret spending it on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soprano soundtrack","review":"This CD has the best music to use your treadmill to.

Does anyone else think there is a similarity?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love The Sopranos, though am less than impressed with this","review":"Don't get me wrong, I love The Sopranos, and am a huge fan of the show. And quite often while watching the show, I've been wanting to see a full score with all the rad songs I've been hearing throughout the episodes.And so I figured I'd just pick up a copy of the soundtrack, and it would be loaded with all the great music. The results were far from impressive. It's got \\"Woke up this morning, and I.. found myself a gun\\" with all the cool sounds and effects they roll on that track. Though aside from that song, and maybe one or two others (and thats being VERY generous, folks), this CD is no good. A lot of old school songs that, well, are just bad.So, if you're a fan of the show, you are going to purchase this CD regardless, which is fine. I'm glad I bought it myself, it's a great show so obviously the soundtrack would be a collectible item, just don't hold your breath on how good its going to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only One Can Received, Not Case of 6.

The list price is $130.80, and it states \\"6 Aerosol Can\\" in the listing title, leading you to believe you're getting a case of 6. You're not. For those of you who would argue this is a problem with the seller, MIDWEST MARINE & SPORTING GOODS, not the product, it's more of a problem with the listing. The listing title needs to be changed.

This is definately a CD worth looking into. But if you've listened to the last 2 CDs it may not be what you're expecting either. \\"Wasting Time\\" sounded more like earlier Green Day stuff and had a playful edge to it that I liked. I didn't care for \\"Destination Unknown\\" too much. It had a couple of good songs on it, but had so much sugary pop-punk on it that it was hard to tolerate listening to it for any length of time.On this CD, the band seems to have done some soul searching and reflecting on their lives over the past few years, and the songs on this CD reflect that. They're well written, catchy tunes with genuine emotion, but many times time slow and thoughful (which is a fairly big change from the care-free tone of their past endevors.) \\"Jaded\\", \\"Chance of A Lifetime\\", and \\"Rooftops\\" are songs that standout.

They have not only made an awesome album, but they have gone above and beyond what i had ever expected. This album is not only more mature in the instrumental point of view, but lyricly it has grown.

I bought this album after seeing Jaded on MTV, unfortuneatly its one of the few songs that actually works for them. They do have a good sound happening, they just dont know how to make a good song. The biggest problem is the lyrics, they are some of the worst i have ever heard, he rattles off every line from every other bands lyric book in no apparent order. You must be kidding if you think these lyrics actually mean something, the singer is just trying to sound like he knows what hes talking about.dont buy this cd, instead buy perhaps i suppose by rufio who know a little about songcraft and whos lyrics are a lot more coherrant, meaningful and original."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"i was a big fan of destination unknown,i really liked mest and couldnt wait to buy their new album.

I always thought of Mest as punk maybe punk pop, but now, i dont know what they are, same as britney spears to me.

Can You say dissapoinment? Man I have been a fan of mest for almost 4 years now, and I honestly can say that this is their wost cd ever! It is nothing like \\"wasting time\\" or \\"destination unknown\\". There are very few tracks on the cd that actually sound like our great punk rock band, Mest. Some of the songs sound like its a completely different band. So hear is my adice: If you are into the old school mest, and you like their other cd's don't waste your money.

I guess this one is for you and your other non punk friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once again they prove themselves","review":"Enhanced is by far Mest's best cd. They have evolved into a band that is a little more punk and less pop. Even though that pop is heard in this cd its not quite as poppy as their other cds.With songs like Until I met You, Jaded, Night Alone, Your Promise, and 2000 miles, this cd is sure to please all Mest fans that liked their previous cds. The lyrics in this cd are just short of amazing. The lyrics fit every song perfectly and all songs have meaning and tell what they are trying to say.In this cd all of the recordings sound great because in their other cds they had like 2 or 3 songs that had bad recordings. The singing is great and after listening to the whole cd they are in tune and sound great.

I would attribute this to the fact they seem to be very willing to turn themselves into a band like Good Charlotte who is at best OK.This CD is fine from a musical standpoint however the lyrics while deeper, are missing the catchy and Sticks in your head qaulity of the 2 previous Mest albums.Mest was already a band made to be loved by GC fans, but they did had a creative edge that GC has never even had. No that creativity is gone and they have become as lame as GC. This CD does have about 3 solid tracks, however the rest arent anywhere near what I have come to expect from Mest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"As a fan of Mest for several years, I have to say that im dissapointed. Their once hard rock, has been replaced by girly pop songs that should never have been released.

All the chord changes were used on their other records..none of the songs stand out...there are NO guitar riffs...the lyrics are absolute garbage...listen to one song and you'll soon find yourself guessing correctly what his next ryhmning word will be. I bought this cd when it was [cheaper] because I knew that Mest was gonna turn out junk. The first two cd's were ok..by pop-punk standards. But this cd just doesn't offer anything interesting..don't be fooled by all those young girls raving about Mest just because they have a song with the singer from Good Charlotte. (by the way that song is probably the worst on the record). If you really want this cd get it cheap, otherwise you'll be sorry when you can't stand this cd in one week."},{"rating":"1","title":"All past times were better?","review":"Hope not, but unfortunately this is what happen to Mest last album, it lacks of spontaneity, all the songs seems to go to the same place, and the lyrics hadn't change since wasting time album, which I'd say is their best.When I heard Wasting Time, i thought this band has much to offer in the future, I really love this album, the second one has their moments but again, they began to become repetitive, but with this I don't know what they're thinking but sounds like the same boring albums that any kid put out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fut the Wuck","review":"Why does everyone hate good charlotte so much? Is it because they make money? Wow, what a bunch of losers, and screw them for being friends with a less popular band Mest.

Well I only heard the single and rooftops, pitiful. I am embarressed to ever say I listened to this band. Mo' Money was their only good CD, with GOOD ska. Wasting Time had one or two decent songs and everything else [is unacceptable]. Sorry kiddos. Listen to the new suicide machines, much better than this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"I just tried listening to this cd again after discovering it hidden in my collection of cd's I won't listen to because they suck. I was previously a pretty big Mest fan just because I enjoyed their style and though they had potential. This cd was pure garbage and I'm glad I only spent 5 bucks on it.I don't know if they were trying to become more emo because that's the new trend or if they are just finally showing how bad they really are. Why can't more pop-punk bands be like greenday or rancid and actually expand and evolve instead of trying to jump on bandwagons.I can't say there is one good song on the cd and perhaps the only people who will like it are high school kids who are either into emo or GC. Well I have to say I will no longer buy another cd of theirs or see them in concert again because they have just displayed they are just another crappy band along the vein of GC or A simple plan. My ears are still ringing from this trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mest-definetly worth buying","review":"Its great, if you thought their last albums were good then you should def go buy this one! or even if you havent bought their last ones...go buy this one its definetly worth the money- its excellento!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Than Expected","review":"This album is awesome. Not only is the cover art creative and new but so is the sound. I can really relate to songs like \\"Until I Met You\\" that describes the frustration of dealing with someone who's always making everything hard that it has to be, or songs like \\"Jaded\\" that talk about leaving people behind and missing people who've left you behind. I think it's over all just an amazing album and all you kids out there should pick it up and experience Mest. You also go see them this summer on the Vans Warped Tour. The lyrics are creative and honest and the guys are just about having fun. If you don't support Mest you'll regret it later. So stop reading this and go buy the album already. It's sold for good prices at Tower Records. MESTCRAPP.COM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mest- More than jaded.","review":"The self titled 3rd album from mest is probably there best. With songs like \\"Rooftops\\" and \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\" there songs have definitly matured.

With every new album released, Mest improve in every aspect. I recommend \\"I'm Jaded\\" (\\"I Never Regret These Years\\"), \\"Rooftops\\" \\"Until I Met You\\", \\"Walking on Broken Glass\\". A great cd for people who consider \\"POP-PUNK\\" the BEST PUNK OF ALL. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"Ok, this cd is very amazing in itself, but i am a bit dissapointed. Most the songs on this cd do not pump you up like on Wasting Time or Destination Unknown. This cd took a couple listens to get into a few of the songs. A couple songs on the cd (Rooftops, Until I Met You) sound great live though and are up to far with thier earlier work. Being a huge fan of Mest, I see that they wanted to try something diffrent, but it would really be better if they stuck to thier old style."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"this is probably one of the best cd's i have ever owned in my whole life. i am so glad that i own it. the songs are so heartfelt and true to life. i can relate and they have helped me through some rough times...helped me let go of demons and say \\"f*** it\\" i am so impressed with this cd. it is by far the best cd yet. the lyrics and songwriting is absoulutely amazing and very inspiring. this is what music is all about!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bubble-gum punk","review":"Lately I have been very dissapointed with the stuff that's coming out of the so called 'punk' world. Cant anyone make something original! this MEST CD is as low down and unoriginal as you can get, I would advise anyone who is looking here not to buy this cd. I gave this CD two stars because at least they copy blink 182/New found glory well. I don't even like new found glory. If you are one of those people that loves good charlotte and blink 182 (for their songs like rock show and small things) then buy this, but If you are someone really looking for a really good band that is new and original look elsewhere. This would have been cool music for me to listen to when I was 11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"After listening to all three of MeST's other CD's (Mo Money Mo 40'z, Wasting Time, Destination Unknown), I would have to say that S/T is their best work yet. I'm not normally into what they call \\"pop-punk\\" but there's a certain vibe about MeST and just the way they put their songs together that makes me keep buying their CD's and going to their shows. They've got a lot of energy and the vocals of both Tony Lovato and Jeremiah Rangel are amazing to me. They are just a really fun band to see and listen to and if you were to buy one of their records right now, S/T should be it. Their songwriting ability has become more mature and diverse, both lyrically and musically and they're just great right now. Buy this record right now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best punk rock band i've ever heard.","review":"This is one of the best punk rock CD's i've ever heard. I'm suprised they havn't hit #1 on the charts already. They are starting out like Linkin Park was. Every song on the CD is great. It isnt like a Chevelle or Revis CD that is a 1 hit wonder. They are going to be the best punk rock band for a very long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Mediocre...","review":"I've been a Mest fan ever since 'Mo money, Mo 40z' and i must say, This is as generic as sellout pop-punk gets. They are capable of doing much better than this. This lacks the energy of their past releases, and the songs are WAY TOO SLOW and overproduced, and, there are NO guitar riffs. It's almost like they gave up their guitars for a sythesizer. There are a few good songs though, the first two are pretty good, and there is another one that is OK, but after that, every song sounds exactely the same. They are on their way to becoming another Good Charlotte TRL sellout."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Mest!","review":"After listening to this cd you can really see what an amazing band Mest is. This self titled album, I believe is their best cd yet. I fell in love with this cd the moment i listened to the first song (until i met you) The song variation is very good and it includes funny songs and as well as songs that deal with very serious issues. The lyrics are amazing and I am sure that many people will enjoy this cd. Everyone should buy this cd and experience how amazing Mest really is, because they rock!!! so go buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"why change now?","review":"i really think this was totally worth buying. i never really pay attention to the tv or radio since they're almost never on, so i don't know anything about the hype that was done on this album. i got it for the sole reason that i heart Mest and want to support the band and all, i can't pass up a new album. but i really was sort of disappointed. i liked their older sound so much better than what they've started now. but songs like Rooftops and Electric Baby are pretty good considering the change. Jaded was a good song too, for somethin slow and pretty. but i do miss their original sound, things like Hotel Room, Drawing Board, Another Day, and Chelsea...but still, this album was good as a whole and is totally worth havin."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS","review":"Ive been a mest fan for 4 years, AND THIS CD SUCKS.

In a day and age where you can call this and bands like new found glory and arvil levigne punk, we've got some serious problems. don't get me wrong, for many of you this is good, even great music. but unfortunetly the music scene turns more and more \\"good charlotte\\" and less \\"rancid\\" everyday. bland, poppy, and unexciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mest is back and better than ever","review":"I have been waiting for this album to come out since I found out they were recording it. I would have to say so far it is the best album they have. I love their other albums but this one rocks. It has shown that since Destination Unknown they have grown up a lot.

I would say Mest is one of the best up and coming bands out there and everyone should pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"mest is the greatest","review":"ive been waiting for this album a long time these guys are great..i think the best song is rooftops..\\"sitting on the rooftop listening to punk rock\\" now thats an awesome song ..all the songs are great though make you wanna move even sitting in the car driving..(like me)..MEST ROCKS if you open your mind to them youll agree dont knock it til you try it"},{"rating":"2","title":"MEST is the Best","review":"This would have to be Mest's best album to date. you can listin to it from start to finish w/o skipping a song. so if you do not alredy have it or any of their other CDs buy them all NOW! Not only are the guys talented but they are sexy too, they are my favorite! I bet you they will become your favorite too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chills","review":"I got on Mest's website and saw they had a new CD coming out and I got giddy. While I waited patiently for the new CD I downloaded the Jaded video and watched/listened to that over and over and thought to myself how awesome the CD was going to be. Well...I wasn't let down one bit. These guys really know how to rock...AND...their lyrics give me the chills (especially Chance Of A Lifetime, Walking On Broken Glass, & 2000 Miles). It's one of those CDs that you can pop in and listen to straight through and enjoy EVERY song.

I would highly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Collection!","review":"We bought this CD for our two year old daughter, but I think that we love it even more than she does. Riders in the Sky is a wonderful group, and this album features some of their classic kid-friendly songs reworked into a Toy Story 2 theme (for example, \\"How Does She Yodel?\\"). This collection is a great introduction to cowboy music for both kids and adults, and it has already caused me to fill my Amazon.com wishlist with other Riders in the Sky titles (and Sons of the Pioneers, too)!

I don't know what lengths people will go to in order to get this job but that sounds like bribery and just plain not ethical. The book can be read in a day and the suggestions again are rudimentary at best.

No, cancel that. I still feel ripped off. These videos are so dated, they aren't worth the money. The narrator actually says, \\"Pterosaurs...must have been an impressive sight flying over the head of early man.\\" The special effects (read: title lettering) is only slightly more complex than you can get with a videocamera.

Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rational approach to China","review":"This book is a welcome addition to the literature concerning China's role in the new global order. It serves as a good counterpoint to literature such as Bernstein and Munroe's the Coming Conflict with China, in that it takes a much more rational, historically grounded analysis of China's impact on global politics.The early chapters survey modern Chinese history, and later chapters detail Chinese relationships with various key states. The final chapters discuss emerging global regimes and explore some of the reasons that China has been unable to clarify its own role in international relations.The strength of the book lies in its integrated, broad-based approach. It should provide a realistic, even-handed introduction to the issues involved with China's role in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"supersuckers great live","review":"supersuckers are one of the best live bands ever. live in anaheim shows them at their best"},{"rating":"1","title":"Comlpete let down !!!","review":"I ordered the book for the purpose of obtaining infomation concerning the build-up and operation of supercharged engines.

After reading this, I still hear Dipa Ma's voice in my head telling me to squeeze in another late night practice...to make sure I practice as much as I can, every day.

I found this one to be particularly inspirational and instructive about how suffering can be transformed into love and how love can be shared and a source of healing and joy.What a blessing it would have been to meet Dipa Ma in person.

If you read the liner notes (as another reviewer evidently failed to do) you will see that the artist/roommate from the movie was actually signed by Clive Davis and was contractually not allowed to appear on the soundtrack (which was evidently an after-thought since the movie was the primary focus of C. Jay Cox.)So, it's a little disappointing that some of the songs are not by the same artist as the movie, but it's still good overall, and if you're a crazy Latter Days fan, you won't mind.Just the liner notes, pictures, and the \\"Abide With Me\\" track was worth the price.Recommended overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"great movie, great soundtrack!","review":"after mr. wiersma talked me into buying this cd, with his glowing review, i was definitely pleased after my first listening! as i write this, i am listening again, and again, and again. each song takes me back to that particular section of the movie, where i was moved by the discourse. good stuff! i can't really imagine anyone not liking this soundtrack, and, let's face it, a great deal of soundtracks are just fluff. i believe you will find yourself, like me, returning to it again, and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNEXPECTED","review":"I really wasn't sure about this movie when I received it and read the description and once I started watching the opening scene I thought it was going to be one of those \\"typical\\" gay movies about how many guys one guy can meet. I was very surprised about how this movie touched me, it really hits home on many issues that any man would have coming out to an overbearing family.

The fact this book was written by a cartographer could shed some light on the issue. Reading the book I became very disappointed by it. The writer knows his maps, that is for sure. He describes the map and the errors found in it in great deal and you can learn a lot of that. But the writer also seems biased on the Antarctic subject.

David Mann challenges you to change your \\"management system\\" in order to change your culture.

Plodding psychedelia, wierd instrumental music, quaint/eccentric pop tunes, hard rock anthems and bad acid jamming clutter up this box set. The few real prog songs that turn up [Dancing With The Moonlit Knight, Perpetual Change, Karn Evil...] you probably already have in your collection, so why bother? Pink Floyd and King Crimson did not participate in the set, but why no Kansas, Starcastle, RUSH [? ], early Utopia, solo Steve Hackett or Rick Wakeman? A half baked effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst box set I have ever heard","review":"If I could give this zero stars I would. First of all, I'm a big fan of Yes, ELP, Genesis, Gentle Giant and Roxy Music. I'm not one of these people who hates this genre. This box set is incredibly depressing; it makes me question even the music I love. For example, it's great to hear Genesis' The Musical Box, but surrounded by terrible music, it sounds overblown and pretentious. Same with Karn Evil 9 and others. It feels like it was put together by someone who secretly hates progressive rock. Just because something is obscure doesn't make it \\"bloody glorious\\" as the Amazon reviewer put it (he probably doesn't like progressive rock either). If you are a fan of interesting, complex, very musical, exciting music, don't touch this box set with a ten-foot pole - it's a huge waste of fifty bucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reunion-planning book yet","review":"I have been organizing my family reunions for years and I have read all of the books on the subject. This one is the best one yet. Every single chapter has resource center to help you find all of the help you could possibly need. I also appreciated the specific examples for families, classes, the military, associations and corporations. It must have been hard to write a book that would appeal to all types of reunion planners, but these tips helped me to personalize the tips for our family. I bought both the main book and the Reunion Solutions Planner which has hundreds of checklists that helped me keep track of every detail. I highly recommend this book for your next reunion."},{"rating":"1","title":"watch out","review":"Not the same as the photo, what you get is something that looks like it came from the dollar store."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of the Galvan Brides series!","review":"This book is my favorite in the Galvan Brides books.

Without Clive in her live, Alonso comes back to prove Sophie that she was always meant to be his.The scenes were so good, I thought I was watching a movie.

It's plot is incohesive, derivative, climaxing in a senseless denouement. 90% of the film is so dark you can't see what's going on. And what about the radio that plays even when the power goes out? The acting is abyssmal. Val Kilmer with his anachronistic ponytail keeps putting nails in his cinematic coffin; Ving Rhames gives a laughable homage to the villainous Tony Todd and MattBarr should've stayed on Harper's Island.And where did the title come from?Basically one to avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, no need to say more","review":"I just want to give this one star, not wasting anymore time on it. The other reviewers did a good job of telling the usual stuff we've seen a thousand times. I'll add this, if you're looking for a horror movie to see something new, this ain't your movie! I think they gathered up the most worn out horror stuff they could and threw it all together and out came this. I'm only interested in one thing, what the heck happened to Val Kilmer? I don't get it, this is the guy who was beyond incredible in tombstone and others. He looks like a bloated pig! And wtf is with the hair? How is he going to get movie roles when his charector has to have hair down to his as*? That alone limits him, who wears a pony tail now, at least a man? That looked like crap on a guy 40 years ago, it sure does now! Val, get it together. And don't know why rhames wasted his time on this junk. Maybe it paid well? They promised only a day of shooting?

It wasn't scary. It was mostly just boring. Ving Rhames is a joke, every scene with him is oozing cheese(the stinky kind) & one can't help but roll their eyes at him. Val Kilmer is barely in it, despite the cover. The whole thing centers around a house where a family was murdered by a young boy, the reason for which is never really clear(is it the house, is it the boy or someone/thing else?) & now that it's been a hundred years...blah, blah, blah... you get the picture. Anyway, my advice is to wait until it's part of one of those multi-film horror packs, they're cheaper & you don't feel as jipped.

And Val Kilmer just looks horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draggy, Dumb, and Doesn't Deliver","review":"One of those films with no real surprises and a very incomplete feel to it. It seems the makers wanted to create a brand-new, really frightening haunted house film, had some interesting twists and concepts to work on, but didn't quite know where to go with them, so they just did the same old thing that's been done a gazillion times before. The bells, chimes, and rain pattering on the roof might have served to create tension and atmosphere 50 years ago, but not today. Vivid cinematography, believable dialogue, and pretty good acting (most notably Rebecca Da Costa as Courtney), but we don't know the too-plentiful characters well enough to attain much empathy with them. \\"7 Below\\"'s stronger points are wasted on this boorish attempt at Southern Gothicism.Buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE.","review":"I'm sorry I wasted my time watching this movie. I thought it was supposed to be a horror movie, but there was not a single part that was the least bit scary.

All around, a terrible, terrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"c minus flick","review":"Only got this film because Val Kilmer is in it, and he was killed off early...the film is boring,(he even looked bored!) no thriller here.

The five star reviews could only have come from the filmmakers themselves. Zero Mostel has a few hilarious comic bits, but they are all too brief. The dialogue isn't much, but Zero makes up for it with his wild gestures, inspired vocalizations and elastic facial expressions. It's a truly a case of an actor being so brilliant he could actually read from the telephone book and make it artful and hilarious. I wish Zero had performed the Yellow Pages rather than this script."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lives up to the title","review":"This movie is fantastic.

The story was none existant, and the acting was appauling. As if movies like \\"Scary Movie\\", \\"Not Another Teen Movie\\", \\"Date Movie\\" and \\"Epic Movie\\", and all the other nauseating cookie cutter sequels they spawned weren't bad enough, VH1 puts out this 90 minute borefest. Instead of doing the same lame obvious \\"jokes\\" over and over try coming up with an original comedy. This is not even worth 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Been Good - But It Wasn't","review":"This SHOULD have been a good book. The story was decent, the characters had potential... But the writing was ghastly, particularly the dialogue. For some reason, Pella shuns contractions and insists on dropping a name of direct address into every line of dialogue. Clunky, to say the best. One expects more from an author as prolific as Pella.Oh, and would somebody please tell me what the title has to do with anything?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this Book","review":"As a writer, I am greatly disappointed in others' reviews stating that books in a series should stand alone, which I agree with, but also that the end left one unsatisfied, which I heartily disagree with. As a writer, you must leave plots unfinished so you may continue with your series. I do not wish to anger anyone with my opinions, so hopefully everyone will understand.Personally, I loved the characters and felt that the conflict in their lives was good. One needs conflict to keep another interested. The conflict revolved around everything: family, lovers and ex-lovers, politics, everything that is essential to our very beings was in this book, which is completely important. I am sorry to be so passionate if I seem so, but I do enjoy a good read, and Judith Pella is an outstanding storyteller. Five Stars for Written on the Wind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Work by Ms. Pella","review":"I finished this book today and I have to say it is the only book I've ever read by Ms. Pella that I found difficult to read through. She was overly descriptive and she tended to just simply overdo it. Normally I love to read historical fiction but this book is the exception to the rule. The most disappointing part of the book was the ending. Though I know it is part of a series I was very put out that not a single thing was resolved by the end of the book. I guess my overall opinion of the book is that it was on the boring-side. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead the 1 felt it actually deserved is because I did truly enjoy the characters- Cameron, Blair, Jackie, Johnny, Alex, Gary and Sam. I just wish she would've wrote more about them and less about their surroundings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Daughters of Fortune Book 1","review":"I order this book in paper back and the condition was rated as new.

I was ordering this book as one of this series that I was going to give as a gift and this is certainly not in the condition to give as a gift and I don't want it in my own collection. I could not rate this book as there is no place to rate a zero except by not giving any stars of recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt cheated...","review":"This could have been a good book. I felt very cheated after reading nearly 500 pages because absolutely nothing was resolved. I don't begrudge the fact that this is part of a series, but I also believe that books in a series should stand on their own. We were left hanging with all three sisters, not one part of their situations were resolved. If I would have known this, I never would have spent the time reading the book.

With her previous albums (namely \\"Enchantment\\"), she established an insanely loyal fan base, which is incredibly difficult to do, especially considering her youth. It seems she tried to fix something unbroken.In my opinion, a better endeavour would've been a jazz album - something she could really sink her teeth into. She still could've been portrayed as \\"sexy\\", but in a better, much classier way. Her new look would work beautifully coupled with a jazz CD (minus the racoon eyes).\\"Tissues and Issues\\" is frankly a disappointment. Her angelic voice is reduced to filtered crooning, and her lyrics are mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible and a waste of talent and money","review":"was a fan, not any more. What a waste of talent. the packaging is just as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to have class...","review":"Poor Charlotte Church, career tanking, now she feels the need to create a scandal to revive the corpse. Charlotte recently whipped up a storm of controversy by appearing as a drug-taking nun and calling the Pope a \\"Nazi\\" in her new Channel 4 talk show. The singer performed a range of outrageous stunts such as smashing open a statue of the Virgin Mary to reveal a can of cider and eating a communion wafer emblazoned with a ecstasy smiley face and pretending to hallucinate. ...As well as branding the Pope a \\"Nazi\\" - despite performing for Pope John Paul II when she was an angelic 12-year-old... A fall from grace is never pretty.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice of a former \\"Angel\\"","review":"Charlotte Church has produced an average pop CD. Her voice, when singing her previous classical repertoire, was sublime. With her smoking and attempt at a \\"rock\\" sound, she is wasting her talents and ruining her voice. Listen to her earlier CDs and you will understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Angel Voice to Wanna Be Pop Diva","review":"Charlotte Church had very early carved out a niche in making some great classic songs and a few newer tunes ring melodic. Her emerging voice was sweet, innocent, angelic.This \\"swing\\" is Charlotte trying to break into the top 40 and its sad. Her distinctive gift is blurred into a Britney Spears wanna be series of tunes ... all contemporary. I can only pray that Charlotte remember her earlier fans that loved the fact that a young talent could re-present great classical, opera, and hymnic material to old and young alike. I miss you Charlotte, leave the pop to Christina and Britney...and let your voice ring pure once more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlotte WHO??????????","review":"This CD is awful. It is one step below the ghetto talking trash we hear so much from cars vibrating you out of your car seat. She has gone from the base of her strengths. It will be a tough decision to buy anything of hers in the future unless I can hear it completely first. I routinely delete songs related to gods, talking rap, and unintelligble tracks. That is this entire album."},{"rating":"1","title":"SORRY CHARLOTTE - Even God can't change my view on this album . . .","review":"I bought this CD, expecting it to be somewhat easy to listen to. I was wrong! The whole album is a waste of money! Every track is completely over-produced with terrible synthetic pop sounds and heavy background vocals. I am warning you - DON'T BUY THIS! I'm not going to write a long and dragged-out review about this album, with scores and comments. Her voice has taken a nose-dive. It's WAY to breathy and weak. Please - After Charlotte's recent behavior against the Catholic church and her use of language, cigarettes, and alcohol, all you're going to do is put more money in her pocket to keep doing these things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why? Why? Why?","review":"I don't understand? She has a gift that most singers would die for and instead of using that she LOWERS herself to their standards? I know that her soprano voice isn't mainstream music, but...PLEASE!! She needs to be proud of her gift and use it accordingly and not lower herself just to sell records. Obviously it didn't work and if she ever puts out another album as a soprano, she will have lost respect from her real fans because of this disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tissues and Issues","review":"This CD is horrible.

Not all of it, but much of it. If you examine \\"Prelude\\", it almost matches a compilation I made up myself from all of the audio CD's I have.This time around, though, there was nothing on the CD I cared to hear.... I suppose if I was a lot younger....She's still cute, at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste.","review":"I think for Charlotte Church, the music made the singer.

But this record? its like a strickly religous person denouncing their faith and turning into the complete opposite.

At one time Charlotte stood out from the pack as a truly great singer; unique and fresh, but now she just blends into the middle. Just another sound-alike voice; vanilla. No distinct color, no distinct flavor. Mark Twain once mused over how many times we chase after things we were never meant to do instead of embracing and using the talents we were born with. This couldn't be MORE apparent in Charlotte Chruch's case. In her wiser youthful age she had high goals of becoming a great opera star. We her buying and adoring audience waited breath abated and in full support. She seems to have traded those aspirations in for a self-destructive path, both personally and professionally, of going for, and missing the mark, of a pop singer; nothing great; not even ordinary. One of the reasons she's so disappointing is we know what she could have been. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Listened to The Negative Reviews","review":"I Normally Don't weigh in with a Review for a CD that has as many Posts as this One, but I couldn't resist Here.

Hard to believe this is the Same Charlotte Church I saw in Concert in 2001 and Loved...Perhaps She Grew Weary of being the Golden Goose for Her Family, and/or desired to Live the Life of a 21st Century Teenager, including Producing the Music that Teen Girls are attracted to These Days. Whatever the Reason, This CD is Truly Wretched. That is All..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Issues is right......","review":"This album is nothing special, her songs sound like every other pop song on the radio these days. What's really interesting is Ms. Church's complete musical turnaround. It certainly seems that Ms. Church has a lot of issues to go with her tissues. Not only did she have a LOT of vocal issues trying to sing classical music and opera with less than fair technique and moderate talent but she's now selling out what little potential she had in that genre to flaunt her body (see videos of \\"Call My Name\\" and \\"Crazy Chick\\") and try to be the next Britney Spears. It's really pathetic and just sad. And what's worse is that there's no turning back. No one will ever take her seriously if she sings anything classical again. (Not that anyone with any real knowledge of classical/operatic singing and technique took her seriously before.....but this just drove the last nail into her virtual coffin.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a terrible album !","review":"charlotte church has an honest talent. so why is she succombing to the same advertising ploys as britney spears and lindsay lohan? parading around like a sex toy, flaunting your not-so-god-given assets is something wannabe singers do when they don't have the voice; they conmpensate for lack of talent by an over-abundance of blatant sexuality. who is actually buying this act from charlotte church? when she was doing folk, classical and broadway, there were many instances when she couldn't quite reach the level of skill required to deliver a great performance, but there was no pretense in it. now she's decided to go the rock route, but she can't do it herself because all she is is a voice, so she's hired washout rock writers to write the songs, which are terrible. very disappointing album from what was a promising young talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over ambitious and lacking substance...","review":"...The basic problem with this album is that it sets itself up to be a battle scarred, well rounded, emotional journey and it just isn't. Miss Church has a beautiful voice, no one can doubt that, but what she doesn't have is the experience, either musical or personal; to produce a reinvention album from a pop Diva. She is only 19 for goodness sake! This said she demonstrates some of the makings of a good transition from the classical world to the world of pop, but she a lot to learn such as Rich, brattish 19 year old girls don't have the kind of \\"issues\\" the world is clammering to hear about."},{"rating":"2","title":"tissues and issues is great!","review":"this album is very good. I especially like Crazy chick and call my name. the highlights on the album are the songs easy way out and moodswings which are very piano based and relate to charlottes life. i think that she is a great role model for teenage girls and isnt a stick thin popstar that most of them are nowadays and i respect her for that. i bought this album when it first came out and i think that this is pop music at its best, charlotte should be pleased with her motown influenced pop albumBest track1.

I was surprised to hear that she sounded so different, even played it for my keen-eared husband and he couldn't guess who it was. He, my daughter, and I are all fans of Charlotte's and have seen her perform in person. The verdict from all of us is we truly love her new style and voice. There aren't many female pop vocalists that I like, incidentally.I don't understand why there are so many negative comments...I guess people expected soprano pop? Considering all the drivel and crappy music that's on the Billboard charts, it amazes me that this CD is receiving such low scores. Oh well, Bob Dylan was boo'ed when he plugged in his guitar...the folk music \\"purists\\" got their panties in a twist. Possibly Charlotte's experiencing the same reaction. All I can say is that no one owns anyone, and of all people, artists are entitled--and should be encouraged--to expand their horizons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Charlotte??","review":"Charlotte Church has such a beautiful voice, & it's sad to see her sink to this.I'm not against her doing pop, but couldn't she have done good pop instead of this drivel?

I listen to it everyday, but this CD has really put a damper on my enthusiasm to buy her CDs. Her georgous soprano voice is perfect for those classical song's. I have played her version of \\"In Truntina\\" and then played Sarah Brightman's version and found that it doesn't even come close to Charlotte's.

Simple though it may be, each block is sufficiently smaller than than the previous block so my 14 month old can stack them without the frustration of them falling over. As with all stacking cups, etc, they nest into a relatively small size. And for paperboard construction, it's surprisingly durable. She loves to knock the tower over and she's gnawed on a couple of them but the blocks are still in great shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter loves them, but I wish they were more durable","review":"My daughter started using these when she was almost 14 months old. She enjoyed playing with nesting cups, so we were sure she would love this. I wish, however, that these blocks were more durable. After only 2 weeks of play, the bottom edges of the blocks are starting to get worn and the bottom pictures are starting to come off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality...","review":"I know this is not an expensive toy, but the quality is too poor. The designs are wonderful, immediately captivated my child, but the glued on paper has ripples and the edges are not quite matching. They also started to fray/shred along the edges immediately - I mean within the first 10 minutes. I wanted cardboard boxes instead of wood as they are not as heavy, but I didn't know that meant the design is printed on paper and glued on. I had seen other maker's cardboard nesting blocks that are much higher quality (no glued on paper) and I should have paid more to have that type. I wasn't able to discern that from the product description - lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love blocks!","review":"We've had this block set for about 2 months. I bought one set for a cousin who was turning 2 and one set for my daughter who was 19 months. Two months later, she still likes to stack them and then knock them over. The colors and pictures are vibrant and cute. They nest together so they don't take up much room when they are not being used. I would recommend these for young children. They help develop hand-eye coordination. As a parent, you can talk about colors, numbers, letters, and animals while playing with this toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly awesome!","review":"I am about to order my second set of these blocks. I was a bit dubious about the material when I purchased the first set, but they lasted about 5 1/2 years. My children have used them as blocks, a tower to knock down, rooms for toys (ignoring a very nice dollhouse), storage containers, missiles (this is frowned upon), beds for small stuffies, doll furniture, and even more. Yes, they are cardboard, but they are awesome! My dd9 and dd6 still find ways to play with them, and dd3 and dd.5 are as enthralled as big sisters. Some of the best money I've spent on a toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun product","review":"I bought these blocks for my 2 year old daughter and she really enjoys stacking them and then nesting them. The blocks are made of a coated cardboard and are open on the bottom. They aren't the most sturdy and tend to fall when stacked if not placed exactly in the correct place. But the pictures on each block are great and overall I am happy with purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty, but flimsy and made of cardboard","review":"Length:: 0:50 MinsThe first thing you should know about these blocks, which you may already if you're more observant than me, is that they are made of cardboard. I bought these for my 10 month old as she seems to be nearing the 'stacking' phase and I thought they'd be fun. Unfortunately, she's still in the 'puts everything in her mouth' phase, too, and has gone to town sucking on the edges of the smallest block. These do not hold up well for a sucking baby.If your child is a bit older and not privy to sucking on things, these will probably last a bit longer although I'm guessing not forever. They are pretty and fun to look at with lots of alphabet themed colorful designs. They stack nicely, and provide a fun physical challenge for a child.If you want something lightweight, totally non-dangerous, and cheap, these are great stacking blocks and will be loved by careful children. If you want something sturdy for a younger child, these are not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddlers Delight","review":"My toddler daughter loves these blocks I purchased as a Xmas gift. She plays with them everyday for at least 3 hours, which frees me up and I love that! The pictures are rich in color and the letters are easy to read.

My daughter had a good time after one use, but by the secnd use I was picking up pieces of cardboard. My daughter wanted to sit on them, knock them over, and do all things most toddler do with toys. I had to toss one block already. I would highly recommend that someone purchase this sort of toy in plastic. That way it's more durable and easy to clean if needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alphabet blocks","review":"I purchased these stacking and nesting blocks about six months ago for my 19 month old daughter. I read a lot of reviews and considered wooden blocks for fear that these cardboard blocks would not last. I decided on the cardboard because I was concerned that she might be able to hurt herself with wooden blocks due to the extra weight. I am very pleased with my purchase. She plays with the blocks all the time. She loves it when we stack them up for her so she can knock them down. Because they're cardboard, they don't weigh much. They are quite sturdy though, my husband showed her how to use the larger blocks as a seat, so she sits on them all the time. After six months of fairly steady use, they show now signs of wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible quality!!","review":"The first day we had these blocks, my 16 month old was playing with them and one of the blocks top caved in.

We have the Baby Einstein nesting blocks at his grandparents house, and he has had NO problem with them. They're all perfectly intact. I'd suggest buying them instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, beautiful images, poor quality","review":"My 18 month old daughter LOVES these nested blocks. This is our current go-to toy since she loves to stack them, and point out animals (and make some sounds). However, they are made of regular-quality pressboard which is not very sturdy (for a 1 year old, anyway) and the artwork is printed on paper that can easily be pulled off if you work at a corner for long enough.Overall, I would recommend this toy for a 1-2 year old, especially if you can get it at a good deal. We've bought multiples of these for 1st birthday presents since my daughter gets so much enjoyment out of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"kids love it","review":"We got these to replace another brand that had been destroyed by years of use and abuse. I like that they come with the carrying case. They're a sturdy set of cardboard stacking/nesting blocks. The kids love to talk about the pictures on the blocks.I gave it a 4 for durability because when we opened the set a few of the tops were not glued down completely. It was an easy fix, a swipe with a glue stick and it was fixed. So far they stand up to our 1 and 3 year olds play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy, but not for rough little boys","review":"My two and a half year old son loved these blocks and spent time everyday stacking, nesting, and reciting the letters and animals. For that, I would give it 5 stars. Sadly, I have to give it 2 stars because he figured out within 2 weeks how to rip apart the boxes, and I had to throw out every flattened block. These would be great for an older kid or a gentler child ;) If they made them in a durable plastic I would definitely buy them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard","review":"I bought this without looking closely because I have been very pleased with other Melissa & Doug items, but this was a huge disappointment, as the blocks are made of cardboard. My daughter chewed and sucked on them almost from the very start, and there are holes in some of the corners.Now that she is almost 3, she will still sometimes play with them, however for the age group that they are intended, cardboard is a poor material choice. I am buying the wooden set for my nephew for Christmas this year.....much more appropriate and durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really looking forward to these, but was very disappointed for a Melissa & Doug toy. The quality is not great, especially if your child likes to chew things... they disintegrate quickly. Mostly though, I was very disappointed by the colors on the outside of each block. The top of every block (which you spend the most time looking at) is a star in the middle of a series of black squares. Not at all appealing. Each box has letters with drawings, but the drawings aren't very accurate... would you expect a lion to be lying on its back turning on a light bulb..? My daughter, who talks to almost all of her toys, was not interested in this at all (once she chewed through the corner of one box)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long; not durable","review":"These blocks are made out of cardboard.

The ONLY redeeming quality was the box it came in. The kids thought it was fun to carry it around. We also have the wooden animal stacking blocks. They are GREAT! We love them!

They are of similar construction to those I had as a child (and still do.)Addressing some concerns noted by other reviewers:Granted they are cardboard, but seeing as their #1 purpose is to stack and then knock down, do you really want a tower of wooden blocks falling on your child's toes?These are meant for use by children ages 2 and up. If you child is a chewer at that age, then you may have other concerns to address. The majority of age 2 children can play with a toy without gnawing all over it. My daughter started playing with these before age 2, but she also rarely chewed on toys after infancy.If you are worried about how your child will treat these blocks, then only allow them to play with them while you are in the room. These are great toys to play WITH your child. You can monitor how they are treating them while you play with them together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory","review":"I bought this for my two year old daughter for Christmas.

She enjoys the blocks because they stack tall, unlike her smaller plastic building blocks, which do not stand well on the carpeting. She often builds up the blocks, knocks them over, and starts over again.She does not care about the pictures on the blocks, but she recognizes the letters, which are all written uppercase. Some of the blocks are difficult for a toddler to associate the picture with the letter (e.g. a rabbit with a rose for the letter \\"R,\\" but most toddlers would see a bunny with a flower).I have used the blocks for other games, such as \\"Memory\\" by hiding smaller objects (such a sock or paper) under the blocks and asking her to remember which object is under which block.I would recommend this product for children aged two-years and older.

I don't know about you.. but cardboard would not last in our house more than a week, my 2 year old would step, or fall and put a heavier toy on it, and crush it. and the 6month old will eat the edges, and I'm not sure I want her with cardboard mush in her mouth! however the WOOD version they have of these in AWESOME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the typical M&D quality","review":"We received these blocks as a gift about two weeks ago and we've already had to throw some blocks away. First of all, if your child chews on things, this is not the toy for you. My son has easily gnawed off bits of the blocks. Also, if the blocks are stepped on... they're not stong enough to withstand the weight entirely, but they are solid enough to hurt your childs feet. The outer covering also started peeling away on the top of the blocks.

Spend a little more and get the wooden blocks they make with animals. If you want them for the alphabet get the regular blocks.

These are cardboard!","review":"Let me say first and foremost that I really like this set. They are cute, wipe clean, are light weight so that even a baby can handle them, and they nest easily and well. Keep in mind though that these are cardboard. As a person who is trying to get away from plastic because of all of the scares lately with chemicals and such, these are great. They're durable cardboard, but they are cardboard. If your little one manages to play with cardboard board books without destroying them then these would be a wonderful option. If they chew on them until they're a pile of paper pulp goo then these probably aren't a good choice.Overall, these stack well, store compact, and are quite durable.

After a couple years, I ran out of Squigle and bought a tube of this Rembrandt product because I could get it locally. Within a couple weeks, I had five active canker sores in my mouth at once. It was the worst I had ever seen in my life. I finally thought to try removing the toothpaste, even thought it has no SLS. So I started brushing with just water. Within 48 hrs, 2 of the sores were healing. Within another 48hrs, they were all healing. I went back to Squigle and I have not had a problem since (a couple months). If this product doesn't work for you, try Squigle (also available on Amazon). If you read their website, they suggest that there are several classes of materials that may lead to canker sore problems including detergents (like SLS), bleaches (peroxides), etc. For me, this product still appears to have something very troublesome, even thought there is no SLS."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonder product!","review":"I had suffered from almost constant canker sores since adolescence.

The combination of Rembrandt and B-Complex has completely cured my life-long problem. Thanks, Rembrandt!

Prior to taking the L-lysine supplement and using Rembrandt I would have at least one canker sore at all times, and it was not uncommon to have 3 or 4 at once. Since using this toothpaste and taking L-lysine on a regular basis I rarely get canker sores anymore. I might get 6 in year now, which is signifcantly less than before. I would say that my canker sores have been reduced by at least 90%.I will point out that I started taking the L-lysine and using Rembrandt at the same time. So, I honestly don't know if one or the other is truly doing the job. However, I did change toothpaste brands when I was unable to find the Rembrandt's cankor sore toothpaste locally and I immediately started getting cankor sores again.

Plus, you have to deal in the cost factor....fifty bucks or more for just the house and a few figurines.

The furniture (that you have to buy seperately) is very boring and straightforward with very few pieces. The bed turns into a bunkbed, but otherwise it is just a hard piece of plastic.Perhaps you think this dollhouse is a stage older than Little People. To me, it does not appear to be geared to a higher age group.I also have a gripe with the design of the house ... why not a handle on top and a latch on the side to close it up? Why not a place to store the furniture?

I think it should have been available as a package deal that you could get the furniture and extra characters, not just characters.

(That includes Thailand, United Kingdom and China) It seems to me that if a toy this hot was going to be manufactured, than up the price, but include the accessories, I would have easily bought the entire set for $100 or so, it would have saved me the time of finding the other parts. Don't go to eBay, unless you are willing to pay up to $200 for the four pack of furniture alone. But, the house itself is amazing, if you can find the other pieces, I would recommend this to anyone with a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Can I Purchase The Furniture?????","review":"I've looked all over for the furniture that goes with this house.

Therefore, she has only played with it a couple of times in the past year. We do have Loving Family Doll House furniture that would work with it, but it just isn't the same from her point of view.

RizzWaFaire IMO is better than his debut. Why? Because he had way too many producers on his debut, which sounded all over the place and disjointed. However, I gotta give Jam and Lewis props for providing Ralph classics like \\"Sensitivity\\" and \\"Do What I Gotta Do\\". This new cd plays consistently from song to song. Ralph is singing better and has grown vocally which is evident on the slow ballads. He still has that silky smooth voice. My favorite cuts are mainly the slow jams like Homegirl, Never Noticed (Jam/Lewis sound-alike cut), and Too cool. The uptempo cuts I like are Love Hangover and Another Shot. Overall, Ralph did a good job on this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"My wife has been using this book and been very satisfied. I thought the topics for the chapter were very useful, as were the associated grammar patterns and vocab. We're living in Korea and mingle with a lot of Koreans so we're experiencing how Koreans really talk. There's a very helpful link through the University of Indiana Korean language department that correlates with these textbooks. I don't have time to write an extensive review, but this book has been helpful for us as we strive to learn \\"real Korean\\" in Korea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for self learners","review":"This book might work well in a classroom, but it doesn't work at all for someone trying to learn the language on their own. It moves very fast, and the workbook exercises (particularly the listening comprehension exercises) quickly become so difficult as to be impossible for someone who isn't already used to the sound of the language. Some grammatical concepts are used without being explained, and the grammar index includes references to sections in which the relevant grammar is not explained at all, merely used. All of this is very dejecting, and it surely needn't be that way. The problem, of course, is that there are very few other textbooks around -- in particular, there are very few textbooks that avoid romanization, as this one does. But being the best of a bad lot doesn't make it useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Endeavor - don't waste your money","review":"This book is not very well organized and it comes WITHOUT any audio whatsoever.

His assessments of the biblical characters and their motivations are very insightful. McKenna shows that the primary purpose of this trial was not to prove anything to Satan but to lead Job and us along the correct pathway to spiritual maturity. McKenna teaches that instead of patience as the focus of the study, God reveals that Job's pride and self reliance are to be considered and corrected. The dilemmas of the suffering of the innnocent, God's tolerance of sinful behavior and the limits on God's control are skillfully handled by the commentator. Without any reservation, I recommend this commentatary to anyone who insists on know WHY. McKenna emphasizes that the real question is WHO. Thank you, David McKenna."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Quirky Pop","review":"If you are a fan of Pulp, you will love this record. David Gedge, the mastermind behind Cinerama, has a knack for writing very quirky (albeit, catchy) tunes colored with lyrics of love-lorn desperation. Gedge's raw and impassioned vocals are backed by a standard Brit-pop ensemble - chiming guitars, slick percussion, melodic bass, appropriately placed backing vocals, and lots of strings and winds. BUT, the thing that sets Cinerama apart from Brit-pop bands is their totally unique pop sensibility. Where most Brit-pop bands have become homogenized and predictable, Cinerama sounds fresh and original. Most of the songs on this album (which is actually a collection of singles and B-sides from Cinerama's Disco Volante period) are very catchy - almost gnawingly addictive. If you like the sound of this record, check out The Wedding Present, Gedge's 80's/90's band - the same great melodies and lyrics with a darker and rawer production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible sound quality...","review":"I was surfing through amazon.com to look for speakers for my shuffle.

But as an adoptee myself, there was absolutely nothing in this book that I related to. I never felt wounded or rejected because I was adopted, and after reading and talking with women who have placed children for adoption, I can only say that I look on it as a an act made for the benefit of their babies and for the loving parents out there who cannot biologically have children. I would not recommend this book to adult adoptees who feel that they are well-adjusted and come from a position where they realize both the challenges and the joys of adoption.

She sunk into an extreme depression and began cutting on herself. We went to multiple therapies. Unfortunately, the popular premise back then was that if you were adopted, it was the root of all your problems. I began to question the \\"popular\\" premise and found that the idea the adoptee was mortally, emotionally wounded and the only solution was in the one who donated their egg, was without merit or evidence.My daughter continues to wallow in the self pity and darkness this propaganda extolls.

The author writes that every child that has ever been adopted has these feelings of depression, rejection, abandonment, and hatred. My husband is adopted, and several members of my family are also and not one of them believe what is written in this book. This book is offensive to Adopted Parents everywhere. The author states that by parents adopting children they are doing them a great injustice.

I, and I imagine many other adoptees, feel that the wounds inflicted by spending my first 9 months in the body of an unwilling host finally began to heel in the loving arms of my adoptive parents. More time with my overburdened biological parents may have damaged me beyond repair. Her book should be hailed as an honest account of one woman's effort to understand the the emotional turmoil of her adopted daughter, and not as reflection of how all relinquished children and their adoptive parents feel. In short, for many of us the wound was formed early on. The separation from our birth parents was the beginning of the healing process, not the source of our pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Primal Wound","review":"The best book I have ever read describing the effects on the child of being adopted, and what results from it. When I read it, I said, \\"yes, that describes me!\\" It is also a wonderful help for the adoptive parent in trying to understand why their child behaves and reacts in the way that they do. If you are adopted, this book will help you understand yourself better. If you have adopted, you will begin to understand that despite all the love and care you have given your child, they still cannot forget internally that they were initially unwanted. This can help the parent not take it so personally when the child may act out, behave coldly or angrily towards the adoptive parent, no matter how loving they have been towards their child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally something that makes absolute sense","review":"As a person who was separated from her original mother, I finally have some answers to all of these questions.

I wasn't surrounded by loving people who were interested in how I was adapting to my circumstances. The idea of when/how/if you discussed adoption with a child wasn't considered.

With little evidence or sampling the author drones on about how adoption is the origin of a myriad of social problems suffered by individuals with varied life histories. Yet, this author proposes that, when it comes to adoptees, the cause of these behaviors is always adoption. It is so absurd and even more so in light of recent research completed in 2004 which indicates that most adopted adolescents are psychologically healthy.

The Parades and Shows are definitely Disney in their content, but now they have a more \\"contemporary artist\\" sound to them, especially Tracks 1, 2 and 13. If you are eager to get this album for it's current content, I guarantee you will enjoy it. However, just like the many Disneyland Albums in the past, they come out with a new one every year.

My criticism would be that the authors were too loose with their language at times leaving the reader to wonder whether (1) the authors had their facts wrong or (2) didn't recognize the implications of their words or (3) perhaps I was misinformed.

However, like most people, i find that I need to see these things worked out to understand these concepts. The material itself is satisfactory in this book, however there are only about 2 worked out examples per concept in this text, and some of these concepts can be difficult to grasp. Lastly, intermediate problem solving is often not made clear in this text. If you are the type of person that likes to read a lot to understand statics, then this book may be for you, but if you are a person that needs clear demonstration of the concepts and techniques visited in this text, this book is definitely not for you.

Amazon should ban the seller: AWEISER from selling on their site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I also bought this because it was the Consumer Reports \\"Best Buy,\\" and I expected to get a lot of use out of it. The frame broke on my first (I weigh 175 and run about 30 miles per week) after about 1100 miles, and its replacement just died after only 350 miles. So far I've paid about a dollar a mile. I'll never buy from Schwinn again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schwinn - Nautilus ZERO QUALITY CONTROL","review":"The railings on the Schwinn 820p did not line up with the screw holes on the frame by several inches! It was impossible to assemble.With any quality control at all, these measurements are checked on every item that leaves the factory. Human error is then not a factor. This is a defect that should never happen. Schwinn/Nautilus has zero quality control. That is simply a fact of the most basic quality control standards.You are therefore definitely taking your chances with this or any other Schwinn or Nautilus product. With zero quality control, no telling what else can prove to be wrong.And though the warranty says \\"1 year on parts\\", the warranty then goes on to say that there will be a charge for the installation of any defective or replaced parts. So what is the 1 year warranty on labor? Nothing, obviously.I wish I never had purchased this product, myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, has worked well for five years, including incline","review":"The Schwinn 820p has been used by me for walking and by my husband for running (when he couldn't get outside) for five years, and it works well. The belt must be lubricated every few months, but that's simple. We use a mat under the treadmill, and it has a smooth, solid feel as it runs. The handrails are high enough for me, which was a big issue with many other treadmill models, and the bed is long enough that I have never hit the end. There are not a lot of preprogrammed routes and such, just a few, but for the price it's an excellent basic treadmill. I usually stay at or below 4 mph because I walk, but my husband has used it up to 10 mph and the incline goes up to 15% in 1% increments. Has a heart-rate monitor built in to the handholds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and energetic","review":"Unlike a previous reviewer, I like both the soundtrack and the movie - Hollywood hokum and all. The soundtrack contains much of the rich early American music - and 1962-composed soundalike. I find nothing tops this record (yes, I still have it on vinyl) when I want background to a strenuous project. It's that good for the energy level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than the film itself!","review":"This is a case of the soundtrack upstaging the film! The score by Alfred Newman; assisted by Ken Darby, is a rousing, spectacular celebration of the old west. Standards of the period are interwoven with an original score and some new songs to create a phenominal listening experience. The sound quality of these discs is rich and deep, full of width and breadth, and will blow you away if you have a proper sound system. For fans of the film or lovers of great film scores; this one is tops!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for purists","review":"I had the ORIGINAL original soundtrack record album when I was a kid and played it till the vinyl wore out. If you want to hear the music you love and do NOT want it to be broken up with second rate outtakes cut in with the really beautiful symphonic pieces, then do NOT buy this album. Frankly I think it's dishonest to call it the original soundtrack. It is not. As far as the \\"extra\\" music they included, there was a reason why it never got into the movie. It was NOT GOOD ENOUGH."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read it.","review":"The book was not only touching but inspiration. It made you laugh, cry, laugh again and rejoice. it teaches you that God's plan will never fail. No matter how you try to run how you try to hide. When GOD has a plan for you life it will come to pass. I rejoice in the fact that all these years later she is still hear. Fighting the good fight. If you ever want to read a page turner that not only tells you about the power of GOD but also lets you know that you have to go through some struggles to get there this is it. Remember anything worth having is worth fighting for. And to be in the presence of the Lord is the best thing you could fight for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun music for baby and you","review":"This is a wonderful way to expose your child to traditional children songs (and a few new ones), while also expanding their music repertoire.

Admittedly, he has been exposed to lots of musical genres and we have a house full of instruments and we've seen some jazz concerts too. The big reason this works though is that it has been put together to appeal to kids. So when the kids sing along or make comments like \\"I have that book\\" at the beginning of \\"Five Little Monkeys,\\" it is invitation for my kid to comment as well, \\"I have that book too!.\\" So far this is his favorite CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This had me jamming at work!","review":"I just bought this for my 8 month old daughter. I brought it to work to listen to it and just had to write a review because I enjoyed it so much. It had me singing along and I even had to shut my door and dance to \\"Go Baby Go\\"I can't speak to how much my daughter will like it, but I sure had fun with it. It has a lot of fun lyrics, movements and sounds for kids, and it does sound different than your average kids CD, but still accessible. The short tracks highlighting drums, bass, trombone, etc introduces kids to instruments. I'm sure she'll love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby loves Jazz","review":"I like jazz.I like babies.I don't like this music A fake voice (supposed to be voice of a baby)repeatedly comes on and is very phony and unpleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"baby music","review":"it is ok, but I was looking for music my son and I could both listen to without me going crazy...and this is not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice album","review":"1/15/07: Nice album, easy listening for parents, but hasn't quite caught our nearly-one-year-old daughter's attention (yet?).3/26/08: Our daughter is now two and she LOVES this CD!

The Complete Series","review":"Product was exactly as we expected. However, the video CD arrived 11 days later than the maximum estimated time indicated on the order, and took a lot longer to arrive from the US (or New Zealand??) than other international orders ordered online - perhaps as a result of a pre-Xmas order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not In The Same Class As Naked Gun","review":"I was disappointed by the low level and frequency of the gags in this 6 show run from the doomed TV show \\"Police Squad\\". Initially, I laughed at the first few gags and thought all the poor reviews were just from \\"Crazy People\\". The jokes are few and far between, and of low intensity because ... remember, this was for early 1980's TV ... and the NETWORK CENSORS of the Reagan era. I should have tried to view it through Netflix first. Now I wish I had my money back. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"How dumb can you get?","review":"I usually enjoy Nielson movies, but this one was is so silly that it ended up in my trash can. Movies like this are made by simple minded people for simple minded people to watch. It is sad that a man so rich with a long career in the movies has to stoop so low as to make a perfect ass of himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wickedly hilarious comedy!","review":"Calling all Nielsen fans, we have a case of utter hilarity on the loose here. Unfortunately there are only six episodes of Police Squad! ever created, but luckily they spun it off into the classic movies like the Naked Gun Airplane series. And the best part about the episodes on this DVD is that they are all in color! Like Leslie says on the commentary to these episodes, the humor just was not cut out for television audiences, since viewers do not like to remain captive and be forced to pay attention to every little detail in order to understand the humor. However, if you are a Nielsen fan, and you really enjoy the benefits of his slap-stick comedy, then you definitely cannot pass up a purchase of this DVD. Each and every line will have you rolling on the floor in laughter time and time again. So buy it, watch it, laugh your socks off, watch it again, and keep on laughing. You will not be disappointed in this hilarious DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy - five years ahead of its time!","review":"It's amazing to think how successful \\"Police Squad!\\" would have been if it had premiered in the late 80s/early 90s when the Naked Gun movies hit the theaters. Each episode is hilarious (even though many jokes were later recycled into the Naked Gun movies) from the guest dying before the credits finish in the beginning to the freeze frame closing credits."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"Although this didn't last long on Television,it was hilarious.\\\\Leslie Neilson is at his funniest along with a terrific cast.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video and sound quality","review":"Having watched the complete series on TV, then purchasing them on VHS years later, I was naturally excited to again have the chance to own it on DVD. The amazing picture quality is only the first thing I noticed. The sound quality is also breathtaking, particularly when using surround sound.I wonder if anyone else noticed that some of the music has been changed/updated since the VHS release? I noticed almost immediately that Drebin's singing was substantially altered in episode 6, and in episode 3 (The Butler Did It), they actually sing \\"Happy Birthday\\" instead of \\"Something Different\\", as was sung in the original version. Just a bit of trivia for the true die-hard \\"Police Squad\\" fans.All in all, this is a great release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Shortlived","review":"I was unaware this series even existed until I purchased the Naked Gun trilogy and it appeared in my recommendations. Since I'm a fan of the movies I had to get this too, and it really is a rare jem as another reviewer stated. It was a hilarious series that actually had some continuity between episodes; for example they named all the people they locked up at the end of each ep. What I don't understand is why only six eps were made? Most shows, even the unpopular ones, are at least allowed to pull off a half season, in the double-digits. There's also a lot of repetitive jokes, such as the cigarette one, that were funny at first but quickly lost their punch. Overall a great (mini) series and this disk even has some good extras. If you're a fan of the movies I'd say get this too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific","review":"While another zany show called Get Smart ran for 5 years, Police Squad never got the chance, being cancelled after just 6 episodes. The suprising thing is how successful the movies would be all those years later with basically the same exact type of gags and jokes. If you are a fan of the movies, then you must pick up this dvd. The 6 episodes are all funny, and the extras are a nice addition. It doesn't appear that the series was remastered, but the sound and picture quality are decent. A good price and nearly 3 hours of funny material make this a must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Am I seeing things??? DVD?","review":"Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! This just made my friggin' month! 20 year fan with grainy tapes to prove it. Great show - too bad most of the country was too clueless to get the hunor.

But audio could have been better ........","review":"I won't bother repeating how great the series is or how long I have waited for a copy of the complete set. They are all here now. But I do have one complaint, the audio could have been better. Sounds like a mono recording and the levels tend to go up and down considerably. Music and gun shots are loud while voices are soft, that sort of thing. But I would buy this DVD again in an instant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Short Tv Show","review":"We remember the Naked Gun films about a inept and absurd Liuteniant Detective played by Leslie Nielsen.This six episodes are the Tv series created by the ZAZ(Zucker,Abrahams) the same as Airplane where Nielsen also had a role.The series were a dissapointment and only run 6 eps as viewers didn't see how the visual humor and 2 acts and epilogue were.Also the eps have unique aspects never repited in subsequent shows.In the start credits a guest star died in the most absurd way.In the end credits actors are froze and all the scene while the credits were displayed in the screen.I never saw this here in Spain as never was broadcasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"old series but still funny!","review":"I remember when this series was on TV. It always made me laugh and it still does!Lots of sight gags and one-liners."},{"rating":"2","title":"You goota have a sic sense of humor","review":"You will notice there is no laugh track. it's because there are so many visuals going on in the backgroundyou have to pay attention.

Stiff without that wonderful Balanchine flair. But then, NYCB doesn't have it anymore either. Costumes are horrible. The French make such beautiful things, why didn't they just make exact copies of the divine Karinska originals?! If you want to see these great ballets danced they way they should be, don't waste your tme watching this DVD. Go to the Dance Collection at the NY Public Library at Lincoln Center. Maybe they will break their hearts and let you watch a tape of the great days of NYCB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Once Paris may have been a place for ballet, but this has not been the case for a very long time. It is sometimes said the Paris Opera Ballet have excellent technique but that there is a cold distance between them and the music, between them and the audience and even between them and the dance.I partially agree...but am not as impressed with their technique as most critics.One wishes for the DVD of The New York City Ballet in this. Or at least the Joffrey."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars, were it not for the poor picture quality","review":"I watched it on big screens (57 and 106 inches) and whenever there is fast movement or the camera moves, the dancers are not sharp. I even wrote OpusArte about it, but was informed they don't see any problems with it.The performance itself is outstanding, but the DVD is visually poorly produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry movement indeed","review":"I have to agree that the DVD is not of very good quality. Movement is indeed blurred. This is, in fact, the only ballet disk which I have where I have noticed this to such an extent. ABT telecasts of such ballets as Swan Lake or Le Corsair on DVD are much superior in terms of the quality of the disk. I found it coninually interfered with my enjoyment of the dance. One other complaint-- sometimes exits are as exciting as anything else in the dance. No one who ever saw Edward Villella will ever forget his whirling off the stage after the 'playing tag' section of Rubies. On this DVD, the camera cuts away before the dancer's exit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"edited or not this album is one of the best in 2003","review":"buy this cd,be it edited or explicit.it is an unbelieveable record by 4 cool guys.the music will blow you away.its an intense record and worth your time and money.buy it now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"beavis and butthead dvd","review":"the dvd set is okay butt they really should release complete seasoned box sets on dvd instead of just putting out mikes favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"The videos are great, I was hoping for the original aired episodes the way MTV played them years ago. Don't get me wrong, they are, but separated from the music videos they would watch and critique. So watching the DVD, you see episode after episode of the cartoons, never any music videos, those are played separate on a different DVD. Still, it's a blast from the past, just not presented in it's original format.Also, the bobble-head dolls are neat, but small and insignificant. They aren't wearing their traditional AC/DC and Metallica shirts but they come with the package and so it's a little something extra.This package is definitely worth it if you're a fan, especially because you get the movie too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Some of the 24 are complete, coherent, and the solutions are logical and clever. Others seem completely arbitrary (a half price ticket means someone is a senior citizan? A stool only falls forward if someone falls out of a window? After a couple of puzzles, the author's sense of humor begins to grate and interfere with the puzzle genre -- I was looking for puzzles I could present to students that they could try and solve (and so had a definite solution), not quasi-puzzles with elaborate solutions that do not necessarily follow from the scenario and illustration.

He is very precise in the attention he pays to exegetical considerations; many of which are done through lengthy comments - more accurately described as short essays. He writes from a fairly conservative approach and is careful to hold on to the view of Paul as author of the epistle. His dealing with the background, authorship, structure and theology yields to his conservative bent. A very good work, which unfortunately is out of print"},{"rating":"1","title":"Banality Plus","review":"I don't think I've ever heard anything quite as uninspired as these little piano pieces, though the piano music of Felicien David comes close---you will be bored to death. The piano writing is far too simplistic, more suitable I suppose for a child's hand and capability, but there is nothing melodically or thematically gripping about anything here to make these pieces worthwhile even for a child piano student---there are so many better simple pieces out there to choose from! I found nothing here to enjoy, unfortunately.Avoid this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poorly directed, uninspired rendering","review":"This movie really should have been scary. The premise was good, and the way in which it was filmed was interesting. The music was absolutly terrible, and the acting was really poor.

I watched it with my twin 6-year-olds and we were all equally bored and disappointed with this video! It was just SO far off from the story and all these extra characters (an excuse to add some star names to the mix), just came and went randomly. Most of the jokes seemed more aimed at adults than the kids it is intended for.

Oh wait, yes I can: Lynn Redgrave. Her performance was outstanding. Everyone else was wasted. Howie Mandel (who I really like), was weak.

The quality of the songs, vocals and productions are very professional. Not all, but a lot of the asian groups out there now are just riding on their ethnicity to get people to buy their records and result in below average vocals and or extremely bad songwriting. And that does make Devotion a standout in the asian-american music industry. the asian-american music scene is still relatively new so in a way they are innovative by their nationality. Here's the ultimate compliment. i would probably buy their cd even if they weren't asian."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD!!","review":"I just want to take this time to thank all the Asian/American bands out there for their hard work and dedication to make it in the music industry and represent the Asian people, culture and music.devotion is one of many great Asian talents out there today..These guys are awesome and soo is thier debut ALBUM \\"Image Of devotion.\\" Their cd contains of a few songs that were written my the members themselves, great lyrics, beats and vocals that make this cd aN outstanding album..This cd is truly an \\"image of devotion.\\"gET our copy today!!I promise each and everyone one of you that this cd will be worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"epitome of cool....","review":"this is a cool, laidback album. most definitely the bomb. bloodstones best whole complete album. its got a little bit of everything. for the lovers, the funksters, for the rockers, its got it all. for a good dose of laid back mellow 70's soul, definitely get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"These lab goggles are great! No goggle will ever by 'fog' free without an evacuation system. These are excellent for college lab's and general work requiring eye safety. For the price they are unbeatable. I have very sensitive skin and was getting the nastiest lab lines from my other goggles. I wore these for 3-4 hrs straight and my lab lines were gone in 10 minutes upon removal of the goggles. Excellent padding - Best 'bang for your buck', hands down. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story!","review":"Interesting story! As expected, it is beautifully filmed, the dialogue is convincing and the actresses are wonderfull - like other Sarah Waters stories. The actresses do a wonderful job in displaying love for one another, despite the lack of love scenes between them. I Really enjoyed the twist in this one, very unexpected! I give it a 4 however, because the end was a bit disappointing. I agree with the previous reviewer in that if you like happy endings movies, this one will likely dissapoint. Overall though, I though it was a very good movie and worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Affinity\\" Video Is Wonderful","review":"The acting and the sets are wonderful. Generally, the movie is faithful to Sarah Waters' novel; unusually, I would say it improves on and enhances the work it is adapted from. The special features include excellent interviews with the author, the scriptwriter, the director and two of the actors which add tremendously to appreciation of the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"What it lacks: redeeming value","review":"Never thought I'd say this: a film with a lesbian subplot that can cure insomnia. I have not read any of Sarah Waters' novels, but this is the third movie I've watched that was based on them and I'm beginning to think that Waters has a poor opinion of women and lesbians (albeit disguised in her smoke and mirrors). In this convoluted suspense story, the female characters are crooks, swindlers, gullible, lonely, controlling, violent, desperate, suicidal -- and in one important scene, sexual molesters. If this was also the novel, then it's a mystery to me how Waters has managed to gain a loyal following of lesbian and feminist readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was an awful movie! I am a big fan of Sarah Waters Tipping the Velvet and Fingersmith were excellent! This movie was too short, I could not connect to any of the characters, the directing was bad, and it did not give enough of the story! Don't waste your time or money. Get Tipping the Velvet or Fingersmith."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been better is not for marketing","review":"There are three problems with the movie. The first of which is lighting. Ok I know is a victorian prision and it not going be the best lit place in the world, but its also just a movie so realism is not needed. The second is the structure its a bit hard to follow all the flash backs, and some extra footage puting sceans into greating contex would be been welcomed. The third is marking, as the ending shows and if follow the drug use of one main characters, its the story of one most brutal assults I have ever seen. This is what makes the book and movie much better then somthing one would see on American over the air tv or the laughable lifetime nextwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't love it","review":"Well, I live in New York. I attend the film festivals. I go to art cinemas. So I took a chance. In the fewest of words, this simple is nothing you would want to own. Fine, rent it. It's amusing at best. It always amazes me that all the effort, money and time it takes to make one of these shorts and yet you find yourself thinking, \\"huh?\\" The best of the collection were the black and white offerings, Boot Camp and Twilight of the Gods. From what I have read, Trevor, which is available separetly, was originally a part of this collection when shown in theaters."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Best of Boys in Love","review":"The Best of Boys in Love is one of the worst items I've ever purchased.

This movie sucked, the storyline sucked, the title had nothing to do with the movie itself, the action was mediocre at best even the ending sucked! Leave this s#!t alone! Buy it only if you feel like wasting money or you're getting revenge on someone! A better movie to buy with the actual wing chun martial arts style in it is: Ip Man starring Donnie Yen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Descendants of Wing Chun","review":"This is the absolute worst (martial arts or otherwise) film I've ever had the displeasure of watching. Any viewers should be reimbursed for their time wasted. I would recommend this film to no one. This \\"c\\" movie had no story line, terrible acting bad correography, and nothing of value to offer viewers. As a Wing Chun practitioner and avid martial arts movie goer, I would like to offer some quality films with skillful actors and great fight scenes. A few are: \\"Fist of Legend\\", \\"Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon\\", \\"The Legend of the Drunken Master\\", \\"The Seven Samurai\\", and anything by Bruce (strictly for the quality of Bruce's technique and forgiving the cheesiness of the films). Have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm happy","review":"I really like the camera and it doesn't hurt to get all the extra stuff with it as well. It's a great camera for regular use and it's pretty easy to use. If i could give it 4.5 stars out of 5 i would, but there's no option for that.My only complaint would be the time it takes to capture a picture. Whenever you take a picture, the camera flashes once, then pauses, then comes a final flash. So by the time the first flash is finished, everyone thinks the picture has been taken, but the second flash actually captures the picture; basically, if everybody moves after the first flash, your picture comes out blurry.Other than that, i'm completely satisfies with this camera! It's my first camera ever, and i'm glad i bought this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Realtors","review":"I searched several stores in town as well as on line and this is the only camera I could find with a wide-angle for interior pictures of homes. The 28mm really widens the shot for small rooms as well as gives a lot of options for the larger rooms.I highly recommend this camera for Realtors & Appraisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"This is a very great book! my son who is 3 really likes the drawings and enjoys recognizing the monuments! we also have this is NY, and it is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for learning random vocabulary... terrible for conversation.","review":"I only bought this Tagalog program because Pimsleur does not, as of yet, have a Tagalog lesson set. Wow, was I ever disappointed! It just has a person saying each phrase twice and then moves on to the next. There is no continuity to the phrases, nothing conversational about them, and nothing that would serve to cement the information into one's brain. If you can wait until next year, Pimsleur claims they will be coming out with a Tagalog course in the Fall of 2007."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to miss","review":"Thanks to a mixup on the Amazon server, some reviews of this offering seem to have strayed into the Korean section, with predictable confusion. But in fact this CD (formerly published on cassettes) is of very little use even for people who actually want to learn Tagalog. You can't teach, or learn, a language via recordings of vocabulary lists and simple phrases out of context. Which is all you get here. This material will leave you completely clueless about how to string the words together in anything beyond the preset formulae used here. If you want to find out what a limited number of Tagalog words sound like when read out as lists, this is just about fit for that limited purpose; but there are cheaper (and indeed free) sources of better material for that, which a quick Google will locate. If you have anything more than mild and limited curiosity about this fascinating language, then don't waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"uh.. i think there's an error","review":"i just read through most of these reviews and it seems to me there might have either been a mix-up on the part of the reviewers (reviewing the wrong product) or a glitch in the website (somehow transferring reviews for the korean language product to this page about the tagalog language product). anywho, that's just my guess.. because it seems odd that more than one person of different locales reviewed a product for korean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye-irritant and greasy","review":"Sorry L'Oreal, but this stuff makes my eyes red and causes tears each time I apply it, even though I avoid using it around my eyes...Also, it's very greasy, it does not properly absorb into the skin and leaves it very shiny...smell is bearable though...Had to throw it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GUITAR VIDEO I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"THIS VIDEO IS A MUST FOR A MUST FOR ANY GUITAR PLAYER-TED TELLS IT LIKE IT IS-WANNA ROCK-GET THIS VIDEO-AND YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for riding in the desert","review":"If you tend to take your off-road vehicle into areas that are particulary dusty or sandy, you'll want this PreCharger for your K&N filter.

Everything in China has changed and nothing has changed. Perhaps the greatest lesson is that China changes but VERY slowly.Crow's insight into China and especially Shanghai \\"before Liberation\\" provides wonderful stories of how to develop ads and merchandising tactics, deal with Chinese customers, and keep on laughing. If you have ever read any other book about the Chinese market, it invariably cited Crow. Now, go to the primary source. It is somewhat frustrating to know he dealt with the same issues with which we deal now, but it is also reassuring to know that he did encounter similar problems. It makes forecasting in China a bit easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange..yes..angels..a big no...","review":"Jonis Agee's \\"Strange Angels\\" is a nobel attempt to modernize a Western. Set in contemporary Nebraska(Cherry county to be precise), the story follows the contempestous relationship between three siblings(Cody, Arthur and Kya). They all have a different mother, but the same father: recently deceased rancher Haywood Bennett. The novels follows their changing lives as Arthur tries to steal an attractive widow away from Cody, Kya tries to be less selfish(and man hungry), and their Indian friend Joseph tries to steer them along(he's the best character in the novel easily). Too slow for my tastes, and overly melodramatic with a hero that drinks A LOT. Only merits 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"doens't work","review":"We purchased this last Christmas.

It's just what you need if you're having any doubts or experiencing rejection (or, for that matter, selling everything right and left!). It helps you get in touch with a lot of wisdom about why we write and how to nurture your writing self, whether you are having \\"success\\" getting published or not. I read it right after a big agent turned down my manuscript, and it really helped me put the whole thing in perspective. A wise, engrossing, touching book, like having a good friend at your side.

Go to books like Self Editing for Fiction Writers for the craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well it passed the half way mark for me","review":"As a kung fu student and a person that stays glued to their seat whenever a good move is showing, this movie has potential in terms of the use of kung fu in not just fighting but in that person's everyday activities in life.A Serious comedy about love, life, death and revenge (duh), this movie shows how emotions affect Kung Fu skills and thus techniques. The Plot and storyline at first is not properly understood but everything comes into perspective a quarter way through the movie, from there it get only clearer. I would recommemd any lover of martial arts movies watch this movie but keep in mind that the fifth star was removed due to the witers trying to add TOO much to comedy to the story and thus losing the viewer at times.(Saw it on VHS)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and money!","review":"Utter garbage!

Not all that secure for hanging things.The idea is the tray will be clamped onto a mic, or other stand, but we machined and attached a plate onto the bottom that would allow it to be screwed onto a beefy mic stand adapted for this use alone. Much more stable. If you used the clamp as designed, this tray is heavy enough to make it probable you would crush your mic stand to some degree before you stepped back and watched it tipped over.Bottom line is it is solid, but requires rethinking how to set it up for secure use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasted too bad to use.","review":"I really wanted to use this product to create some shimmer and sparkles for cupcake decorating.Product was not what I expected, and tasted very bad.

The lead singer's tone is definitely one that is hard to absorb at first, but the lyrics to these songs are amazing. It's been in my cd player since I first bought it! Third Eye Blind has always been known for their lyrics, sexual nuances, and catchy melodies; and this album doesn't stop there. You still get the best of them while they also expose the \\"vein\\" that obviously inspired these songs. There isn't a song on the album that I don't like!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind has Returned in Style!!","review":"After \\"Blue\\", I was starting to doubt the longevity of the band. But after the wait, \\"Out of the Vein\\" clearly delivers the excellent unique sound that was so remeniscent of their first album. Quite a few of the songs will become hits I think, including: Blinded, Crystal Baller, and Can't Get Away. Overall the album is less silly and radical than \\"Blue\\" which is nice to see. Better than the first album....hmmmm that could be debated, but a GREAT album nonetheless! GET IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another thought-provoking piece of art!","review":"Well, the title of this review says it all!! There are so many facets to this band and their music. As one can see by customer ratings, it seems there is something about them that EVERYONE can connect to. This band is quartet of solid, creative talent, with each member contributing their soul for the sake of the art. Again, Third Eye Blind \\"bleeds\\" for its fans. Blinded is yet another musical and lyrical piece of artwook, embracing the best of life,(manic love, wealth, reckless abandon;) and the worst, (heartbreak, poverty, obsession.) The lyrics are poetry and like the others, this CD is most appreciated with lyrics in hand. Rock, Rap, Reggae, a little bit of everything blended in here. High points of this CD are, Wake For Young Souls, Misfits, Can't Get Away from You and Crystal Baller, although it is an addictive listen from start to finish. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING","review":"Out of the Vein is one of Third Eye Blind's most impressionable pieces of work. Every track on the CD is amazing.

I haven't listen to the whole CD yet, and I don't need to. This CD is trash. Every single song has the same upbeat and annoying rifts. It's only after the first 30 seconds of each song and the display on your CD player that you know what song you are on because EVERY song starts out the same way.3EB needs to have more than one idea for a song before they release a CD because rehashing the same one over and over again isn't going to sell very many CD's. It's no wonder they haven't had a hit song in awhile--people are tired of listening to the same old stuff about the same old things with the same old melodies.

Being a fan since their first album (must have), this is much better than their last cd, Blue. The cd starts off with a great uptempo track, Faster, and ends with Good Man, a mellow song that keeps you going. Some standout tracks are: Crystal Baller, Misfits, Good Man, and Wake For Young Souls. But like I said, their isn't a bad song on this cd.

Really, you could start anywhere - the self-titled is amazing but Blue impressed me even more and even thought this one (Out of the Vein) just came out TODAY I can already safely say from one listen that this band has not lost it yet. This CD, and the 2 previous ones, do not contain one skip-over song - but I must add that any of the singles you have heard on the radio (while they are still great) are not near as good as the others you will hear that will never get released. Third Eye Blind sing about stuff you can really relate to and they touch the soul!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! Buy this album!!","review":"This is the best ThirdEyeBlind album to date!

The vibe of Cant Get Away is unavoidable, and songs like Faster, Blinded, Forget Myself and My Hit and Run have top 40 written all over them. Best album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Eye Blind has done it again! Awesome CD!","review":"Like a lot of the other reviewers on here, I have also been a huge fan of Third Eye Blind since 1997 when they came out with their smash hit \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\". I, of course, loved both thier debut CD and \\"Blue\\" but I do believe that \\"Out of the Vein\\" is by far the BEST CD they have done yet. After waiting 3 years for the release of this CD, I have to say that I was not disappointed. Stephan (Jenkins) is an awesome songwriter/musician and this CD definitly shows that. Every song on it is great and catchy in it's own way. I, personally, love \\"Crystal Baller\\", \\"Palm Reader\\", \\"My Hit and Run\\" and \\"Forget Myself\\" the best. I would definitly recommend this CD to anyone who asked. They won't be disappointed. Third Eye Blind rocks and I hope that they continue to put out awesome CD's like this one in the future!~*~ If you get the chance, definitly check Third Eye Blind out this summer live on tour in a city near you! Third Eye Blind Rocks Forever! ~*~"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will not be dissappointed!!!","review":"Since picking up Third Eye Blind's newest cd last on May 13th, I have listened to nothing else.I have been enjoying their cd tremendously.I feel the band has grown a lot from their previous work,but you can't mistake them from being anyone else.Stephan's lyrics are so poetic,combined with help from Arion and Tony this time around makes the music simply the best out there.Every song just takes you right in.Out Of Vein has to be one of my top 5 cds in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Vein Attempt at Former Greatness","review":"After the blazing success of their first CD and Blue, Out of the Vein is a real let-down. Gone are the innovation and poetic creativity that drove their first two CDs. It is clearly apparent that the departure of Kevin Cadogan has bled this band dry of it's artistic capabilities. Instead the band must now rely on un-inspired heavy metal and cheap gimics like a free DVD in order to sell music. Thus ends yet another short lived but great chapter in the anals of Rock...not with a bang but a wimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm an old 3EB fan","review":"I bought this cd simply because I love Third Eye Blind, and I still do love the band despite this new effort. Listen to it before you buy it, don't buy it on spec like I did. The problem is not that their talent has disappeared, but that it's a flat recording. I don't feel the umph that I require from a song. It sounds like they beat it to death in the recording studio, and lost the emotion of the words somewhere along the way.I was so surprised that I switched players to make sure my speakers weren't screwed up. It wasn't the speakers. In well thought out lyrics and sounds, somewhere it died for me. It seems from the other reviews that many people disagree with me, but my recommendation is to listen to this cd somehow before you purchase it. I was disappointed. Perhaps I should see them live to find their spirit, because I don't think it made it to cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIRDEYEBLIND, not a but THE band!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Takes the first two albums to the next level. Simply the best rock album of the year! Its strengh is its sound: solid rock which has less of a studio feel to it than the first two. Out of 13 songs, at least 8 are superb! Jenkins's composing talent is evident and its voice unique. Salazar and Fredianelli's contributions complete the album. This not a, but THE band. A MUST HAVE ALBUM."},{"rating":"2","title":"What many have been waiting for.","review":"Ever feel like you are missing something. That you are waiting for something to show up and take you out of this hole you have been sitting in. Well it has arrived and it is Third Eye Blind's new cd \\"Out of the Vein.\\" The music is incredible. Stephan made a comment saying that it isn't a continuation, and he is absolutely right. There is a magic within the sounds that you hear that I haven't heard since the days of Blue. Every song brings you a new emotion and once you are done listening to the whole cd, you want to listen to it again. I just \\"Can't Get Away\\" from it. All the tracks could be used for singles and I really hope everyone goes out and buys the album. It will be worth it like a \\"wake for young souls\\" of sorts. Stephan, Arion, Brad and Tony really make you \\"Forget Myself\\" and show you once again that we are all \\"Misfits\\". Finally I found my people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Emotion","review":"THird Eye Blind does it again with their third album, Out of the Vein. With each new album, THird Eye Blind seems to more and more exactly portray their emotions, and in addition, the emotions of their listeners. Before this album came out, I knew of five of the songs. I had heard Blinded, Faster, Crystal Baller, and Wake for Young SOUls, and Forget Myself. I immediately fell in love with those five songs, and after i heard the rest of the album, the same affect took hold on me. Out of the Vein is pure genius, and the result of years of work. To miss out on this album with its lyrical beauty and musical complexity would be missing out on a turning point in musical history. Buy Out of the Vein today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"This C.D. is absolutely great. It took a few listens to get into it but it will not let you down. Unlike anything else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great CD","review":"The summer CD lineup is heating up in the rock genre. Metallica, Train, Staind, and many others have had good releases, but Third Eye Blind's release was suprisingly good. With strong tracks the whole way through, this is one of the best CDs this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm Calling Shenanigans","review":"This cd is a disgrace in the context of this band. The band strives to reach new levels of mediocrity with this release. The entire cd is comprised of bitching about how relationships don't work out, and how things could have been better....just shut the hell up and give me something that at least stays consistent with the style that i've come to expect from you guys. I'm sorry, but this is an unimpressive cd. I was not impressed at all with the content. The songs are soft, the lyrics are weak and the band is only a shadowy expression of what they once were. Don't bother with this cd; move on, find a new band, pick up a hobby, jerk off in the shower if needs be, just don't bother with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great come back","review":"After hearing blue, i was very disappointed... i thought third eye blind had lost it, but after out of the vein was finally released, i changed my mind and i believe that third eye blind are unbelievably talented. their lyrics are poetic and magical, very deep and thoughtful. Theres always a meaning behind each song, unlike most bands today. The greatest song i think are Forget myself, blinded, faster, track 6 but i cant remember its name, - Hit and run i think - can't get away and misfits. Its definately worth every penny, its a great listen and never gets boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"best band ever","review":"cd perfect condition. I do prefer other old school cd's from 3eb better...but all in all ...awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it","review":"In regard to the editor's review I believe the CD is incredible. I am an extreme fan of 3EB. I went to one of their concerts on the \\"Within Arms Reach\\" tour which hit small clubs in the nation. While this CD can still not touch their first self-titled debut, I believe it is better than \\"Blue\\", even though Blue in itself is amazing as well. If you are a fan of Third Eye Blind, or just like alternative in general, get this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"This is a great album, i have always loved third eye blind. This one is just as good as their others. \\"crystal baller\\" is a great song, my favorite is \\"danger.\\" you will no be disappointed if you are a diehard fan. there is a secret song at the end of the cd, what are you waiting, for go buy this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected more....","review":"When Third Eye Blind released their first major label CD, I was impressed with the introspective lyrics matched with memorable hooks -- they made the CD an almost permanent part of my changer's rotation. I said that after that collection, I would not hesitate to buy anything they put out. I bought the next one (Blue) the week it came out, and I felt like it was a huge step down -- not bad, but nowhere near the first.I am sorry to report that Out of the Vein hits a new low. Sure, the tracks are still marked with a personal tone, but at times this tone hits the depressing and painful. What is really lost, though, is the originality of the first -- most of this disc seems recycled and rehashed; in many cases, I thought I was hearing missing parts of songs from the first two CD's. There are a few exceptions, but they are few and far between, and I am rethinking my status as a 3EB fan with every poor effort that comes into stores from them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out Of The Vein is what 3EB fans have been waiting for!","review":"Third Eye Blind has completed yet another outstanding album to add to their repertoire. After their three year break after the release of Blue spent building an all-new studio in San Francisco, 3EB returns to the scene with quite an entrance. The new album, fraught with the pop-alternative sound, offers something to everyone, including fans of Pop, Rock, Alternative, and just plain unique music. This is a CD you can listen to in your car, at work, while you work-out or even sleep. It's great...the perfect final act of the Band's trio of albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changing Sounds","review":"Third Eye has achieved a following and fan base through their ability to connect with the common listener. Relationships, fights, sex, death, and self doubt are just some of the topics they tend to touch on, but lead singer Stephan Jenkins has the ability to make you step into his life.With the release of their third effort, Out Of Vein, things have not changed. The lyrics are just as dark, the sex is just as raw, and the tones have an uplifting but negative vibe at the same time. For a true Third Eye fan, this is a Third Eye CD. If your someone who is looking for Semi-Charmed Kinda Life, that was 5 years ago, times change, and so does music. All in all, it's the same band, and they continue to evolve their sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"3EB","review":"This is 3eb's third album. Here u can find this band at their punkiest prime. Not so lyrically forced as their first 2 albums but still not a dissapointment. I think \\"hit and run\\" is one of ther best songs and u also get a hidden track \\"another life\\" and \\"time in exile\\"<---only in bonus dvd. Overall a good cd, dvd is good to making my money worth while. If your a fan of softer and gentle 3eb there blue and dubut album will give u a rise so pick em all up and have a fun time being lost in jenkins words. hes a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"Great album from 3EB, just like their self titled album to \\"Blue\\". Being from California, or more specific the Bay Area, they offer a different sound from all the other bands.My favorite track is \\"Crystal Baller\\", but I still like all of the tracks. The bounus DVD is great also featuring the band playing live somewhere I forget. And they even had help from Vanessa Carlton also, so this is a great album from a great band. Go out and but it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slit a Vein","review":"Out of the Vein is great...if you can't sleep and want something to put you out fast! Whoever says it takes some getting used to was partially correct. I'm already used to changing the station when their first single plays on the radio. Steven Jenkins is not \\"interesting when he's wounded.\\" He sounds [bad]. Out of the Vein seems to be missing something the first two GREAT albums had...could it be fired guitarist Kevin Cadogan? Skip the album, and if you still want to spend money on Third Eye Blind, go to one of their concerts...oh, and a word of advice--the best time to make a run towards the concession stands is when they start playing songs from Out of the Vein."},{"rating":"1","title":"i'm glad this is a limited edition","review":"one of my favorite bands from way back when was undeniably third eye blind- making their self titled album one of my most treasured cds. however, this album is way to drowny its missing any form of melody whatsoever and it sounds like 3EB wasn't even enthusiastic about any of these songs. this cd is lacking all of the essential ingredients that they worked so hard to put in for their first album, and then not so much with blue (but enough) but there is an immesurable amount in Out of the vein (maybe just traces of their once good side). its missing all the spunk and anything really important. the best song is crystal baller and that is only so-so, the dvd is interesting but i really wouldn't have paid $18 just for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lazy Rehash","review":"Loved the first two albums. This one sounded like reprocessed tracks from those. Occasional moments give enough pop rock energy for 10 listens. Then the dread sets in: these songs not only sound like each other, they sound like pale versions of what this band (when it had a much better guitarist) was doing 7 years ago, and you are never going to listen to this album again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hitting Rock Bottom","review":"I really adored Third Eye Blind's self-titled debut--it was a beacon of light in the sludgy late 90s, with its perfectly constructed pop songs and Kevin Cadogan's lyrical, effervescent guitar playing. The lyrics were even introspective and creative. But they lost their roadmap with the sloppy, incoherent \\"Blue\\" and have now bottomed out with the bland, hookless \\"Out of the Vein.\\" No song reaches out and grabs the listener like \\"Jumper\\" and \\"How It's Going To Be\\" did on the debut. Jenkin's lyrics are occasionaly interesting in that vague stream-of-consciousness way, but his attempts at social commentary (\\"Danger\\") and general tastes for nonsense (\\"Wake For Young Souls,\\" etc.) are tiresome. The vocals are mixed too high, the guitar playing is nondescript (people forget that Cadogan was not just your average axeslinger; his blend of The Edge and Neil Young often bordered on virtuostic), and the songs are just not there."},{"rating":"1","title":"... Cadogan took the good stuff with him","review":"Ex-3eb guitarist Kevin Cadogan should present this album as exhibit A in his lawsuit against Jenkins & the band; apparently he did write all the good tunes. Without Cadogan, 3eb has definitely jumped the shark.Almost all of this album is pure disposable [rubbish]. Jenkins should have focused on music more & acting less. The only decent song is \\"Self Righteous\\" and that's not saying much.It's officially over for these guys. In 2 years, these guys are going to be on VH1's \\"where are they now?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"this record or shall i say this type of music (dave mathews Bland, macthbox 20) has no backbone. its very contrived.these guys are frat boys trying to be rocker's. no standout tracks.it all plays like one endless comercial. You want the real rock? get some Supergrass or Wilco"},{"rating":"2","title":"3EB is back","review":"Third Eye Blind's new album \\"Out of the Vein\\" is a testament to what thoughtfull lyrics combined with excellent guitar work and melodies can become. Stephan Jenkins lyrics throughout the album mostly deal with the pain of ending his relationship with Charlize Theron. On songs such as \\"Faster\\" \\"Crystalballer\\" and \\"Blinded\\" you can feel his anguish. This album mostly rocks though as the slow ballad type songs are limited. This album puts Third Eye Blind back up to the forefront of rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"They've still got it","review":"While not as consistent as either their debut album or the followup Blue, Out of the Vein delivers several incredible songs. The best seem to be Faster, Blinded, Crystal Baller (incredible), and My Hit And Run. However there are a couple weaker songs, like Forget Myself, where 3eb's previous albums really didn't have a single downer, in my opinion. If you like their previous CDs, you should enjoy Out of the Vein. In addition, if you like this album you will love their two other offerings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Vein, Into greatness","review":"I am a big Third Eye Blind Fan. I really liked their last CD Blue. This one is extremely good, even better than Blue. My personal favorite songs are Faster, Crystal Baller, and Wake for Young Souls. I recommend this if you enjoy rock without the emo, and punk. It's hard to write a review for a CD because it's all a matter of opinion, and my opinion is that this is the best Third Eye Blind CD yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Depends What You Like","review":"As usual, Third Eye Blind has taken tbeir good ol' time releasing a new cd. And, as usual, it has resulted in a quality piece of work. Third Eye Blind has undergone some changes since their last cd, including a change in guitarists from Kevin Cadogan to Tony Fredianelli and the building of their own studio. The result: a much more spontaneous, organic sound. However, I feel that the songs just don't have that finishing touch that Cadogan's guitar lines often added in the previous two cds. This cd has a sound more similar to their debut album, with great songs such as \\"Crystal Baller\\" and \\"Blinded\\", but it also explores new directions with songs such as \\"Self-Righteous.\\" My only major complaint is that there is a touch more similarity between all of the songs on this cd than either of the first two. Overall, a solid effort from a great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"FASTER!","review":"Literally...this CD is much faster than the original that put 3EB on the map and though it does branch away the feelings are the same. Sex, Drugs and relationships...that's all you need for a great CD. I love this band...best song...between \\"Faster\\" and \\"Danger\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Been my fave record for months","review":"This record is excellent, its been my fave for many months which is not usual, they usually get replaced. This one sticks. Its made me believe there's good music out there again (yeah i'm old). The hidden track is a beauty (why do people hide the things?) and the motocycle accident is so real, he must have really done it. Love this record & recommend it to anybody who likes good loud tunes with excellent lyrics. BTW I bought the CD but had to crack it & copy it to play on my own CD player!! Crappy copy protection sucks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Very good CD. A must for third eye blind fans. Not as good as Blue, but still catchy and energized. Overall worth the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refined - and that's a good thing","review":"If you liked Third Eye Blind's previous two albums then you will likely enjoy this as well. The band has taken their strongest characteristics and refined them into an excellent blend of the pulsing high energy rock that is the core of their greatness. If you only liked the experimental and fringe tracks from the previous releases then you will be disappointed, but if like most people you want more of the kinds of songs \\"Semi-Charmed Life\\" from their self titled album or the unreleased \\"Camouflage\\" from Blue then this album is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Eye Bomb","review":"I have a compilation CD of the 3EYEBs best 10 songs that always stays in my truck's CD mag. I won't add any songs from this album. The spirit and lyrics that exploded in the first album began to dissipate in the second is hanging by a thread. This album sounds like a band trying to imitate what 3EYEB once was. Musically the songs are very similar. Gone are the intricate lyrics interwoven with guitars that crisscrossed effortlessly between powerful and haunting passages. If you love this band, my advice is to skip this album and hope they find whatever it is they lost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Eye's New Effort","review":"What can I say...this was a great band who lost a great guitar player as well as the ability to write a SOLID album. Don't get me wrong there are a few highlights on this album like catchy tune\\"Blinded (when I see you) and the flat out rocker \\"Crystal Baller\\" (my fav) but other than that the songs don't do much for me. Sorry maybe their next album will be better, or maybe I'll change my mind but for now it only gets 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad. Not bad at all.","review":"Almost as good as their self - titled debut album, 'Out of the Vein' offers an amazing new array of tracks since their last, relatively unremarkable 'Blue' of 1999. The quality compared to 'Blue'? A vast improvement, indeed. If you liked their first album - pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely worth waiting for","review":"I have anticipated the new Third Eye Blind ever since the last album. They keep gettin better and better! This album has some new beats to it and it gets you hooked quick. And what better way than a FREE DVD to tell their fans what they have been up to since they last put out an album! You get an inside look along with listening to these smashing tunes while you watch! THis is my newest favorite cd! You won't be disappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but 3eB has had better","review":"Out of Vein is a good cd...but it is not 3eB's best. It should be purchased for it listening enjoyment but don't expect to have your life changed. Out of Vein lacks the pop hit that will give the album lots of radio time (read: semi charmed life). Faster, Blinded, forget myself, and palm reader make the album worth purchasing. The songs on the cd are mostly balanced in intensity, unlike the debut album Third Eye Blind I have yet to find a song that you sing along with quite like Semi Charmed Life or How's It Going to Be. Out of Vein also lacks a refrain that will haunt you for days as God of Wine from the debut album has a tendency to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"a comeback","review":"After the disappointment of Blue, Out of the Vein brings 3eb back with a vengeance. They are a favorite band of mine and i was constantly awaiting their return. Vein combines the emotional intensity of blue with a common catchiness that slightly drowns out the darker side and makes it easy to relate to. Obviously, Jenkins is singing about the demise of a relationship.I wouldn't raise it above their first album, which was unbeatable, but you have to give them credit. Lyrically, it's very strong musically it's what you'd expect from them. Go out and get it if you're a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Overall, the album flows very well from song to song. Very instrumental at times, but always emotional; songs such as \\"My Hit and Run\\" incorporate both. This is a very good album, not as catchy as their first, but much more honest, and I think that makes it very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"This album does not compare to their previous two releases. \\"Out of the Vein\\" sounds rushed. I was extremely disappointed with this release. I love 3eb...i know Steven Jenkins can't sing LIVE worth you know what, but i expected alot better. Maybe the 4th album will blow all of these out of the water?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does it work? I still don't know...","review":"I've tried using this a few times.

Verdi), he is able to generate genuine dramatic tension; his melodies do seem to arise from the text and situation. Ruy Blas has at least the dramatic and musical interest of Giordano or Ciléa (but not the instantly memorable meoldies). Marchetti seems too anxious to move to the climax in any sequence, but his structural grasp is unique and elegant.

The former is probably worth the price, even though much of the video appears to have come from PAL format tapes that were not terribly well converted. The story's the thing here, and the fascinating history and the vintage video from the Reyes' early lives and travels with their famous father is very interesting.The concert doesn't live up to expectations. The video is of very low quality--some shots have blown-out highlights--and the audio sounds as though it was rerecorded in the men's room at Howard Johnson's.For me to dis any Gipsy King's offering is about as likely as sunshine in Oregon in January. If you are willing to pay the price to see the PBS doc, you won't be disappointed, but if you're also in it for the concert experience, I'd give this a pass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite way to apply liquid foundation","review":"Applying liquid foundation with this gives you an absolutely flawless finish and such an easy/fast application.

It's so soft and puffs up when wet, and it's cool on your skin when you apply make up. When I use mineral make up, I put on the makeup with a regular kabuki brush, then I like to use this to touch up the minerals. I think it makes my face makeup look natural and makes me glow.. Sometimes when I put a little too much make up on (minerals or liquid) I like to use this to give me that airbrushed look. I admit, I had some doubts about this product, especially because it was so expensive for two sponges and because I mainly used mineral foundation and wasn't sure it if would work too well with it, but my doubts were quickly diminished. I introduced this to my friend who usually uses liquid foundation and she loves it. Only con would be that after washing/cleaning the sponge, the liquid make up doesn't always come off fully. For those of you who are a little OCD, a beige/pink sponge isn't always attractive but it gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much...","review":"I have to say that I had high hopes for this product, the reviews were good, and the shape made sense -- add to that the cleanser, and I was excited to receive it.Unfortunately, the sponge does not do the job well, nor is it firm enough. Regarding cleaning it, the enclosed pads don't do the job as well as water and some soap if neeed. Needless to say, I'm disappointed -- this is not the \\"better mouse-trap\\" I hoped for.I say skip this product as is, and let's hope they improve it, and not just be a girly-girl pink gimmick.

I just feel it's a little over priced; only lasted about a month and a half before it sort of shredded, and I don't like that you have to buy a special cleaner for it. I didn't buy the cleaner, but cleaned it with gentle soap and water. When cleaning it, a bunch of the pink dye would come out, making me skeptical about rubbing that damp sponge all over my face or my clients faces.

I tried this little gem after seeing reviews on it. Love that I am using less of my foundation, saving me $$. It gives a air brushed look to my face. It can be a little tricky at first so definately watch the tutorial video on their web site, huge help. Also don't use it for the first time before work or if your in a time crunch, once you get rhythm down your fine. My only problem with it is it leaves little specks of foam on my face. Easily wiped of with the hand but annoying and the reason for the 4 stars. Still not annoying enough that I stop using it daily. Two tips: squeezing out less water makes it great for a sheer summer coverage. I use j&j baby wash to clean my makeup sponge and brushes. Works great, gentle and less $$$ than the brand cleanser."},{"rating":"2","title":"great foundation blender","review":"I purchased ths item after a recommendation from my sister. It is a little costly for a sponge, however it really does work well to blend foundation.

These fakes actually broke on me which the real ones did not do), the fact that they don't stand up at the base the way real ones do, the fact that they don't expand as much as the real ones do.

At first I was skeptical that it was just going to be a weirdly shaped, expensive sponge. After using it I saw what the huge rave of the makeup gurus were all about. My makeup looks so blended and smooth when I use the beauty blender and its so easy to contour with it. I love this product and highly recommend it!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should have bought 2!!!","review":"This is the most amazing product, I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner! It's surprising that a little sponge can make your face look so great, but it does. I use high end makeup brushes and I've never been 100% satisfied because it'll sometimes make my makeup look flakey. I don't know if it's because the sponge is damp when you use it or what, but it blends my foundation perfectly! And, it's good for getting under your eyes and in the corners. Great product! I will def be buying again once it's time for a new one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT blender","review":"I absolutely LOVE this sponge!

Before finding this, my makeup would sometimes look cakey and not smooth. From my first use, I knew this little sponge would work wonders for my skin. My skin look natural, and not heavily made up. Usually when I wear makeup you can sort of tell that I am wearing it, but not with this! After the first time I used this product, my mom actually noticed the difference enough to ask me what had changed in my makeup regimen.I also like how I do not have to use those little white triangle sponges that aren't reusable like this one. Also I found that I use A LOT less makeup than before when I used makeup brushes. This is great, because I can make each bottle of foundation last longer and longer than before."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my best purchase","review":"I purchased this item over the summer because of hearing good reviews on you tube, delivery was prompt but the product didn't really make much of a difference to me. I have used wedges, brushes and sponges in the past and the beauty blender doesn't apply foundation better than any other sponge or brush i've used. I do not have alot of scars/blemishes on my face but i love using full coverage foundation to hide those scars that i do have and i've found that my revelon concealer brush or a round brush applies foundation most wonderfully, the look is natural and never cakey. After purchasing and using this item it just went into the basket i store my other sponges in - i gave this item a two because delivery was good and it's my favorite color - pink! I would recommend if you're looking to buy a good sponge but in my opinion it's not the best one out there"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this sponge","review":"I just got this in today and used it for the 1st time omg!!!!!!!!!! airbrush finish totally worth the price althogh you can get double with cleanser at Sephora for around the same price I love this thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love..love","review":"This is my 5 beauty blender that I got and I am sooooo happy with it !It blend my foundation and concealer perfectly and easy to clean, I don't think i want to go back using brush for foundation and concealer ever again !!!Buy it and you won't regret it :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reader","review":"i just want to say that this book was one of the best books that were ever written and one of the best books i've personally ever read.

God certainly orchestrates things, but He wouldn't give us an entire bible full of wisdom to teach us about Himself if we didn't need it.Most relationships in the bible did NOT happen on coincidence, most relationships back then were arranged.And not only that, Satan is real and knows how to bring about seeming coincidences in our lives...most certainly he is a great deceiver and if we don't have God's truth hidden in our hearts we can fall for the wrong coincidences!I suggest reading The Meaning of Marriage by Tim Keller if you want some good guidelines on what even is God's purpose for marriage.

One of these aliens escaped and went on a rampage (presumably angry that its mate had still been alive when cut into little pieces). Our sad sacks find this alien alive and well and still angry after all these years. Derivative of the Alien movies - down to the encasing of human victims in some sort of coccoon.

The lids fit fantastic. Steamer is decent size, small for some things, but perfect for most uses. Pans are overall very good, clean well, and the nostick is wonderful. The silicone grips of the everyday pan coule be larger, but that is a small problem. Pan edges can be sharp on the pans though, and I did cut myself taking them out of the box. Once you get used to the pans, they are wonderful. I find them in use every day. The price was a fantastic deal and since I paid considerably more for my last nonstick pan (just one pan) than this whole set, if I end up throwing them out after a couple of years, I have more than gotten my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great value!","review":"I have an expensive stainless steel professional line and wanted something with a non stick surface.

I thought I was getting a real bargain at $70 because the set supposedly retailed for \\"$400\\". What a joke. It's only worth about $70 t0 $90. I you pay more than $70 to $90, you've been ripped off.The set has a lot of feature (lots of nice glass lids, riveted handles, etc...) but don't be deceived. This is NOT a high quality set. This is a starter set for a young family that needs a lot of cookware. The material is just too thin to heat evenly. Also, it will warp and then not lay flat on my flat ceramic cooktop. If you have a gas cookstove, this might be OK for you, but believe me, a set this thin WILL NOT hold up well on a ceramic top. Also, the box said it was good in the oven to only 350 degrees. That's less than I thought from the ad on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"I bought it knowing that Cuisinart is a name to trust. I purchased it on black friday for a very low price and seeing that it was normally $400 thought myself to be very lucky. My concern started when the box arrived and I had no problem carrying it in.... seemed much too light. When I opened the box, I only took one pan out and knew it was NOT worth the money. The pots and pan are very light and made of a thin aluminum. The non-stick surface is very thin, so it will not take much to scratch the surface. I put it back in the box and returned it.I went to other stores to compare what is available and have decided it would be worth spending the extra $100 and get a hard-ionized set.

We'll play with this for at least 30 minutes. The problem is my 3 year old thought she'd use it for teething and with one bite dented in the wood significantly (I got it away from her before she could splinter the wood). There is also a possibility of the baby pinching his fingers in it as the colored wood parts do pull apart and I can't help but wonder just how strong the string holding them together is. The colored pieces of wood are movable and can be twisted into shapes which really interests my son- this does pose a bigger problem of being pinched but so far it hasn't been a problem yet.While is is beautiful and clearly a much better option than plastic it's not the perfect teether in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love the quality of this toy.

Miles could say more with a few scattered notes than Marsalis can blowin' all day long. Jazz is, after all, not solely about technical proficiency. It is about the player's soul and his ability to connect it, in a purely spontaneous way, with his instrument -- and, thus, with your soul. Wynton, I'm sorry, but they can package you as the \\"Young Man With A Horn\\", but you ain't got no chops.

Wynton's incredible mastery of almost every style of jazz is incredible. On Cherokee, he blows an absolutely amazing solo that I believe rivals the great Clifford Brown. The two tenor saxes of the septet create some very interesting contemporary motifs on The Egyptian Blues andMarsalis is also able to show his soulful and sweet playing in both takes of the ballad Stardust.

The cousins, Count Balint Abady and Count Laszlo Gyeroffy, are caught up in the world of the demise of the Austro-Hungarian empire, the resulting political and social upheavals, and a frivolous and decadent aristocracy. The lives of the counts, including the choices they make, are used by the author to comment on human nature and how choices they make impact the lives of many others. The novel very authentically depicts the broad tapestry of Hungarian society, from the lives of peasants, merchants, political leaders to the members of the aristocracy during this important period of history. The author, Miklos Banffy, is a terrific storyteller. A very remarkable novel - very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of politics","review":"I really enjoyed reading about the history of Hungary as a person of Hungarian heritage.

This series is smart, fast, funny and educational. The entire collection is well worth adding to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missed it originally--My Mistake","review":"I was one of those people who paid no attention to The West Wing when it was first aired. Earlier this Spring I heard one of the actors (he plays Josh) speak at a commencement program at Wesleyan University. I did not know who he was at the time. But a close friend, who was in attendance at this event with me, spoke inglowing terms of the whole series. So I went out and rented the first DVD out of curiosity and am halfway through the first season. This is simply extraordinary television. I look forward to every episode and have yet to be disappointed. Great Stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick of Disk Problems Here","review":"I don't understand why you keep selling these sets when people complain about big problems with the disks and packaging. You just lower the price on junk instead of replacing it with a quality product. It is as if you hope no one will check out their disks in 30 days and not be able to send them back. When you have a considerable number faulty disks, it it time to create better contracts with your providers/producers so they eat any faulty and returned disks. I went through the same thing last year when someone bought be the piece of junk pink Sex and the City set and then had problems and found everyone had problems. Yet you just kept selling it! Stop selling junk. A DVD you can not watch is not worth half price! People want good, quality DVDs to watch one of the highest quality dramas ever on TV.

I decided to treat myself to Season 1 on DVD.In watching it again after all these years, I realize that Season 1 is the best that West Wing has to offer (well -- I say that now, but I haven't yet delved into season 2 or 3).As far as the DVDs specifically -- one thing that I like, that some hour-long dramas don't include when reproduced on DVDs is the \\"previously on. . . \\" part before the episode starts. This series does have that, and you sometimes need it to get caught up, since one obviously doesn't watch ALL of the 30 episodes at once.It's packaged beautifully, and has some good special features including commentary, the making of the pilot, behind the West Wing, Deleted Scenes, and a Gag Reel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to Compare","review":"If you don't own it yet, I highly suggest buying it. I got into West Wing around the start of season three and have been watching it with dedication since then. But through it all, my favorite episode is from Season One, \\"In Excelsis Deo\\" in which the episode mostly focuses on Toby, the humble giant, who deals with some issues. The finishing scene, with the music playing perfectly along with the gun salute at the funeral.Buy it, you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific!","review":"I must say I've learned so much about our country, our history, the political process, and the list goes on. Since the show is fast-paced, this DVD set was a welcome addition to my DVD library -- I caught things during the DVD viewing that I'd missed during the original showing. I also enjoyed watching a few of the commentary shows and hearing their views on what was happening during filming of a particular segment, or their thoughts on strategy in setting up certain shots. Wow!

Yes, my political views coincide with this administration but the wonderful interplay of the lead actors is what kept me glued to the series.

Though the beginning of the 5th season was less sparking, it finally picked up pace in the final episodes.

Anyway, what I thought was supposed to be a show about a noble profession has become just as drama-filled as any daytime soap opera.

Despite of a suppoesedly fascinating idea for the plot, I found the story too scattered and lack of excitement. The author seemed to try too hard on character development while it should be done within the unfolding of the incidents. In other words,I was often unsure whether I was reading a mystery at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vastly overrated","review":"I can't help but be amazed by the flood of ecstatic reviews greeting this book. The title and basic concept led me to expect great things, but--as both a mystery fan and an English lit professor--I found it disappointing and dull. The bizarre, quirky world of academia is certainly an excellent background for a mystery, but it doesn't receive its due here. The heroine is fiercely uninteresting; even her character quirks are dull (why, for example, constantly focus our attention on her preference for black coffee?). If you're looking for a good mystery that really mines the fascination and strangeness of English literary research, read Robert Barnard's _Case of the Missing Bronte_ or Jane Langton's _Emily Dickinson is Dead_. For a truly great read about literary research and the folk who are obsessed with same, you can't do better than A. S. Byatt's _Possession_. _Quieter Than Sleep_ is a waste of a good concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start here, then read the rest of the series","review":"Joanne Dobson's Quieter Than Sleep is just the wonderful beginning of an outstanding series starring Professor Karen Pelletier. Dobson has created a main character who is real, flawed, terrifically intelligent and witty, and tenacious to a fault. These books are not typical \\"cozies\\" but raise the bar. I love a lot of cozies, but Dobson's writing doesn't miss a beat. The language flows beautifully, the characters are well defined (no confusing one character with another in these books), and the story keeps me reading at all hours of the night. Dobson's are among the very few books I really CAN'T put down. So, start here, then please go on to read the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for rebuilding your collection","review":"I originally found this CD when I was looking for songs that I had lost back in my old college days (especially the old 12\\" platters).

But now we're ready for something that will contain him and will not tip over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinky lil hole","review":"I got one of these for my son back when I first tried to potty train him. I couldn't believe what a piece of garbage it was once he had put his bare bottom on it (thus I didn't think returning it seemed quite right). How is any kid over 18 months supposed to fit all the required parts over this tiny hole? I don't think even a girl could keep her various parts on it at once, and any parent who's been there knows that they frequently pee while trying to poo, so there you are. I ended up tossing the top and keeping the step stool for use with the potty seat I went and bought to fit on the toilet instead. We still have the step stool, in fact, and I intend to pick up a baby bjorn seat for our youngest to use with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mama Does It Again","review":"This book was full of suspense. I think of myself as a good armchair detective but I was completely wrong about this. Without giving away the story I will say you get two mysteries for the price of one. The main storyline involves Simone's ex-roommate from college. It is an open and shut case but is anything really open and shut. Did Cheryl really commit murder? If not why is she confessing. Candi, who is Simone's mother answers these questions and more in an entertaining fashion. Simone who is her mother's Dr Watson travels along helpfully but the main focus is Candi or if you prefer Sherlock Holmes. If you have a few hours this is a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flamed out way too early","review":"Not quite as nasty as the 1st season disc, but the 2nd season still makes the most offensive of South Park look like pablum.

I also like that i can simply dump mp3 files into the samsung's music folder directly from My Computer in WindowsXP. No media player software needed to move music files onto the player. It isnt perfect though. The are a few important buttons on the side and you cant easily feel the difference between them when you are walking around. They are way too small and too easy to accidentally push. The large front button is great but the side buttons could use a redesign. The earbuds that come with it are huge!

Nice crisp display, great sound, menus and features. For the price tag you think you will get an entry-level player but still, this one has many features other more expensive players DON'T have. I love the FM Radio feature, although sometimes reception is not perfect, but it works. Videos look nice on the screen, and very bright. Photos look awesome.

Mine came with latest firmware on it so this may be a new feature.It does have its own proprietary plug would be nice if it was straight usb but it does the job.

They kept chewing.All this stuff accomplishes is two things:#1: It wastes your money. Let's face it, it's essentially water with some bitter rosemary extract in it. It's not exactly worth what they charge for it.#2: It coats everything in a very bitter-tasting spray. So, if you put it on anything you handle or lay on frequently, this stuff will eventually end up in your mouth. Not to mention the taste of the overspray when you apply it.Don't even bother with this. The only good thing I can say about it is that it is odor free.You're best of trying other methods to prevent chewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Opposite Effect","review":"Purchased this for a cat that needs to stop licking himself for medical reasons. I was suspicious since the ingredients are water, baking soda, and rosemary (my cats actually like the smell of rosemary), but I wanted to try something natural.I applied the spray to the cat's fur and he promptly licked himself, paused, and then continued licking himself. I, however, got some of the liquid on my hand and later in the night touched my lips. Regretted that inadvertent action for the remainder of the night due to the lingering taste on my lips and tongue.The cat has continued to lick himself in the area of application and actually spends even more time grooming himself now.I am returning the product for \\"bitter apple\\", which is more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Left Bitter Taste in My Mouth","review":"Sprayed it on the newspaper in the driveway & let destructor-dog out.

I purchased this product as I have a teething puppy who is chewing everything she can fit into her mouth. I was hoping Bitter Yuck would discourage some of the chewing, but I was finding that it wasn't. So to test it further I spayed a healthy puddle of it in the palm of my hand. The puppy went crazy over it and licked my palm clean. I called my adult dog over and the result was the same. He loved it as well. I tried a similar product (also water based) called Phooey. Both dogs went nuts over this product as well licking my palm clean. Lastly I tried some Bitter Apple. This one they didn't like at all, but dogs took a lick and pulled their heads back in disgust.While a nice concept, Bitter Yuck instead is an attractant and a treat. It encourages the exact behaviors it is marketed to prevent. At least with my two dogs, YMMV."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW TO REMOVE","review":"Do not spray in air or on human skin. It is very difficult to remove odor, taste from hands, mouth, and anything you touch.The only thing I found to remove it from my hands was \\"Black Jack Asphalt & Tar Remover\\" found at Lowes or Home Depot.It claims to be gentle on skin and IT IS !!!!

Just to test it out, I sprayed it on a treat and the cat still ate it all up.

Like bitter tasting yuk? Well, great! Because you'll be tasting it for hours and hours! Wash those hands and then wash them several more times!If a nonplussed cat and a noxious odor on your lips isn't enough to deter you from this product, I suggest using it for a far more sinister threat.KIDS.

It covers not only that tribes star lore, but goes into detail about how each tribe lived, such as food/shelter/migrating habits, so that the reader can easier understand how certain elements follow into the star lore.With over 300 pages of detailed information this is a wonderful book and I am happy to own it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise level","review":"The noise level when this product was on was blocking the sound from the TV in the same room....much too noisy to have in the house....it was taken back to the store for a quieter model from a different manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud...

Rael is obviously peerless as a expert and a master in his instruction. Each pose is broken down and really emphasizes where the attention and focus should be. Even a novice like me can understand how to do Pilates correctly. I lost a belt size and five pounds after doing this workout for only three weeks. The workout starts with a gentle warm-up and continues into a very challenging workout for beginners, all in 25 minutes. The visual camera work and production (it says shot in High-Definition on the box) is in perfect sync with the instruction and is any video I've tried. I am looking forward to starting the System 17 ( for intermediates) next week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I bought Rael Pilates System 7 online without knowing much about pilates.

It was at best a 10 or 15 minute work out. I then read the back of the DVD (something that had not been mentioned when I bought it) and it said that you needed to buy 2 other DVD's to get the rest of the workout.I recommend pilates because like I said, I was definetly into the workout but I do NOT recommend this particular one.

As far as that goes, could you buy underwear then, or did people sew it at home? It also laughs at that era (\\"before fun was invented\\"); adults can understand that none of this is to be taken seriously, but what child would get it? Furthermore, why shouldn't our history be presented to small children as serious business, and these people as figures to admire? \\"1776\\" is great fun for adults, but unsuitable for kids of the age that this book is marketed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute children's book to teach history!","review":"I bought this book because it was required for a children's literature class, and I just love it!

Facets seems to have simply duplicated the Region 2 DVD, resulting in blurriness, artifacting, and visible interlacing all over the place.

There are so many engrossing, life-changing foreign films out there, but I think people shy away from them because they fear getting stuck with something ridiculously self-indulgent like this. This film is as pompous as it is esoteric.Since it made so many critics' top ten lists for the year in which it was released, I was eager to watch it but couldn't find it for rent. Thank God I finally found it, and didn't buy it: I hated virtually every minute of it.It consists, so I read, of only 39 black-and-white shots: most of the time we are being treated to the spectacle of circus-related characters monologuing on in the directors attempt to instill a \\"looming sense of dread\\" in the viewer.

The producers did not contribute to this. The production is simply awful. Listen to a Sheryl Crow album which fits similarly in the same genre - there is no comparison. The production value is amateurish, sloppy and not mastered well. They really should have recorded her in a studio by herself with a guitar and that's it. The arrangments are simply inaudible to the point of being a nuisance. Aimee's voice is highly unique and has a quality to it that takes a moment to read. I don't think the engineers understood this.

I hope she never retires."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT AMAZES ME","review":"It seems as if when Aimee Mann puts pen to paper, deceptively simple words and themes can be so complex. It is also sad that the music industry has become so unwilling to foster artistry, rather than baby sit former mousekateers.

I put the CD in and immediately skipped all the previous eight tracks and went straight to \\"Save Me\\", pure beauty. But over time, I started listening to the other, well, they too are pure beauty. She has so much to say about love, life and death and all of it. Anyone who enjoys a beautiful voice, some good acoustic music and some good soft rock should get this CD. The only let down is \\"Dreams\\" by Gabrielle, does not fit at all and is very annoying and breaks the whole album up. But the two tracks by Supertramp are fun and good nostalgia of the late seventies, and the orchestarted song \\"Magnolia\\" by Jon Brion gives you a good feel of the soundtrack and the film itself. Pure beauty, get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed Magnolia? Buy the CD Now!","review":"Well, what can I say? I got the chance to see the movie and listen to the soundtrack a few days ago because here in Brazil takes a while to enter a good movie as this one, altough the movie have 3 hours long, i didn't felt tired watching it becouse of the amazing story, incredible soundtrack and memorable acting. I'm not surprised that the movie got an Oscar nomination for Aimee Mann, well her voice and lyrics are just amazing also i'm not surprised that P.T. Anderson based a part of the script on Aimee lyrics. The movie shows how people are fragile and what happens to these people when their lives are about to fall apart and the soundtracks shows the exact same thing. I'm still amazed how the movie and soundtrack touched me me.

Whether or not you like the movie (and I'm honestly on the fence about this one) you'll love the soundtrack.Mann has more in common with tunesmiths like Elvis Costello, Xtc, Squeeze and, yes, the Beatles than most of her contemporaries. She also (unlike most of her contemporaries) is able to turn her influences into a capitvating, original sound that is all her own.The inclusion of the 2 fine Supertramp songs doesn't diminish the album in any way. It fits in perfectly with the tone of the scenes they were used in for the film. I'd also highly recommend Whatever, I'm With Stupid and her latest Bachelor #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduced Me to Mann","review":"As the title says, this is the CD that introduced me to Aimee Mann. I must thank Paul Thomas Anderson for that.Mann has a gorgeous voice that is put to good use on this CD. Save Me is a great song, deserving of its Oscar nomination. However, my favorite off this soundtrack remains Wise Up, which is the song that the characters sing along to in the movie. It's an incredible song that beautifully frames the hell that the characters are going through.While the soundtrack seems a little cobbled together (and the non-Aimee songs are basically throw-aways), it still fits the mood of the movie quite well. It is a great introduction to Aimee Mann, but she is better appreciated in true album form, such as with her new CD, Bachelor No. 2. I also hear that Whatever and I'm With Stupid are excellent albums, but I have yet to buy them myself.Joel Caris"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy the CD and see the film - Now!","review":"Aimee Mann is one of the most underappreciated musical greats of our time. Don't cheat yourself any longer if you don't already own any of her CD's. And if you are a Mann fan, be advised that his is possibly her best work to date.The film that PT Anderson built around Aimee's music is the best I've seen all year, so be sure to rush out and see it. Thank goodness Anderson had the brains and taste to give props to such a great artist as Aimee Mann. Her tunes are featured prominently in the film, and rightly so.Anderson's girlfriend is Fiona Apple, but surely even he knows in his heart of hearts that Aimee's lyrical depth and mastery with a tune make Ms. Apple sound like an obnoxious first-grader. Don't waste your money on fakers & wannabes...Get the real deal with Aimee.

Aimee Mann is a master who combines melodiclly somber pop sounds with intense feeling, devoid of self control. Aimee's amazing voice paralyzes you and resonates inside as does the message, \\"it's okay to retreat\\". The CD also offers more of the same with two meloncholic, but upbeat Supertramp tracks. A great purchase for staying inside on a lazy or rainy day, but to truly appreciate the CD go see PTA's film inspired by Mann's songs \\"Magnolia\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the Movie","review":"Aimee Mann has really outdone herself with the selection of songs for this soundtrack. Her voice, haunting in selections such as Nilsson's \\"One\\", \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Wise Up\\" evoke some of the movie's best moments. This CD makes for perfect background music and is very moving. The addition of two of Super Tramp's best songs, \\"Dream\\" and \\"Magnolia\\" round out the CD, but it's Ms. Mann's songs that lend the album an unforgettable haunting quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great package","review":"I was somewhat mixed on the movie, and I didn't immediately fall in love with this CD. However, after listening to it a few times, I find myself putting it in at least a couple times a day. The songs are on the slower side, but quite catchy after a while. I've always been a fan of Aimee's - some don't care for her style, and those people probably wouldn't like this, but she has great lyrics and a great voice. I especially like \\"Driving Sideways\\", \\"Nothing Is Good Enough (instr.)\\", and \\"Wise Up\\". I even like the two Supertramp classics they threw in, and I don't hate \\"Dreams\\" by Gabrielle, although it sounds \\"a few years ago\\". You don't need to see the movie to enjoy the CD as the songs stand on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely, lonely and thoughtful collection","review":"I've been an Aimee Mann fan for years, and for others like me, this CD is a true must. Mann's voice has never sounded as sweet -- or as fragile -- as it does here, and there's something wistful about her performance, as if, like the film's characters, she's wishing for something she's not sure she deserves. In addition to the lovely, fragile optimism of the Oscar-nominated \\"Save Me,\\" every single song on this disk is a keeper, offering a depth and intelligence those ex-Musketeer navel-barers can only dream of (her performance of opening cover song \\"One\\" is worth the purchase-price alone). Whether you love Mann, or loved the movie and can't get those songs (or frogs!) out of your head, you won't be disappointed by this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Music","review":"This CD is a terrific companion piece to the best film of the year. Aimee Mann's songs ache with a ironic and melancholic beauty that captivate and enthrall with each listening. The songs are strong enough to stand on their own; seeing the film is not required (although I HIGHLY recommend it) to enjoy the lovely tunes on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars for Aimee & Jon; None for Supertramp","review":"How did Supertramp get on this clever album?!?! And Gabrielle with \\"Dreams\\"??? Didn't she release the song nearly 10 years prior? In any event, Magnolia showcases the best of Aimee Mann's talent. Her cover of \\"One\\" makes you long for the company of another and \\"Deathly\\" stirs up the longing to push that company away in disgust. \\"Wise Up\\" sets the stage for \\"Save Me,\\" a song Aimee Mann was gypped out of an award for. Tracks 1-9 are poignant, beautiful, gripping, and intellectually emotional. Jon Brion's score to Magnolia (Track 13) is a perfect finish, ending the mood that Aimee Mann began so well. Dealing with Supertramp and Gabrielle are worth the diamonds found in this CD. I've never seen Magnolia the movie, but if the CD is an accurate representation of the movie, I'll be delighted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trash the Super Tramp","review":"The movie turned me on to Amiee Mann, and this album hasn't left my changer in a month.

No kidding? That's because her songs aren't all that creative and mann sounds like she wants to join a Beattles reunion tour. I think the majority of this problem comes from the production work of John Brion, who tends to make everything into one big mess( i.e. Fiona Apple 2nd record, Rufus wainwright, etc.) I'm not blaming him liking the Beattles, I blame him for not being innovative enough to break things up more. But I did like the song \\"Driving Sideways\\" produced by Mann and Rage Against the Machine producer brenden O' Brien, who I think, is much more versatile than Brion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worthy","review":"Aimee Mann is talented, but her work on THIS record is disappointing.

It was that bad. Couldn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful remake of a great film","review":"I don't mind remakes, but this is probably the worst one I have ever seen. Turning everything good into a complete mess, destroying every ounce of suspense, not even managing to entertain as a decent Christmas movie!Billy is given a backstory that is disgusting, pointless and hardly entertaining. All the details are presented in such a way that it becomes a dull mess of revolting characters, and the way the story progresses is not mysterious, scary, entertaining, cool or funny.There is nothing to be found in this film. It's as nauseating and sickening as spraying fake snow down your throat for one and a half hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"PATHETIC","review":"What is with this recent need to create back-stories for psychopaths? Am I supposed to be stirred by the poor-pitiful-me exposition? I wasted 90 minutes watching this drivel and don't want to spend much more time even thinking about it, but here's the scoop:* the killings are ridiculous and implausible (the icicle impalement and death by thrown ice skates in particular are howl-worthy and, let's see...IMPOSSIBLE)* characters are lame and of course act in typical \\"bad horror film\\" fashion (although when one loses an eye, the natural response SURELY MUST BE to want to eat all the eyes of your victims) ??!!!??* and are we actually supposed to believe that the killers are body bagged and taken to the morgue with no one ever noticing that THEY'RE NOT REALLY DEAD?!Sometimes bad horror can be good -- alas, this is merely bad horror.

Quit doing remakes and if you do do them,do it right! Do something different or something fresh with it,ok??

It looks as if it was made over the weekend with a blank tape just laying around.Horrible acting to begin with. If you can even call it acting. The scenes were just so pointless that you can't even have proper dialogue.The plot was about a man who lived a horrible childhood and got his own mom pregnant (disgusting and wrong or what?) and then goes into killing people by tearing out their eyes and eating them. His daughter/sister is some pyscho woman who comes out of nowhere to start killing a bunch of sorority girls.The plot was just not elaborated at all. The movie seemed to be jumping all over the place. It was just plain dumb.Given the plot, it could have been average, but with this type of acting and directing, it wasnt even mediocre.I do not recommend it at all. A waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"good slasher","review":"if u like the scream-esque type of horror, beautiful cast, elaborate deaths, creepy moments and brutal killings this movie is for u would like to see this. also the other positive is that the killer gets a back story. the only negatives are that its not that suspenseful if u watch alot of horror, the killer is already known from the beginning of the movie and girls doing very predictable slasher-esque things like trying to open stuck window when she could just smash it open."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT!!","review":"Not much more needs to be said about this one. Simply put, it could have been much, much better. I found the characters and their performances to be mediocre at best. The only reason I am giving this one 2 stars (after debating 1), is for the storyline. Many films nowadays delve straight into the killing, without shedding any light on the circumstances leading up to the present.Sadly enough, the background information and storyline where not enough to save this ship from sinking (fast). So, unless you are a die hard horror flick fan, and like just about any horror released, I suggest you pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating Based On The Worst 45 Minutes Spent Watching Anything","review":"First, all the chicks are attractive but all look the same. I'm sure there is someone out there who knows their names and the films they've been in. That person, however, is not me. Also, this film has some undefinable 'gross' quality to it that makes it just unappealing. Maybe it was the certain sex scene implied about 30 minutes in that kind of finished this movie for me. Stupid dialog, lame delivery of that stupid dialog, no character you care about in even the slightest of ways...the list goes on. And while I really didn't have any clue as to who the killer or killers might have been, and while there might have been some incredible 'surprise' ending, I stopped caring long before I stopped the DVD.

Well one night me and my sister were at the movie store and we decided to rent it just for fun, because we were in the mood for something stupid that would make us laugh, and this movie was the perfect candidate.And while it was certainly funny indeed, about halfway into the movie, I no longer felt myself laughing, and instead I found myself cringing because all I could think was \\"am I seriously watching this?\\"At one point, the killer kills someone by stabbing them with a candy cane.

Bad move. BOOOORINGGGG as the day is long, about as scary as an episode of Home Improvement, suspenseful as an Applebee's commercial. Maybe the ending was good, seeing as I only made it through about 57 minutes before I had to take it out of my DVD player and sent it spinning frisbee-like across the room.

Ho Ho Ho."},{"rating":"1","title":"should not have been remade","review":"The original \\"Black Christmas\\" is a classic horror movie. It's on blu ray now too. It has great actors of a high quality in it like Margot Kidder and Olivia Hussey. This one has a guy dressed up as a woman and it's absurd. It's ok at best if you look at it like a bad b movie. But it used the name and basic plot of a true classic and that's a shame. Get the original \\"black christmas' on blu ray or another edition before you get thisbad b movie version (black x-mas). As a bad b movie this competes with 'Orlock and the invisible man\\" or 'robot monster\\" and others for being inept so it's one of those type of movies. (which are ok in their own way) but not horror classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Christmas is just a goofy gory version","review":"When Bob Clark gave us the original back in the 75 and threw a young Margot Kidder in as a boozing sorority sister who along with the rest are being terrorized by a killer living upstairs in the attic his intentions were to give us a scary movie and not much blood.As a result it worked for the most part.Oh before I forget, Rest in peace Bob Clark.He died at 67 in a head on which also killed his son last week.This version directed by Glen Morgan brings gore and eye balls popping out every chance he gets.Hey there's even a scene where an icicle falls off the roof and pierces through Andrea Martin head.Its laughable! She would of had a better death if she let the killer did it.The acting is so-so but nothing worth noting.They're spoiled girls and very vulgar when they speak.You'll probably do what I did after a while and root for the killer."},{"rating":"1","title":"keep away","review":"I was looking at this mostly because I've enjoyed the actresses in this film's previous work.

Even though its not as good as the original doesn't mean its a bad movie. The plot I think is very good and it develops most of the characters along with the killer. The plot is kind of cookie cutter (sorority girls snowed in on Christmas) but it offers us some intense kills and a chilling settting.The gore in this movie is over the top and if you're into Friday the 13th style deaths then you will deffinettaly enjoy this movie. There arew also some good chase scenes as well as good endning. There are also a ton of special features and deleted scenes on this disk. If your into oldschool slashers then you'll like this one!Movie also offers some really hot girls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gore fest!!!","review":"I liked this movie for the gore and the fear factor. I didn't see the orginal movie, so I am not going to judge it with the orginal. I don't tend to do this anyway because a movie should be judged for itself only. There is one thing that I did take from the orginal though, when I was a kid I do remember that the original was ban in many cities in this area because of the content of the movie. That is what drew me to watch this one. I thought that this movie was a very scarey movie and with alot of gore. It did remind me of Friday the 13th with all of the people being killed. There was a suprise ending that wasn't really expected. This movie is a must for all horror/gore fans. I do highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie was done well and scares you.","review":"I cant say that this film was a oscar winner but in the sense of it being a horror film its a good one.

Should be part of your horror collection. Makes you think about noises in the attic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick to the original","review":"I agree with the sentiment of most reviewers on here. The plot to this movie was simply absurd and while the director did not set out to make a slasher movie, this is simply all he made. For one, you never really care about the sorority members and what happens to them in this movie. Rather than getting backstory on the sorority members to actually care about them, you have a lot of Billy backstory and simply a bunch of foulmouthed sorority sisters that you don't care about.Further, the movie is filled with Billy backstory that simply takes away from what made the original so great. Who was Billy...why did he do what he did? But you can figure out what's going on here from early on, so there's really no great surprise. There are also a bunch of plot holes and killers doing things that are physically impossible. And how many times are two people both erroneously pronounced dead?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I would have given it zero stars....","review":"I would have given this movie zero stars but you have to rate it. This remake is an absolute insult to a classic horror film. Come to think of it, it's and insult to horror movies. Where to start....I wont. I wont waste your time like this movie wasted mine.To sum it up, I'd rather sit through a 24 hour marathon of Richard Gere romance movies than spend 30 seconds watching any of this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this one better........","review":"I have treated this movie as one of my Christmas horror favorites. Just recently watched the original, and it was......ok......but after seeing this one, I just liked this one better. If people thought this one was slow, then DO NOT watch the original, I thought it was slow. Not really sure how people thought this movie was slow.All the characters are somewhat likable, no one really gives a \\"bad\\" performance with the main cast. All of them, eyerolling, wisecracking, screaming, it was great to watch it all unfold. It was like watching \\"Sorority Row\\" at Xmas. Plenty of boo scares in rapid succession. And definitely a great ending. I love those endings where you truly think its over, and poof, you have 15 more good minutes of the movie.I won't sway you either way on this but definitely do yourself a favor and give this one a watch sometime. I have seen many many more remakes that totally sucked worse than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sigh...","review":"The original Black Christmas is one of my all-time favorite movies. The boogieman in the attic remained a fear of mine throughout the 70's after watching this show way too young. Sadly, and perhaps predictably, the remake is just a bunch of overblown violence, really terrible acting, and gore that is just too dumb to be scary.I wish movie makers would get back to psychological, suspenseful thrillers and move away from this trend of mindless blood and guts crap. Today's \\"scary\\" movies give too much away. It's not about continuous slashing and screaming, it's about the creepy music and shadows slithering up behind you.Black Christmas 2006 is perfect for the lazy viewer who can't be bothered with a good storyline or edge-of-the-seat suspense. For that reason, I'm rating it two stars. If you're more mature than that, however, stick with the original. You'll probably hate this remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst","review":"Long a devotee of giallo, horror, hell ALL genres of movies, I looked forward to Morgan and Wong's latest.

The story is really twisted and the kills and special effects are top notch, any slasher fan will really dig this flick, really high body count and the action is unrelenting from start to finish. This is an 80's style slasher with the best elements of modern pacing, special effects and film techniques.

There is no finer performance of these songs that I have come across - many that I enjoy such as Devrath, Te Kanawa, etc - but none that really come even close to this one. It's heavenly, I am always transported to the Auvergne when I listen to it. Incidentally Grey premiered the work with Canteloube. At least one expert says her Auvergnat pronunciation is very authentic.I have the 1950's mono reissue of this and I can tell you that sound-wise it is not great. That said, this transcription of the music makes it much much worse. Sounds like they played the original 78 on someone's pack-and-play and recorded off the speaker. Let's hope EMI decides to try again, this time making a real effort. As much as I love this performance I would have to say avoid this particular recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great singing marred by abysmal production","review":"Madeleine Grey was one of the great voices of the 20th century.

Even though I like the newer versions (1) brighter LED, the legs of newer generation are made with a different type of metal. It seems more flimsy and is probably some sort of aluminum. The 1 LED is very much brighter, since I have both the older and newer versions. I feel the older version does give off a brighter disbursement of light and this can be essential since the area of light is larger.Obviously you buy a flashlight to be bright, but if its only bright in one small area then whats the point in constantly moving the light to see different areas.

I have LED flashlights that are much more powerful. Also, the tripod is nice, but it cant illuminate items BELOW it very well. The head needs to tilt down more. I cant use it on my car engine, for example. It won't shine down enough.Its not bad, per se, but it should simply be better.Update 11/2010: Not really living up to its promise. LED technology is marching on. The brightness of this unit seems to be increasingly disappointing. It hasn't changed, its peer's have. I would say, that its one of those design triumphs that just doesn't age well.Update 3/2012: Downgraded to 2 stars. Brightness has diminished, potentially due to battery leakage. This is perhaps not the unit's fault. Nevertheless, This unit is nearly unusable.

I tried using duct tape to keep them on, but the spring inside and the weight of the batteries quickly causes the tape to fail.

The light is rather weak and didn't provide the coverage I have with the work light from the combo kit.

It seems this unit drains the very bottom batteries disproportionately fast but as I found out the unit will still operate. Actually the unit will operate with only three batteries in one of the legs. Strangely with apparently the same brightness level as with all nine batteries. Then what happens is the bottom battery that drains first will leak corroding and destroying the tube inside the leg. Upon checking the batteries in this unit I found all three of the nine batteries that sit in the bottom of the leg tubes completely dead and the rest still good. Sadly the battery that had been dead the longest leaked destroying the inside of the tube.It was then I realized 3 batteries in one tube will operate the unit"},{"rating":"1","title":"bate and switch","review":"That prety much sums it up.

Could not get the batteries out of those legs and eventually threw the flashlight away. A waste of money. New Energizer batteries were used (9 of them).

Out of curiosity, we put in only three (in one leg) and the light was as bright as with nine. Now i'm assuming it's going to burn out quicker, and we'll have to add three new batteries pretty quick, but such is life.Overall, it seems to me to be a good flashlight, even with only three AA betteries. i would recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, poor execution","review":"The tripod design is a great idea. The frame is also well constructed, and has quality feel.However, they must have sourced some lousy/cheap LED.

Probably for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer version is better and cheaper","review":"The original Stanley Tripod Flashlight (model 95-112) has six weak LEDs. In 2008, the model was replaced with one having a single bright LED and the same model number. The new one lists at only $10 and sells for less. I compared them against each other. The construction is similar but the light from the new one is much more intense and useful. I don't know why they kept the same model number but the six LED one is on clearance at most stores. Look for the one LED - it is marked on the box. And shop around - you'll be surprised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Stanley's Standards","review":"This is NO $30 flashlight. Cheap on/off switch either doesn't change the brightness or turns it off when you want it brighter. AA batteries are stored in the legs with very flimsy screw feet to hold them in. If you twisted too hard it would probably strip the plastic threads. Adjustable aiming beam has light detent stops.Overall, I would not buy this item again.

Definitely not a professional grade tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea is good construction pathetic","review":"I received this for Father's Day and was very excited because I could see where the tripod would come in very handy. Unfortunately the construction is incredibly shoddy. After only a week the catch to hold the legs in is non-existent so the legs just flop open if you don't hold them closed. One of the legs won't stay in so I have to keep pushing it in. It wasn't dropped or mistreated, it's just crappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caps that hold batteries in legs are cheap","review":"Its a good design.It could be improved upon.I had mine about 1 month when one of the caps that hold the batteries in the leg came off.The threads are cheap.About a month later another came off.If the legs were threaded and it had a metal cap to screw on, it would be much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"A lot of reviewers are critical of the brightness, but I my complaint is with the mechanism that extends the legs for tripod mode.

My estimation is that it's overpriced at $20+."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent design and nicest LED color temp I've seen - should be all metal, though","review":"This is a very nice piece of equipment for the do-it-yourselfer or camper. The batteries in the tripod legs are a brilliant piece of design, and the overall functionality of the moving head is very nice. What really sets this light apart from other, cheaper LED lights is the quality of the lens, which focuses all 9 LEDs into a single circle of light; this beam is the closest I've seen to a traditional flashlight beam a-la MagLight, and has very little of the annoying LED blue-ness to it. Note that you can't change the focus on this light, but that's alright, as the beam they've engineered is a good all-around one.Long-term durability is my only concern, as this light has a plastic head and hinge parts for the tripod legs. If this were available in an all-metal design, it would be a hands-down 5-star item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floppy head","review":"I got this for my husband who works in tight spaces.

The tripod can be deployed with a push of a button, one-handed.However, it is not indestructable and certainly not for major construction jobs. Also, it is not nearly as bright as it could be.

It is very prone to accidental activation. I had to tape a plastic cover over the on/off switch to keep it from turning itself on while rolling around in my car's trunk. The head doesn't stay in the position I set it. It uses way too many batteries for the amount of light it throws.Instead of getting this tripod light, buy a Petzl headlamp. Here's why - I had to change a flat tire in a dark parking lot. My body was always between the wheel and the tripod light. I ended up holding a pocket flashlight between my teeth, so I could see what i was doing.

I find the brightness settings very useful, so I wanted to get another one. But when I received the one I ordered last week it has a single LED, not six, and no brightness settings.

I always had to use mine on the max setting). However, I was cleaning my garage yesterday and went to wipe off my work bench, only to find that two of the legs had battery acid on them. Two of the Duracell batteries had leaked through the aluminum and eaten away at the unit. I tried to remove the batteries, but they were stuck solid. I could see one battery leaking and blaming the battery company, but two batteries, in two separate legs? There's something bigger going on with this thing. IMHO, it's not worth the cost of the light, and the 9 batteries, when the light output is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I purchased this product as a christmas gift so I went to put batteries in it before I wrapped it.

However, the knob just falls out and its clearly not attached to the spring-loaded piece at the joint of the legs. Have to pry your finger into the tiny space and push the piece up manually. Even still, the legs don't stay in the central piece so it never securely closes. The concept would be great if it would only work. Stanley customer service was not available.

Only ran it on 3 batteries which worked almost like having the lights on. Batteries didn't even wear out after several hours. Light is LED so it is brighter than your traditional flashlight.

The microscope fails to produce a sharp image on any of the three settings. The focusing knob's best result is lost once you let go of the knob and that \\"best result\\" is awful to begin with.

I'm clearing out his room for a garage sale and I even hesitate selling it to someone else. The main problem is that you can not get it to focus. You twist up, you twist down... up, down, up, down. Just when you think you have it in focus and take your hands off the knob, it slips out of focus again. At the higher magnifications you can't see anything but a blur no matter how much you turn the knob. The viewer on the front is useless as well as you can only see a blur.

The tiles slide easily, and the table cloth is very plush. I not only ordered one for myself, but ended up ordering FOUR more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Lovin' This Series!","review":"Great read!! I am in love with the characters and have already purchased the second one(\\"The Ghost and the Dead Deb\\")...The stories are very similar to the ones in Cleo Coyle books, except they are in a bookstore, and of course, there is a ghost involved...either way, it was a great murder mystery with some humor thrown in!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing!","review":"I am obviously not in the majority here as I thought this book pretty bad. I enjoy cozy mysteries but they still have to be well written and hopefully imaginative. This ghost sleuth was ridiculously generic. Anytime I thought \\"oh, yeh, ok, this is cute\\" it soon wasn't. Won't read any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of paper","review":"I had read other reviews of this and was looking forward to reading it. Unfortunately, this book did not live up to expectations. The characters were not very likable. The voice of the Ghost in the title, a film noir rendition of a 40's hard-boiled PI, was overdone and did not ring true. Much of the pulp fiction of that era was better written. Here's a note for all authors: read your work aloud and if the dialog sounds stilted and unnatural to you, then it will to your readers as well.I had to give up half way through this book, as the plot was very slowly paced, the characters seemed one dimensional and not very likable, the murderer was obvious, and the way the victim was drawn, there should have been at least a dozen people who would have been viable suspects without involving the heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"What a waste of time. The plot was full of cliches, the perps were telegraphed from the beginning and why try to explain the unexplainable.If you still want to read it, check with the library - don't spend money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for old women with cats","review":"Clever idea that falls flat on it's face.Sickly sweet, no character development, and solutions tied up with a neat lace bow.Disappointing - the idea of a ghost as a partner in crime solving and sleuthing has such potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"One of my favorite movies is the Ghost and Mrs. Muir, so needless to say the title - The Ghost and Mrs. McClure caught my attention. I read this in one day. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I'd like to see how the author handles future books with these characters. I was glad to see at the end of the book the notice that her next book in the series comes in December 2004. Something to definitely look forward to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bookshop haunting","review":"What a fun read! Widow Penelope McClure co-owns a bookshop in Rhode Island with her elderly Aunt. Over fifty years ago a hard-boiled detective, Jack Shepard was murdered in the bookshop and has been haunting the premises ever since. When Timothy Brennen, author of the Jack Shield mysteries based on our resident ghost, dies in the midst of his talk, Pen is one of the murder suspects.Pen must cope with a ghost who speaks only to her, her husband's suicide, wealthy in-laws who want her seven-year-old son, and a business that is teetering on financial disaster. The plot is tight, supporting characters wacky, and the literary mentions make this a satfisfying read. If you are a fan of The Ghost and Mrs. Muir, try this one. And in December the second in The Haunted Bookshop Mysteries will be published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean, ghostly fun!","review":"I really liked this book, not because it was the best mystery I have ever read, or it was the most exciting book in the world. I liked this book because it was just plain fun. It didn't require alot of thought, it is short and to the point. It is filled with humour, action, suspense and it does all this without vulgar language, guts all over the floor, and everyone sleeping with everyone else. This book could be read by young and old alike and everyone in between.The plot is good, the idea is fresh and different from the usual mystery novel. The mental conversations between the main character and the ghost are great. I can't wait for the next installment of this series to see how the relationship between these two blossoms. Share this book with a friend or relative. The townsfolk remind me of a small mid-western town I grew up in where everyone knows everyone else's business and everyone has an opinion. This is a refreshing book, I hope you enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HEROINE NEEDS A BACKBONE---","review":"My biggest beef with this series is that the heroine really needs to grow some backbone. She was a total doormat, avoiding any and all confrontations and constantly wringing her hands. I did like the fact that she was able to laugh at herself when she had her goofy moments. The story itself is a little on the lame side, but likable enough to read the next in series. I liked the idea of the private investigator ghost and the cases from his past that are interwoven throughout the story as they are actually the more interesting part...And what \\"dame\\" worth her salt wouldn't like a sexy old-fashion private eye for a guardian angel? (Even if the 1940's slang gets to be a bit much.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"While I appear to be odd-person-out, as it were, I did not find this to be a very enjoyable book. The writing style was boring and with the exception of Penelope, the other characters were really irritating. I kept picking it back up, wanting to like it but couldn't. I do realize that many others liked it but wanted to give voice to those (including 3 others I heard in the bookstore) who didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cozy Mystery with a Twist","review":"I am a fan of the Coffee House series by Cleo Coyle and was introduced to this book from the author's [...] website.

I enjoyed this first book in the series. It's a cozy mystery with likable characters and I look forward to the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Prologue","review":"I just wanted to say that the Prologue to The Ghost and Mrs. McClure absolutely took my breath away.

However, the author covered many various options and technologies used in enterprise application integration. Some of the approaches included were JCA, Web Services, and JMS, but as I said before, lacked in examples.The book however, does provide good references to resources that I found useful for accomplishing the task of EAI. The author even covers some Open Source projects that proved to be interesting.I would only recommend this book to those just beginning EAI and have a firm grasp on the Java language.

The book starts off by defining metaphors and how by using metaphors to describe a situation we can focus on how we look at an issue but by so doing ignore other aspects that are not in the metaphor.My disappointment with the book is that of the six viewpoints that he expresses I am not convinced that any of them are now metaphors that people who work and manage organizations actually use to me they are just a convenient way to categorize management theory.Ch 2 Organizations as MachinesCH 3: Organizations as OrganismsCH 4: Organizations as BrainsCH 5: Organizations as CulturesCH 6: Organizations as Political SystemsCH 7: Organizations as Psychic PrisonsThe book is also dated - he talks a lot about the success of the Japanese model, and its inroads to the US in the 90's but who talks about the Japanese model today.An expensive book and a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd for the whole family","review":"I bought this item for my family to watch together and we all enjoyed it!

In this DVD they are performing a concert together.You will find the type of comedy that has made them as popular in the Christian comedy circle as they are today from Bob's shadow puppets to Ken's talking about what getting old and growing old with his family is like.

It still works at the moment, but once grease is gone its days are numbered. This is by far the least amount of use I have ever gotten out of a head.Other than that it is a bit heavy for the specs.

I loved it then, and I have loved it every time since then that I have reread it. Great literature? Probably not in the way other great literature is judged, but the character of John Carter remains, to me, the ultimate fictional hero, the one to solve all the problems when the chips were down, the one friend who could always be depended upon.

It is neither comprehensive nor balanced. Rather, its a dry re-run of historical sitings, peppered with a lot of information on fantasy prone personality syndrome. For people intrested in alien contacts, UFO history, and other unsolved mysteries, this will truly fail to satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concepts that don't follow through","review":"While the theoretical physics and computers in this book are true to life, the plot and characters seem to fall a little short.All of the action takes place in the author's home town, the main character is a picture of who the author seems to want to be, and the female lead is a cartoon of a woman who seems to have no desires or second thoughts outside of the protagonist.While the quantum nature of the story is a little heavy-handed, it seems to stick together for the most of the book, but some of the plot twists smack of the fabled 'plot hole' of D&D; fame. At one point, one of the characters disappears to return with just the right tools to solve the crisis and only a cursory explanation of how he got them.Later works by this author may be much better; there is some promise, but in the end the book falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are the ones I used to watch over and over and over ag","review":"All three of these dvds are better then the two movies.

The three dvd's are also sold seperatly, but this is a better deal. If you like the Care Bears, or have or know a child who adores them then this would be a perfect gift. It's probably also better for parents who don't want to sit through over an hour of a cartoon movie, becuase you could just watch one or two stories, unless you want to watch ah hour, but then you could just watch the dvd in it's entirity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that Good!","review":"When it had came out i couldn't wait to buy them but after i watch it.

I would call the work less \\"political poetry\\" than \\"poetry of human relationships that have a political context\\".

If you have a ground loop that's buzzing, you have to take the turntable apart and find a place to connect a ground wire to it. Bad design. Also, even though there is a speed control and strobe built in, I can't get the platter to go slow enough to zero out the strobe. AMAZING!

This is unacceptable and the second time it has happened through Amazon. Incidentally, I bought this directly from Amazon and not a private retailer through Amazon. So the moral of the story seems to be not to buy electronics from Amazon.Shipping: The player arrived a day early but with minimal protection in a banged-up box.I am returning my turntable tomorrow and will buy another one from a more trustworthy retailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous customer service by Amazon","review":"So this is a product review, and a seller review.

Xmas gift ruined. We went on vacation the day after Christmas. Upon returning two weeks ago, we opened the record player, plugged it in, and voila...it doesn't spin. The internal motor is broken. I've done everything I can reasonably do to test this unit. But sInce I bought this in early December, we are outside of the return window. Amazon does not want to help us. The item is junk.

This turntable has everything the new guy needs. The only downside is you need to manually adjust the speed based on power input frequency (50 or 60 hertz). But for the price this thing sounds great and has worked flawlessly. And you can't go wrong with the Pioneer name IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase","review":"I don't consider myself an audiophile. However I am very pleased with the turntable, and the quality that a Pioneer product usually has. Assembly could be a little daunting for the electronically challenged, but the instructions on the minimal assembly requirements were fairly explicit. As far as the sound quality the table affords to the listener.....to me, it is great! It is going to be wonderful to share some music with my nieces, that they won't get to hear, unless it is on CD. If you have 33 1/3 albums, it's a great price for a decent piece of audio equipment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I'm REALLY pleased with this turntable - I love that it is fully automatic.One thing to be aware of is that it has a built-in preamp, so you can't connect it to the phono inputs on your tuner/amp.

I bought it so that I could listen to the 30th anniversary edition of Dark Side Of The Moon on vinyl and the sound quality is very clear, spacious, and potent connected to my Sony LBT-ZX66i HiFi stereo system. The only thing I found strange about it is that I can't connect it to the Phono jacks ( I have mine connected to the Game input jacks) on my system but nonetheless for me that's hardly an issue.

Depending on your configuration, you may need something like this to complete your set-up:Cables To Go - 03179 - 3.5mm Stereo Male To 2 RCA Female Y-Cable (Black)The turntable looks great, works flawlessly, and sounds terrific. I've slowly been filling holes in my CD collection with used vinyl records that I've purchased on ebay, at antique stores and records stores. I've twenty-nine records so far and none of them have skipped on the PL-990. I also have one 180 gram vinyl record, AC/DC High Voltage. I bought it brand new, cleaned it before playing it, and it sounds great. I highly recommend cleaning your records before playing them.Bottom Line: After owning this player for one year, I'm still very happy with this turntable, and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pioneer Turntable PL 990","review":"As others have said, I would prefer the turntable not have amp/equalizer built in. It is very easy to set up and works great. I plug it into the aux on a 1980 1980 Pionner SX-780 and my albums sound great. My other issue is that there does not seem to be any way to secure the arm when not in use. I have got in the habit of putting the plastic needle guard in place when I am done playing. It appears the arm stand is grooved for some type of retaining clip, but I cannot find one in the packaging, so I assume there is no such thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I liked it.

I only found the ONE (there should have been more) Coffee Talk sketch and the two Wayne's World sketches funny. Mike had several other more memorable sketches than those included in this release. In many of the sketches the SNL audience was >barely< laughing. SNL should have picked sketches where the audience was roiling. The Adam Sandler and Dana Carvey releases have been FAR superior. So in closing, if you never caught Linda Richman or Wayne's World on tape then stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Watch, Even With the Need of Edits","review":"Saturday Night Live's \\"The Best of Mike Myers\\" is definitely on my list of tapes I can watch over and over again. I was disappointed with the choice some of the sketches, such as \\"Lothar of the Hill People,\\" but I am a hardcore SNL fan in general, so it was not too much of a blow for me. I actually appreciated how the tape included some of his lesser known skits, such as \\"Middle Age Man.\\" I did not find these sketches absolutely hilarious, but I chuckled as I learned more of Myers SNL career. Last, but not least, I was also disappointed with the fact that his classic sketches were used a little too sparingly. At least \\"Dieter's Dream\\" was on the tape. \\"Touch my monkey!!! Touch him! Love him!\\" I just love that! In conclusion, I believe that even with the few disappointments, all Mike Myers' fan should add this to their video collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not his best","review":"I agree with other reviewers who said this \\"Best of\\" video does not begin to include Myers' best stuff from SNL. Some of the editing choices are downright inexplicable.For example, one of Myers' funniest impersonations is of Ronnie Wood, which he did just three times on SNL. The first sketch was by far the best -- hysterical -- while the other two were pretty much forgettable. So what are we given on this video? You guessed it -- not the first.The exact same thing is true for Sprockets, Coffee Talk and most of his other classic characters and sketches.This video is very disappointing and is a perfect example of why NBC/Broadway Video should make COMPLETE SNL EPISODES (if not complete seasons) available for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, to be a kid again...","review":"So with the launch of the new 90210 I decided to kick it old school and rewatch season 1. And remember why it's infinitely better than the tripe they're calling TV these days.In season 1, the Cindy and Jim Walsh move from Minnesota to Beverly Hills, enrolling their twins, Brenda and Brandon, at West Beverly High. Life in Beverly Hills is full of trials and tribulations that the Walsh family has no experience with, including teenage drug use, rape, shoplifting, and racial tension. Oh my! Watching this season is like taking a trip back to the 90s on the oh-so-awesome train. I'd almost forgot how tragically hip teenagers were in 1990. The outfits themselves are worth the cost of these discs. Watch season 1 of 90210 when you're in the mood for a laugh and a blast from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great DVD!!!","review":"This dvd was great!

I think that its criminal for paramount to sell them this way. I know this because I have all of the episodes recorded on tape and I compared them scene for scene. The DVDs are totally incomplete. I will never buy another season. Some of the episodes are missing scenes that help make the whole show to make sense. These dvds make me not want to buy any show on DVD ever again.

The recording is extremely detailed and sounds incredibly natural in SACD multi-channel sound (3 channels [Front Left-Center-Front Right] in this case). It's as if I was seated at the conductor's podium. If I had to say something negative about it, I would have to say there could be just a little more hall ambiance (reverberation).

But if you want to print something for business purposes, to submit or give someone else, job applications, you wouldn't want this one. You need something at least 28 lbs in that case.But using heavy paper for daily printing is not really environmental friendly. That's why i prefer light weight ones.

And it is repeated over and over again that the company contact information is not accessible. I did notice when we opened the package there was no instructions or information sheet as comes with most toys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different tune.","review":"If you were aware in the '60s and espeically into the popular folk songs this CD might be for you. Juliane sings many of the favorites from that era in German. Bob Dylan's \\"Blowing in the Wind\\", \\"Where Have All the Flowers Gone\\", \\"The Day They Drove Ole Dixie Down\\", and others plus several German folks songs from the same time period. Juliane has a more earthy voice than Joan Baez without the high note trills, but it will get you moving. Definitely a pleasant alternate look. A world of caution. Some of the tunes are well known, but have entirely different verse sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Collection - You MUST Buy This CD!","review":"I must have listened to this CD a dozen times the first day I got it. The entire CD is an amazing collection of African music, an outstanding introduction for newcomers to music of this continent. \\"Into Africa\\", \\"Drive\\", \\"Soundiata\\", and \\"Sou\\" have such powerful rhythms, they will not leave you. And the musicians are superstars: Angelique Kidjo, Boubacar Traore, Ali Farka Toure and Hamza El Din. I only wish that \\"Into Africa\\" were four minutes longer, and that there were some tracks from Salif Keita or Geoffrey Oryema, my personal favorites. Definitely buy this album, and fall in love with the music of Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soothing !","review":"I accidently came across this CD in a local library. This was my first exposure to African music and since then I have gotten hooked up to the genre.The tracks are soothing and brings me back to basics.If you like graceland by Paul Simon you will not be disappointed by the CD tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you think this one's good...","review":"I like the artists and the selections on this soundtrack to the PBS series, if only Mr. Gates would have shut his mouth when he was there. I rated it 4**** because of his stupidity and believe that you, the buyer, should support the artists on this soundtrack and buy their albums, all of which are excellent. Jeffrey Oreyema, Salif Keita, Ali Farka Toure are my personal favorites. Africa is a beautiful place with great musicians, all of which do not need to be watered down with insipid questions by a man who thought he knew all about Africa before he got there.

This one, however, was very slow. I was over half way through it before it started to \\"pick up\\" and spark my interest. The ending is triumphant so it wasn't a total waste. It's an easy read. Classic Hannah character development. Overall, ok. Not her best."},{"rating":"1","title":"once in every life book review","review":"This is one of the worst book I have ever read.

I am not a prude and most of the books I read do have some offensive language in them.But this book \\"Once In Every Life\\" was filled with profanity, and especially the use of God, Jesus, and Christ in conjunction with swearing. Far more than was necessary to get the author's point across. I am disappointed as I ordered three of her books at the same time and I am hoping they are more like the first book but afraid they will be like this one.Ms. Hannah ruined a beautiful story by using too many pages for swear words. Just one reader's humble opinion....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once in Every Life","review":"Having read 'On Mystic Lake', I turned to another of K. Hannah's novels. What a grave disappointment.

Why, then, does she turn into the epitome of a prarie wife with no greater pleasure than learning to master cooking on a wood-burning stove? The hero's 12 year old daughter was doing the cooking before....how could a woman who is educated and intelligent be content in a cabin with no books, no intellectual life whatsoever and no one to really converse with? How could she possibly be happy doing chores a 12 year old child can do????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time-travel romance!","review":"Kristin Hannah does a marvelous job of maintaining the main character's (Tess') modern sensibilities when she suddenly finds herself on a rural island off the coast of Washington State in the 1870's. Suddenly, she needs to accustom herself to a new identity,and to life without microwaves and washing machines.Kristin Hannah does a wonderful job (always) of showing us the psychological scars of the characters, and showing how gentleness, honesty, and caring can overcome them. In this case, Tess' (Amarylis') husband and daughters need to overcome extreme psychological trauma, and Tess needs to work hard for the love she's always done without.Romances are usually only good for one read, but I've reread this book several times (whenever I need a good cry)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A concise look at the driving force in American politics.","review":"Mayhew's book is probably the one that I remember best from graduate school. There's a reason for this: as a political professional I work each day in the context and with the forces that he so concisely describes.I recommend this book highly both to students American politics and to my colleagues in Washington and in state capitals who are anxious to gain insights that will be useful to them in their efforts to influence and muck up the legislative process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reelection matters, but so does policy","review":"Although the review of the book by the gentleman below certainly delves into some of the major issues that Mayhew offers in this classic poltical science text, he ignores one of the major points of the book: Mayhew's point that legislators are constantly seeking reelection, that it drives them, is mitigated by his belief that the *reason* they are seeking reelection is so that they can pursue particular goals -- policy or otherwise. Reelection does drive them, but is only a MEANS, not an end. Impact on national, state or local policy -- or other political goals -- is the reason they continue to work diligently to be reelected. After all, they can't enact legislation if they aren't members of the body in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"Unfortunately this was poorly filmed. The background noise is icky. Also, I was hoping for some kind of demonstration...Nothing like that.

I'm sure there are far higher quality ballheads, but this has an excellent fit and finish. I used to use it with my D70, and now use it regularly with a Nikon D7000 and the Nikon 18-70 lens. No slippage, and it's never once flopped over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have and independent Panning Lock","review":"Good head, good cost to value relationship. However the description says it has an independent Panning lock. Nope .. it does not the MH-1002 does ... but this baby doesn't. I question the 8.8lbs ... from my experience it's more like 5 lbs. That said ... if the description was accurate I'd have no complaints. If you expecting the lock and capacity ... better look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant history for non-readers.","review":"Another Konemann bargain (how do they manage to produce such lovely books at the price?) with 832 pages, many of them with more than one photo, all the main events in the Nation's history instantly available with a picture and caption (and index). History in the broadest sense too, plenty of people and events from the everyday world. As the text is mostly captions don't expect any great historical insight though.I think this would be an ideal book for children, rather than a textbook with a few photos why not start with lots of photos to inspire their curiosity about an event or personality and then let them read about it in other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect organizer for pregnancy through age 5!","review":"I received one of these planners for my first baby and loved it! I now purchase it for all my friends who are having babies, it has a space for everything. I like that it's a very organized way to cherish all those early memories. There is even a pocket in the back for extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"This book is fantastic except that it devotes too many preprescribed pages to things like pregnancy and health and not enough to what your baby may have been up to. For example, the first almost 50 pages are devoted specifically to pregnancy and planning for baby. Six of those pages are for the brands and colors of items that you may have picked for your baby's nursery. In contrast, each of the baby's years gets about 10 pages. I didn't even get the book until almost my due date, so you see my plight.That being said, the graphics are adorable and we are enjoying the book. It's ALMOST exactly what I was looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great USB Hard Drive","review":"This is a great portable hard drive. I use it to backup my desktop hard drive.

My own children will enjoy my dog-eared copy. This is a fun and engaging basic science book with many subjects and information from worms to astronomy to yeast. It also has practical and fun experiments to reinforce what is being taught. I remember growing rock candy crystals, bending light through water, and watching the different meteor showers come through during the year to name a few. This is very appropriate for elementary kids up through junior high. It's also just a fun read. I never considered the fact that I was learning and in fact it was just one of my favorite books. Great one to have around."},{"rating":"1","title":"iowa ring","review":"This ring I wouldn't recommend, because it tarnish's which I purchased for my husband for a birthday gift.

Edge of Sanity's cover of Mother (Danzig, not Pink Floyd) is good, and I like Bathory's cover of Sabbath's War Pigs. Dan Swano's second appearance after Edge of Sanity (as Nightingale) is well done. He does a great job with C'est la Vie. (The track listing above says it's Greg Lake, but it's not). However, most all the vocals on this cd are clean, so if you're looking for something black and heavy, this isn't it.

It was skipping and actually stopped playing where the DVD player said 'Cannot read disk' a couple of times. The quality is also horrible!!

If you want it to perform the tasks that it is supposed to do (i.e. move around), don't buy this toy. I bought this for my son's 4th birthday. He loves any construction vehicle, so that is a plus. The bummer is that this toy does NOT move/drive like it is supposed to, on any surface. What it lacks in movement, it sure makes up for with VERY loud noises (no volume control).If you do buy this toy, invest in some ear plugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"mommy of a boy","review":"One of the worst buys ever. What a disapointment. My husband is in construction, so when my son saw this at the store, he was excited so I got it. First day within a couple of hours, some of the buttons on the remote broke. So, I went back to Toysrus and they replaced it. I brought the second one home and the thing doesn't even move!! Not on carpet, or my hardwood floor. It just vibrates. It's cheap, cheap, cheap.

I did not see any reviews before I bought this at ToyRus. It is cheap and weak. My 4 year old son can move cereal around on our hardwood floors but that's about it, no carpet or outside at all.

Unfortunately I read it while I am preparing and cooking. This tends to get things rather messy for me. This has been exactly what I needed. The only thing I needed that seemed to be missing was a lesson on what kind of equipment I should purchase to replace my 8 year old junk BBQ which was the only thing I could afford at the time. I realized, I didn't need that information. Any place selling these BBQs would be happy to spend time with me and go over all the differences. So, the book was perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best BBQ books I own","review":"This is one of the most down to earth BBQ cookbooks around .Ray does not bore you with irrelevant fluff but instead devotes the whole book to simple and easy to follow bbq recipes.Plus he is a real cook ..not just someone writing about it. This is an excellent book for someone who wants to start cooking authentic bbq as well as experienced bbq cooks who want to experiment with different methods. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for the average person","review":"This book has tons of recipes so everyone should find something they like.

It goes through all the SOUNDS of Vietnamese, which is critical in a tonal language. (other languages such as Spanish allow a lot of leeway for poor pronunciation; not so Vietnamese) The essential beginning phrases are here, as well as good basic vocabulary. Repeated playing of tapes, with a fair amount of rewinding is what is needed in using this course, more so than in a course like the Pimsleurs, which have a lot of repetition built-in.While the Pimsleur courses have what I consider to be a better approach to language instruction, you definitely get a lot of bang for your buck out of this 2-tape course and since Pimsleur has a very limited Vietnamese offering, I consider this mini-course an essential for the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"This product is the one I recommend to the beginner.","review":"This product consists of two CDs and a small phrase book. The phrases are short but practical in everyday life. The CDs show clear pronunciation and intonation by native (northern) speakers. A phrase is spoken in English followed by in Vietnamese twice, and then there is a short pause for you to repeat after.If you master all of the phrases in the book, which is not difficult to do, it will be the most useful basis for your Vietnamese learning. You can build more of your Vietnamese language skills with other products such as Beginner's Vietnamese by Robert M. Quinn.I have several Vietnamese language learning products (plus a Vietnamese husband who speaks tieng Viet). This product is the one I recommend to the beginner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good product","review":"I own this and Pimsleur Quick and simple Vietnamese. This is much better than Pimsleur.

The so-called \\"Delaware\\" or \\"Lenape\\" text is a patchwork of words culled from early Moravian missionary sources, strung together without regard for grammar or semantic structure. It's a transparent fraud. The so-called \\"pictographs\\" are, likewise, a fabrication of Rafinesque. The eminent scholar of Delaware culture and language, Dr. David Oestreicher, in his lengthy doctoral dissertation, has completely demolished any flicker of a notion that this work has any legitimacy, whatsoever. It was ever unknown to the Delaware Tribe of Indians, now headquartered in Bartlesville, OK; and their council has summarily dismissed it. Every resurrection of this work, as an \\"authentic\\" production of the Lenape Indians, constitutes another hoax perpetrated on an unsuspecting public--even if done unintentionally.

Though the bracketed english is a bit confusing at times, the play itself is easy to get involved in. It is based around the mystery of who painted a mystery fresco inside of a small church. As the mystery unfolds, so do the characters. The plot keeps the reader inthraled and wondering who will be the greedy one. I recommend this book to all theater majors because of its use of structure and role reversals.

I mean, it's fine the first time you play it, when you're all lost, but it gets really tiring and frustrating after that.

It has brought me back to a simpler time which sometimes you need in this complicated world. It's fun to watch how the show progresses even techniqually with each season. Lets face it, they just don't write shows like these anymore! Especially good to watch during the summer months when there are only repeats on anyway. the only criticism I would have is the that the editing was sloppy in some of the shows, but you might not really notice it and it didn't take away from enjoying them. If you are an MTM fan than you'll love these DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK FOR CHILDREN!","review":"I think this book has a great story line. Goldlocks is all grownup and now is a police officer and is searching for a missing bear. This book is so different than alot of books on the market today. The author takes an old story and made a new one out of it. Today authors try to come up with new ideas but Alan Osmond chose to take one that was alreay there, expand on it and make it have a new twist to it. The book also has great illustration and color. I think any child would like to hear new bedtime stories for a change and this one is definietly new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a beginning","review":"Our parent education book group agrees that advice-giving to parents has been complex and inconsistent. However, identifying an \\"odd couple\\" (experts who give contradictory advice) for each period of the century is arbitrary, contrived, misleading and inappropriate. Hulbert mentions that she selected advice givers who had spoken at national conferences. Otherwise, she give us little information about her biases or about the criteria she used to select individuals highlighted. Why did she choose L. Emmett Holt (not a well-known individual) and G. Stanley Hall (who focused primarily on adolescents)? The protaganist format meant that in the recent years, advice-giving \\"giants\\" such asThomas Gordon, Hiam Ginott, Jean Piaget, B.F. Skinner, Erik Erikson, and Rudolph Dreikurs barely receive mention. A history book on parent advice IS needed, not only for scholars, but also for parents to understand their own upbringing. This book barely begins to fill the need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raising America","review":"As parents, we have all been told how to feed an infant; how to ensure he or she sleeps; how to discipline a toddler; and how to talk with and listen to our children.

She writes with a wise, graceful and truly humorous pen -- a pleasure to read.At the risk of offering one more bit of \\"advice\\" -- after a century inundated with it -- I recommend that you put aside for a while Spock, Brazelton, Leach, and Greenspan and settle down with Raising America for a thought-provoking, rich and thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Show!","review":"One disc had some problems playing but overall not too bad.

This is not the case. Upon opening the bottle I started gagging over the awful smell. It did not smell like chemicals like you would think. It smelled like cow manure or something along those lines...a toilet maybe. Not only did I have to deal with the smell for 15 minutes it was still there after using shampoo. It also did not straighten my hair at all. I ended up using the electric hair straightener in the morning.

There is no included AC adaptor and the (practically useless) manual included with it does not tell you what type of AC adaptor you need to use with it. The CDs skip when doing anything other than walking gently (even in the No Skip mode) - I don't jog, but have tried using it doing yardwork (blowing leaves, raking grass, mowing).

For under $150, there are some outstanding portable players. But that's all they are. High-quality portable players; not audiophile sound gear. With the $400 Bose headphones, which are precise but not especially musical, try a high-end tube headphone amplifier. Once you hear what is really on the CD, and what the earphones can do, you'll be in the market for a high-end tube CD player in the $500 to $1000 range. Just because it's \\"Bose\\" doesn't mean it's worth any more than a good Sony or Panasonic walkman. And Bose disowned and discontinued this CD Player very quickly.

I had horrible PMS-headaches, mood swings, irritability, bloating, anxiety, depression. With the other brands I used (Pharmacist's Ultimate Health and Source Naturals), I did not feel this miserable.

I had very high expectations with this camera but now I' am not entirely pleased with its performance. The pictures are excellent during daylight or outdoor conditions, but in low light or indoor conditions picture quality is not upto the mark. The zoom is good but when you take pictures of long distance scenes, they appear hazy and blurred. The red-eye reduction mode also does not help much. During Video mode their is lots of Camera noise that is also recorded with the video. It gives an impression that recording was done near a seashore.

This one doesn't advance just one picture but goes back to the beginning or if you want to delete it skips back to the beginning again. The \\"scan\\" offerings are great, if you can get the advance button to click onto the correct icon--again it skips all around and won't place itself where I want it to do so. I can't tell if it is super sensitive or just the way that it works. This is especially frustrating when you are trying to \\"review\\" pictures.On the other hand, the cropping and enhancement right on the camera menu are great and do a tremendous job.Hopefully the museum setting will work well.

I spent more time dealing with the camera than watching my boys. People kept turning and looking at me when I took a picture(it was the green light). All of my pictures had horriable red eye.

I bought it because I was going on vacation and finally needed one. My requirements were: speed (for when I'm taking pictures from a tour bus window), use of rechargeable (not proprietary) AA batteries and more than 3X optical zoom, on a small automatic (not SLR) camera. I need only 4X6 pictures for scrapbooking, so I set it to 3.1 megapixels, but didn't change any other settings. It takes pictures quickly (unlike my friend's camera, where you have to hold the button for 5 seconds or more), but there is quite a lag until I can take a second picture. I don't know if this is normal, since I don't have much experience with digital cameras. It has 21 \\"scene modes\\", of which I had the occasion to use quite a few (especially flowers, landscape and night landscape) and I was pleased with all of them.

It plays dead for ten, twenty minutes even, and then all of a sudden, when your photo-op is gone, it turns back on. We missed sooo many pic of the kids during our trip because this camera couldn't seem to make up its mind. And new batteried didn't help. Finally, on our last day at Disney, I turned on the camera to discover that somehow ALL of the 275+ pictures I had taken had somehow deleted!!! I was devestated!

However, THE POWER CONSUMPTION IS AWFUL! I've never before had a device that was so inefficient with battery usage and would require so many recharges or new batteries. I think I've replaced the batteries 4 times before I've filled up the memory card. I've nearly thrown this camera out the window various times because the batteries cut out at important (and priceless) times. I'm selling it to get a Canon.

This book showed me that people with those \\"anything goes\\" attitudes need to maintain some sort of self-control before things get too out-of-hand.

In their best element, each member shines and are at their best musically...and are a must see!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgia rules!","review":"The originals are recordings from the mid 50's through mid 60's. To those of us 'of a certain age' they have been around seemingly forever and many have even been revered since their first release. There is a certain 'lilt' to these that really isn't achieved elsewhere. Kunzel and the Rochester Pops come close while Abravanel and the Utah forces dutifully play all the notes. The CD transfer is up to it's usual high standards (higher than some of the standards for the presssings on the originals); but it's the 3 channel SACD that is really impressive. If you have the capability, I highly recommend most any of the Mercury Living Presence or RCA Living Stereo SACD's. This one in particular will have you dancing and feeling like the \\"Belle of the Ball\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"MONOTONE MEETS DRAB","review":"I was really digging a song called \\"been so long\\" but thats Cric's only good song every other song is monotone and drab, I feel like Im at a funeral for someone I didnt like and cant wait to go home!

I dislike roma-ji, and I'd prefer to see Kana in their place. This book has examples sentences in Japanese(using Kanji) follow by roma-ji, and then an English translation. I am assuming it is this way because the book is geared towards beginners, but it is still very useful for intermediate level students. The only other problem is that it doesn't teach you about compound verbs.I think most people will be happy with this book. The power Japanese series is a good series, even if they do use roma-ji."},{"rating":"2","title":"Q.

The tracks sound terrible. The volume was jacked up way to high and the low frequencies are overwelming. If your looking for the extended version of goodbye horses, I recommend getting it either on the clerks 2 soundtrack(it sounds great on clerks 2) or spend the money on the original 12 inch single. All the other tracks can be found on their original 12 inch vinyl releases on online auctions for reasonable prices. So in love by Omd is a great song but its sounds terrible on this release. Dont bother buying this cd if you like quality sounding music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Looking for the original a-ha remix","review":"Good to get some of these old vinyl releases I had such as the OMD, Blancmange, and Human League on CD. I was hoping the a-ha would live up to the asterisk and actually be an UNRELEASED version of the song. The Steve Thompson mix of \\"The Sun Always Shines on T.V.\\" has been available for a long time on 45 RPM Club and Twelve-Inch Club a-ha CD compilations. I hate the droning cowbell and beat. The rarer 12\\" mix WITHOUT that droning beat is MUCH better IMO, and is still impossible to find on CD. Guess i'll just have to live with the record..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does anyone remember Peter & the Wolf?","review":"It was an AWESOME dance/club song.

Like many of us, I was taught in school that we would make it to Mars by the 1980s. I really enjoyed how Baxter's book took me back to those childhood dreams. Later as an adult, I went on to work with the Shuttle project in Houston, and it was wonderful for someone to portray how my career and the JSC environment could have evolved, had we kept those childhood promises.I'm looking forward to a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another good concept ruined","review":"It's a good idea for a plot, and it certainly deserves better than the truly cringeworthy prose offered. I know nothing of Baxter other than this book, but it seems he's a much better technical writer than a prose writer. His charaters are truly cardboard cutouts, making their melodramatic internal monologues laughable.The worst part is the frequent lapses into British English. Baxter duns us over the head, again and again, how NASA is chock full of cornfed Midwesterners and drawling Texans, then gives them dialog like \\"rubbish,\\" \\"mucking about,\\" and \\"pieces of kit.\\" Right. The jacket copy touts how much research Baxter did to achieve technical authenticity. I'm sure he did, as the technical verbiage is often stultifying in its detail. I guess he didn't devote as much effort to dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, but oh how boring!","review":"I've read all Baxter's other books and I think he's one of the best authors yet. However you just can't win them all. I had expected a bit more exploration and science on the Mars surface but the more closer t th end you get you feel like they will never get there. Although the technical details are very accurate they don't give anything more than more words to read. If you want to read a godd book read Ring and The Time Ships. They are his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"What might have been? Definately!","review":"Alternate history. It's a fun concept to fiddle with. . . what if Hitler had won? What if VonBraun had went to the Soviet Union after WWII? What if Kennedy had not died.Stephen Baxter answers the last question in grand form in the novel Voyage. Voyage is the story of a manned mission to Mars in the 1980's, or perhaps, more specifically, the build up to and execution of the mission.Baxter brings his aeronautical expertise to this book, as well as a good command of history (aborted and realized). The story of Voyage, the tech, the flow. . . all are believable and the story is told quite well. It reminded me of watching \\"From the Earth to the Moon\\" to be quite honest.Give Baxter a few evenings of your time, and you'll get a good read from it. Just ignore the rather frequent use of the Lord's name in vain. ;-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Call Anyone!","review":"Tweet is an awful artist and her track \\"Call Me\\" is an awful track!

I ordered this item back at the beginning of August, for use in my elementary school classroom, and HomeandBeyond never did ship them, and sent a couple of excuses (the first, saying that the hooks were coming from another warehouse and they would be shipped in 2 days, but were not, and the second saying their shipping dept was looking into the \\"problem\\"). Today I get an email saying that they have cancelled my order, no explanation, no nothing. Because the order was cancelled, I don't even get to leave feedback for the seller, which is very wrong. I would never order from them EVER if you actually want to receive your product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on a plane","review":"This is the first set of head phones that I spent more then $20 on. I used cheaper ones on plane trips (DVD Player) and i had to press them into my ears in order to hear anything. After 1 trip with the NoiseBuster's I wonder how i ever lived without them. The noise canceling technology is a wonder, all i heard was the sound from the dvd player. Another great feature is the way they fold-up. Although it's not totally flat, it does fold down and fits into my laptop case quite easily. Well worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price, good noise canceling, but . . .","review":"I bought these headphones less then 4 weeks ago and have used them moderately since then. A few days ago I noticed that a piece of the locking clip on the top of the headphones had broken and today I went to unfold them and the whole locking clip broke! The noise canceling ability of these headphones is great for the price and with a decent battery you can get more than 24 hours of use from them. I have never dropped them or done anything that would compromise the integrity of the plastic. So that leads me to believe that the plastic that they used to make them must be of a very low quality. The best noise canceling in the world is useless if you can't wear the headphones that have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing performance","review":"Based on previous reviews I had high hopes. Those reviews must have been paid endorsements because the performance was poor and that is being kind. The product does not cancel the noise (air travel) it replaced it with a different type of noise. I tried a pair of Sony headphones on another flight and the quality was truly superior. Also, be prepared to purchase a battery because the one that comes with the product is less than cheap. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Local Interest","review":"Since I live about ten miles away from the area where most of the stuff in this book happened, it's pretty interesting to me. I've done a lot of hiking and exploration in the area and so it's kind of fun to find out what someone else did in the same locations. The author also shares many interesting stories relating to prospectors who were his contemporaries or who came before him which make the book even more interesting. While it's clear that the author lacks a certain amount of polish, he does relate his stories in a manner which are captivating to those who bring an interest to the area (Death Valley, especially the area around Manly Peak) or the topic (prospecting and mining). If you live in the Death Valley area or if you plan to spend some time in the area, this book will probably be of interest to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A legend tells his story","review":"Emmett not only is a man among men, rugged, tough men at that, but also is a great storyteller. What's perhaps the most surprising about Emmett is that he tells amazingly enthralling true stories.My only complaint about this book is that the last couple of chapters don't seem to belong there, and I would guess that the publisher pushed for them to be there to make the book longer. Up to that point, this book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"tireless, unique and universal","review":"heard a track on college radio and thought i'd try it (sometimes it works, as it did with broken social scene, and sometimes it doesnt, as with the fall).this CD is, in a word, stupendous. there's not a lot of range on this CD, as its mostly nedelle singing alone or with minimal accompanying musicians (shame too, the best track, good grief, explores pop sensibilities while still maintaining her irreplacable voice). but if you like one track, you'll love the CD. put it this way: picture donovan with an angelic voice, and that's where nedelle begins.nedelle is a thing of beauty. i'm just saddened that, like a lovely sunset, there's not more people who share in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"title of review","review":"This is a bit sparser than her first album.

What you talkin' 'bout, Lu?!). With only three \\"Venoms\\", however, the viewer is not cheated as plenty of other fine performers handily fill in the void. Go to others for plot details, though special mention of the opening sequence that goes from a brothel to a gambling house is a fine comedic moment that shows an influence from (of all people) the Three Stooges!

The arm is long enough for long adjustment, and it hasn't pulled down the stand it's attached to, either.I've taken this thing around town on shows, on the road, and I practice on it every day.

I will say that it's slighty harder/heavier/rawer than his more recent stuff. A good bridge between Marvelous 3's rock sound and Butch's 70's pop rock sound that we've grown accustomed to with Sycamore Meadows and The Black Widows release. Sober is the album's best track in my opinion but as with most Butch releases....favorites often come and go the more you play an album!!Anyhoo...if your a Butch fan it's a must have.

In LEFT OF SELF-CENTERED, Butch carries over lots of his Marvelous 3 songwriting techniques however, manages to begin carving his own identity as well. Songs like \\"My Way\\" and \\"Suburbia\\" have the upbeat energy that Marvelous 3 was known for, but they also carry their own seamless storytelling that Butch is known for. Songs like \\"If\\", \\"Sober\\", and \\"Take Tomorrow (One Day at a Time)\\" have become classic Butch pieces that are added favorites at shows.Butch's LEFT OF SELF-CENTERED is a spectacular infusion of guitar, piano, and vocals. Butch is still finding his way out of his Marvelous 3 shadow, but is showing fans that he's not afraid of musical experimentation. Butch Walker has become one of the best storytellers, songwriters, and producers of our time and this album proves exactly why."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll Make This Simple For You...","review":"Buy this album. It is a work of art. Butch Walker is a musical and lyrical genius. Like the Einstein of the pop rock world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to grow up.","review":"I'm a huge fan of Butch Walker. I think he's a major talent and a true rock star. However, it's time to get over the trite, teeny bopper lyrics. Melodies and guitars are good (thats the 2 stars) but come on, Butch, you're a grown up with a cool, fun edge...act and write like it. We're not on the playground anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I discovered Butch Walker and Marvelous 3 after reading about them on the Metal Sludge website. I heard clips of Marvelous 3's \\"Sugarbuzz\\" and \\"Supernatural Blonde\\" and instantly became a huge fan. I later heard \\"My Way\\" from this album and have been eagerly awaiting it ever since. Unfortunately, the rest of the album sounds nothing like it. Instead of being upbeat and rockin', the majority of the album is dark, depressing, and super-poppy.Fans of Motley Crue's \\"Generation Swine\\" album may like \\"Into the Black\\" (which features Nikki Sixx on bass), but the rest of it is totally forgettable.I had hoped that Butch walker would be the savior to bring back the fun, happy, hard rock sound the 80's. Instead his lyrics focus on such grim subjects as death, infidelity, drug addiction, rape, and bad relationships.Butch obviously has the talent to be a huge rock star. It's unfortunate that he chooses to waste it making this depressing pop drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great artist to discover","review":"I've been listening to Butch Walker since 2003. I'm from Argentina, and I've became a huge fan of him. First I bought the mp3 on Itunes and finally this year could buy the cds!

Perfect for background music during those warm summer nights during your barbecue party or as you cook dinner with friends gathered around. This was my first introduction to flamenco music and truly enjoy it. The songs are of a consistent nature, yet with distinct melodies so that they don't drone on together into one mass. They are just unique enough, yet similar enough so that they make good background music without becoming boring or irritating. I recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good artist, shoddy merchandising","review":"Actually Ottmar Liebert is one of my favorite artists, but the concept of rereleasing an old CD with 6 extra tracks and one of the tracks on the original omitted is responsible for the 2 star rating. It would have been one star except that I have respect for Ottmar Liebert as an artist. Actually I don't find the special edition quite as moving as the original despite the extra tracks. Partly it is because the new CD starts off with \\"Surrender to Love\\" instead of the more catchy \\"Barcelona Nights\\". Anyone with a sense of music appreciation knows that you start off with a fast piece and put the slower more melancholy pieces in the middle, not the other way around. One of the extra tracks, \\"La Memoria/Shadows\\" is just a rerelease of one of the omitted tracks on the original \\"Shadows\\" with a different introduction. A good artist is ruined by releases like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all-around healer!!!","review":"This is a great all-around healer! The product came on time. The company is great.

[Particularly good are the early B.E.'s.]Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone. Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12. That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.And I would have thought it would have been more productive to read commonly known nursery rhymes, in tempo, in the various languages... rather than reading heaven's knows what.Save this one for last.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another disappointed parent","review":"Like some of the other reviewers I've been reading I was also disappointed in this video.

My daughter is 10 months old and loves Baby Mozart and Baby Doolittle. However, Baby Einstein did not hold her attention at all and I found it boring, too.

My grandbabies, never take their eyes off of these movies, they are also the perfect length for little ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird video...","review":"My daughter (11 months) LOVES Baby Shakespeare and Baby Bach. We were very disappointed with Baby Einstein. It is slow paced, has boring images and music - she doesn't watch it for more than a few minutes. The weirdest part of all is that while the different voices speak in different languages, what they are saying does not match what is appearing on the screen at all. For instance, someone may be counting to 20 in a language, but only 7 blocks are shown, or the picture and the words don't go together at all - nursery rhymes while showing pictures of a spinning top or a flower or something. If I want my child to become \\"familiar\\" with foreign languages, regardless of what the person is saying, I'll just take her to our local grocery story to people watch. I'd personally prefer to get a product that teaches my child a foreign language -- AND the meaning of the words."},{"rating":"2","title":"baby neptune","review":"Showed this DVD to my 4 month old grandaughter.

Small babies will find it entertaing because of the bright colors and contrasts in the video, but older babies (and their parents!) will be confused by the language portion of the video. The language portion doesn't match what's shown on the screen, so it really doesn't make sense - however, for exposing your baby to the different *sounds* of other languages, this could be useful. There are some \\"flashcards\\" in the bonus section of the video that I think are helpful for older babies. Final thought: not our #1 favorite Baby Einstein video, but add it to your collection if you 1) have a tiny fussy baby (fussy/colicy babies love Baby Einsteins - don't ask me why!) or 2) have all the videos and want to finish your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Eienstein Is Ma Hero","review":"N'ways.

Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"It grows on ya","review":"After loving most of the wonderful B.E. DVD's, we finally came across one that was not an immediate hit. At first when we tried to show this one to our two-year-old, she actually walked way - and that's NEVER happened with any of the others! However, after several attempts, she decided that the duck, octopus and turtle were lots of fun - oh and the water stuff is kind of interesting too! Now it's in the rotation with Galileo, Van Vogh and Shakespeare. And I'd change my rating to 3 stars, but I don't seem to have that option at this stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAYYY OVERrated","review":"This product is so incredibly overrated. My child is more entertained watching commercials. After I saw this video I was convinced that parents buy Baby Einstein products for the name rather than the quality of the product. \\"Baby Einstein\\".. so alluring..Good marketing on Baby Einstein's behalf. I tried it so many times all the way up to now that she is 9 1/2 months.. she doesn't watch it for more than a minute or 2. I really can't understand everyone's fascination with it. Its so poorly and cheaply made. I can just show her toys and put on international radio stations from the inernet to expose her to other languages... for that matter.. I could do that in front of a video camera, call it Baby Genius and sell it.. it wouldn't be much different from this Video."},{"rating":"2","title":"11-month-old son finds this fascinating","review":"We can pop in this DVD, put it on repeat play and it occupies our son long enough for us to get ready for work in the mornings.He loves all the water images, and the turtle, octopus and duck make him giggle.

My daughter absolutely loves the Neighborhood Animals Baby Einstein DVD that she's been watching since she was 4 months old. But when I played this one for her at 9 months old she couldn't have cared less. I found this interesting, given that Neptune is for 9 mos. and up, while Neighborhood Animals is for 1 yr. and up. I thought the younger movie would hold her attention more, since she was younger. I too found Baby Neptune to be boring. It's got the nice music and pretty imagery, but it is lacking the pazzazz other Baby Einstein movies have."},{"rating":"1","title":"They missed the mark on this one! Confusing and Boring!","review":"We must have all the Baby Einstein DVDs to date and this one goes beyond useless and a complete waste of money. My daughter comes from a multi-lingual household and her father and I would not watch this DVD more than once. My daughter hates it too! We started watching the DVDs when she was 8months old, she is now 22months old. I was expecting it to at least intrigue her but it does not have any teaching material enclosed in these senseless clips. I have spent half my life overseas and the languages spoken don't make any sense with what is being represented and she finds it extremely boring. On a different note all the other DVDs are fantastic and highly recommended! We almost exclusively watch them, she loves them and asks for them by name! Different DVDs will intrigue your child at different stages of he/her development and he/she will love them. They are defintely worth the money.They will give you some much needed down time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Language exposure might start with the alphabet?","review":"I did not like this video and neither did my 10 month old son. My son does, however, enjoy the baby davinci DVD which teaches body parts. I do believe in exposing children to other languages, but maybe something simple like the alphabet and numbers would be a good place to start instead of phrases and stories told in different languages that I can not even translate for my son. Simple images such as a cow followed by cow in english, french, spanish etc.. might be more interesting and educational. When this video started playing I immediately checked the language on the video to make sure it was English! I'm not sure if I'll be able to return this video but I will by attempting to do so later today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another baby scared by the goldfish!","review":"I actually came on here to see if my son was the only one who burst into tears when the goldfish came on (he's 10 1/2 months)! He does startle easily though and perhaps that is what's going on. I had left the room for a second when it began and came running back when he started screaming. Daddy accidentally sent Baby Mozart back to Netflix (instead of his Star Trek DVD) so we were branching out into our Baby Einstein collection. I think we'll put this one away and try some of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Einstein: Language Nursery","review":"My 18 month old loves every other Baby Einstein video she has (5 altogether) but shows no interest at all in this one. Ended up giving it to the Goodwill. Don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as the others--parents examine your motivation","review":"I love the other Baby Einstein videos. This video is really more for parents than for babies--I think it makes parents feel good about themselves--that they're culturally aware and trying to stimulate an interest in other languages in their children. This was given to me and my baby as a gift. It was truthfully rather dull. If I as a parent do not speak another language, my child is not going to magically gain the ability to understand another language by watching/listening to this video. Maybe a preschool child would benefit from this video, but what do people think, that somehow by osmosis or subliminal messages, their 4 month old is going to become a whiz at other languages? Again, I love the other Einstin videos, especially the animal video, and I find the music is very relaxing. But I think this video is all about being trendy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our sons favorite","review":"Our 5 month year old loves this video the best out of all the Baby Einstein products. He also really like baby Newton. We have the entire series and have found that the videos are sort of hit or miss. Our son really enjoys the shows that are heavy with puppets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one","review":"I've always been very curious about these Baby Einstein videos and saw one at my friend's house a few months ago. I thought it was boring and so did my friend's 1 year old daughter because she fell asleep. Since I have a 3 month old, I thought I'd purchase the Language Nursery to expose my daughter to other languages. I would think that as the other languages are being spoken, there would be some English subtitles. I know the video isn't supposed to be teaching me foreign languages but what good is it if you keep hearing different languages but are totally clueless and to what is being said. My opinion is that these Baby Einstein videos aren't going to boost my child's IQ so I won't be adding any more to my DVD collection. Another reviewer said these videos are as fun to watch as it is to watch paint dry. I agree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting for young babies","review":"I was very disappointed in the particular Einstein DVD; my son loses interest within the first few minutes. There isn't much music and the words are spoken very softly and difficult to hear. For the amount of money for DVD's I would stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get any other Baby Einstein DVD unless you are bi/trilingual","review":"We bought this DVD because our 18 mos. twins love the \\"flash cards\\" on Baby Bach and on Baby Doolittle. Unfortunately, the language lab flash cards on this DVD are the same flash cards found on Baby Bach. Likewise, some of the images in this DVD are duplicates of other Baby Einstein DVDs. This raises the question: What the heck am I paying for when I'm getting duplicated material? Likewise, the DVD IS boring. I'm sure it is more engaging to families raising multi-lingual children. We are not one of them and we really hated this video. We do have about eight of the other Baby Einstein videos and we love them all. This one, we took back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Mozart, Baby Bach, and Baby Shakespeare are better","review":"I will be honest. Our son loves Baby Mozart, Baby Bach, and Baby Shakespeare. The music on them is delightful and the videography is great. The toys and objects are shot in such a way that they get a baby's and toddler's attention. But, I find that they are not as mesmerizing as the Barney, Elmo, etc. TV stuff is.Now, for Baby Einstein. The concept is good, but in execution, it didn't work for our son. Listening to moms speak in a dozen languages bored our son. And the videography is not well done, so the images don't get a child's attention. This was the first tape in the series; the others are far better. We ended up consigning this tape. But, I am about to buy the new Baby Van Gogh, so I really do like the products from this company--just not this particular tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring - a disappointment","review":"Got this tape as a shower gift and it seemed like a good idea - but I must say that my little son is absolutely bored with this tape. Plus, frankly, there are others he likes much better and will watch and \\"talk\\" to much more actively (his current favorites are the two \\"Brainy Baby\\" tapes) and this tape looks a little like it was videotaped in someone's garage.Sorry, but there are better tapes out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for us","review":"We truly use our videos as education tools, watching the videos with our girls and then following them up with books or games about the subject we've watched that day. But with this video I can't understand what they are saying so I space out and lose interest. Which, I believe, is not beneficial to our girls. See if you can watch someone elses version or check it out from the library before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wheres the english?","review":"maybe my Dvd was messed up but the only english I heard was one old mcdonald farm song and hello! I even went to the part where theres a list of all the languages i selected english then would hit play I would here hello then the rest of the video was in another language. Everything else was in a different language. While I do understand why people think it looked homemade I guess it was trying to capture the babies view of the world. i like the sounds and graphics just more english. I do want to expose my 4 month old son to other languages but english is going to be his first language and this video could have had more but its good for him to just watch for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandaughter loves it","review":"Who cares what I think.

My advice: music & babies - these two things will keep your little one very content so you can take a little break."},{"rating":"1","title":"really really boring.","review":"I bought this DVD last year, because my son loved baby mozart and baby shakespeare.

I'm not sure whether my son might like it 2 years later.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brainy Baby beats Baby Neptune by a mile!","review":"A friend gave this to our daughter and I must say that it was very disappointing. Too much blank screen time and ALOT of repetition of scences, I guess to stretch the overall approx. time, which is more like 23 minutes instead of the 30 advertized on the box. No reinforcement or explanation of what was being shown-more eye candy than educational. I'm exchanging mine for another Brainy Baby, as they are 45 minutes and really hold my child's attention, and isn't that the whole reason for spending the money?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Einstein Makes Muppet Babies","review":"This DVD fails.

Spoken words don't match image presented. Example: They show clock and count till 30. They would point to a number and pronounce completely different one.

I can't believe anyone would keep this material let alone show to a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This video is wonderful! I was sure that Jesica, being only 4 months old, would have no interest in this video as she doesn't with most everything else on television. But this video is very exciting to her. She will talk to the objects she sees. I am very proud to have this for her and look forward to getting Baby Bach and Baby Mozart to switch them out for variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"A video that stimulates baby's listening skills","review":"My brother bought my daughter this tape when she was 9 months old and I wish that I had had it when she was born. Sixteen different languages are spoken (random nursery rhymes, the alphabet, numbers, etc. are recited) as various toys and everyday objects are shown. I found it strange at first, but my child was visibly drawn to it from the beginning. The only critism I have is that I am doubtful that the voices are spoken by native speakers as the video claims. My husband is French and he's sure that the voice speaking French does not belong to a native speaker. I don't know about the other languages but it leaves me wondering. Another remark is that once your child becomes mobile, her interests change very quickly and you shouldn't expect her to sit through the entire 30 minutes of the video. Nonetheless, watching the video with her and commenting on it can help her to develop her vocabulary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this video after the series was recommended to me by some friends. My baby has seen it several times from 4 months of age to 12 months of age, and he was completely disinterested in it.

He is never going to take a remote interest in this DVD and wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"We own several of the Baby Einstein videos, and my 15 month old son loves this one. We first bought it for him shortly after he turned 9 months old, and although it was a bit different from the older Baby Einstein format, once he became familiar with the puppet characters he loved it. If you have a child who loves the puppets in the other videos, the octopus and turtle in this video will delight them. I bought him the bath time book with the characters from this video and he was delighted to see them in a book! THis is a great addition to your Baby Einstein collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"baby bored- not representative of the series","review":"this is 1 of 5 baby einstien videos we have and the only one we don't like. Even though I noticed within the first 2 minutes that it was unlikely to 'teach' Sammy anything, I tried to be objective (because this time daddy was the one to choose it). And I suppose Ms. Clark's purpose was to EXPOSE babies to different languages, after all, teaching is really the parent's job. but this one seemed confusing- maybe just to me- Sam doesn't know that all those sounds aren't just sounds. I do find him imitating some of the inflections in the video as if he's trying to carry on a conversation in whatever language he thinks grown-ups speak, just as he imitates some of the sound effects in the other videos. I stand by the BE line- we enjoy all the other videos we've seen. And we do still use this one, but mainly to get Sam to take a nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for children, engaging for interaction","review":"I enjoy the different languages, my child enjoys the songs & toys.

While I wasn't expecting a half hour video to teach him the laws of gravity I also didn't expect to watch a video that appears to be \\"home-made.\\" I could have just as easily picked up a camcorder, taped some of the toys I have around the house and dubbed in some classical musical for effect. This video is very amateur-like in style and content. Shame on the producers and manufacturers of this video for capitalizing on the names Mozart and Einsten and for taking advantage of parents who eagerly purchase these videos with the hopes of enhancing their children's intellect. Call me old fashioned but I think I'll stick with the tried and true and continue to read to my son rather than try to distract him with a video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Einstein making parents look stupid!","review":"I'm with the reviewer \\"WAYYY OVERrated\\" on this one. We get swindled into paying a lot of money for these cheaply made products. The name is very persuasive and i suppose we're hopeful it will really have that effect.My daughter is no more fascinated by this DVD than she is by any number of random and unexplainable things that catch her eye on regular TV. I find that PBS has some great shows for free that actually teach her. I was amazed when after one show Grover had her trying to say \\"up\\" and \\"down\\". She's only 13months so it came out sounding like \\"ut\\" \\"dow\\" and she was raising and lowering her hands very excitedly. She doesn't ever interact with the Baby Einstein. She only stares at it mesmerized like when she saw the teletubbies, which scared me to no end.I say, save yourself some money and tape your (and baby's) favorite shows from PBS and repeat those. They are far better quality and so much more educational."},{"rating":"1","title":"My child hated this one!","review":"My child cries when I put this one in. He hates the animated dancing crayons. Let me just say that these movies have such an appeal to babies because, in the exact words of Julie Clark, \\"they capture the sights and sounds of baby's real world.\\" I don't know about you, but there are no computer animated, singing and dancing crayons in my child's real world. I think Disney forgot that the simplicity of these movies is what makes them so loveable. Pass on this one and stick with the earlier versions (before Disney took over)My child adores Bach, Mozart and both the Dolittles."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as baby mozart or bach","review":"this video is a lot more boring than baby mozart or bach, because those have music and this does not. this one is just voice-overs in different languages and doesn't hold our child's attention as much. if you really think hearing all the different languages as an infant will make your child smarter later, go ahead, otherwise I thought the musical ones were much more interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son LOVES this DVD","review":"My son has LOVED this DVD since he was one month old and now he is 18 months.

They've been great - its the only way to get a 30 minute break in the day and she loves them with the exception of this one. She can't watch more than 30 seconds of it without being bored and crawling away. And I can't say I blame her - it speaks in other languages, but doesn't translate, there's no way of knowing what language is being spoken at what time or what they are saying. If its confusing to an adult, what baby would get any value from it? The other Baby Einstein videos are ingenious, and I HIGHLY recommend them for fun and for learning. But skip this one unless your baby is interested in nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My son (17 months) received this as a gift.

We are a bilingual family with some knowledge of a number of other languages. Even tho' our son is only 5 months old - he cried through this entire volume. The pictures do not match the translations which can be very confusing for a child trying to actually catch on to a language. If this is just to hear other languages being spoken - I'd rather take a bus. The pictures aren't even the usual \\"eye catching\\" visuals & when counting is being done, it's not even in sync with the picture.

My daughter has Baby Bach and loves it, all the music and sounds and activity really fascinate her, so I had high hopes for the Baby Einstein video.

The narrator reads numbers to twenty yet the syncronized clock only goes to 12. This is just one example of how there is no correlation between what the narrator says and the images that are displayed. The poems in the various language are boring. The movie is confusing. A better approach would have been to show simple objects and repeat simple words in various languages. Instead, the movie includes LONG passages in foreign languages without saying what language is what and without showing visuals to help the listener understand what is going on. Quite honestly, this is the worst baby einstein video I've seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This One! The Others in the Series are BETTER!","review":"Loved the other Baby Einstein DVD's I have for my daughter (Mozart, Both Animals and the Neptune), but this one is a BUST! I couldn't get my daughter to watch this again if I sat her down with a bag of cookies (which I WOULDN'T!) in front of it. Boring, odd and slow! Listening to it will drive you nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"My little critics think its the best Baby E. ever!","review":"Never seen my kids go so nuts for the puppets, the music or the beautiful scenes of underwater magic. It's amazing to think there are so many facinating things about water. We adults even find ourselves seeing things we learn something from. An incredible effort and our most prized DVD from Baby Einstein. It even gets soft at the very end, so the kids know it's almost time for bed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish i had listened to other reviews on this product!!!!","review":"This has to be the most boring video for kids!!! I Love all the other einstein videos but this one was a miss, not a hit!!I wish I would have listened to the reviews from other parents .About two minutes into the video ,my 18 month -old just gets up and walks away,as with the others, she's completely mezmorized .Nice concept though, but to all parents ,please listen to these reviews, or you'll waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great service.","review":"Thanks so much for the fast service. My order arrived as I expected. I will certainly use this dealer again. Thanks so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing","review":"This dvd was very confusing. My three kids are big fans of baby eistein. It has way too many languages. Doesn't make sence."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing","review":"We have couple of baby Einstein videos and my son loves them - except for this one. I was very disappointed, unlike the other BE videos, this one is boring and he won't pay attention to it. Using of so many languages in this video is confusing for kids {if they actually watched it} and I don't get what is the point of it. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great as other Baby Einstein products","review":"I don't complain about this DVD too much but I'd rather use other ones that are more fun and educational. It's just OK but I always end up using the other ones. This one is not in my top list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great to snooze through","review":"I watched this video at least half a dozen times with my five month old grandaughter. If you or baby cannot or will not fall asleep, this is the video for you. It's as entertaining as watching paint dry. A smile and a hug says \\"I love you\\" in any language and you need not be Einstein, to teach your baby how to talk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeww.. hated it","review":"My baby does like this video, but I can't stand it. I first purchased Baby Mozart and Baby Beethoven and liked them a lot, but when my daughter got older (6 months) I decided to try something new. So I bought her some of the Fisher Price videos. She loves them, and I do too. Then I decided to try this video because unlike Mozart and Beethoven they actually have nature scenes and stuff in this video. My daughter is entertained, but the way they try to make the kids in this video all \\"cutesy\\" is annoying. The kids in the Fisher Price videos are very cute. They're filmed doing many different activities, playing with moms and dads, sleeping, eating. Very cute. But the kids in this video are always mugging for the camera - a complete turn-off for me. So, I gave this video two stars because it definitely entertains my daughter. But only two stars because I can't stomach it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying for adults - boring for baby","review":"When I first played this, I thought I had purchased a foreign copy because it starts speaking another language which I can only guess is German. I dont like the fact that you dont know what they are saying or in what language. I found it incredibly annoying and my 5 mo. old baby isn't interested in it either. She usually sits captivated during other Baby Einstein videos from beginning to end (except for Baby Newton, which scares her). I do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"this video is so boring!","review":"My daughter is 11 months old & loves Baby Van Gogh, and both Baby Doolittle tapes. However, in comparison this video is dull with slow music and is more appropriate if you want you child to nap. It also has very little educational value & was truly a disappointment. Don't waste your money, like I did, just because it's a Baby Einstein tape!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY BAD","review":"I agree that it's wonderful for babies to hear the sounds of other languages, but what is being spoken should relate to what is seen on the television screen. The concept is good, but the quality of this is very poor.Unrelated to this dvd ... why does amazon require an email address from adults ... adults should be able to write reviews without requiring such information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves out the Italian language!","review":"I am very disappointed in Baby Einstein. This video has several different languages, none of which were Italian! I even wrote a letter to Baby Einstein expressing my disappointment. I think that Italian is a beautiful language that many people wish to learn and to leave it out of this video is unforgivable. I no longer support Baby Einstein products."},{"rating":"1","title":"(*&^^$","review":"unfortunatlly i got a dvd that dosnt work.... he lagnguge is not english and when i tried changing and choosing english lang. it dosnt repond... so am stuck with it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest for language learning","review":"I speak two other languages besides english and at first was excited to see a language baby einstein but disappointed upon seeing it. If you want your child to learn a second language do not expect this video to help. The poems do not coincide with the pictures flashing across the screen hence, you do not know what the poems are about unless you can speak the language. I think it was poorly done. I love almost all the other videos I have seen thus far as does my two year old and 7 mo. old however I would not purchase the language nursery. Hopefully they will come out with a better video teaching kids different languages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our baby has loved this video from 5 weeks old!","review":"If it weren't for these dvd's, my husband and I would never get to have dinner together. From the time she was 5 weeks old, our little girl has been hypnotized by this series, including this one. She is now 6 months old, and has seen it 100 times, but still never makes a peep during the entire video! She smiles as soon as she sees the little bug log appear on the TV. My husband and I also enjoy listening to all the foreign languages, and trying to recognize them."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY SON'S FAVORITE BABY EINSTEIN VIDEO!!!","review":"My son is six months old and he absolutely LOVES Baby Neptune! It is his favorite video in the Baby Einstein series. The packaging says \\"nine months and up,\\" but he already enjoys it so much. He loves watching the tropical fish, dolphins, whale and sea turtle, and he giggles and tries to talk to the duck, octopus and turtle puppets when they appear. We're thrilled, because we love water and hope he will enjoy it as he gets older as well. The beautiful music and real underwater footage, combined with the darling baby and puppet scenes, make this a pleasure to watch --- even for Mommy and Daddy! We want to limit the amount of TV viewing he does, but we love sharing high-quality, educational viewing opportunities like this with him and seeing his face light up. It's wonderful --- don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hit or Miss","review":"My son never showed any interest in the Baby Einstein (Mozart, Bach, etc) series. Though we exposed him to it a few times, it rarely kept his interest for more than 3 or 4 minutes (if that long).He was much more interested with watching a tape showing baby faces and their expressions. He'd sit through that entire tape.I think the Baby Einstein concept is good but I think it is hit and miss with each individual child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I have the whole series of their products. This is the worst. My daughter loves the others but this one is simply boring. I agree with some of the other reviewers that is purposeless to not have the images correlate with what is being spoken. My daughter resides in a multi-lingual home and we are careful to match what we say to her with what is going on around her. To not do this is worthless. Poor product, trust me don't get this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAXIMUM enjoyment!","review":"We just got this video last night and my two children (ages 3 years and 21 months) want to watch it over and over and over! They didn't want to go to bed last night as they were so excited over this. They don't want to play in the beautiful sunshine today because they want to watch this video. I have had to turn it off just to get them to do something else.Another hit from Baby Einstein. I personally don't care as to whether it is the same or different from earier videos . . . what I care about is whether or not my children like it whether or not we can talk about it. Both criteria were well met by this video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Generally dissapointing","review":"Wonderful photography, as always, but it would be nice if they had included a word-for-word translation booklet so parents could translate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great DVD at all","review":"The languages and images don't connect. We were given this as a gift because of the linguistic value, but instead the entire dvd doesn't offer it. The other dvds in this collection are great. This one failed to teach anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning- This video scares my toddler","review":"My toddler loves the B.E. collection, but for some reason is petrified of the goldfish that pops out in the beginning and the end of the video. I had first showed him the video when he was 11 months old, and he burst out in sobs (this had never happened before with anything else). I waited a few months and again- same thing. I was ready to throw it out, when I just showed it to him again (19 months). He clings to me and once the goldfish is gone, he is fine with the video... until it reappears. The sobs have stopped, though. Is it worth it? I don't think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"My child received this DVD as a Christmas gift, and I was immediately excited. Friends had raved about the series, referring to them as \\"baby crack\\" for the way their children have become addicted. I looked forward to having a few minutes to shower or clean the house...but didn't get that benefit. Others have accurately described its contents, so I won't belabor it. Let it suffice to say that it was not captivating for my child (then four months, now ten) then or now. The Baby Mozart CD (yes, just the music) is far more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's The Worth In It?","review":"My 14 month old son loves the Baby Einstein series. They've been the only movies to hold his attention. The sounds and music get his attention, the shapes and colors hold it.That said, this movie never got or held his attention. There are no interesting sounds or music. The voices are very monotone. While I understand the intention of this video, if you don't catch the attention of the child, what's the worth in it? The pictures on the screen do not corrolate well with what is being said. I also believe that there is value in learning not only foreign languages, but foreign cultures. If I knew what was being said when nursery rhymes or poems are recited, I could repeat them in english as an additional learning tool. All around, this move was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I recieved this DVD as a gift from a friend of mine who is a pre-school teacher who claimed this was one of the best videos for young children around. I happen to highly disagree. The age range on this DVD is 1-18 months, however when putting it on my for child at a young age he would cry. I agree with another reviewer when they said it speaks other lanuages but there are no sub titles to go along with it. I would like to know what at least my child it being taught. I was very disapointed with this baby einstein video, i wish i had returned it when i had the chance for it now just sits in a box."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"My 13 month old son loves Baby Mozart, Baby Bach and Baby Beethoven. I thought this was going to be in the same league. Unfortunately, it's as boring as Baby Einstein's Language Nursery. He had no interest in watching this. Lots of repitition and the music isn't that great. I wouldn't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Hot","review":"I purchased this video thinking it would be a great educational video for my daughter. Not the case as I found out. I liked the fact that there were many languages but the picture and the words need to match. Things did not match up. I listened in English and another language and it was confusing. If you are going to teach counting for example, when you say 1,2,or 3 it should be the same as what is on the screen. You can't say 2 and show 5 balls. Otherwise, a child will not connect the two. If you say \\"up\\" something should be going up. I got rid of it as soon as I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i was disappointed with this childrens dvd. It is nice that they are trying to get childrens minds moving and teach them things i just feel it can be done better. for example they say the abc and count to 20 in 7 different languages which is good but they don't show the numbers or letters while they are saying them, there is pretty much a blank screen. Also if you view the short theatre part of the dvd they are saying thing while objects are being shown ( stuff animals, toys etc) but the things they are saying dont relate to the pictures at all. One thing that was very upsetting to me was that one of the objects they display are burning candles not a picture of burning candles like on a cake just actual burning candles i think it is uncalled for and could be teaching children to be interest in fire. this was very disappointing"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"Video not in English! It had English writing on the cover, but the entire DVD is in wvery other language except English."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first disappointing Baby Einstein video","review":"My 14 month old daughter loves all of the Baby Einstein videos. She is enthralled with all of the ones we have, so I was excited to buy this one. She watched it for 2 minutes and walked away. She has no interest in this one, while the others we have to watch ALL of it including the credits each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it as a learning tool!","review":"The first time I sat my son down to watch this DVD, he lost interest in just a couple of minutes from hitting play. Until I sat down with him and explained and went over everything with him, he actually had watched it with me. It's very bright, musical, and educational but you'd have to take part in it if you'd want to teach your child something. If you plan to have more children then it's worth buying but if you're unsure, try buying it used or borrow it from a friend or relative. It'll last you for a year from birth, maybe two years but after your child recognizes Barney or Blues Clues, it'll be boring and unentertaining to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby Neptune","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. Believe me, my baby and I LOVE all the videos we have seen in the Baby Einstein series, but this one has to be the most boring one! The footage is great and the puppets are cute, but it just isn't that exciting to watch. It might be good to watch it just before a nap because I certainly felt like taking one during it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"much overhyped","review":"My daughter started crying everytime I played this for her. She hated it. If you get as a gift ok. But save your money and buy barney or something from Elmo's World. They'll enjoy that alot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best video on the market for babies!","review":"My daughter has watched Baby Einstein since she was a few weeks old, and it has always captivated her. It's a wonderful program for infants and I highly recommend it! Whether or not the intellectual benefits are true, we'll soon discover, however, it is very entertaining for our daughter and the time we spend with her as she watches it is cherished!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please skip this one!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I chose language nursery to introduce my baby to the einstein tapes. What a bad choice. Who knows what they are saying? The visuals are boring at best, the music is the only thing keeping you awake. My baby hated this from the start. Yet, I did not lose hope and I bought baby Mozart and bingo!! She likes the Mozart much much better and so do I."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy any of the other Baby Einsteins over this one.","review":"My daughter and I are fans of this series with the exception of this video. I don't quite understand how children will learn different languages when the words have nothing to do with the pictures. Please don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly interactive","review":"I totally disagree with a previous reviewer who says your children learn nothing from this video. This series of videos is meant to foster interactions/explanations between parent and child--it's NOT something to just plop your kid in front of to learn the alphabet or numbers for another 15 or 20 minutes...These videos capture a child's interest without him or her spacing out in front of the tv and allow great parental. Although the Baby Einstein Language Nursery is the weakest of the series, they are a great series to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"It stops my son from crying EVERY time!!","review":"This video is AMAZING!! My son is 6 months old and is in love with this video. He is a very fussy baby, but every time you put on Baby Einstein, it instantly stops him from crying. He smiles and laughs and flirts with the dolls and the little girl at the end. His favorites are the train and the cow in the begining. I've watched it so many times with him, I am starting to learn the alphabet in different languages. We don't have any of the other Einstein movies, but I am going to order another today. A DVD this time so I can put it on continuous play. He will watch Einstein 3 times in a row before he is sick of it. It is a savor for parents! 5 stars from my husband and I, oh, and the babysitter too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"She wasn't interested","review":"I believe I made a mistake in ordering this DVD for my granddaughter. She was absolutely not interested. She is 17 months old. I wonder if she would have been more interested at 1 month old.I was very disappointed myself. Real animals and real babies are of more interest to children her age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Our 16-month old son was captivated by this newest Baby Einstein video from the moment we turned it on. He LOVES water and is especially enchanted with all the sea animals. He points to the TV, saying, \\"Ooooo! Ooooh!\\" or asking \\"Wa zat?\\" He always imitates the moving crab toy you see at the beginning of the video and just laughs and laughs at the puppets. We took the video to his private day-care setting and the kids there LOVED it -- even the older ones! Now, it makes a regular appearance in his diaper bag. They lady he stays with during the day just raves over this video in particular, and we have a few in our collection.This video is beautifully filmed, is visually captivating, is highly educational, and is so much fun to watch. Even I can't resist watching it from start to finish!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another good one in the series","review":"I bought the VHS version of this, although we have a DVD player. I actually prefer the VHS, as you can just pop the tape in and go. With the DVD, you have to wait for the menus to load and unless you fast forward the intro, you always have to hear \\"Hi, I'm Julie Clark...\\"That aside, this is a good tape. My 9 month old is definitely not as captivated by this one as she is by the 'Mozart' or 'Beethoven' tapes. This may be due to the fact that there are more real images (such as kids playing with a sprinkler) than puppet and toys flashed across the screen. It is more like watching someone's home movie at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't correlate","review":"I love the other Baby Einstein tapes,(my 5 month old loves Mozart & Bach so far) and I recently ordered a few more. The language Nursery is interesting, but it doesn't always correlate the words and \\"nursery rhymes\\" with what is on the screen. That seems like it would be confusing for a baby/toddler. For instance, if saying little miss muffit, you would expect something to be shown that is associated with that nursery rhyme. Much of this tape does not do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING BORING BORING","review":"My 3 month old & I are big fans of BE DVDs BUT this one is just not one of them. I gatta say it is very boring & not suitable for a baby. Maybe a toddler. My son started watching BE Dvds from 2 months (Beethoven, Mozart) & he loves them, laughing and all. He usually gets into them from 45 min to an hour. The second I put this DVD in, he started crying. I tried to fast forward to find something that would be interesting, colorful, or some music. Didnt happen all you hear is numbers & numbers in different languages. Maybe when hes about 2 but not now or anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Boring and Dull","review":"I normally just love the baby einstein series, but this one was very disappointing. It had the same images more then a couple times, and my son got bored of it very early. It doesn't teach your child new languages, but exposes them to it. However, my son was only interested when the english parts were on. I would recommend baby macdonald; that one is the best one I've seen. But don't waste your money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby needs to be older","review":"Being multinlingual parents, we wanted to expose our 5 months old daughter to multiple languages as well. As it turned out, she was totally disinterested in the program.I think it would probably be more interesting for older children. Though, a colleague of mine with 18 months old twins said that they weren't interested in the Language Nursery either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video!","review":"My baby loves this video! He is particularly enchanted with the Japanese sections - the sounds seem to appeal to him. My son has watched the video almost daily since he was 3 months old (he is now 8 months), and at this point, my husband and I can count to twenty in Japanese, Russian and Hebrew as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good one at all","review":"My 9 month old daughter who loooooves Baby Eienstein videos totally hates this one. I don't know why but this one simply was a total waste of money. Whatever their formula is that makes babies love these videos was lost on this one. It is well known among other moms that this is the one to stay away from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"This is really a bad product. Our 4 month old daughter was completely disinterested. It is visually unstimulating and poorly thought out. It would be nice to know what they are saying in the different languages. My wife and I are multilingual and did not find the choice of languages to be helpful. Don't waster your money here, you are better off buying a book and reading to your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appealing to the ears","review":"I was very disappointed with this tape. I own many others which incorporate music with pictures, but this tape did not make any sense. Since I (the parent) sit with my child while watching tv, the baby einstein company could at least match up the language with the picture. The languages seemed to pierce my eardrums like the volume was off between the music and voice. I didn't understand why there would be a poem being spoken with the background of three lines. It never held either my attention or my childs. I actually got restless waiting for my computer to print out the translation from the cd. I returned it the next day and bought neighborhood animals instead. It seems we do better with the other tapes that have music and animation. That keeps the interest of my child. Better luck next time I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neptune is the Greatest!","review":"My child is 6 1/2 months old, and he just loves this video! Everytime he hears the music start, he turns his head and watches the TV and can't take his eyes off the TV. We put him in his bouncy chair and he kicks and kicks throughout the whole video. I actually have time to get things done around the house while he is watching this video!! It's a great video, so keep them coming!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I purchased this used and it was outstanding, quality was great and my son watches it almost 3 times a day along with his other Baby Einstein DVDs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional DVD!","review":"My baby has loved this from the time he was very, very young. The music is soothing and the water scenes are to die for. I've even found myself putting this in for ME to watch & listen to when I suffer from bouts of insomnia. The animal life is amazing, the colors are vivid and the music is soothing -even the narrating child's voice is soothing. My son is 2 1/2 now, and he still loves this. He falls asleep with this DVD in no time. I cannot say enough good things about this DVD. I initially purchased the old version, but we played it so much, it finally gave out. We then purchased this newer version and it's just as good, just the grow-with-me features are different. Either version, you can't go wrong. If you've never tried the Baby Einstein DVDs or don't own this one, go get it now!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver again and again.....and a great show too!","review":"This DVD saved our lives many a cranky night! From only about 3 months old, our daughter would be soothed by this DVD with the calming music and images of water. It sometimes worked better than getting dressed and driving around at 4am to finally get her to sleep! Oh god, those nights were just rough! The DVD is just great,educational and fun. the real life footage of sea life, the puppets, the music and the little kids all add up to 25+ minutes of soothing down time for little ones and parents. Helped sooth us to sleep sometimes faster than our daughter! ha ha! Recommend for all new parents. Our 21 month old still enjoys watching it and now asks what each object or animal is. She gets a real kick out of the kids splashing in the puddles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I was excited to expose my baby to baby einstein so I tried this video first. While the images got my baby's attention for the whole 30 minutes, I was concerned about the language confusion. Not only the language and images are sometimes not related, but I think that mixing so many languages can be confusing for a baby who's trying to figure out language.I'll try baby mozart and see how my baby responds to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best Baby Einstein Video - a review of Baby Einstein Language Nursery","review":"196 Reviews Say It All... This is not the best Baby Einstein Video of the many that are on the market and I would suggest you buy all of the others before this one. Particularly good are the early B.E.'s.Our principal reason to dislike this video is the lack of music which leaves it 'dry' and plainly dull: the readers are not particularly inspired and read in a monotone. Then there are the other odd things that others have commented on, like counting to 20 when the clock only goes to 12. That confused by son who is 2.5 years old and who still loves the Baby Einstein franchise.And I would have thought it would have been more productive to read commonly known nursery rhymes, in tempo, in the various languages... rather than reading heaven's knows what.Save this one for last.Pam T~mom and reviewer for BooksForKids-reviews"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull....","review":"This is not the quality of the other Baby Einstein movies!

He doesn't, and neither do we. The images are less interesting than other Baby Einstein videos and the music is not very engaging. I would not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best of Baby Einstein","review":"I love the Baby Einstein movies--my 21-month old has watched them since he was a few months old. This one has random words and sentences (poetry?) in different languages that have nothing to do with the visuals. It also has counting and alphabets spoken in several languages--again, with no relation to the visuals. My son is at an age where he needs recognizable words he can repeat and relate to what he sees. Perhaps it would be fine for a younger child but I think this one is just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"very complicated","review":"I did by this dvd from e-bay, when I started to play, its was very confusin for me to operate this dvd, you cant chose a language, you cant come back were you were, I had to read a guide!!! its not supose to be that hard. and no music!!! is this dvd for kids or what? not happy at all, I am afrade to buy another BE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soothing and visually enthralling","review":"This video is not as educational as other BE videos have been, but we still enjoy watching it. I usually put this one in when it is time to get ready for a nap or bedtime. The animals are fun to watch and we both enjoy the visual images of the different kinds of bodies of water. Not every video we watch has to be 100% educational in order to have value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"We and our baby love the Baby Einstein DVDs (Bach, Mozart, Nursery & Van Gogh). I wish we had not bought this one. It is not interesting to watch, lacks innovation and charm. The story and music even seem to hack Baby Van Gogh.I did notice that Julie Aigner-Clark (and kids) are absent on this one...is she not involved in production anymore? Maybe that is the difference. Unfortunately, I will never buy a B.E. DVD again without reading the reviews in advance!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my baby loves and learns from it","review":"I am really pleased with the video and am looking for find more educational videos for her enjoyment.

She wasn't even interested in it from the very first time we played it for her. Thinking that she needs to get used to the DVD, we played it again and she just wanted entertained by this one like the others. As a parent who bought the whole set of Baby Einstein when I was 3 month pregnant (that's how enthused I was with the product) I'm very disappointed with this new DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly upset.","review":"I got this as a gift and we put it in thinking there would be a section with just English for him and there wasnt.

I am sorry that when I bought the video for my granddaughter I only read the first couple reviews (which were positive) and did not get to the ones that criticized it. A very poor video and now I've had three babies with their perspective parents watch it and they ALL feel the same.

I would not recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY cute, but very cheaply made","review":"This was just what my daughter, age 7, wanted. And it IS cute. But it's CHEAP.

While it does have some useful example problems, the explanations are not very elucidating and the chapter problems often expect you to make assumptions that I don't think it's natural to make.For example, in solving problem 4.9, you need to flip back 45 pages to Example 4.3 and use a chart for the machine described there. However, problem 4.9 never indicates that its machine shares these characteristics, or that you ought to assume they are the same. There have been a few other times when our professor has forewarned us that the wording in the homework problems is inexact, does not give us all the information we need, or gives us erroneous information.I would not recommend this book to someone trying to study electric machines, especially if you're trying to learn it on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is as low as I can rate this.","review":"This book is naffing awful.

The first part of the book is fine, but once the material gets even halfway challenging (3-phase and referring sides) it's like the author just abandons any effort to explain the concepts and throws you into the deep end with \\"example\\" problems that are magically solved with none of the steps being shown, unexplained primed notation and new units of measure everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not as yellow as hoped...","review":"I hate to take away 1 whole star for color.. but I really hoped this helmet would be more yellow.

For a man who sight-read the Brahms B flat concerto at a concert (!!!) in his early 20s, to struggle with this repertoire ought to suggest something is very wrong. These recordings were made shortly before Ogdon's death. The old fire rarely returned after his recovery in the mid-seventies. In many ways as tragic a loss to pianism as Solomon's stroke.The release of these discs not only discredits Ogdon's memory but is a cynical expoitation of this great artist's reputation by parties who should have known better.Buy the testament Etudes and the RCA / Great Pianists release of the Sonatas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Ogdon","review":"How can EMI release this appalling assortment of Ogdons struggling through rachmaninoff?

While most Beckett fans know _Waiting for Godot_, this novella takes more of a Modernist bent that differs from the anticipatory post-Modernism of _Godot_.

The self-conscious narration resembles some of the humor of Watt(in the footnotes and the appendix), but as it's chief expressive voice.

Probably the first reader-participation novel written(you gotta play chess). Hints of what was to come, but mostly in retrospect. Murphy is a fun read, it's almost a shame it was written by the author of Waiting for Godot, Molloy, Endgame, Stories & Texts for Nothing, footfalls: it doesn't come close to the complexities expressed in those works, probably because it follows Joyce, and tries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I feel I'm really getting my money's worthWith this brand.

The inability to change tone or approach mark his limits as an author. Often, his analysis is no more than using modern statistical analysis to poke fun at long-dead and forgotten moments and personalities in the game's history.Overall, a grim, repetitive read and not recommended unless you are a neophyte to the history of the game and one with a decidedly sadistic sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wishing there was more on modern baseball","review":"What I really enjoyed about this book is that it was all in bite size chunks.

The folding works really well. It goes up easily and comes down softly, although I haven't folded it up very much. This treadmill isn't very mobile, so figure out where you want it and plan to keep it there. It is heavy and awkward to move. I strongly recommend using a mat under it.Overall, it performs very well.

It worked fine when it worked. It's been 6 months since it has stopped working (two months after the warranty ran out)and after replacing all of the electronics in the lower unit it is still not working.

Good size track. 10 Degrees MAX incline & 12mph Max speed. Good sturdy construction. Easy to use controls.CONS: Large poor output fan in middle of console. A little heavy to move around. It is foldable but i never have. TRy to get the delivery guys to put it where you finally want it. Otherwise get some help with it.If you want to setup a Home gym. This should be the first thing you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowflex Series 7 Failure","review":"Had the Series 7 for 18 months and mother board failed.

This treadmill showed up with great reviews on amazon and consumer reports. My husband runs about 30 miles a week or so and he really likes all the features this treadmill included. I am new to running but really wanted a treadmill with lots of different training programs. The programs are great and I am really getting into running which is something I really wanted to do since I have never been good at it. The fan isn't the greatest but it does help a little. We have it in a room with a ceiling fan so that helps out a lot more. The people that delivered it were great. Our delivery man was very helpful and offered to put it in the room we wanted in our house. I read in some reviews that some of the delivery people wouldn't but I guess it just depends on the delivery person. Overall we are really pleased with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not Working","review":"The treadmill I have had in my house for a month is still not working (it was delivered non functioning).

I am not impressed! The speed sensor did not work on the machine and so I was sent another sensor from Nautilus with instructions written in Chinese. I do not feel I should have to repair a brand new piece of equipment. I finally had the speed sensor repaired and the fan doesn't work! I will never buy another piece of equipment from Nautilus. Amazon.com has been most generous by taking off an additional 10% of the purchase price so I could hire someone to come over and replace the sensor. Consumer Reports - you dropped the ball on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product and value","review":"I bought this treadmill about 2 months ago and have used it almost every day since. It is extremely well built, works just fine, and does not require a \\"Rocket Scientist\\" to program. Assembly is easy. Built in HR monitor doesn't work well but the chest strap works fine. Built in fan is great for the first 5 minutes.... then it is time to turn on the remote controlled floor fan (check out Honeywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand Fan here on AmazonHoneywell HFS641P 16-Inch Remote Control Stand Fan. This works perfectly as well). My mill was delivered in about 1.5 weeks. A $40 tip got the thing placed in my workout room instead of just the garage. This was worth every penny, unless you value your back at < $40. If I were you, I would go ahead and buy this mill and the fan while they are still available. You will not be disappointed and you won't find a better deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Treadmill broke down within two weeks. Problem with the belt. Terrible customer service.

The delivery was less than stellar. The delivery company called to schedule delivery, but did not leave a call back number. When I finally looked up the number, they were unable to accommodate morning or afternoon delivery, but had to deliver mid-day. I had to take off work to be there - ok, not too bad. They arrived on time, but the delivery truck did not have a lift or a ramp, and I was told that I had to lift the treadmill off the truck myself! It weighs 300 pounds, more than twice my weight! They did not tell me this on the phone, so I could have asked someone to help me. Thankfully a kind neighbor helped me out. What a ridiculous concept - delivery that does not include the last bit from the truck to your house !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill","review":"The Bowflex we purchased 4 or 5 weeks ago has not been operable due to the machine sensor.

Amazon discounted the unit because Bow Flex would not take it back. Bowflex sent me the parts at no charge but I had to install the new display and control panel boards myself. Bowflex had no one to come out for the repair. Next the fit and finish is terrible on this treadmill compared to others I looked at. I bought this online and never saw one up close. Everything is warped and scratched. Now the unit shuts off after 5 min and after several calls to bowflex they tell me we have to buy a new tread and belt because we didn't lube it enough. Then after I spend the 250 on that if that doesn't fix it they will cover the motor under warranty. I'm sending this junk back to china where it crawed out of a hole. Will never buy crap from Bowflex again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WILL NEVER PURCHASE BOWFLEX EQUIP AGAIN","review":"We have had our Bowflex 7 Series treadmill for only 3 years. Within those 3 years, we have had to replace the belt, the computer, and now the platform is shedding so much \\"varnish\\" that the powder residue sparked a small fire. I agree with the other disappointed Bowflex buyers with the poor customer service, as well. Do not purchase Bowflex equipment. My mom's inexpensive Sears treadmill has lasted over 10 years, looks like that is where I will purchase my next treadmill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product may be good -- company support lousy","review":"I bought this treadmill based on Consumer Reports recommendation. Mine was malfunctioning right out of the box. Nautilus/Bowflex made me do a series of disassembly projects to self-diagnose the problem. This included opening the motor housing -- despite the big sticker warning against that. They eventually said they could mail me the parts and arrange for a tech to see if he could repair it.Their customer service support was lousy. I returned it through Amazon and will never buy any Nautilus/Bowflex product that might require product support."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICEEE!!","review":"I was able to purchase this treadmill from an older man that no longer needed it. He had open heart surgery and used it to do his walking. VERY heavy machine but after I installed it I forgot all about the weight. Very sturdy and well built.

The motor is making a very loud noise. I understand that sometimes there are problems with equipment; however, I am extremley dissappointed in Bowflex customer service. Everytime I have called there has been an minimum of a 30 minute wait to speak with someone. Once I got someone live, they agreed that the machine needed repair. They said I would be receiving a call from a repair person to fix the machine. That was over 5 days ago and I still have not been contacted. For the price of this equipment, my expectations are to receive proper working equipment and great customer service. This has been extremely inconvenient.The machine was easy to put together and looks like it would be great if it worked, but if you receive a defective machine good luck with customer service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor service Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill","review":"I purchased the Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill 11/06 and it was great.

The technician could not find anything wrong so he did nothing.The rear roller noise became extremely loud and we've contacted the company. They initially said they would ship a rear roller but now they cannot give any date at all.We're not pleased with the service. We need the treadmill for walking.

This treadmill worked fine for just under 2 years (although it developed some deck noise). Then it suffered a catastrophic break down (electrical and/or mechanical problems). Nautilus reps (the owners of Bowflex) sent repair guys to my house multiple times. The repair guys never got it running properly. After 6-8 months of hassle, I called 2 other independent repair companies, and they said it would be too expensive and difficult to fix (even Sears will not repair Bowflex treadmills). I am completely frustrated with the slow repair process, short warranty, and poor quality of this treadmill. I decided to buy a different treadmill at a similar price (a Sole F80, which I have also wrote a review of). I do not believe this product holds up well over time and, unfortunately, the warrantly only covers labor for 1 year! I would not buy another Bowflex treadmill again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bowflex Series 7 Treadmill","review":"Heavy sucker to move into the basement! Once set up, it's great.

Amazon had offered to replace the treadmill instead, but we had already put it together and placed in the house. The machine weighs 300 lbs. who wants to take apart and remove again. Amazon only offered 10% of my purchase price for the inconvience, I bought a Schwinn 230 recumbent bike though amazon but shipped by a different company, which also came damaged and they gave me back 40% of the purchase price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best buy","review":"I bought this because it scored highest on Consumer Reports rankings of folding treadmills. They didn't pick it as a best buy because they bought it for 1500 and the next best was 1300. Well amazon sells this one for 1300. I've had it for almost a year and have yet to have any mechanical problems (I like to wait and see if it breaks down before reviewing it). What I like best about it is that you can change the angle you are going and burn as many calories walking uphill as running level. I don't like that there isn't a book or computer holder in front of you, so I just built a shelf on the wall in front of it and put my laptop on the shelf and watch hulu or netflix while running. I think it is a great product and anyone looking to get some exercise in the privacy of their own home should consider it. I've even thought about getting rid of my couch and putting it in the living room so no one can sit around anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT TREADMILL","review":"Bowflex Series 7 TreadmillA really great treadmill,extremely well-engineered and built. Has all of the features one would ever need, including a variety of programs built in. I was considering a less-expensive model, but am glad I chose this one for the extra money, as it will provide a lifetime of use. Only minor problem is its weight (absolutely necessary to provide great stability) of almost 300 pounds. While it does have portability, it takes some strength to move it.

I thought these would be great. Well-- the quality is great, but the product is awkward. I found that after installing the cymbal stacker-- there was not enough space between the two cymbals for effective stick work-- in other words its hard to strike the lower cymbal without hitting the top cymbal as well.

This CD player is attached as one part of an entire stereo system.The only thing I don't like is that if my electricity goes out when the CD player is OFF, the CD player comes ON by itself when the electricity returns.

That original model was fantastic and lasted pretty much until 2008-- except for the fact that it did not play burned audio (not mp3, but audio) CDs.I bought the new model thinking that that would certainly have been updated, but to my disappointment it was not. When I called Pioneer, they said that this new model was designed in 1997, which explains why it does not play burned CDs. According to that representative, there are no Pioneer models newer than this.If this is anything like its predecessor, it's probably a very good player, except for this major drawback, which is why I feel that it really can't get more than two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd player","review":"I only wanted a cd player for my home component system, as I already have a cd/dvd player with a built in video tape player. This Pioneer fits the bill! It is easy to use, with a simple plug in and go. It plays the cds one right after the other and has dozens of other features that I will probably never use.-like programable random sampling etc.The only down that I could find with this player is that the cds have to be loaded in the tray upside down-meaning that the label side goes toward the floor with the music side facing the sky. Every other player I have ever owned has been the opposite way. When I first received the player, hooked it up and tried playing the cds-I got error codes. I then panicked figuring the player was defective, but being female-I then READ the owners manual and found that the cds were incerted incorrectly by me. After correcting my error, this system has been flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty CD changer","review":"The CD changer behaved erratically.

Next, the front panel was not user friendly. You have to hold down search arrow instead of a numerical key pad. Then I realized it wouldn't take the single play magazine from my pd-m60. I don't know why pioneer bothered, the laser pick-up and sound miight be slightly better, but other wise a total bust.

Each eventually developed the same problem--the servo that moves the laser reader across the disc loses its ability to scan/play the first few minute or so of any CD. It blurbs through. This forces me to be nearby to fast-forward past the servo's difficulty. The great convenience of this machine is that it takes up about half the space of the carousel type. Given my space limitations, I tried a second one because of this. However, two times (starting a decent time after purchase) indicate a manufacture engineering defect.

He is one of the only authors to include information on the enemy snipers, VC/NVA. Mr. Lanning does not go into wonderful 'superman stories' you read, and now see so much of in other works. While 'Lone Wolf' actions, and miracle shots did happen, Mr. Lanning points out that these were far from the normal operations under taken by both the Army and the Marines. This is a good book that can be easily understood by anyone, no military background needed to decode the cryptic language. The only real flaw I found was the lack of knowledge in what to capitalize. Mr. Lanning is obviously a fan of the Enlisted Marine, since he cannot seem to capitalize the title Army, or Officer. It is sad that a work of such completeness suffers from such unprofessional behavior. Does not say much for Ivy Books either.

Without giving away too much plot, there is something that happens shortly after they all move in which makes the gals need to earn some money. As they try to accomplish their goal, time progresses and readers get to know each gal individually as well as the people around them.While I couldn't relate to all three roommates, I loved reading about their interactions with each other, men, family members and friends.

Yes, as a reader you learn about all the bad traits about each character but I think all the description makes them more real. Everyone has flaws and, yes, people with nail biting, almost-anorixic or slutty traits do exist!

I mean, we practically drove to Barstow looking for the young lady who inspired that song! Of course, gas was under 50 cents a gallon and we could get there and back in a few hours (after hitting the MacDonalds, actually), but the originals don't need remaking, folks.

You end up tearing the bag and paper shreds spilling all over.

Worked first day, but then blades would not go forward on second day, only reverse. CD/diskette slot would not work either. Tried reseating basket multiple times thinking the safety latch was not engaged, but it could not be positioned any better than I had it.

I knew it was a \\"re-imagining\\" of the entire series, but it still threw me for a loop. Even with that said, I still enjoyed the movie. I didn't compare it to the series in artwork or storyline, I didn't expect them to re-imagine the wheel or anything. Some of the characters became unrecognizable, but I think that was also some of the fun. They took time to mention ALMOST everyone from the series(I missed you Lady Sakuya). All in all, yes I'd much rather watch the series, but the movie tried to manage to re engineer the whole series in the span of hours where the anime had fifty episodes to do as it pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cynical attempt to cash in on popular characters.","review":"As a fan of the series, I wanted to like this movie. Sadly, character development is virtually non-existent, the dialog is clumsy, and the plot seems to have been lazily cobbled together from events and scenes that 'worked' in the series. Unfortunately, a scene or line or plot device relies on its integration into the larger work to be effective, and the movie as a whole simply isn't solid story-telling.Sometimes it works very well when a new creative team comes up with a different vision of characters (such as the superb dark, violent drama ofSamurai X - Trust & Betrayal (Director's Cut), which was produced after the much more mainstream/cartoonish Rurouni Kenshin TV series.) In this case it doesn't work; the movie lacks a lot of the things that made the series strong (such as good pacing and a strong musical score), but doesn't bring anything new of its own to the experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Good Night, Sleep Tight' Lacks the Heart of the Original Series","review":"As has been said in other reviews, I believe that the BONES team attempted to crowbar too much story into too little time, and because of that I think the story lacked the heart of the original series. There are a lot of things about the film that are awkward for viewers who know the original story, such as the recasting of characters, recycling of old footage, the simultaneous connection/disconnection between the film and original series. Consequently, I spent the majority of the film trying to get past these issues instead of being able to enjoy the film for what it was. If there were more time to adjust to these changes by perhaps creating a two-part film or a short mini-series instead of a single feature-length film, these issues may not have been a problem for me. On the positive side, Naoki Sato has composed a completely new score for this film that lives up to his previous work."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Crap Isn't Reviewable","review":"I recently purchased this cd by Barbria Deanne and was mildly impressed.

While some of the medical descriptions are slightly out of date, the confirmation and understanding of the emotions that are an integral part of the ICI experience are right on target. While the chapters about treatment and therapy are not as detailed as I would have liked, they did offer a good starting place for me to talk with my doctor about practical steps I could take to improve my quality of living.

Now, for me that's fine because that's exactly what I bought it for, but I found myself wishing that I would have gotten the mac/daddy which has a lot more capability... such as grilled chicken breasts, bacon, etc. I think I will ask for one for Christmas and give this one to one of my kids. Valuewise- Cuisinart is peerless, but I saw my daughter grill a sandwich in her VERY inexpensive GF grill the other night. It came out perfectly and I was a little peeved... since her GF also does those other things I described.I do like the look and size of the appliance. Easy to clean.

It is a great size, in my opinion. It is large enough to have two sandwiches on the press at one time, but still small enough that it doesn't take up too much precious storage space. I have only cooked sandwiches on the press and they turned out very well. They took about 4 minutes to get the grill marks and for the sandwich to get all melty, so it's nice and quick. I will also use this for grilling chicken inside and maybe even some veggies if it's too chilly to use the outdoor grill. It seems to be a very versatile product. I'd choose this panini press over the $120 version at Williams-Sonoma any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no off/on switch","review":"This has to be plugged in & unplugged with each use.

I use the smooth side so they look like they were done in a pan. If you think wiping out grooves is easy just try it for it is not.With the temperature control you can slow heat the sandwich so the whole sandwich gets hot rather then just the outside.To turn on the GR1 you must pull the plug in and out of the wall each time, this is just wrong, it will arc each time you do it, this is hard on the wall side and will wear it out.

When you press down on the handle it can cause the griddler to slide and/or tip easily, causing the hot grill lid to hit and burn your hand/fingers (this happened to me with 2nd use). It seems like the legs/base need to be wider with a different center of gravity to account for pressure being applied to the handle. also, the unit only has small rubber anti-slip circles in four locations on the legs/base that barely provide any meaningful traction on granite counters (presumably other counter materials too), which contributes to the tipping burn problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's for dinner","review":"This is a great machine to make the ever popular panini sandwiches.

This product does what it is supposed to- It looks good, price is reasonable, nice and compact, worked very well- BUT - not for very long. The non-stick on the plates lasted 2 months - and replacement plates cost just as much as the machine itself. I think it has alot to do with the sandwich pattern that it tried to press the bread into. It has lots of places where it can stick - Pam doesn't help and it makes the bread taste funny. Never mind the oozing mess that comes out of the whole machine as the stuff in the sandwich starts to melt. All in all .. good while it lasted. But not recommended. I bought the West Bend Panini press to replace this one. Its been 4 months - it's not attractive - but it does the job really well and it $50.

It is sturdy and on thicker sandwhiches sometimes I add a little pressure to the handle to smoosh the thick bread a little. My only possible complaint is that sometimes on thicker sandwhiches the cheese won't melt. I won't complain that this one-purpose kitchen items takes too much space on my counter because I store it in my cabinets.I would say I despised them.

Each character has some kind of problem that rely on a private investigator, Sharon McCone, to help them. But what she does not see is that she needs help of her own. In Sharon's case it's ironic because her character is a sophisticated, intellectual, employer who is a famous private investigator, who does not realize that there ia an imposter, impersonting her, who is sabotaging her reputation, her life. She is more concerned with assisting others with their problems, trying to get to the bottom of her own case. What is so intriguing about this story is that is gives a full description of each step of the process. Each maneuver that a character does or says is given a fulj detail step-by-step.

The inner journey from disbelief, to fear, to anger was especially rewarding as McCone gets down to finding out what is happening as someone impersonates her.

It does contain overviews of topography and early settlement that are somewhat useful. But Campbell, although he clearly tries not to be condescending, doesn't succeed. He's a missionary, and his purpose is to bring \\"modern civilization\\" to an underprivileged region. In discussing how he wants to do this, he never really comes to grips with the unique cultural heritage of the people he's talking about and the ways in which modernization -- his version of which is a sort of clean-cut, upright, Protestant Capitalist dystopia -- would endanger that.

It's hard to single one out as the best on the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen To The Band","review":"I've listened to this CD on numerous occasions, and the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate it. For the fans of classic Monkees' music, this CD may not be for you because it carries a very modern sound and edge to it. This is a labor of love produced and written exclusively by Mike, Mickey, Davy, and Peter, hence the title. The updated version of \\"Circle Sky\\" catches you off guard at first because of the industrial strength electric guitars, but the purpose of the track is clear. These Monkees are in it to win it. Unfortunately, this disc is probably the swan song of this group.

Much of the problem was the writing-- for me part of the Monkees will be a library of songs by the great writers of the time. Mike fit in that category, and Peter had his moments. Sadly, Mickey and Davey simply don't have much of anything special to add. In retrospect, I'm not sure how I expected this album to work. Nostalgia? Can't ask guys to play as if they haven't gotten decades older. A step forward? Being on the cutting edge is not exactly the Monkee legacy. Ultimately this just doesn't much work.

This film proved a fitting choice. Taylor plays boxer \\"Killer\\" McCoy, a boy from the slums who rises quickly as a prize fighter, and who along the way must contend with an alcoholic father, the accidental death of his mentor, manslaughter charges, rigged matches and the kidnapping of his girlfriend. The cast is great, particularly Frank Morgan as Taylor's father, and Taylor himself delivers an assertive and believable performance. The Crowd Roars would easily be among the top ten Robert Taylor films. The unrestored picture on this DVD-R from Warner's Archive Collection is a little soft and grainy with some film damage, but on the whole it's an acceptable standard. There are no extras, not even a trailer. The disc is Region free.

Not to say that books that ramble are all boring or not good to read, but this one definitely is."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've enjoyed an enema more.","review":"I have to admit that I was \\"taken in\\" by the \\"Winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature\\" mention that graced the cover. Having never read a Coetzee novel, I thought this would be a fine start.It wasn't. It was nowhere near a fine start, or a fine anything. To say that this book is the equivalent of mental masturbation is an understatement. For a literary genius, the main character, Elizabeth Costello, is about as interesting and engaging as a \\"Charles in Charge\\" rerun. Though at least a \\"Charles in Charge\\" rerun has a plot, which this book fails to even consider necessary.The only joy I have gotten from this book, honestly, has been in loathing it. Oh...and from letting others know that this load of over-intellectualized crap should be avoided at all costs--ergo this review. And so I'm left to ponder what I'm to do with fine waste of paper, ink, and energy.Too bad I don't have a birdcage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"I have read Mr. Coetzee's literary criticism and found it worth the effort. He should stick to what he does well, which is not writing fiction. This is just barely a novel, only because the form is so broad that almost any long piece of prose can qualify. But it is not an interesting novel, though the main character might have been interesting if she were free of the shackles of the overwrought essays that Coetzee puts in this poor woman's mouth. If you have purchased this book, then I recommend that you read the last half, where Elizabeth is occasionally given a chance to come to life and not simply be a mouthpiece. If you are a teacher and want to punish your students for some good reason, make them read the first half.Elizabeth Costello"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fact or fiction?","review":"I honestly don't know. The press releases say Elizabeth Costello is a novel that pretends to be a biography, but many critics swear it's Coetzee's biography dressed up as fiction, even tho the protagonist is female while the author, of course, is a man. All I know is that it's a damn fine piece of writing.The setup is that Elizabeth Costelly, an Australian writer whose fame is based on an early piece of work about Ulysses' character, Molly Bloom, cleverly educates us to issues of race, honesty, humanitarianism, and deception in Africa through \\"eight lessons\\" which sometimes read like lectures or debates.It's not an easy book, and Coetzee's bleak outlook comes through in the writing, but it's worth the effort. It's a book I'll keep, as I believe I'll get even more out of it on a second reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Massive Disappointment","review":"J.M. Coetzee is one of the best writers that I have ever read. His winning of the Nobel Prize was fully justified. However if this disaster of a \\"novel\\" had been released a couple of years ago, it's doubtful that the Nobel jury would have awarded him anything.For this isn't really a novel, it's a repackaging of a Coetzee's lectures from over the years. He's constructed a completely unconvincing framework to present these lectures with the result being a horribly boring and absolutely crushing experience.How could such a great writer release such a sorry book? It is almost as if he decided to conduct a writing exercise rather than a novel.Read \\"Disgrace\\", \\"Youth\\" or \\"Waiting For The Barbarians\\". Do not waste your time on this nonsense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ageing AlterEgo rants","review":"This book was a gift to me, and I was excited by it. Then I started reading. The first chapter was totally engaging and I expected to really enjoy it. Then the rants started. Others have characterized this as philosophizing, but I don't think it deserves such a complimentary description. The book is not a novel, but a collection of lectures by an ageing woman who has apparently lost her writing touch, is intensely worried about her mortality, and frequently in the company of people who suffer from the same problem, and have \\"sold out\\" to the lecture circuit. Sounds like the author to me. When I pick up a novel, I actually would like to experience good character development and at least a little plot. Philosophy and theology are well discussed in many novels. This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"an overly cerebral, boring mess","review":"I have read some wonderful novels by Coetzee, and so without hesitation I purchased 'Elizabeth Costello'. What a mistake! 'Elizabeth Costello' is really not so much of a novel but rather a forum for the other to pontificate on a whole slew of life and death philosophical matters. Such verbage might be of interest to the top 0.1% of the populace with multiple doctorates and too much time on their hands. For everyone else it's simply the sort of book that screams out \\"don't read me!\\".Bottom line: maybe better served as fodder for a doctoral thesis?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A rip off","review":"Is it my imagination but was this author just trying to put every interminible, radical commencement speech he ever heard into bookform and use the most uninteresting character in all of literature to be the speaker. Because it was mercifully short, I read it to the end to see if somehow he let his readers in on this ridiculous joke but alas, it ended how it began. Incredibly boring!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreadable.... really....","review":"I am not an idiot, I was attracted to this book because of the awards it has won. I have read the world's finest literature in my almost 50 years, and enjoy much of the Times Bestseller List selections, plus an eclectic collection of other literature. I enjoy complex character development and rich language.... But, I simply found this unreadable. Period. Just me you say? My best friend who is a reading teacher, book club member and literature enthusiast did not get any further in this novel than I did. As I post this someone has a used copy for sale for $.05. I rest my case. Besides, what kind of author places their name at the top in bold fancy writing and the book title in plain print at the bottom? It's the same on the spine. I thought the book was titled J.M. Coetzee.... <sheesh> PS: this is the only negative review I have ever been compelled to write!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading as Fiction","review":"I read J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace and was blown away by its powerful prose. I believe wholeheartedly that J.M. Coetzee is deserving of his Nobel Prize. I started to read Elizabeth Costello and couldn't even finish it because I was so bored. There's no real story to this book. I'm not sure why its classified as a work of fiction. Its not fiction, its a mish-mash of J.M. Coetzee's essays and ideas, collected under the guise of a \\"story\\". People will buy this book wanting some semblance of a plot or forward moving action and they'll be disappointed, just as I was. I really tried to slog through it all the way to the end (its a slim volume), but I couldn't. Mr. Coetzee is no slouch and he's no dummy ... I'm just not sure this was the right vehicle for getting this type of material out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Encouraged by the joy I had from \\"Disgrace\\", I jumped at this new Coetzee book. Unfortunately, I find it extremely tiring to read and for half of the time, I had difficulty following the arguments which incidentally are not very universal. There are only a couple of chapters which I find slightly more interesting. Perhaps, this is due to my not being very much in-tune with philosphical writings. I think I will be better off sticking with memoirs and fiction and not try to read a half-fiction, half-biographical work."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Ponderous Read","review":"Although quite a few paragraphs were poignantly written, I honestly did not get major chunks of this book. The nuanced philosophical discussions & historical references were beyond my level of sophistication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written tiresome intellectual exercise","review":"I found it a labor to navigate through Coetzee intellectual obstacle course. Don’t get me wrong, it’s not entirely bad, well written and some of the topics of her lectures peaked my interest, but many were long and tiresome. I kept waiting for story to lead somewhere but it never happens. If you like a story with a cohesive storyline this isn’t the book for you. The main character reminds me of an old fish flaying on the deck of a ship, gasping its last breath. Hey we all feel like that sometimes in our life, I just don’t enjoy being subjected to it for 230 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pedantic and boring (most of the time)","review":"as much as I'd like to be cerebral and enlightened, i must confess that this book bored me. the writing is high-minded and lovely, but the novel's basically formatted as 9 \\"lessons,\\" or lectures, and after about the 3rd lecture, i lost interest in the preachings. elizabeth costello was interesting when she clashed with other people - her son, her daughter-in-law, other authors - but during most of the book she simply digressed, unchallenged. i'm giving it 2 stars for coetzee's prose, which made me talk and write better while reading this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for display, not much for playing with","review":"I purchased this little fellow in Prague after being given the Dragon for Christmas. It's a remarkably detailed piece, with an amazing level of historical accuracy in the armor and armaments of the 14th/15th century. It's made of highly durable plastic, and overall it's rugged enough to withstand the rigors of entertaining youngsters. I bought several other members of the Schleich Knights series for my two nephews, aged 4 and 6, so there is minimal concern that the detachable parts could be dangerous for young children. The pieces come in two opposing camps: the Red Fleur de Lis, and the Blue Lion, and each piece has a corresponding piece in the other, with somewhat different design and graphics. This reflects an impressive variety in styles of armament and armor of the period, and vastly improves the educational value of the series. This piece is the most bland of the series, and it's \\"rival\\" piece is uncharacteristicly identical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was expecting much more from the HABA brand. These blocks are not ideal for 3-6 year olds at all. The blocks are way too small to be used by those little fingers. This is not an educational toy, its an exercise in frustration. I mean come on-- a block sized 1 inch? We have the Melissa and Doug architectural set and that by far is a better value and quality than these. You can actually recreate some of the designs M & D show on the back of the wooden storage box. Good luck actually trying to make a medieval castle. I would not recommend any of the HABA building blocks for any kid under 6. Its just not a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"One armed boxer aka the chinese profesionals","review":"This movie was one of the early kung fu classics.

And worth the wait!!","review":"If you like Diamond Rio, then you are going to like this album. There is a great variety of music from balads that make you choke back tears (\\"We all fall down\\" and \\"I believe\\") to more traditional country sounds (\\"Something cool\\" and \\"If you'd like some lovin'\\"). The song \\"Beautiful Mess\\" reminds me of a song from the band The Mavericks and its very catchy. \\"Rural Philharmonic is also a signature Diamond Rio instrumental. I really like Diamond Rio because they seem to get better and better with each album they release. This album definitely stands up there with all their great albums such as \\"One More Day\\" and \\"Love a Little Stronger\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much \\"instrument\\", not enough \\"voice\\"","review":"I was drawn to buy my first Diamond Rio CD by their incredibly tight, incredibly beautiful vocal harmony. This CD is really disappointing. The album is terribly over-orchestrated. So much so that the group really looses showcasing their vocals. I wish they would just do a freakin' \\"accapella\\" CD! This CD is just to \\"quirky\\" for me. I think they need to just pick a flavor & stick with it. They need some new, fresh writers, producers & managers. They've really cashed in on their ballads. I don't know why they try so hard to go away from that. They're really going to loose it if they don't hone in on what they do best...accenting their \\"vocals\\" & choosing great material."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Disappointing!!!","review":"I was soooo looking for a COMPLETE album of Diamond Rio songs, but instead I only got ONE-Beautiful Mess. And that kind of describes this album. One beautiful song and the rest is a mess.I agree with others that outside of one song, they seemed to have made up an entire ablum on the spot with no care to put the Diamond Rio harmony signature on the it. I would not recommend this album to anyone. The two stars is for being able to play the first song over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This might be the least favorite cookbook I ever bought on Amazon.

But to someone who has never heard of mimi smartypants and has yet to experience her incredibly smart and funny meanderings -- they are in for a real treat.Like her online entries, this book is probably best savored in small bites, not read straight through. It is pretty dense and sometimes repetative with its themes-- as most peoples lives tend to be! This is not a smack against the book, but rather an observation.Overall, whether or not you're a fan (yet)... its definitely worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mimi Smartypants","review":"I can't count how many times I was laughing out loud while reading this book.

I was expecting something more on the lines of \\"Bridget Jones;\\" something witty with a story that is easy to read with a glass of white on the deck enjoying the summer breeze. When you read the description on the back of the book it declares: \\"Get ready world - because Mimi's going to explain it all to you!\\" I'm not sure what happened here, as nothing was explained merely commented on in that annoying judgmental attempt at sounding witty. I, like the author, am unable to put down a book, even if it is miserably horrible. If you value your reading time, please do not pick up this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely beautiful","review":"This is a fantasic recording.

The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the awesome graphic. It was like watching 3D animated cells rendering. Ghost in the Shell's best is second to the technical visual of this film. Sadly, the plot and storyline was not as innovation or spectacular at all. It felt like watching an average Hollywood's film that regurgitated other themes, plots and ideas from other movies and reused it. Like another reviewer noted, the character and facial expression felt like \\"Reboot,\\" which was first generation computer animation in the US.Simply stated below average directing, story-writing, but even with top notch animation still makes this hard to recommend to the average viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"very underwhelming","review":"I got on an anime kick after seeing the Ghost In The Shell movies (first one is promising, second one is excellent). Appleseed doesn't stand up in terms of artwork or storytelling. The characters' personalities and physical movements are both painfully wooden. The storyline struck me as pretty stupid too, but I'd probably have liked it more as a teenager. I sat through the whole thing, but only just."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"The animation was horrible. The characters have little to no facial features (and thus no expressions) at all. The voices don't always correspond to the movement of the character's mouth--which is very annoying.Characters move mechanically--the arms and hands all move together as one piece--no fluid motions.Even the physics of the movie are poorly worked out--most of the guns have no recoil at all yet send bad guys flying across the screen at point blank range.I will note that in the scenes without humans--the animation is amazing--very nice. However, this amounts to nothing when the human characters are so poorly done.In summary, once you begin watching this version, you will likely become annoyed and start nitpicking it apart.Stick with the 1988 version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big dissappointment to fans of the original manga","review":"This \\"feature\\", if you can truly call it that, completely broke, splintered, and mutilated the story and narrative set fourth by the original, multi-layered, EXCELLENT manga by Shirow Masamune.

This review includes nothing else besides this lone fact and I assume you can look to those other reviews to see if you would like this anime or not. As far as I can tell the case is made out of some very high quality painted plastic (similar in shape and design to a tin collectors item like the Akira Special Edition release or Iria, but obviously not tin.) I was extreamly dissapointed when I recieved this plastic case that marketed itself to me through a big lie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Remake","review":"I now know that anyone who has seen the first movie in 1988 is dying to find out how to get a hold of the molester for his crimes committed to this Remake. It is astonishing how the creators of this flop have never seen the first movie. This remake does not hold true to the nature of Appleseed. It ruins anyhope for a 2nd film and any potential Appleseed may have had. True fans Everywhere are questioning wheather or not they should erase this traumatic event from there lives. I have never been so horrified to see something massacered in such a manner. They have destroyed Appleseed and everthing it stands for!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another cliche anime movie","review":"Appleseed suffers from the problem most big budget, CGI enhanced anime theatrical releases have: Gorgeous visuals, but a incomprehensible story filled with dull cliche dialog.

Because I too noticed this, it irritated me so much that it distracted from the film. This in turn prevented me from enjoying the highly polished action scenes or any type of body movement you see the characters make.I commend them on a job of trying to break the barriers of animation to forge new grounds. But please keep moving it along till the characters have some weight and a more natural movement going for them.

Perhaps this kind of high tech backgrounds and lazy character design are the future of modern anime? This would make it much like Vexille, although Vexille's character design's are a little better - although I don't like Vexille's use of the lazy man's form of anime, ie: paint over motion capture with pastel-like human faces.

Movement is smooth as silk, and realistically rendered; character interaction with background and surroundings is perfect. The storyline is well-written and the characters are rounded and believable. Even the dialogue, a perennial weak point for anime, is excellent.The only thing that lags here is the voice-over work, another area in which anime suffers as a whole. Perhaps this is because all the development money on these project is typically spent on artists and rendering equipment. The work of anime voice-over actors (especially English ones) is of generally poor quality and Appleseed is no exception.Appleseed instantly became a top-5 item for me, equalling and in some respects, surpassing the Ghost in the Shell saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"This blows!","review":"I installed this to my VW Jetta and it was whistling at high RPM.

There were really now major drawbacks to this method. But at times it's simplicity can be a bit tedious to someone who has done pattern designing and tries to skip steps or not follow the instuctions closely. Other then that.

I tried using the measurements to adapt this method but then I was all on my own. Also, the instructions about how to go from \\"smoothing out excess\\" in the initial fitting to actually placing and making the darts is sketchy in the extreme. Again, I was on my own there. There's lots of good information in this book but don't think it'll allow you to stop buying patterns to start from. After making two \\"muslins\\" for the \\"basic skirt\\".

But it's nothing to write home about. I never, ever made a pattern before, and this book didn't help very much. While it has a moderate amount of patterns, they are all variations of one another and the diagrams are very, very sparce. They illustrate the \\"basic\\" pattern and show you how to spread it out to make a \\"new\\" pattern. It isn't very clear, especially to someone who has no training in design whatsoever.

I've already spent endless hours shaping big pieces of square fabric into patterns and thought that this book would save me some time from doing that, but esentially, it doesn't...I was still screwing around with big pieces of fabric darting them everywhere in order to make them fit even AFTER I was done drafting the slopers in this book.....it's just not worth it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and bad illustrations","review":"Very amateurish written book.

I would love to see this book reprinted though with colorful illustrations, instead of the black and white drawings which make the bulk of its illustrations.

I've listened to other keyboard recordings (Angela Hewitt, Murray Perahia), but this recording appeals more to my taste. Many pianists (and not Andras Schiff), make the mistake of using way too much pedal when playing Bach's music, Gavrilov's use is subtle without taking anything away from the harpsichord style that it was originally intended for.

This is music for anyone who loves to sing and dance to Italian music. It even has the only Italian recording to reach #1 in the U.S.: \\"Volare\\".

Usually at the end of a semester, I sell my textbooks to help pay for the books I have to buy the next semester. I didn't sell this book. It is too valuable of an asset. The book is a great text for any student thinking about entering an education program. It's divided into fifteen chapters with topics ranging from teachers and teachnology to how schools are financed to social problems affecting students to the history of American education. The book is well written and researched and is full of useful tips and advice. I learned a great deal by reading through this book and highly recommend it for any student pursuing a career in education. The CD-Rom that came with the text is full of many more pictures, articles, charts, graphs, and links and makes a great supplement to the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thievery steals my heart.","review":"This album is a bit of a departure from \\"The Richest Man in Babylon,\\" but I doubt you'll miss the change. The emphasis is back on world beats and smooth electronic sounds. Gone are the haunting vocals of Emiliana Torrini (from Heaven's Gonna Burn Your Eyes), but there are some great appearances by other artists like Perry Farrell (Jane's Addiction) and The Flaming Lips. For my money, this album is not as beautiful as previous entries in the Thievery discography, but it is a nice downtempo album that emphasizes the duo's talent at making music and not just making sounds.If you're looking for a repeat of \\"The Richest Man in Babylon\\" you might be initially disappointed, but don't let that deter you from picking this album up. If you're a longtime Thievery fan, then you know what to expect and this album delivers in gold."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth getting.

The following \\"The richest man in Babylon\\" was a step back with the same use of chords and beats but this is too much! Reggaeish stuff mostly. Except the track with David Byrne that sounds fresh despite being very typical (Once in a liftime style) the rest is absolutely dull and good only for joint smokers.

Thievery has lost their way thru the unique and unsual genre of downtempo/lounge/drum&bass. Their first album...Sounds from the Thievery Hi-Fi was mind-tripping...it is to write history books upon. And the B sides that joined the album together were awesome as well; you can not find a print of it unless you are willing to pay $50-100 for each EP. That is how tight they use to be.

I had one of their previous CDs (couldn't even tell you which one, since it's long sold) and it didn't do much for me, but this one is a keeper. It's got a lazy, trippy feel to it throughout. They get inspiration from a bunch of different psychedelic influences, and somehow melt it all together to make it work as a whole. Several very strong tracks here that will burn into your synapses, yet you can also enjoy it at low volume while doing something else. Cool stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid entry in the Thievery canon","review":"Although it's not their first album, \\"The Cosmic Game\\" is easily the most hyped of the lot. That's great for the band; odds are more people will pick it up, but it would be a disaster if the first album they picked was a washout. Thankfully, it's far from a washout.The guest stars are at times impressive (Perry Farrell), inconsequential (The Flaming Lips), and downright horrible (David Byrne), but it's the no-names like Gunjan who make this album worth owning. It's got enough lounge music, enough world/ambient fusion, and enough of what made their previous albums so good, that it's not only a good starter for newbies, but it's solid enough for the hardcore fans to accept, even if it's not as outstanding as previous albums.*Special note* My Asian tour edition comes with \\"Babylon Rewound\\" free of charge, and as far as I know, is only available as an import. Well worth it for the bonus cd alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thievery Keeps Getting Better","review":"This is already one of my favorite Thievery Corporation CDs.

This book appears to be written by an accountant for accountants - it goes into excessive detail without ever addressing the needs that an investor has. I was looking for a relatively simple, straightforward book that addresses stock selection on the basis of information gleaned from financial statements. This book claims on its back cover to \\"show stock market investors how to profit from the knowledge of professionals,... \\" It doesn't do that. It goes into endless, minute detail about statements but never relates it to stock selection. I feel ripped-off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written by a professor, for other professors","review":"This book was a huge disappointment. It is overly technical, dense, and difficult to read. The author uses technical language to such an extent that his information is circular. Technical language to explain technical concepts leaves the reader who is not already an accountant in the dark. Here is an example. \\"Assets are probably future economic benefits obtained or controlled by a particular entity as a result of past transactions or events. Future economic benefits refers to the capacity of an asset to benefit the enterprise by being exchanged for something else of value to the enterprise, by being used to produce something of value to the enterprise, or by being used to settle its liabilities.\\" (p. 24) If you think this kind of explanation is helpful, you might like this book.

Her family does everything to protect her, even having her join the Hitler Youth.Most books about World War II are written from the perspective of the Jews, or other victims of the Nazi's.

Mo Tucker isn't on this recording, John Cale left after the 2nd album, Lou Reed only sings on about half of the songs (Doug Yule sings on the others), and these songs are more pop rock than their signature experimental rock sound. I would give the usual Loaded release only 3 stars, but I give this one 4 because the bonus tracks are a big improvement.

The sizes and description were not clear, or it was changed after I ordered these. They were not even close. I needed them for DVDs and the size I got might hold a coin. The sizes are not clear. Be careful when ordering because these are very small!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money!","review":"These mailers are so thin they are useless. Came in a box that looks as if it was used several times. Packed terribly. Mailers were crushed and torn. These mailers are total JUNK. Do not waste your money! I was contacted by seller (Buyer News) after my review and offered money to take it down. I was also offered a full refund...which I never received. There product is awful and so is their company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price for these","review":"These are perfect for shipping out thin items, like small photos or trading cards, to keep them protected. As with most mailers the inside dims are less than the labeled size. These do seem a little smaller inside than the jiffy-lites, but they are sturdy and the glue on the seal is great, no need to overtape. They are not as padded as the previous jiffy-lite mailers I'd been using, but the jiffy-lites were very expensive per/mailer compared to these. These mailers also arrived pretty much \\"dumped\\" into the packaging box, but that doesn't bother me; it might concern the tidy, engineer mentality that needs to have neat stacks and bundles. You won't feel like sitting there and counting out 500 scattered mailers to make sure you received your entire shipment. But again, for the price, you get what you pay for, I got it and am extremely pleased. Shipped fast and arrived in excellent condition.

Most of the remixes on here are of a rap or R&B influence, hence guest stars such as Eve and Q-Tip, and you also get a disco-influenced remix done here by Jason Nevins (remixes for Janet Jackson, The B-52's and Run-DMC), which is my personal favorite. Upon first listen, I was not too impressed, but listen to this one a couple of times and you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best in a long while","review":"Ok, I have read them all. This is one of the best song that have come from the Artist in a long time. No I am not hatin' on him. I think he is a musical genius that has had problem finding his groove.

The critical part of latin is that it is an inflected language, that is, the words change with the meaning (amare, amas, i love, you love, and so on).The second CD is basically a list of phrases. Since no country in the world speaks latin anymore, phrases like \\"let's have lunch\\" and \\"I have a head ache\\" are about as useful as \\"puella et pisces capuit\\" (the girl and the fish fall).For 17.95, this is an adequate supplemental learning tool. It's hardly going to teach latin, and the sub title \\"Start speaking Latin Today\\" is certainly a misnomer. Save your money and get a copy of Wheelock's Latin and the Rosetta Stone software. Or better yet, take a class."},{"rating":"2","title":"good introduction","review":"For the person who knows nothing about the language, this is a good beginning. It gives a selection of the few remaining latin phrases and expressions that might ocassionally be encountered in daily life (with proper pronounciation). Immediately useful. The only drawback is that there is not usually enough time to repeat the longer expressions out loud before the text moves on. The recordings seem to have been done in one take (a la Ed Wood), when it might have better to do some of them over. Occasional stammer by the narrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"soso, could be better","review":"I am a beginner level. This one had multiple people speaking, both men and women.On a totally subjective note, no one had a voice that was too annoying to listen to.On another even more totally subjective note, it was a little annoying because it sounded to me like Latin with a strong American accent. Admittedly, I am not an authority on this and latin is a dead language, after all, with no classical Latin speaking Romans around to compare to.On a slightly less subjective note, what I want most on a language audio track is vocabulary and this one didn't have enough of that for me. Rather they skipped all the common latin mottos/legal phrases and given more straight up vocab."},{"rating":"2","title":"Myserty Thief at Pine Hollow","review":"Pine Hollows is holding its annual Mystery Weekend the riders will sped the nights in the hayloft and during the day they must try to solve a mystery conceived by Max himself.

It covers right topics but there are just too many errors everywhere. I agree that it seems no editor at all and they just cut-and-paste from CCO (There are places they even pasted to the wrong location!) It's really painful to read this book especially at first time. First, you need to GUESS what it's trying to say. Then you have to VERIFY whether it says is correct or not.This is what they say at the preface of the book: \\"...Each book is crafted with care and precision...\\" But it doesn't seem true to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very much lacking","review":"This book could have been much, much more than it ended up. I bought it without having read any kind of review and I definitely regret it. After having read a far superior book on ACRC (Semester Five Companion Guide), I have to say that this book lacks too much in detail for the price. There are numerous errors (which you can view errata on the Cisco Press web site, it's massive) in this book as well that can confuse the reader tremendously. I only buy Cisco Press books, but had this been my first, I may have reconsidered. Mark McGregor did a much better job writing the Academy curriculum."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is really all you need","review":"I purchased this book along with the Lammle book thinking they would be good together. However I found that this book is really all I needed to pass the exam. If you can gather all of the information from this book and apply it on the exam you will most likely pass.

Was there an actual editor for this book or did they just cut-and-paste from CCO? I'm sure that the ACRC exam will be a breeze for anyone who completes this book but caveat emptor is an understatement. If you actually want to learn something, as opposed to just getting another acronym on the business card, go to the lab and try as many commands as you can vs. what the book says."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tons of mistakes and grammatical errors","review":"Not nearly as good as ICRC.

From our pre-historical upbring, to the depths of space beheld in Jupiter, we are just a species who have actual done a few things. The music exemplifies this theme, for each individual choral voice in atmospheres is thrown into the background of stellar harmony. This CD is well worth the journey to obtain. When you first put it into the machine, to last stricking momnet of Hal, one is in pure rapture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful music for a movie","review":"2001: A Space Odyssey is one of the classic movies ever made. One of the things that made it so good was the brilliant use of classical music as a soundtrack. The Blue Danube and Also Sprach Zarathustra are classical masterpieces given new relevance in a modern artwork. I like to play this cd in the morning when I need to get myself mentally focused for the tasks of the day. it also plays well in the afternoon or night. Stanley Kubrick not only possessed a genius for making movies but also for selcting soundtrack music to play in the backdrop."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Source Music Soundtrack Ever?","review":"I think so - the only serious competitors for the title that I can think of are the soundtracks for Tarantino's Pulp Fiction and Scorsese's Mean Streets.Stanley Kubrick was widely acknowledged as a master of selecting just the right music for his films, a gift that is nowhere better demonstrated than it is here.Can you really picture anything other than \\"Also Sprach Zarathustra\\" accompanying 2001's title sequence? Anything other than \\"The Blue Danube\\" running behind the film's first spaceflight scene?The reals gems here, however, are the stunning pieces by Gyorgy Ligeti. His \\"Requiem...\\" is probably the most disturbing piece of music I've ever heard; his \\"Adventures\\" (best heard in its unaltered version, which is thankfully included) among the most suspensefully comic.Highly recommended to anyone with a passion for great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"2001; A Space Odysses","review":"The album was perfect for the slide show I was creating with slides from 1968, the year the movie played in theatres.

It looked appealing the andean look, southamerican kind of philosophy. Unfortunately, when I opened this book, I realized it was more like guidelines how to win in life, how to succeed, avoiding all information about learning from mistakes, about inadequacy feelings or else, that as human beings we experience several times. I missed the heart.It appears at a first glance as appealing, but it falls immediately into superficiality and poverty of arguments.I wouldn't buy it again.

I was amazed how much pressure I got from the people selling this book, \\"I had to have it\\", \\"It will change your life\\"... it was more like a congregation than a normal author sharing his ideas. I was amazed to see how committed and single-pointed the staff was, as if brainwashed. Or maybe they get a certain comission. Otherwise it is difficult to understand such level of determination in just .... selling a book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The continuation of the con","review":"After being banned in all Latinamerica, now the author of this book goes to the United States to try to sell the unsellable.

This author's methods are simply disgusting.So if you are looking for something real and authentic, let me tell you that this is definetely not what anyone would be looking for.It would be so romantic and naive to beleive in these stories, it would be nice that all this would be true, unfortunately, it is not only not true, it is also an escalade of more and more lies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"It's incredible what marketing can do... To create the illusion and make it appear as true. In the back cover of this book, it says that \\"it is the most important book in the world\\".

If your child is a fan of the colorful Dan Zanes videos on TV, this video is not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD, format needs work","review":"The songs are great and not just for kids. My only problem is how the DVD is set up. Rather than have a Play All choice, you choose either to play the concert footage section or the videos section. Since there are only a few songs in each section, it is pretty hard to navigate when playing on a car's dvd player (unless it is a very quick trip, you have to stop the car and then navigate over menu to the other section - no easy way of doing this at all)."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves this video","review":"We've seen snippets of Dane Zanes on the Disney channel, so I bought this for my 3 year old boy who loves music.

The impact of sexual abuse on the primary victim was shown from various perspectives: male,female, juvenile, and adult. All of the victims were abused by people known to them and their families, rather than strangers. This video could be used in sex offender treatment to deal with victim empathy, or it could be used in a chaperone group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This is an awesome book that helps us find our own assurance in those times we feel God is not listening.

Although the premise for the book is good, I feel it was not well written. I also was somewhat taken aback by the verbal cruelty of Charles' parents. Basically they told him he wouldn't amount to anything and some might spank him, just for being shy. This is NOT the message I wanted to send my kid. In the end, Charles shows everybody what he's made of, and they say thank you, but no one ever apologizes to him. I suppose you could argue that this represents the real world, but wow, how harsh. Since my daughter loves the illustrations, we keep reading and I keep add-libbing."},{"rating":"1","title":"unfortunate name-calling in this book","review":"We are tried and true Rosemary Wells fans, and are familiar with most of her books. I borrowed this one from the library, and was disappointed to find Charles' parents expressing their frustration through language like \\"another mother would have spanked you\\" for not saying thank you or goodbye (maybe Wells could have the mother model good manners rather than threatening punishment)and the father actually calling him names for not participating in football, which Dad forced on him. What a negative approach to modeling the behavior you want your child to adopt, never mind giving parents the idea that it's OK to treat a child in this manner. Needless to say, I edited it heavily when I read it, then returned it to the library post haste! Not one for my library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"Nice book- but I presumed from the description it was tp support students that had trouble speaking - not that they were just shy - it is a nice story but shouldnt be advertised as an aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"I felt odd reading a book to my child, where the \\"parents\\" in the book get angry at \\"Charles\\" for not talking. I feel my money would have been better spent on a different book."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I have been looking for books to help my child with SELECTIVE MUTISM begin to understand his difficulties with talking in public. We like so many of Rosemary Wells' other books, so I was excited to find this one. Luckily, I previewed it first! The pressure from Charles' parents and the ridicule and name-calling because Charles won't talk are APPALLING. How is this supposed to help a child begin to feel good about themselves?? If anything, this book seems to want to shame a shy child into talking, not build his confidence. Sure, Charles rises to the occasion and saves his babysitter. In the end, though, he realizes no breakthrough and gains nothing from his heroic act. Do not read this book to your child if you want to help him/her get over shyness!"},{"rating":"2","title":"stellar","review":"stunning album. full of gorgeous melodies. might be best Jethro Tull/Ian Anderson ever released. favorite songs: habanero reel, little flower girl, secret language of birds, jasmine corridor."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL BEANS, DUDE!","review":"Wow, I even got to listen to this before my dad did! He ordered this disc a while back, and it came today. I unwrapped it, and OH MY GOSH! I can't believe this! Another great album! I love Ian's use of flutes, drums, and his overall style. He has such a way to flow back and forth from style to style! This album is a great example of his vesitility! Just makes me want to get up and dance!Another thing that got my attention was the use of art on the front and inside of the cover and the disc itself. Whoever did the art should be given a pat on the back as well. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK, IAN! HOPE THE NEXT ALBUM IS AS GOOD AS THIS ONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very good album","review":"It's easily Ian's best solo album -- not that there is very much to compare it to. Walk Into Light was terrible and Divinities was... fair. The best tracks on this one, though, rank up there with the best acoustic Tull from the '70s. Most of the songs are very good; occasionally, Ian's lyrics occasionally break down (iguanas don't \\"glisten\\"; ice cubes clink, they don't crash, etc.) as they are often wont to do, but mostly they are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't speak the language, but I love it anyway!","review":"The title track on this cd features yet another brilliant and catchy melody by Ian Anderson, which he has always had a knack for creating. Then again, that compliment could be applied for every song on this disc. This album is truly a joy to listen to. Some of the highlights include Sanctuary, Jasmine Corridor, Panama Freighter, and the instant-classic Circular Breathing. I would have liked to hear a little more drums and more electric guitar from guest Martin Barre (of course!), but the overall quality and accosutics of this recording are really excellent. You can hear many of the elements, such as great accoustic guitar work, classic Hammond organ, and of course, exquisite flute solos, that has made the music of Jethro Tull so special over the years. Another example of why Ian Anderson is a musical genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"A true work of art. ..","review":"Having always been a Jethro Tull fan, and having always admired Anderson's blending of rock and flute melodies, I was not surprised to find this album a true work of art. Very few musicians are able to make the transition from the fiery depths of youth to the airy peaks of maturity. Anderson stays true to his character, makes no false pretenses and orchestrates a beautiful piece of work. His musical wit reaches towards all corners of the globe as we are transported to such exotic locales as \\"Montserrat\\", or \\"The Jasmine Corridor\\". Tull fan or not, anyone lucky enough to have come across this album should not give a second thought to its purchase. This album is a fine addition to ANY cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wimpy, disappointing.........","review":"Although I am a big Ian Anderson fan, this CD has really disappointed me. I have had it for two weeks now, and I am already sick of it. While the music was nice, Ian's vocals left a lot to be desired. He, well, he sounds wimpy on this CD. He just sounds so unlike himself--- I was expecting more of a Jethro Tull-sounding Ian, not this nasally Ian. And I just don't get what the big deal is about the 'language of birds'---the song really turns me off. I wish I would never has wasted the money on this CD. I have his Divinities CD, which was nice, but the vocals on THIS one---AWFUL!! I should have bought some more Jethro Tull, NOT this bland redundant boring CD! (Sorry, Ian!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding?","review":"I have been a fan of Ian Anderson's for years, but this cd is terrible. Not one single pleasant melody or interesting flute lead. And then to end it with one of my less favorite songs from his classical work, and...to top it off, yet another version of Thick as a Brick? What the heck for? A real shame as I was very excited about this project. And face it, his voice is shot. Maybe time to bring in some other singers on his music. At least Dot Com had some interesting music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Piece Of Work","review":"The Secret Language of Birds has so many strong songs, I'll just say that it is one of my favorite group of songs by Ian Anderson. This album with the follow-up, Rupi's Dance, represent some of Ian's best work. There are many \\"reminders\\" of earlier songs sprinkled throughout these newer works. As always the performance of the musicians is beyond reproach, and the quality of the recording and mixing earns \\"full marks\\". Finally, over the last decade Ian's flute playing(concert, bamboo etc.) reached quite another level. Once again....I wait in anticipation of Ian's next work."},{"rating":"2","title":"SECRET LANGUAGE SPEAKS VOLUMES","review":"What a GREAT CD! The title is somewhat deceiving, as the music is surprisingly accessible. I agree with other reviewers that this music is the best material Ian has produced since the mid to late 70's. It's like SONGS FROM THE RAIN FOREST, or MINSTREL IN THE JUNGLE. No cheap effects, just heartelt poetry and intricate, lush musicality. This album is a wonderful testament to the talent of the \\"Lee Marvin of Progressive Rock\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE SECRET IS OUT","review":"IAN ANDERSON'S new solo project is called \\"The Secret Language of Birds\\". It's no secret to life-long (Tull) fans that anything Ian puts his hand to will be great. This newest effort is no exception. The songs evoke such familar feelings that you know in two or three listens, the entire piece will be enjoyed forever and it will remind you that \\"life's a long song\\". The lovely \\"Caribbean\\"- like setting to the CD (Abum) whatever, makes you feel like your on vacation. Songs Like POSTCARD DAY and THE LITTLE FLOWER GIRL will make you smile. Martin plays on a few tracks as well. Coming so soon after DOT COM Makes it a great time to be a fan. I gotta stop now and go listen again. ENJOY it my fellow fans of Ian and (Tull too for that matter)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This is the solo album I have been waiting for! This is pure Ian. The Humor, The Intellect, The Melodies, The Structure and the overall feeling that, \\"this man is having a good time\\"! No dark blues laced gems or progressive anthems here, Just Ian's wonderful melodies. A must for any I/A fan or Tullster who enjoyed \\"Songs Form The Wood\\", The lighter side of \\"Aqualung\\" and Ians vocal sound from \\"Dot-Com\\". High points: Title track, Flower Girl, Boris Dancing and most of all the inclusion of Andy \\"Web-Page\\" Giddings and guest spots by Martin Barre and Tull Alum.

Meanwhile, mysterious strangers threaten her to leave poor Mo alone. She might, except dead bodies keep popping up, piquing her curiosity. This humerous adventure gives plenty of Morelli and Ranger, but Grandma Mazur gets less airtime than in the first two.

I'm not so crazy about the characters either.

This isn't even a guilty pleasure read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book! It was so much FUN!","review":"Janet Evanovich is a wonderfully funny writer!

As the Rolling Stone quip says, Mexican New Wavers predominate - resulting in a dated form of crossover. That said, the New Wave influence sounds fine in contrast to the hard rock flavors on a couple of tracks. Rhino took care to assemble songs that give lyrical space to socio-political themes, but they did not present us with the cutting-edge in Spanish-language crossover music, EXCEPT for the tracks by Los Fabulosos Cadillacs (who will hopefully go back to this vibe after their last concept album) and Mano Negra. That leads to the real problem with this compilation: most of the best fusions being achieved in Spanish- and Portuguese-speaking countries at this time are not based on 80s pop and rock styles. For all the attitude and energy of these bands, this disc fails to conquer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service for Calculus","review":"Book arrived in excellent condition as promised.

While I understand the exaggerations and over-dramatizations inherent in the shows, CSI:M had way too many \\"I'm calling BS on that!\\" moments. Also, actions of some of the characters at times, particularly Horatio, brought up serious doubts about their morality. Horatio letting the child molester in the theatre fall to his death was certainly not what you would expect of an honest police officer. And the scene where he and Tripp took a suspect out to a deserted area for a little street justice was just plain wrong.

However, as with every family you always have that one relative that no one wants to see show up at the family get-togethers! This would have been a great addition to the franchise except for two things, a lead character that can't act and only has three poses, and a story line that can't seem to stay on the winning track of crime investigation and instead routinely veers off into soap-opera territory. We live in one of the few areas that still do not get cable and there are too many trees to get satellite reception so we buy videos and online episodes. I bought the first two seasons of Miami hoping they would live up to their sister shows standards only to be drastically disappointed. The quality of the videos (DVDs actually) is excellent, so if you like this show then do buy them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed reading Ms. Frank's Reflections in the Nile both for it's story and the accuracy of the setting. Ancient Egypt was described in such detail I had to assume that Frank had done a great deal of research in the process of writing her book. Shortly before I purchased Shadows on the Aegean my younger sister succumbed to Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (CJD). This awful disease is an important plot device in Shadows on the Aegean. However, Ms. Frank does not portray the disease accurately and I found that I could not get past that. I developed a strong interest in the characters while reading Reflections in the Nile, and while Ms. Frank continued their story in Shadows on the Aegean I could not muster an interest in their fate in this sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fascinating take on the Atlantis legend","review":"If you like time-travel stories, this is certainly an excellent example of the genre. The author has definitely done a lot of research, and has created two delightful protagonists in Chloe and Cheftu. Which leads me to why this doesn't rate 5 stars--too much time spent on peripheral characters, and not enough on our hero and heroine! Pages would go by with no mention of the protagonists to the point where I wondered when they would return to the story. Aside from that, this is a very good series, and I'm looking forward to the next volume, which is due in August."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"Very confusing, a difficult read.

That being said, its hard to judge this one because Staind was still growing as a band when this was released. There are some great songs on this album, but its different from typical Staind because its just a different sound. Not all Staind fans will like this album, but many \\"hardcore\\" fans might. I personally love this album because its great to see where a band you grew up listening to came from. So I'd preview this album before you purchase it, especially for the crazy prices this CD is going for these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry...I don't like it...","review":"Personally, I like the other albums from Staind. I love \\"Dysfunction\\", I like \\"Break the Cycle\\", \\"14 Shades...\\" was tolerable, and I really enjoyed \\"Chapter V\\". However, even for a debut, \\"Tormented\\" just sounds inmmature. There's emotion, but I lost count on the how many times the \\"f-word\\" is not only mentioned on the album, but on each song alone. Then again, Fred Durst produced this band in the first place, so that probably had a lot to do with it. All in all, the album itself just flat out sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold up for an hour","review":"My dog Maddi took this thing apart in less than 30 minutes.

He prefers chasing his donut to chasing tennis balls and Frisbees. He typically waits for us to retrieve any tossed tennis balls he misses and he has trouble carrying back Frisbees due to his short legs. But he returns almost all donuts tossed to him (whether caught or not), which makes the play sessions as much fun for his human family members as it is for him.Update - January 2012Well, our last batch of 3 was just very bad. Each of them lasted 3 weeks. I put some photos up on the main page of the product. What used to be a very tough toy is now a joke. Sad, because my dog loves this toy.

Now to be honest my husband is picky, but I watch everything and I couldn't really find much value in this. it didn't grab my attention enough for me to keep watching. maybe it was great, but I couldn't watch it long enough to find out"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a serious reference work","review":"I purchased this tome in order to expand my knowledge of lesser known significant women throughout world history. But the book is more akin to a People Magazine's Annual list than an OED of women's history.The book gives short shrift to women from Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Its primary focus is on late nineteenth and twentieth century women from the UK and United States. The significance of each woman's contribution to society has no correlation to the length of her entry. Supermodel Claudia Schiffer is devoted more attention than Harriet Tubman and Sandra Day O'Connor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased report","review":"This book is way too biased. Tha book reads as though, the British did everything, the Americans took the credit. The British are good codebreakers, but a better balance of historical facts would have been good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was excited to see this book but was ultimately not very pleased. This book spent way too much time on personal recollections of housing conditions from some of the participants and too little on stories of the consequences of the code-breaking. For example, the shootdown of Yamamoto is the title of a chapter but it is covered almost parenthetically in it. It is told entirely from the British perspective. The Americans may have been too secretive with their allies but some perspective from the US participants was needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, Backroom Heros","review":"Even after the author explains how the decoding occured it still seems impossible that people with paper & pencil could decipher the codes. Impressive. About time these \\"backroom\\" heros were held up for admiration. At times a bit scholarly but an excellent read for any history or puzzle buff. Should be required reading in our schools--as an example of what can be done without a computer or pocket calculator."},{"rating":"1","title":"biased history","review":"this book only gives the british of the story, story which involvrd modtly US organizationsthe british have been first class breaking enigma, they don't need extra unwarranted congratulations for their work on Japanese codes"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff!","review":"I bought this book hoping to learn more about British cryptanalytic techniques or some new information concerning the British eforts in the Pacific Theater. I was very dissapointed! There is far too much personal fluff (who cares how a certain upper class twit dressed?) and not enough history. At times it also seems like the author expects the reader to somehow regret England's loss of its colonial influence in Asia. I suggest Frank B. Rowlett's \\"The Story of Magic, Memoirs of an American Cryptologic Pioneer\\" instead of this book for anyone interested in the details of WWII cryptology. While it only covers the American side, it offered much more information from a first hand perspective. Those who just want a light read should go for Simon Singh's \\"The Code Book\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"Scottish romances are my favorite, and this was my first Hannah Howell. I did not enjoy it. In fact, there were several times while I was reading it that I was certain this review would read \\"I only read part of this book\\". The story was not engaging and the characters dissected their \\"relationship\\" from every possible angle in every paragraph on every page - without ever actually moving it along. First she loves him but first wants him to love her, meanwhile he loves her but first wants her to love him. No one discusses it and no one acts on their true feelings. Bored already? Throw in some action-less ex's drama and there you go.My shirtless Highlander recommendations: Paula Quinn and Michele Sinclair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Great book for anyone who likes to read about passion, and romance and strong males with tender sides!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Highlander Romance","review":"This is my first Howell and it certainly won't be my last. What a great book! I won't rehash the plot as others have done so eloquently. Its well written, even if the highlander speak takes a bit of getting used to -ye ken? There's plenty of action, suspense, surprises and steamy love scenes. The secondary characters are fascinating and I love that there are sequels and prequels -lots of them. I didn't feel that I'm missing something by reading this one first (its sort-of smack dab in the middle). I'm looking forward to reading the others.I also enjoyed these highlander tales:Julie Garwood : Ransom, The Bride ( A MUST READ!), The Secret, Saving Grace, The WeddingPaula Quinn:Lord of Temptation & Lord of Desire (Both Excellent!)Kinnely Macgregor: Master of Desire, Claiming the Highlander, Born to Sin (FANTASTIC!), Taming the Scotsman, Return of the Warrior & Dark Champion"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHE DOES IT AGAIN!!!!","review":"I LOVE HANNAH HOWELL.... EVERY ONE OF HER BOOKS JUST GET BETTER.THIS ONE IS NO EXCEPTION.. IT'S FUNNY, SAD, AND FULL OF EVERYTHING YOU WANT IN A BOOK....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I was really excited to read this book, it got such good reviews. Howell's diction was great no doubt but the story was really slow. I almost didn't finish it, I even skipped pages and didn't miss anything of importance. It just seemed like a lot was happening in the book but nothing was really going on...if that make's since. The story just seemed to start dragging about have way through the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"And a hot wolf he is","review":"Hannah Howell was my first experience with historical romantic fiction...specifically 15th century Scotland. To say I was hooked would be a profound understatement. In the period of two weeks I bought ever book by Mrs Howell with the word Highland in the title. (a rough estimate was about 20 novels) The language was fluid but authentic yet didn't take away only added to the story. Especially the dialogue...who could have thought that words like...aye, wee, lass, bonnie and nay could be so enjoyable? While the main premise of the story is historical romance there are \\"wee\\" sprinklings of paranormal...which is my genre of choice. Mrs. Howell also does my favorite thing to find in books, characters that span several books.First as the protagonists then as secondaries in others. In the Highlands they are kinsmen or clan members. Loved it so much. Buy it you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WHAT WAS ADVERTISED","review":"THE SELLER SHOWED A PICTURE OF ONE ITEM FOR SELL. YOU THEN RECEIVED SOME THING ELSE.

VERY disappointing that this happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Hawkins - I'm no rock star","review":"While I have always enjoyed Tim Hawkins, I was disappointed in this one. I felt that some of it was inappropriate as I watched it the first time with my age 9, 11 & 13 year old grandsons, I realized I will be previewing future T.H. shows before the kids see them. We'll stick to Full Range of Motion and look for another comic we can feel confidant in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Tim's Best Work","review":"My family was abit disappointed by the DVD after really enjoying \\"Full Range of Motion\\". It also seems like the DVD was overproduced. Unlike \\"Full Range of Motion\\" where it was just Tim, his guitar, and a microphone -- \\"I'm No Rockstar\\" contained alot of lighting effects that I think actually took away from Tim's performance instead of enhancing it. But the DVD was still good for some laughs. But if you can only afford one DVD, buy \\"Full Range of Motion\\" instead of Rockstar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth it","review":"I was pleasantly surprised by this. A Christian comedian who was actually funny - sad how rarely that seems to happen (I'd actually recommend this to other people to watch). It wasn't \\"christian\\" humor so to speak either - just plain funny. Good mix between stand-up and his musical comedic stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Hawkins = Clean, Funny, and Brilliant!","review":"I would definitely recommend this to both Christians and non-Christians as Tim deals with both religious culture and older \\"pop culture\\" in his references. For those interested in sampling some of Tim Hawkins' comedic gold, you can visit his youtube page: [...] , or his website: [...]There's really not much I can say without spoiling the show, so go check out some video clips and get the DVD if you like what you see!And as a little side note for people who use their consoles to watch DVD's, this one works in the Xbox 360 but for some reason the PS3 gives an error. It's nothing to do with the region, but probably with how the disc is produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE HIM!","review":"Tim Hawkins is great fun for the whole family. His musings ring true as a parent and the kids just think he's hilarious. We've seen this one several times with family and friends and it's always great to see their reactions to his comedy. We all end up with sore stomachs from laughing so much...it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I've never heard of Tim Hawkins and after a recommendation from a friend, we watched this video of Tim Hawkins over the holidays and we never laughed so hard! It was so hilarious, I had tears running. And the nice thing, like some other reviewers have said, it's good, clean humor and just proves that you don't need trash to be funny. We thoroughly enjoyed this Tim Hawkins video \\"I'm No Rockstar\\", and we can't wait to view his other works as well. He's received a permanent place in our video collection now and has become one of our new favorite comedians!Funny, funny stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny","review":"Order shipped out fast. Tim Hawkins is the funniest guy ever. Clean comedy for the whole family. I would recommend to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love that it has no junk","review":"I'm sorry but he isn't funny. I bought 5 of his dvds in hopes that we can finally watch comedians without the filthe. He did make us laugh every now and then. I think it's due to being bored most of the time and hoping that he says something funny to justify the cost of the dvd. He could be funny. Brian Regan is funny and keeps it decently clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"An hour and a half of pure laughter!","review":"I love Tim Hawkins! He is hilarious from beginning to end....laughing to the point of tears! Laughter is good medicine and Tim Hawkins serves it up in abundance!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Humor","review":"I've seen Tim's DVD \\"Full Range of Motion\\", also sold here on Amazon, and it is quite hilarious. This newer DVD is not as funny in my opinion, but still is a great way to laugh! Tim makes fun of the way people say and do certain things, often exaggerating but always funny. He ties his jokes together throughout the performance, so the whole show flows nicely. He also sings more-or-less well known songs, but he changes the lyrics. If you need a good laugh, try this DVD! Tim Hawkins is no rockstar. As he says, the only difference between us and him is he has a microphone... and talent.
