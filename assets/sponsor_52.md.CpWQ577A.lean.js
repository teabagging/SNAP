I can't explain without giving away some of the juiciest details, but it is a truly captivating story! This was my first attempt at this author. I only for it because it was free, so I want expecting too much. But it took me by surprise on how well she thought out the characters and forced them to think like actual human beings. I only have this four stars because I wish there was more of a back story of Jeff. He's a main character and wish Claire had elevated more on him and his mind set.

There was no mystery in the ghost story. And I found Joys angst over Jenny to be borderline psychologically abnormal. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised at such good reviews","review":"This had the potential for being a good book. But alas, the main female character was so neurotic and had such wild mood swings she really came off as being somewhat unbalanced. The main male character was too good to be true .. he put up with sooo much crap for her and just kept on understanding and accepting everytime she turned on him, which was pretty much every time she saw him. About half way through the book it was apparent what the big mysterious secret was - it was so very obvious that I thought it must be a red herring, but nope, the obvious was the obvious. As to who the bad guy was? That was fairly easy also. Were the characters written to be more balanced, it would have been a much better book. Glad it was free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long Time Coming","review":"Didn't like it, I deleted it. It was too slow developing the story, didn't hold my interest.

I was not sure what to make of it at first. It is very clean, and seems to fit in with what a lot of people go through in real life. But I was NOT prepared for the ending. That took me by surprise and I just absolutely fell in love with the storyline and its characters.

This is a feel good book that will leave you with a warm heart at the end. Good Job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jeez, get a grip","review":"The heroine in this novel would have benefited from some intense therapy in the 18 years since her best friend died. It's remarkable that so many memories came back in the course of a few weeks, when she was able to lock them away for almost two decades. All the supernatural interference was merely a plot device meant to push the two main characters together. I like mindless escapism as much as the next person, but this was entirely too predictably rote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the book","review":"Excellent story line.

It was heartwarming, funny and mysterious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Average Horror Film","review":"Beyond Remedy is a German horror film shot in English, released as a DVD in America. The majority of the cast is German, save for the film's \\"star\\" Rick Yune, better known as Johnny Tran from the Fast and the Furious.There really isn't anything about this movie that stands out. The story and dialogue plods along slowly, there's an overemphasis on spooky music, and the end monologue by the lead actress is painfully hokey. It's neither scary nor interesting, the only reason why I'm giving it two stars instead of one, is because of the job done on the lighting and set design.The hospital setting is foreboding, and lends to the vibe that the director was obviously going for. The cafeteria scene is like something out of the first edition of Far Cry, which is something I appreciated. Otherwise, this movie is pretty forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done!","review":"This book is a funny and strongly compelling collection of stories written by Gerald Durrell - conservationist, author, audacious story-teller, hero. His wife, Lee Durrell, has truly stepped up to the plate and put together a marvelous representation of Durrell's work, taking up the cause of conservation as ably as her husband could have wished. This timely book is a must-read for anyone who lives on our fragile planet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sour Grapes","review":"Four out of five brokers do not last five years. That is why the \\"salesmen\\" get weeded from the people who have their clients interests at heart. The author is one who got weeded out.

Needless to say I am very dissapointed.In my entire life I have never gained so much weight and it's not due to my diet or lack of exercise.

By reading this book, I have found a way to heal the wounds from the past by being able to forgive the Church--really the poor messengers it sent! This book is funny, informative, and timely. I am crazy for the way the authors explain years of theology in street terms. I found out alot more about being Catholic from this book than from all my years going to Catholic School and Church.

Within one page, the authors indicate Roman Catholics genuflect before sitting in the pews to 1) Honor the Presence of the Lord or 2) honor the altar. Which? I thought is was to honor the presence of the Lord. Another inaccuracy: they say G.K. Chesterton spoke on radio shows in the UK in the 1930s and 1940s - but Chesterton died in 1936. Do they mean C.S.

I think not, even though all the arguments he uses to justify the title \\"Abortion: It's a tough choice\\" would apply equally well to the others. The trouble with some dissenting Catholics is that they insinuate what they dare not say outright. The offending title can be understood to mean that the \\"tough choice\\" involved is the decision of whether abortion is justified in a particular case.

Was first cautious however when there was no official \\"nothing against faith or morals\\" Nihil Obstat mark that usually accompanies Catholic texts. WHile there were many good insights made about the Church, there were also some unfortunate comments about contraception and women's ordination that simply lies outside the mentality of the Catholic Church's official teachings. Making such statements tends to weaken the case for the intent of the book as being a guide. With the popularity of the \\"idiots guide\\" series, this book unfortunately makes the title more fulfilling than its attempt to do otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belittles the Catholic Faith","review":"This book is filled with over-simplifications and errors about the \\"tribe\\" of Catholicism. It questions the literal virginity of Mary by implying that her virginity refers only to the fact that she is unmarried), claims that tradition chages with time (Catholic doctrine develops over time, it NEVER changes), calls Teresa of Avila a Zen Master (and refers to Madonna as a modern-day mystic). It misinterprets the role that personal concience ought to play in Catholic morality and generally encourages cafeteria Catholicism.

Any book that is trying explicate Catholicism and uses the silly politically correct B.C.E (Before Common Era) and C.E. (Common Era) instead of A.D. and B.C. cannot not be taken seriously. If you cannot acknowledge the birth of Christ as an historical marker and work to undermine such with newspeak then I question the value of the book to those interested in Catholicism.I became Catholic because of the enduring strength of the Roman Catholic Church.

I now attend Mass regularly, thanks to Bob O'Gorman's and Mary Faulker's page turner manuscript. I can accurately debate my Protestant friends and, as a convert, I am better informed about the Church than most cradle Catholics. This book compares the Vatican's official position on various issues with those of Catholics, themselves. I found it a breath of fresh air as opposed to more serious, \\"preachy\\" books.

The author does not seem to fully understand some Catholic traditions, such as genuflecting in the presense of the Eucharist, and also has a shaky understanding of dogma and doctrine. It is not for the Catholic to decide what doctine to accept and not accept; by professing your Catholic faith, you profess to believe everything the Church teaches. This slips by this book. They also makes their biases known with their language on topics such as abortion.Many people will read a book and accept what is in it as fact; I hope no one does that with this book.

Shafer did a super job of melding the main theories that scholars believe motivated Lucifer and a third of the host of heaven to rebel against God.I only gave it 4 stars because I was disappointed that Shafer used the \\"dumb blonde\\" theory to explain why Eve succumbed to the devil while portraying Adam as the innocent victim of Eve's nasty disposition. There are far superior interpretations of the book of Genesis and the fall of mankind then that one. So that was disappointing.Other then that it was a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accessible introduction to low-dimensional topology.","review":"This book treats (geometric) topology of dimensions two and three together with necessary machinery of group theory. The account is accessible if you have the basic knowledge of general topology and algebra. It well illustrates the inherent difficulties in low-dimensional topology. A mild surprise with this book is that Novikov's proof of the unsolvability of the word problem is fully described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits perfectly","review":"I've just changed my old OEM 1994 civic coupe A/C condenser for this TYC Condenser, it fit perfectly.

I did not want that type of workout, so wanted to return it. I still have the dvd, as Amazon has been HORRIBLE with their customer service and the return!!! I had problems with the return information on the internet, so contacted cust. svc. - they have repeatedly said the only way I can return the dvd is by a return label that they will mail to me immediately.

She is incredibly perky and can get annoying, but she really knows what she's doing!I pretty well have every Denise Austin video out there and snatched this one up as soon as it came out. I was not disappointed, it's a great overall workout. My only complaint (and it's a small one!) is that I like having toned arms and this video doesn't focus on the arms as much as I would like. Overall, it's a fabulous core workout and it's a bit more challenging than the \\"Shrink your Female Fat Zones\\" video it's often compared to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great!","review":"Denise Austin does a great job!

It contains just a bunch of articles about different chess topics, illustrated (mainly) with the author games. The articles are rather interesting and well written, games well annotated but ... it is hard to find the idea behind the book as a whole.I would rate it higher if it had title like 'Alex Yermolinsky selected chess articles'. But this book does not offer any organized plan of work towards reader chess improvement (ohh, there is suggestion to study own games on the beginning). So I am just disappointed after buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite chess book","review":"As an 1800 player looking to drastically improve, this book was an inspiration. What makes this book so unusual is that the author is able to give such an honest appraisal of how he slowly improved from a 2200 14-year old into a GM at the age of 34 and then a 2700 player. It is a series of steps to ever higher plateaus which require a radical change in training plan to advance to the next level. His explanation of the essential differences between players of different strengths is beautifully clear and convincing.I own dozens of books but this is one that I know I will study in depth over a long period.I would strongly recommend to anyone who loves the game and would like to understand it more deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"While there are many books on the market regarding how to improve your chess skills, this one is truly among the \\"Best of the Best\\"! It was written by Grandmaster Alex Yermolinsky who grew up in The Soviet Union. He was not a prodigy, but worked extremely hard of his own accord to uncover the secrets of the game and bring about improvement. His work has inspired me to improve at the age of 64 and I highly recommend it to everyone because it is a \\"practical how to\\" set of improvement ideas. You'll learn how a non-prodigy applied himself to move slowly but steadily up the chess rating lists. He didn't skip any steps along the way and now you can learn what was required to achieve the steadily improving results he did. I found it a unique and fascinating work. Be prepared to \\"work\\" too as you read it, because its depth will require you to think hard to obtain maximum benefit...but it's well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book","review":"I am disappointed with this book.

When I first tested it, it was during the night time, however in a well lit room, but I couldn't see anything. I figured I could deal with that as long as it took good pictures during the day. When I stepped outside ,which was very bright and sunny, all I could see on the screen was white. I tried all the settings and still encountered a white screen. The only time I actually saw anything on my screen was when I was inside during the day.I brought it back right away, thankfully I had bought it at Wal-Mart and they were happy to refund my money.I hope anyone reading this review will take my advice and not buy this video camera.

It takes unbelieveable photos! The controls are different than the DSC-F828 but they are easialy learned. The lens is fantastic and low light performance is great. When using a high speed Memory-Stick pro or High speed compact flash card the time between shots is fantastic... just keep pushing that shutter button. The top mounted LCD is great for candid shots with the camera at waist level. The viewfinder is really great for those of us with eyeglasses.The battery life is incredible! I can't find the words to describe battery life, I get three times as many shots per battery than I get with the Sony DSC-F828. Sony claims it is the low power requirements of the new CMOS sensor. I don't know what it is but I like it.The colors are great, the reds are more red, the blues and yellows are bright and no washout.James hatsis (Sony Fan)James1@OconeeAirService.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Detail AMAZING!","review":"I have had this camera for a while now...and I Love it!

'Mediocre' describes it best.What I find odd is that nearly every single review on here has similar verbage with the same number of stars.Of course, authors would never post fake reviews to pump up their Amazon ratings.

I paid 75 cents for this book plus 2.50 for shipping. It wasn't worth it. There is some but very little useful information in this book and it is written from a woman's point of view. When the author does actually give useful information it is very brief and goes into little detail. I would say that 90 percent of the content of this book is useless.

I read a review for this book in USA Today and then looked through a copy that someone in my office had ordered and thought it would be a great gift.This book has a ton of useful advice and you can tell that it is written by someone who really wants to pass on the information.

I got one of these on sale for less than $10 delivered awhile back. You cannot use the light when it is plugged into either AC or DC and the instructions say wait for 5 minutes after you unplug it to use it. This light does produce a very bright beam of light but it only lasts for about 5 minutes.

It has an extremely bright light. I find it very handy for easily spotlighting a repair job or looking for what my dog is barking at in the back yard. I think it would be good for changing a tire.As the other reviewers note, it doesn't last very long between charges (mine is more like ten minutes than five), and it takes a while to recharge. So it's not very versatile, and certainly not something useful to illuminate a campsite or anything like that. But as long as the price is within single digits, it's nice to have around for quick spotlighting.My problem is, the wall wart transformer that came with it got mixed with some others, and now I don't know which one it is.

I thought the information contained on these CDs would be explanatory in nature so I could listen to them away from the bass and absorb some good information. In reality they are very short tracks with no real explanation of what's going on. I'm not sure who the market for this product is: if you are a skilled bassist you already know intervals and whatnot; if you are a beginner you know very little and need information.The beginning of the program advises you to not skip around because you will become confused and frustrated.

To compensate for the easiness of the workouts, I use heavier weights and hold 3lb weights in my hands throughout the cardio portion. That definitely helps.

I actually caught myself SMILING throughout the whole DVD because she was telling me to. Most of the pregnancy fitness DVDs on the market are about calming down and relaxing... yoga, etc. It's nice to actually stand up and do some cardio.The level of exercise is DEFINITELY moderate, but you can increase it or decrease it depending on the size of the movements you make.I appreciate that the routines are somewhat easier than normal DVDs - and my pregnancy brain appreciates that, too. I also enjoy that there is a weight-training section.I'd say buy it! Especially for that price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out for all stages of pregnacy","review":"You will use this video!

With Denise Austin, I was hoping for a bit of a challenge and also variety but after viewing the very first video workout, I really felt like I was working out to geriatric needs! I realized some moves are prohibited but I was not at all satisfied nor motivated to further continue Fit and Firm due to the monotony of the workout series. There are 3 workouts on her dvd which I didn't even bother with, I am back with Maya now just avoiding any moves that might be harmful"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Strenuous","review":"I thought the workout was a nice balance; not too easy, not too strenuous.

The toning portion of the workout was very gentle as well.

When I got pregnant I got this video to keep up my activity level. I really enjoyed it! It isn't that hard, but it does get you moving. I don't think that this should be the only working out you do during your pregnancy, but it can definitely be a good addition. I walked a lot during my pregnancy, ate healthy foods (sometimes a lot of healthy foods!), and I did this workout video. I felt great throughout my pregnancy, had an easy labor and birth, and quickly lost my baby weight without having to go gung-ho with working out. I recommend this video if you are an active person, and want to have something safe to do on those rainy days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I do the workout every day I would reccomend it to any pregnant woman no matter their fitness level.

Even though Denise wasnt pregnant the other lady was and she was awesome.

I wasn't avid with exercise, but I would get at least 20-30 minutes of cardio in 4 days a week - this DVD seems a little easy to me, but I like how much energy it gives me. I do not really care much for the cardio aspect of this DVD (I'm not a huge fan of aerobics).. but the toning is great! All in all, I'd buy it at this price just for the toning sections. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"not for advance preggos","review":"If you have been working out before becoming pregnant...this aint for you....I suggest working out with this from the beginning of pregnancy (dr. permitting)if you have never or hardly worked out before being pregnant and continue...you'll love it through out and may get bored with it...I love the fact that she does give two ways to do everything...less advanced to more advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I just did the twenty-minute workout and it was a joke. I'm not in the best of shape but it barely raised my heart rate and I made sure to follow all the directions and keep moving at all times.

Go w/ the Tracy Mallet Pilates, it's way better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Austin Fit and Firm Pregnancy","review":"This workout video is just enough for someone who already has an active life and wants an extra boost of energy. For those who are not as active, it will turn their energy levels around. Either way you can not over do it with this work out. She offers the both a modified version and a high energy version.I appreciate how she works different muscle zones during different trimesters. I am still pregnant and can not speak to the post natal workout.

It is incredibly easy and not at all challenging. I don't even break a sweat throughout the workout. Also, Denise Austin is incredibly cheesy in this video as she constantly reminds you, \\"You're doing something good for you and your baby!!!\\" Quite frankly, I want to punch her in the face every time she talks, perhaps it's the hormones talking (But I don't think so, judging by other reviews)! If you like cheerleader types, this might be a DVD for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout","review":"I really enjoy this DVD and try to do at least one of the 20 minute segments every day.

This DVD wasn't a workout at ALL for me. I mean, seriously horrible. The only way I'd recommend it might be if you're beginning your pregnancy as a completely sedentary/obese person, because it does at least get you moving- which is so important when you're pregnant.

However, it doesn't seem quite right that all Amazon did was take a free PDF off the web, [...] and run it through a converter, and then charge customers a dollar for it. At least make sure the conversion is good then. But it isn't, as it cannot rightly distinguish between line spacing and can not convert certain Spanish symbols like upside down exclamation points and question marks, and can't seem to convert quotation marks either.I have purchased plenty of Spanish language plays and books from KIndle precisely because I like the Kindle and especially its point-to-word dictionary functions.

I bought it with the intention of transferring some of my DVD collection over to my new video iPod. I discovered after purchasing Roxio dVD Copy 2 Premier that it does not copy protected DVD's, which made 99% of my collection uncopyable. I'm not a pirate, I just don't want to pay for movies in the iPod format that I already own. With a little further research, I discovered that Roxio was the only product of its kind that does not copy protected DVD's. There's more. I found 2 DVD's in my large collection that were copyable, neither of which I really wanted to put on my iPod. Just the same, I tried to do so. I followed the directions carefully and waited literally hours for Roxio to copy the movies directly to my iPod. After both times, when I looked in the Movie directory of the iPod--they weren't there! Needless to say, I'll never buy another Roxio product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & Troublesome","review":"This Roxio product has proven to be a real irksome piece of software.

The diet doesn't even start until after page 200!","review":"I thought I was getting a diet book & ordered it from my church's bookstore. I thought it would be based on Leviticus 11 & the instructions God gave for healthy eating. I've gotten to page 200, and all I've read about is how painful & disgusting GERD is and a bunch of lore about how the whole healthcare industry & vaccination shots are harming people. I've got an autistic son, so I've done tons of research on vaccinations & diets, and I've never seen such outrageous claims as this man has written. I'd be completely open to accepting what he wrote if there were any kind of citations or footnotes showing where science backs up his claims, but he quotes/ cites no such studies. The diet may be good, but I don't know since the book was such a complete disappointment that I quit reading at page 200... without even getting to the diet, still in his GERD saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"When reading this book I don't know if I'm reading the Bible or a diet book. The justifications for the diet just don't sound right to me. I need more scientific based conclusions as to why I should eat a certain food rather than \\"God says it's ok\\".

I manage a full time job so was not able to, for example, cook stock for two hours before even starting on whatever meal I had to make.I found my changes came to me by putting myself in a happier environment, becoming spiritual in the true sense of the word and eating an organic wholefood diet.Even if you are dying and desperate, there are much better things out there for you to try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although it has a lot of good suggestions, I found this book disappointing. The author states that vegetarian and raw food diet is dangerous, sounds like someone who has never tried this diet and have never had anyone who tried this diet around him. If author does not have any experience, it is pointless to talk about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting. But...","review":"The author's story is a truly inspiring and up lifting one. And as far as a translation of Judaic dietary laws into an approachable guide for modern Christians, this book is excellent. But it's just absolutely not pragmatic: financially, socially, or as far as natural cravings go. There's nothing wrong with enjoying modern culineary delights, so long as we don't over indulge. In my opinion, this author's view of food, though understandable because of his miraculous healing, is obsessive (because to follow the letter of this would require CONSTANT thought about meals), unrealistic (the financial constraints have been mentioned already), and rather judgmental towards those of us who feel no guilt in partaking of modern food in a reasonable fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amway on Steroids","review":"I am not knocking this diet.

Very convenient.","review":"This is your best option if you need an Xbox Live code right away, whether it be at 2AM or in the middle of rush hour. Most sites I've gone through send their codes through email which can take hours or even days at times. By purchasing through Amazon your code is displayed at the end of checkout for you to use or email.

You may be stuck waiting hours for it to process, just to receive a 25-digit number. Also, make note of the time you order. Amazon.com knows that this process is flawed, so they don't send an order confirmation and they only tell you the date of your order, not the time, so you can't easily point out how long it has taken. It's also not possible to cancel a pending order from your \\"My Account\\" screen. You have to e-mail customer service and wait for a response.These details should be disclosed ahead of time so customers can consider whether they'd rather sign up through Xbox Live directly, for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lied about price","review":"I was contemplating buying this item because it was $39.99.

He did say that after a year, my next renewal would go back up to $60 but that I could call and cancel just like I was about to. Then I will just purchase the Amazon version next year. Anyone else that is about to renew anytime soon may want to give this a try. I can't guarantee that they will continue doing this, but it is worth a shot if you are about to spend the money anyway. You can call xbox support at (800) 4MY-XBOX or (800) 469-9269.

I owned the XBOX so that I could take advantage of the exclusive game titles. The quality has significantly improved on the XBOX since I have owned the Arcade 2005/6 model , though I feel that the paid subscription service offers is more in the lines of a WINDOWS tax that must be paid on each new retail PC or laptop that one buys when LINUX is sufficient and free for most users to run simple programs and the like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do the ONLINE Code","review":"Do not purchase the online code option from Amazon!

It gets too expensive doing it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"So I bought this card because my account is about to expire. Not must to review only that XBOX should make multiplayer free, considering most of the time people are chosen to host games. Rarely are there games with dedicated servers, and if they are, you have to pay a subscription fee.Not to mention the prices they charge for virtual merchandise, that alone should be enough to pay for the xbox live service they provide and make a profit.But If you're like me and all your friends are on XBOX live, playing XBOX games, then you don't have a choice in the matter. You have to renew each year.Never automatically renew with the XBOX 360. You can always find one of these cards at retail locations or online for less then $50 which is what the XBOX 360 automatically charges each year. You just have to keep an eye out for them.

Sign up for bing rewards and download the app called \\"App trailers\\" and usen the referall code \\"gogish118\\" to help you get some points.

Intead of gaming being a solitary experience it is now possible to game with your friends remotely. There are risks to uncontrolled access to the entire gaming community so I would recommend Friend control for youngsters. 12 month membership is the best value. Amazon's everyday price is good but they also have regular sales also (usually the better sales are on the card instead of the code)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy","review":"Was cheaper than buying it in the store and was shipped fast.

I assume this has to do with Modern Warfare 3 coming out tomorrow, and pre-orderers getting discounts off codes and all... I don't know who's responsible for the price hike but it's unfortunate.Online codes can be a lot cheaper than buying cards online or at the store, if you catch it at the right time.

The 12 months of Xbox live should be nice, but only a little over one month in I can't say for sure.It would have been nice if Amazon could have delivered it faster, it took nearly a whole second to get hear!

This code does not work, and Microsoft has told us there is nothing they can do because they sent the code and our e-mail must have been hacked.

I'll admit that the main draw of even subscribing to Live is to be able to play games with your friends online - why would anyone else subscribe to this service?The answer? I watch Netflix.Waiting until one of these cards goes on sale is cheaper than putting down money on something (a Roku, a home theater PC, or any other Netflix-enabled device) that can let me access Netflix without a monthly fee.It angers me to no end that Microsoft's competitors (both Nintendo and Sony) offer Netflix streaming on their consoles without requiring you subscribe to any silly little membership, yet here I am, paying the Live Tax because I don't have any better devices to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"As a long time xbox user im tired of paying $60 or so dollars a year.

Its no different than every year taking 60 bucks and lighting it on fire, I can afford to do that and it be the price of a cup of coffee every month but it would still not be right,A total waste with no return. Basically its like paying the price for a game every year but receiving no game while online play is free on PC and Ps3. You also get a blu ray with a ps3, when my gold expires im gonna sell my xbox online and buy a Ps3, for this is a not a matter of whether I can afford it or not, its the principle of charging money for nothing in return."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesnt work","review":"The code was not accepted.

The result of this battle was vital for the allies as a positive reinforcement could have seen real problems for the Allies who would have been outnumbered at any given point.The author relies to a very large extent on diaries and personal remembrances, along with unit histories, to tell his tale. He focuses on the individual planes to a large extent and takes you into the cockpits with the crews and also sees the battle from the point of view of individual Japanese soldiers who are undergoing attack. This makes the description riveting, enthralling and very personal.I would recommend this book to anyone looking for an exciting retelling about this pivotal battle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible print - but you may have an alternative!","review":"As others have posted, this was possibly the worst print of the movie they could find - it is full of very noticeable scratches and horrible cuts that cause momentary gaps in the movie at various places. Plus it's a pan & scan. What they did to this great film is an embarrassment to the DVD business.But, there is now an alternative...If you have a Region 2 compatible DVD player that can handle PAL (or a computer that can read and play region 2 DVDs - which is more common), then you can buy this version from Amazon.co.uk.http://www.amazon.co.uk/Melody-DVD-Jack-Wild/dp/B002VD5SA6/This version (which I ordered and had shipped from the UK) is an absolutely stunning print - not a scratch to be seen. And it's a wide-screen version as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melody-A Sweet, Gentle Masterpiece","review":"Melody is a film about two 10 year school children who fall in love, then face constant adult opposition, as well as nonstop harassment from the other children. The two main characters, Daniel Lattimer (Mark Lester) and Melody Perkins (Tracy Hyde) are seeking someone to love and to provide companionship. Daniel is largely ignored by his trendy, upper middle class parents, while Melody longs for something other than her existence in a poor, lower end housing project. The story is a tender, sweet story of innocent love between two children, backed by a great music track by the pre-disco BeeGees. It contains no objectionable language, no sexual content, and no violence. Melody is a thoroughly entertaining film, one which will grab your attention from the opening, and hold it throughout the movie. This reviewer would give it 10 stars and a thumbs-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful, if you can get a good print!","review":"I was a senior in high school in 1971 and on vacation in London with my mother. We were having a theatre tour taking in every show we could. We had a spot (a matinee) on our schedule that was empty. I loved OLIVER! and its stars and we decided on this film still in its first run. I was enchanted. My mother was, also. The characters were kids I knew (maybe even kids I had been at that time in my life!) It is a movie that anyone who has been in love, but especially those who fell in love when they were younger, will identify with. It is not a perfect movie. But it still works. It is too bad that there hasn't been a major re-release with a quality video format for the US and Canada. The print available is scratchy and of poor quality.

Maybe it's unfair to compare this with Frank Miller's brilliant Year One. So I won't. All things being equal, this is just a bad comic. For some reason they seek to answer the question: why doesn't Batman use guns? The answer: who cares? This is just a series of bad ideas wrapping up with an ending that makes you wonder why you bothered with this in the first place. One of the worst Batman books I've read."},{"rating":"1","title":"meah...who is this Batman?","review":"Not the greatest story ever told, but It was entertaining. In this story Batman teams up with his parents killer (joe Chill) to stop a deadly killer called the Reaper. What I didn't understand about this story is why would Batman ever team up with his parents killer and how is it that an old ass man with little training is able to smack Batman around like a little girl? What I kept thinking while reading this book was \\"where is the Batman I know?\\"Id say only bother with this book if you like me are a collector otherwise, there are better Bat tales out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak storyline fails to capture the essence of Batman","review":"The book begins simply enough. Batman goes up against a gun toting maniac. However this isn't just any gun toting maniac its his predecessor vigilante the Reaper. The Reaper has no mercy for anyone and is more of a menace than a vigilante. My big problem with this book is that Batman is supposed to have trained for twelve years and be a human paragon. He is also supposed to have the resources and skills to stop a maniac with a gun, no matter how insane. The fact that he decides to work with the man who drove him to become the man he is and use a gun is ludacris. Batman is a Dark Knight. He is called a knight because he posesses chivalry. He's known from the moment he was conceived in crime alley that he can never become what he fights. That is what makes Batman a true hero. However just to see the idiocracy of this horrid book pick it off of the rack. The real Batman Year two is Long Halloween I highly recommend that book instead of this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexandria...","review":"The artwork in \\"Alexandria\\" is just as strange and beautiful as in the first four books in the series - maybe more so. I'm reminded of Griffin's dark travelogue in \\"Sabine's Notebook.\\"I love the original Griffin & Sabine trilogy but was initially disappointed with \\"The Gryphon,\\" the fourth book in the series. Bantock's new time-and-space-crossed lovers, Matthew and Isabella, weren't as compelling to me as Griffin and Sabine. They seemed awkward and even a little trite. After reading \\"Alexandria\\" I appreciate \\"The Gryphon\\" a lot more: Matthew and Isabella deepen as characters as the plot moves forward.I'd recommend this book to diehard Griffin & Sabine fans or anyone interested in graphic novels. Fans of Egyptology might be pleased...hard to say, since there could be gross inaccuracies in the book. I know nothing about ancient Egypt. I sure liked the book, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit less compelling than Griffin and Sabine","review":"I rushed out to buy \\"Alexandria\\" as I have done with all of Bantock's books since I was first gifted with \\"Griffin and Sabine\\" many years ago.I love his work....his books are such a visual treat that even if I do not know what is going on, I enjoy them. I love handling them and looking for hidden clues in the drawings.That said, I feel that I don't know Isabella and Matthew as well as I knew Griffin and Sabine. G and S were much less mysterious and I was able to make more sense of what was going on. I also felt that Bantock wrote each of his original trilogy without resorting to cliffhangers, a device which I find a bit off-putting, and which he used in \\"The Gryphon\\" and again in \\"Alexandria\\".However, none of these complaints will stop me from buying anything Nick Bantock writes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans of Griffin and Sabine will be delighted","review":"I am a librarian, so as soon as the I found that this book had been ordered, I put it on hold. As always, the long wait for Mr. Bantock's latest book is worthwhile.This book picks up where The Gryphon left off, with Isabella at university and Matthew in Egypt. Alexandria is visually stunning (which won't surprise Mr. Bantock's devotees) and it's fun to see the artistic choices of our four characters. There are some surprises in this volume, both for the reader and the characters.One aspect that I found particularly interesting was learning the background behind how Isabella relates to love, and to loving Matthew. We find out more about their relationship by finding out about her past.Much remains the same... Frolatti menaces and meddles, Griffin and Sabine offer wisdom (do they know how everything will end?), and (of course) the book ends with a cliffhanger, making it essential that we get the third book as quickly as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Griffin/Sabine fans will not be disappointed","review":"This book further explores the relationship between Matthew and Isabella, while Griffin and Sabine offer their support.The love letters between Matthew and Isabella are reminiscient of the letters between Griffin and Sabine.

While this book is, at times, a chore to read, I could not put it down. The writers took great pains in laying a good foundation for the reader, dealing with the early history of Poland, and illustrating the territory struggles which play such an important role as the book unfolds, especially prior to and after WW2. The book made me laugh, and at times, cry for the sacrifice of these brave men. It is beyond words how deeply the western countries betrayed the brave and loyal Poles, who fought harder than any nation \\"for your freedom and ours\\".Another great read, which will equally portray the Czech experience in WW2, is \\"One Man and His Dog\\" by Anthony Ricardson. The book is amazing to read and would make a remarkably good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Forgotten Polish Pilots of WWII","review":"I just finished this book and being the son of a WWII veteran of Polish decent, I found this book very informative of the heroic performance of the Polish Airman. I learned quite lot about my grandparents native land, and how Churchill and Roosevelt did not follow through on their pledge and policy. I have been to Poland and lived in England and visited many WWII sites in Europe. It is a shame this story has not been more widely told.

It was the best mistake she ever made. The story is shocking and eye opening to the fate of the Polish people. I always thought FDR was a good guy, (Democrat, should have known better).

This is a must read and a true eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honor Restored","review":"The authors have done a wonderful job with this book.I found this book to be hard to put down. They tell an important, over-looked story--the tremendous Polish contribution to the Allied cause in World War II-- in an accessible manner. Using the stories of the Kosciuszko Squadron (from its initial founding by American pilots after World War I to help win the Polish-Soviet War in the 1920's, to the disgraceful betrayal of them and the Polish nation by their fellow \\"allies\\") and many of its pilots, the authors manage to tell the much broader history of Poland, putting everything in an historical context. Every detail is very thoroughly researched and documented. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read on little known chapter in the Battle of Britain","review":"This is a wonderful book giving an account of the unsung heroes of the Battle of Britain...Polish pilots who had fled their native country when occupied by Nazi Germany and went to England to continue the fight. The story is written in a narrative style that features great insight on both the personalities and battles of these brave men. The book includes footnotes and useful tables, photos and charts including aerial victories/losses.One of the most poignant moments is the conclusion...where we learn how thier hope of returning to a free Poland is betrayed by the very allies they fought for. Many never return to Poland. A must read for WW II buffs and those interested in Polish history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!

In a way like Godard, you will either love his movies or find them a bit too intellectual - sometimes lacking the qualities that make us just sit back and enjoy. I found that I both love and hate his version of the Arthurian legend. At times the claustrophobia of the camera work is very effective - at other times it makes it very absurd. One thing is for sure, there are shades of genius in this film, the shots in the forest, in particular, bring some very relieving shades of green in the film. You also do get a sense of what the characters are wrestling with inside - and it is a very disturbing portrait, to be sure.

I've only been using them for about a month so far but there is no sign of wear as of yet, and my workouts are usually around an hour and a half with the mitts being used for about half of that time. Very impressed, very good quality. The only negative is that they are a little heavy, but I couldn't actually take a whole star away for that. In a perfect world I would be able to select 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very experimental","review":"Knives Out is Radiohead in their older form with acoustic guitars, drums, bass, etc. I consider it to be sub-standard to their older recordings but its still one great song.As for the b-sides, Worrywort has some great effects used in the background (a type of mood synthesizer with chimes i think). It isnt exactly the best song theyve ever done but great nonetheless. Fog will grow on you after repeated listens. It combines Radiohead's new sound with their old sound, drenching their basic song structure in effects that will indeed remind you of fog.if had to rate the songs in order of greatness it would go:1. Knives Out2. Fog3.

In the meantime, I just have to add a note on this single... it's really fantastic. I got it long ago but just happened to be looking through these pages today and realized I must comment on how wonderful the b-side \\"Fog\\" truly is. \\"Worrywort\\" is a solid b-side, though definitely that to me, but \\"Fog\\"... my oh my. I suppose I can understand why they couldn't sequence it into Kid A or Amnesiac but it's a truly phenomenal song.

This is really poor. I love Radiohead's brilliant nonalbum tracks of old, but ALL Amnesica-era singles thus far have proven to be self-indulgent, shallow ramblings mistaken by fans as concept art. If you love music and saw right through Amnesiac like I did (unlike Kid A, however), don't expect any hidden gems from 2000-present. Consider this review to cover all Knives Out and Pyramid Songs singles, title tracks being songs that have so much developmental potential but were squandered on mediocrity.

It tries to straddle a description of methodology and that of program function, and does a poor job of the latter.We already have a good understanding of how to get the job done -- we just wanted to use the tool. Thus, we only skimmed the parts of the book we considered were just a tepid introduction to Yourdon.If you already comfortable with task analysis, problem decomposition, and normalization, and simply want to know how to use this tool to develop a system, move on to something more practical, such as \\"Rapid Application Development With Oracle Designer/2000\\" by Chris Billings, et.al."},{"rating":"1","title":"A truely useless book","review":"Yet another book full of fluff with no substance.

Although the photographs are not crisp (they were taken during the infancy of photography!) they ae very interesting. The background provided by the author is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinly disguised hatred of capitalism","review":"This book is extremely well written. It provides a history of the United States from a perspective different than that of most history texts, and thus covers topics that are hardly touched in other books. Despite this fresh material, it fast becomes tedius as every event is described and analyzed in a common fashion: the little man is constantly being trampled by the American capitalist pigs. Even World War II, a noble endeavor against two of the most tyranical and evil regimes in the history of the world, is reduced to just another excuse for Americans to kill innocents and loot the rest of the world. If Mr. Zinn could have only resisted the temptation to pound square pegs into round holes and ensure that every historical event supported his thesis on the evils of capitalism and the United States, this could have been a well-rounded, refreshing look at American history."},{"rating":"2","title":"America is the Melting Pot...","review":"America is the melting pot...the scum floats to the top and the people on the bottom get burned. I liked this book. Even though I was familiar with much of the material. Its good to see history from another point of view.

Please let history speak for itself,good or bad and don't inflate or deflate it according to personal agenda."},{"rating":"1","title":"A socialist's unsubstantiated view","review":"If Zinn is unfamiliar with the usage of footnotes, his publisher should have clued him in. This somewhat interesting take on American history lacks credibility. I wonder how much of the money he earned from this bestseller was shared with his comrades. I hope he saved some for a ticket to China."},{"rating":"1","title":"extrodinarily biased","review":"This book offers an extrodinarily leftist view of American history. Instead of presenting events in American history as they happened with an attempt at being unbiased, every event is setup with a spin to make it sound like a travesty. If you are a liberal and like to hear how awefull some of our own citizens think the US is go to town. If however you want a true picture of history avoid this book for it offers only critical view points of events that happened for a very good reason beyond the popular belief that our officials are evil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better grab a hand saw...","review":"This book was so biased I had to cut off two legs of my chair in order to stay upright. But seriously, I've never been very politically minded, but I can tell when someone is zealously biased. Zinn is one of those people. I had the unfortunate opportunity to take a course in which this book was required reading. All I can say is that two wrongs do not make a right. High school textbooks may neglect wrongdoings in American history, but Zinn's convenient evasion of all of this nation's great achievments made me find very lame excuses to cut that class. It's a little disturbing how he manages to create the illusion that everything that has happened in American history has been orchestrated by the upper classes in order to deepen their pockets. This book is nauseatingly biased, and I recommend it only for inducing vomiting after swallowing poisons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old and tired","review":"If this were 1967, at least we could excuse the writer and his fans as understandably being caught up in the revolutionary drama. But, now over 30 years later, all that remains are tired lies told by a tired old man who practices a dead blind faith in a forsaken religion. Enough, already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Challenges traditional highschool thought","review":"I am a high school junior in an Advanced Placement U.S. History class. Our teacher assigns reading from this book in addition to the textbook. I find that whatever the textbook maintains, Zinn challenges it almost every time. What a refreshing history lesson!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving towards a compassionate history","review":"Zinn's book is an utterly necessary first step in moving towards a more compassionate view of history and hence a more compassionate society. In giving an account of persecuted groups, Zinn shows us that only by including and indeed focusing on these heretofore excluded groups can we begin to make amends for past wrongs. A cheerleader-viewpoint American history benefits only those few already in power; it does nothing to initiate social change or alleviate the suffering of the many. If you think our government is just fine the way it is and that poor, dispossessed, and unhappy people should \\"just get over it\\", then perhaps you should look elsewhere for informational sources (say, Nike ads or Bush speeches). If, however, you're interested in the truth, minorities, and social activism, then this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The other extreme from history books","review":"I first must say Howard Zinn has the correct idea. Write a history book the opposite of what many read in school. In other words, tell the bad or seedy parts of United States history. After reading this book I have to say Mr. Zinn has done as much disservice to our countries history as the other history books. According to Mr. Zinn nothing was done anytime in the US that was for the good of the people. Nothing. Ever. With a BA in history I spent many hours studying our country. Yes, we have done bad things throughout the years but we have also done good things. To categorize every episode as a capitalistic endeavour controlled by the rich is a one-sided view of the events. Instead of A People's History of the United States this book would do better with a title more a long the lines of The Other View of the History of the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the Whole Story, but...","review":"What Howard Zinn has purposefully done is to look at history from a different viewpoint, the viewpoint of the poor, of the oppressed.

Yes.Don't let yourself prejudge this book, though...I feel it absolutley deserves to be read, no matter what you think of Zinn's political beliefs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glance at the other side","review":"Zinn has written an amazingly well-researched, and well-written book which clearly narrates to us the \\"other side\\" of American History. While I would have preferred a more moderate position, I accept the truth in our history presented by the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The other side of America's History","review":"I have never been a history buff. I prefer the lively works of great writers of literature and the beautiful, complex world of mathematics and physics. This is mostly because the history books that I have read have been extremely dry and pretentious. My feelings towards the subject though have been altered significantly thanks to this wonderful book. Many claim that this book is biased; unashamedly, this is quite true. But it is no more biased than the history that is taught in the elementary, jr. high, and high schools throughout the country. This is necessary; people have not been told the complete truth: the oppression, the inhumanity, the viciousness involved in making America what it is today. It's not the truth that hurts, it's finding out you've been lied to for so long. This book is a gem. Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book...","review":"Although this book does raise some interesting points, I found it to be just too 'Politically Correct' to recommend. The author picks highly selective events which occured over numerous decades to make a his points. Furthermore, the author used numerous misinterpreted quotes and misrepresented facts to arrive at his conclusions. Great men in our history have been reduced by Zinn to 'evil overlords'-despite the fact that millions have benefitted from their actions (a fact which the author seems to ignore) I was only able to make it to the mid 1800s before I just couldn't take it anymore. And for the record, I'm not an uneducated right winger either. I am a student of American History..."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Marxist Dribble","review":"Interesting book, but too one sided to be taken seriously.Good points made pertaining to injustices and misconceptions regarding the idealistic but unreallistic perceptions of the founding and progress of the United States thru the line of history to the present.Unfortunately, the author seemed more intent on drawing conclusions to support his villification of America to the point of ignoring obvious counterpoints to many of his positions. At least, that was my impression.I would suggest Paul Johnson's book, \\"A History of the American People\\" as a more balanced work. It covers many of the same issues and does not cut anyone any slack regarding injustices and some of the idealistic misconceptions we have regarding American history, but, it does present a more objective look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awaiting Prof. Zinn's next book","review":"Though Prof. Zinn is a talented writer, his text shows that he is hopelessly biased. The book itself is well-written, but the presentation of the subject matter is skewed more than just a bit to the left. By continuously hammering on the misdeeds of the United States (and conveniently forgetting that the country ever produced, allowed, or did anything good), Zinn attempts to lead one to believe that the United States was (and is), the embodiment of \\"The Evil Empire\\". I think a chapter on how the United States gives Prof. Zinn the freedom to write such an unbalanced, revisionist, non-objective, and needlessly-critical book about it would be a nice addition. Failing that, I would like for Prof. Zinn to relocate to China and write his next book on human rights violations by that country (from the perspective of the oppressed). I am sure the government there will grant him the same journalistic freedom as the \\"fascist\\" government in place in the United States."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Distorted History- but from the other side","review":"This book was written for white upper-middleclass yups who want to feel a tinge of guilt at their wine-tasting parties!!!! I would avoid this book, it is a very biased and one sided version of American History. While this book does not have the \\"Might makes Right\\" view of many US History texts, it is no less of a distortion. I understand the reason for publishing a US History that does not whitewash the misdeeds throughout the centuries. However, it is equally as distorting to paint virtually every American policy, Business practice, etc. as aimed solely at controlling or abusing \\"the masses\\"..whoever they are. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have you ever heard him lecture?","review":"I would simply like to ask if any of these people have ever heard him give a lecture. Not only does he not follow a logical pattern of thought, but preaches the need for a revolution. My reason for not caring for him is not because my views differ from his, the reason is that I can't listen, or read, from a person who cannot form a clear thesis, argue it, while still finding time to dispel doubts by disproving the oppositions arguments. Howard Zinn simply spurts out ideas without having any back up. This book of his has the potential to be good, but before I would ever call it so, Howard needs to learn the finer points of making an argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment","review":"Zinn has written a masterfully composed history that looks at U.S. history without embellishing it and without distorting it. His book has the ring of truth written without the usual historian's tendency to reflect his own paradigms.

Some have complained this book is anti-American and rated it low for that; I say that it provided a startlingly different viewpoint that will be invaluable to those who study history.Zinn quite clearly states that his sympathies are not with the rich and powerful (who seem inordinately fearful of his analysis). I have found no factual errors in his work; anyone who can demonstrate he got facts wrong is free to point to specific instances and complain. No one has done that yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of its kind","review":"This is an exciting, readable history of the United States (and what preceded it). What has impressed me most about it is that a lot of people who never liked \\"history\\" have been completely engrossed in this book. It's a good read. It grabs and holds your attention. It tells you things you never knew. It is frankly biased, but the author doesn't try to conceal that. I found it uplifting. Zinn is unsparing about the injustice and atrocity in our country's history, but that's not all he cares about. He brings to light some instances of courage and inspiration that conventional histories leave out.Many readers are apparently tempted to read the book with a narrow purpose in mind: to uncover \\"leftist bias\\" - to get a subversive thrill - to rationalize their oppressed status - to feel self-righteous. The book allows all of these things, but somehow there's more to it than that. This history is not just a collection of dates, names and facts. It really tells the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY, THE TRUTH!","review":"This book is a treasure which I shall read over and over again.

That is the real question. This freedom we 'enjoy', is it an illusion? An integral part of our control? Or is it simply 'freedom', in its purest form, that we may exercise our minds and bodies with the least restrictions within this system we live? Yes, it is a system, but one that provides us with freedom --- and it is this quandary Zinn must address. The quandary of determining our system's rightness, its goodness, or its evil. Because freedom in America is a reality Zinn and others of his creed ignore so to create their 'boogymen' of capitalism, and class war. Their argument requires the ingredient of apparent control, but America's 'freedom' throws a monkey wrench into that argument because it incoluates 'control'. Or does it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother with this one","review":"This book is is nothing more than a recounting of all the dark moments in American History. These moments need to be documented and remembered, but not told all together in one breath as Zinn has presented. He seems to take pride in exposing all the ugly horrible things that have happened in our history and not presenting suppporting evidence for the contrary.There is a brief section on the Vietnam War which seems to be more impartially documented, but the rest is a witch hunt for negativism in AMerican History.To clearly understand the issues he writes about, I stongly advise reading other books focued on each subject-- for instance, A Womens History of the United States, A History of Black America, the sad tale of the Real Americans etc.I honestly believe that Zinn has presented these issues in a way that will blurr proper understanding of these sad characteristics of American History"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, extremely biased","review":"When I bought this book, I was in a hurry, and I assumed it would be a simple, credible, unbiased source of US history. It was not. It is sporadicaly sourced and the writing style is rather tough to read. It feeds you countless pages of leftist political propaganda. It draws far-fetched conclusions (even with the psuedo history Zinn will feed you for 500 pages). And, worst of all, Zinn spins, twists, exaggerates, downplays, and excludes vital pieces of history in order to push his rather extreme political agenda.

Anways, since I've never used a double mouth guard before I wanted to get used to it, so I decided not only to train with it on the mat and the ring (MMA of course), I also decided to run with it. This would help for me to get used to breathing with it. After about three weeks of use, the bottom guard started to get really flimsy...and actually tore on the inside.

I think his style of writting has changed of late, but this was back when he was writting in the style I love.You really get to know the characters and understand them. There is a good mix of drama, romance, humour and more drama with them all. I really love the Shelby and Tyrel story line. They are my favourite characters EJD has written. I also love how in this book everyone goes to Roscoes (the best fried chicken spot in LA). You don't necessarily have to read Sister Sister first, but you should at some stage read all of his books because he's such a great writer.

As an aspiring novelist myself, I was curious to see how it would differ from \\"S&S\\", after reading that Eric wrote \\"F&L\\" first. I suspect that Sister, Sister was written with a commercial focus in mind (something I can relate to), but man, Friends & Lovers was first-rate! One of my goals is to increase the diversity of black male portrayals in our novels, but \\"F&L\\" sets the standard! Tyrel's struggles and the life experiences that shaped him were carefully woven throughout, and Leonard was a brother on the move professionally but in touch with himself spiritually. The women were well-developed, too, but it's the male portrayals that make this novel unique. This is \\"Waiting to Exhale\\" with REAL black men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very believeable issues that occur with men and women.","review":"I was very in touch with the characters, I must say it was quite refreshing to read about men having those same uncertain feelings about love and if theyre with the right person, or just the fact that they really care about choosing a woman for a life-partner."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved this Book!!!!!!","review":"This was such a gripping page turning book that I just couldn't put down. I never lost intrest and looked forward to the next chapter. So real, intense and exciting, I couldn't keep it to myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read","review":"EJD did it again with another novel that brilliantly captured the essence of relationships in the '90s. His characters were so real that you were sad when the book ended, you really wanted to know what would happen to them next.He did a wonderful job making the female and male characters real by avoiding any gender stereotypes and burdening all the characters with real life issues and complexities.I can't wait to read his next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Won't want to put the book down","review":"An attention holding book. Eric Jerome Dickey's protrays the characters as someone you know. Highly recommend this book to the African-American woman to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey's second book \\"Friends and Lovers\\" is just as good as his first book \\"Sister, Sister.\\" I loved it. You can relate to his characters. And it is filled with lots of humor, Dickey's trademark."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are going to read a book, make this the book to read","review":"This is the best book I have read about friendships and lovers. Jerome gets to the heart of relationships. He makes you appreciate what you have and how important friendships are. I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Book is excellent. I enjoyed it.","review":"Friends and Lovers is a book about two relationships. One with sex being the main motto and one without. It shows the breakdown and build up of each of the friend/relationships without making the characters protaganist or antagonist, but a little bit of both which helped the characters come across as real life individuals that I were able to judge, find compassion for, and later identify with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"Friends and Lovers starts off good but then it reaches a point where you say \\"Who the hell cares?\\" I hate when the plot gets mangled up by sub-plots that no one cares about. Dickey has a tendency to tack on \\"I ain't got no daddy\\" or \\"My daddy is no good\\" subplots that always makes the story go in a dull and unnecessary direction. I usually skip those few chapters and try to find the more exciting parts. Other than the boring sub-plots, F&L is an okay read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book takes you to places you haven't been before.","review":"I have never read a book so fast in my life. I was very emotional throughout the entire book but did not let out my tears until the end. Dickey's personal comment to me \\"You could be Shelby\\" enspired me to read this book and as soon as I read about Shelby's character, I wondered if he (Dickey) had truly taken this from my life. Every event in the lives of these characters felt so real and hit close to home. I like books that I can relate to that deal with issues I see happening everyday if the lives of African-Americans but yet, are not degrading to me or my race of people. Dickey, you hit home on this one. Sister, Sister was a great piece of work also. Keep writing please. Don't leave us waiting to long on another of your works of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad bad bad","review":"I really don't understand the good reviews this book has received. There was an overuse of \\"sister\\", \\"brother\\", \\"light, caramel, ebony, mocha complexion\\", product placement, \\"kente-wearing\\" afro-centric references. It was quite distracting. Why the author couldn't just focus on the plot without interjecting the various skin tones of the BLACK characters I will never understand. I quit after the second chapter because I was tired of lines such as \\"with two shakes of my tail I could hypnotize a brother and any other\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG SO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!","review":"I have never been an avid book reader, but I have to say this book was AMAZING! I literally just finished reading it and had to write a review boasting its praises! The writing style that Dickey uses is perfect and moves quickly. The characters he has created are extremely real and relatable! \\"Friends and Lovers\\" took me on an emotional roller-coaster and I loved every minute of it! I laughed, cried, swooned, cried, and laughed some more. I want to know what happens to Shelby, Tyrel, and Debra after the book ends. Bravo! I highly recommend this book! This is the first Eric Jerome Dickey book I've read, and I can guarantee it won't be the last! I'm positive I will re-read this book many times to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my Favorite!","review":"Yes out of all of his books and others this book is still one of my favorite books of all time, I can't count how many times I have read this book over and over. I think the fact that it was one of the first books I fell in love with that is why it will always remain near and dear to me. Eric is such a skillful story teller that I fall in love with his novels, he weaves humor throughout the story and makes you fall in love with each character."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"There are SO many other reviews that I don't think I can say anything new. It was just very boring. I just don't see the greatness and excellence that others saw in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is all heart and soul.","review":"Friends and Lovers, was totally engrossing and a delight to read. The characters are magnetic and quickly draw the reader into their lives and relationships. This book leaves one with a true appreciation of what else, but true Love and Friendship. A must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and breathtaking!!!","review":"Where do I begin? This book hit close to home on many different levels. This was the first book I read in a long time. It came highly recommended from someone with whom I have shared a rocky relationship, similar to that of Tyrel and Shelby's. This book gave me hope that I, too, might be able to work things out and find everlasting happiness!It was very easy to understand and relate to. I read this book in two days!! And I've already begun reading it a second time. Keep up the excellent work!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ABSOLUTE MUST READ!!","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey has extraordinary talent. I have never read a book where an auther was able to write a book filled with so many emotional issues and to hit each issue right on the nail. Throughout this book, I found myself agreeing to comments out loud, laughing hysterically, crying and becoming angry on behalf of the characters. This book affected me in a way that no other book has. I am very happy to see Dickey doing so well with his writing career. Eric, you are a suberb writer and I am thankful that you chose to share your work with the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Friends and Lovers.........","review":"This was an enjoyable read. I really like the characters Eric Jerome Dickey choose to use. My favorite would have to be Shelby because she didn't beat around the bush about nothing. I liked how things turned out in the end with everyone except Leonard. This book shows that true love does prevail.........."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't judge a book by it's cover","review":"I have to admit, the cover of this book did not appeal to me. A co-worker had been encouraging me to read it for a while, and I kept on declining. It just seemed that the market had had been inundated with African American authors, and I was getting bored with it. Funny, what boredom does to the soul. I could not put this book down once I started reading it. Eric Jerome Dickey writes from the woman's perpective better than most female writers. You have a promiscuous male and female, who had to take a look at their choices in sexual partners. Then there was the sisterfriends relationship. Three women of different social status who attempt to maintain a friendship in trying time. I was impressed. All the characters in this book, I knew somebody like them. I have no more words. Just trust me. This book is DA BOMB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin, Predictable Plot & Terrible Ending","review":"This book opened with great promise. I hoped the leading male character would continue to explore his past for insight into his relationships with women. Instead, the chapters droned on with the same kind of excessive-adjective-use, name-brand product-advertising, and unnecessary-sex that has kept me away from most of the modern African-American fiction writers. Oh well...back to the classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!","review":"Eric Jerome Dickey is my All Time Favorite Author!!! It doesnt get any better than him. It's my personal mission to read ANY and EVERYTHING he has EVER written!!I LOVE YOU E. J. D.!!!!!!K from the Carolinas"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dickey Has Really Outdone Himself","review":"\\"Friends and Lovers\\" by Eric Jerome Dickey is a sensual tale of the lives of four people: Debra, Shelby, Tyrel, and Leonard. Once you pick this book up and begin reading, it's hard to put back down. This book is filled with drama and suspence from beginning to end. If you have ever been in love, you will find yourself laughing out loud and losing a few tears. The words truly jump off of the page and into your life. Erick Jerome Dickey has really outdone himself with this book. It can only be called a Literary Work of Art."},{"rating":"2","title":"My #1 Choice of Eric Jerome Dickey Books","review":"This book was by far the best book he's written. It was very realistic and I could see it as a possible movie. The story was touching. It made you laugh, cry, and get (upset) at the characters. I give this book 5 stars and it is #1 on my choice of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"maaaaaaarvelous","review":"I first read Cheaters and I was so overwhelmed by Mr. Dickeys work that I went out and bought all of his book. I read Sister Sister, Friends and Lovers, and I've just finished Milk in My Coffee. I get so caught up in the characters it's crazy. All I have to say is mover over E, Lynn Harris, there is a New Sherriff in town."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Dickey Novel to date!","review":"All I can say is read the story. You'll feel like these characters are your personal friends. As usual, Dickey does a marvelous job telling love stories and all the drama that love entails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultimate Friendship","review":"A friend loaned me this book to read. I read it, and then I purchased my own copy to read the next time(s) that I want to read it. This book is about the ULTIMATE Friendship. Everyone should have a friend that they can be so relaxed with during a time of joy or sorrow. It remains my favorite book and I've been reading for many years."},{"rating":"2","title":"The scale needs to go higher than 10 for this one!","review":"Dickey's initial book - Sister, Sister was a 10. With Friends and Lovers, Mr. Dickey has surpassed the rating of 10. This book shows both sides of the relationship - male and female. Once again, the book was written in easy to read dialogue, but the best treat was the superior quality in which each character was written. The reader has a chance to get an intimate look at the lives of Shelby and Tyrel, and Leonard and Deborah. The surprise twist in the middle of the novel isn't bad either. This was definitely worth the price of the hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book! When is the movie coming out?!","review":"I read Eric's first book and was so thoroughly impressed with his writing, I anxiously waited for Friends and Lovers. When it was released, I bought it right away, but wasn't able to read it because I was behind in reading of other books that I also wanted to read. Needless to say, I finally had my chance to read it and I could've kick myself for not reading it sooner. This was the best yet and I find that you are a very talented writer who can express feelings between lovers and friends as if I were a character in the book myself. Please keep up the good work, and if you ever have a chance to read all of these good comments about you and your book, please do so. I also am waiting again anxiously for your next book. Can we expect a movie deal?! I'm sure it will far pass \\"Waiting to Exhale\\" in the ratings."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put it down!","review":"I was given this book to read in a crowded airport terminal and did not put it down practically until I had fininshed. My spontaneous outbursts of \\"No, she didn't!\\" and \\"I heard that!\\" [or \\"True that!\\" to Tyrel and Leonard] caused the sistah sitting next to me to ask what I was reading. I told her that I really wasn't trying to do a commercial for this book but that this was truly a GOOD book. Eric Jerome Dickey, this was truly a treat. I was trying to think of who would play the different parts in the movie.I am looking forward to reading the other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!! Keep it up Eric!!!","review":"I enjoyed reading Friends and Lovers. One can easily relate to the characters. Also, it shows that sometimes it takes tragedy to bring those in love together as well as friendships. I am looking forward to reading \\"Milk In My Coffee\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, AWESOME, HEARTFELT AND LOVING","review":"This was a great book. Easy to read and follow. I felt like I was there, the characters were my friends and it was a movie. I couldn't put the book down and has shared the book with co-workers. Friends and Lovers has become a great conversational piece. A Book Well Written.....Mr. Dickey! Hats off to you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Facts Fast","review":"This is a great \\"bathroom book\\"...it can be read in 2 minute installments.

It decidedly conveys a valuable sales and customer service message, doing so in a format that makes the salient points memorable. It does for the Sales organization what The Goal, by Eli Goldratt, did for manufacturing. This should be a primer for the sales student and practitioner.Kudos to Uly Meixner and Erich Mock for this seminal work in sales training. I look forward to additional works by this innovative duo."},{"rating":"2","title":"NORMAN SELLS ANOTHER ONE","review":"A clever and informative book about the principles of successful selling techniques.

The use of humor to emphasize important points makes this book enjoyable as well as useful. I recommend \\"OH Norman\\" highly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get lessons from a pitching instructor","review":"I bought this thinking I could teach my daughter how to pitch. There's so many things that affect a pitch that aren't covered or only touched on. The kid in this video obviously already knows how to pitch. You can get a few tips on how to pitch, but you're only going to be a little better than someone who just swings their arm in a circle and releases the ball. My advice is to save your money, find someone who teaches pitching, and spend your money there. My daughter learned more in one lesson with a live coach than watching this video several times, writing down what should be done, and analyzing the pitcher's motion in slow motion. A coach can give you immediate feedback, corrections, and drills to improve your pitching. Save your money on these videos. (I bought a couple others and never got my money's worth out of them.) Sorry Ernie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad recording!!","review":"You'd think with today's technology that they'd be able to make this CD sound better. The vocal tracks (except for \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\") sound like they're coming from the bathroom down the hall. There's an echo-y reverb that gets annoying before the first track is done. Also, the \\"I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus\\" track is actually sung by Bobby Helms, not Bobby Sherman! This CD would actually be good if it had been recorded correctly to begin with.Track listing:1. Christmas Wish2. Blue Christmas3. Jingle Bell Rock4. Yesterday's Christmas5.

Not this book. This book is full of pure speculations. The photo examples that the author gave to compare clothing costumes between the Chinese and the \\"early settlers\\" are not even Chinese. They are Manchurian, who occupied China as the Qing dynasty, hundreds of years later than Zheng He's time (oops, sorry, wrong dynasty). This book was given to me as a gift.

The cover art is worth getting alone, and the concept is very original even for this type of music. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars","review":"Incredibly tight... very heavy... lots of time changes... chunky riffage... extremely technical.... And yes, the songwriting and arrangements are great. It's heartening to come across an album like this - I've been meaning to get it for some time, and am glad I did - I'll definitely be checking out their later stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delightful children's CD","review":"Calvin Davis is a vivid storyteller, as he demonstrates in his tales about Chauncey frog. Chauncey's adventures are engaging and entertaining for all children. Music and sound effects enhance to the experience. The perfect way for children to pass the time during long car rides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Lives - Brilliant","review":"I will have read everyone of Diane Chamberlain's books when I finish the one I'm reading now. Secret Lives is one of her best, although it's difficult to chose between them, they are all so good. Once you start you won't want to put it down. You just need to keep reading to find out what happens next. It's full of surprises and a thouroughly good read read. Once you start you'll be hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have found a new author.","review":"This novel was a pleasant surprise; one of the first books I ordered on my new Kindle. I enjoyed it, highly recommend it and will be watching for more Diane Chamberlain."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book- shows the horrible consequences of secrets","review":"I read this book several months ago and it is in the top 3 of my favorites for 2012. The story line keeps you reading and with several surprises along the way. I definitely recommend it to others who like a good mystery that is not a murder mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Lives","review":"I really enjoyed this book, it is the first book I have read by Diane Chamberlain, and will definetly by reading more of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read!!","review":"I really thought this was an enticing story. I really felt for Kate as she lived in an era where agoraphobia was untreated. It pretty much ruled her life and played into a lot of decisions that she made.I did feel, at first, the story started a little slow but once it got going, it was hard to put the book down. I really wanted to know what Ben's secret was and how that whole situation would end. What a twist!!One thing that bothered me somewhat was the relationship between Kyle and Kate. I was a little put off but I know that it added to all of the \\"secrets\\".All in all, this was a great story!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like","review":"I read this book based on all the positive reviews. I have never read a Diane Chamberlain book. I am sorry to say I was disappointed. At first the story captured my interest. I just did not like Eden or Kate at all; therefore could not give the book a fair shot. They were dysfunctional and pathetic in my opinion. I also did not like some of the subject matter in this book or some decisions the characters made. The author's style of writing flowed well. I guess I just could not be objective with this book. Perhaps if I were moved at all by reading this book, I would be able to give more stars to this review. However, the only emotion I had while reading this book was disgust. Instead of feeling remorse or sorrow towards the characters, I felt no emotions at all. Not sure if I am willing to read another book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a page turner","review":"The author's approach to this book is quite original, the story gets pretty far fetched as she tries to get it all to come neatly together in the end. Would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love","review":"I have read many books by Diane Chamberlain and this one didn't disappoint. Her writing style is great and she has a way of keeping you interested. I guessed the main plot just about half way through the book, but that didn't stop me from wanting to read to the very end and enjoy it anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"While the author expresses herself well, the story was rather lurid and contrived. It was also very predictable. The several \\"surprises\\" other reviewers have commented on were easily figured out long before they were revealed because the author dropped multiple, obvious hints along the way. The characters were one dimensional and not believable. The significant problems of the main characters were happily resolved easily within the last few pages. Spoiler: This is, at heart, a romance novel that introduces topics of incest and child molestation in an attempt to add sophistication and novelty to a basic theme of famous starlet falling for average Joe. However, these topics fit very oddly in a basic romance novel. Certainly, this author did not pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!!","review":"Enjoyed the gripping story between these broken characters. Very absorbing and fast moving. First Chamberlain book and certainly will not be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read..","review":"I loved this book and had a hard time putting it down. The characters were so well written that I truly cared about each one. The twists and turns that I can usually see coming, I couldn't see coming in this book. The back and forth of Eden telling her story and Kate's journal story was a great way to get this moving at such a fast pace. I will definitely be reading more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Lives","review":"Diane developed her characters so well that you could not wait to know what they were going to do or how they were feeling. This is one of those books that make you ponder for days after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Lives","review":"I found this book an easy read, hard to put down as the story just kept you wondering what was around the corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, Passionate, Unique!","review":"Once I began reading it, this story enveloped me. The characters are well developed and easy to relate to, and the storyline is woven with exceptional care. Romance, mystery, psychological intrigue, Southern culture...the subtexts are gripping and work together to create a story that had me genuinely feeling the impact of a web of choices and untruths that threatened to tear each person apart in a unique way. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book.","review":"I really can't put how great this book is into words. Just read it and trust me.

I was sad to have the book end, but it ended on a very satisfactory note. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG, Couldn't put it down!","review":"What an excellent book!!! Unlike most books I really did not know how this book would end until I got to the end (very close to the end anyway). Not that I mind predictable books sometimes I just want something good and predictable. But this was not like anything I've ever read. Read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult","review":"Something is wrong with the print as it isn't lit up. It started out correct but didn't continue beyond the first few pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"why all the 5s?","review":"characters are so fake and storyline so predictable....with the great reviews I didn't expect it to be nearly as boring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I read the first few pages, I was perplexed. The opening reads like a mills and boon novel - I thought I had clicked the wrong book. How did this get 5 stars under 'literary fiction'. I have remained perplexed, and I am not finishing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Although I finished this book last week, I still cannot stop thinking about it. I almost want to pick it back up and read it again. I know I will at some point. Diane Chamberlain's books have a way of drawing you in and this one certainly did. This book never let me put it down. There were times when I felt like I was in the book. She makes this story so real. Like it could have happened to you. This was only the 4th Diane Chamberlain book I have read and they just keep getting better and better. I have vowed to continue to read all her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best!","review":"This was a really good book! I couldn't put it down. Although I figured out one twist early on...I didn't see the other one coming!

This set is full of bad acting, not very attractive actors & actresses, and the information found within can be discovered for free on countless websites on the net.

There are better instructional video material out there for your hard earned dollars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"These videos were nothing but low budget soft core porn.

Then, Fortran was the main language for numerically intensive applications. (Go back far enough and it was the only language.) So Fortran was taught from that perspective.Likewise with this book. The emphasis is from the point of view of a user who is NOT a computer scientist. Rather, she hails from some other subject, and needs to know enough of Java to apply it to her problems. A very utilitarian approach. Java purists might bewail this, but remember, not everyone can be, or desires to be, a full time programmer.If you are a physical science major (especially in physics), or an engineering student, then you should have the ideal background for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very, very helpful","review":"I am an economist and biostatistician who works in sas and stata. So I don't write code in \\"real\\" programming languages. However, I was using another program that was built on Java and I needed to tweak some portions of the underlying Java--this book was just perfect for me. I had some familiarity with fortran; I know how to write little programs in Stata's programming language (so I understanding looping) and so on.This book helped me implement things I knew about in other contexts or wanted to do and implement them in Java. Very helpful.(It's also convinced me to use Java for some simulations I was doing in R because Java is so fast.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product - BUT IT WAS EXPIRED!","review":"Bene-Bac is a five star product for it replenishes the necessary bacteria that birds need for good health and is veterinarian recommended.

I will add these eight movies to my Agatha Christie DVD Collection. Can't Wait for this collection to be released on September 12th. I loved the box cover Artwork. The Actors are superb to watch Peter Ustinov, Helen Hayes, Bill Bixby, Jean Stapleton, Bette Davis and many others to give wonderful performances in their roles in my favorite agatha christie movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly remade","review":"This is perhaps the first time for me that Amazon reviews have been totally amiss. This series is a set of poor adaptations of the original christie novels, which are set in 1930. The sets are cheap, the actors second grade and stellar performers like Bette Davis wasted in guest roles. The only saving grace are Helen Hayes as Miss Marple and Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot. Most of the episodes drag unbearably with lot of drama, no music or slickness in direction and no real backbone to any character. The David Suchet series is highly superior and worth keeping compared to this. Am waiting to get rid of my set, total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agatha Christie Mystery Collection","review":"These 8 made for TV films are among the weakest modern Christie offerings. Any of the PBS versions are preferable. Ustinov makes a silly Poirot in 3 of the films, Helen Hayes is a passable Marple in 2 films and plays a brief role in a third one. The Man in the Brown Suit is fun, but fluff. Christie fans should look elsewhere for satisfying film versions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chill bumps--from horrid retro 80s pop culture","review":"I know we have been spoiled by David Suchet and the period filming, but these are extremely dated--with poor acting to boot. Poirot is a bumbling buffoon. It was a waste of our money.The only one that half way kept our interest was \\"The Man in the Brown Suit.\\"Conservative viewers BE WARNED: they were trying to stretch whatever immodesty that they could get away with on T.V. at that time. A number of scattered scenes and wardrobe items were complete voyeurism.I love Agatha Christie, but these left me chill bumps of revulsion rather than excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Sorry, but the more recent Agatha Christie's in the past 10 years are good, these were corny and badly scripted, but good casting. However, not worth watching, as I turned it off as we just couldn't agonize through it all. I'll probably give them away to someone less discriminating. I'm a prude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I dislike these movies!!!!!","review":"These are the worst Agatha Christie movies i have seen. I did not want to even give a star. i WOULD LIKE TO GET my money back if possible. I cannot bear to watch the rest of them. They do not have the class as the other movies have . I will ONLY WATCH THE first type of movies i brought with Hercule Piroit as the leading person. Money wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"AC CLASSIC MYSTERY COLLECTION","review":"This collection is a must have for a true AC Fan. All the usual suspects we try to catch on TV but end up mising them, due to their TX times, are here. Some are far better than others - hence the rating I have given the collection. It would have been nice to have a few extras on the DVD's, but you cant have everything. Hours of sheer magic and suspence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use Caution","review":"I got this with the anticipation of seeing some of the better actors/actresses who've played Agatha Christie's characters on screen.

The tone is certainly approachable, and a lack of technical or academic language makes the contents easily graspable. Yet the book is wanting in its lack of detail and depth: at best the reader is left wanting something else -- and while this may, perhaps, have been the author's intention, it certainly poses a substantial flaw in the final outcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magesterial historian of science","review":"I actually purchased these volumes for a friend, having read them some time ago. History of science at its best.Error. Error. I discovered to my dismay that I had used the wrong scale on several items. I reviewed every purchase in about the last five years and discovered several comparable errors. The changes should be posted within 48 hours. Terribly embarrassed about these errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Found: A disappointment","review":"Having enjoyed \\"The Discoverers\\" and then a bit disappointed with \\"The Creators,\\" my expectations for \\"The Seekers\\" were mixed. I was hoping to read a description of the historical development of philosophic ideas. Unfortunately, I found \\"The Seekers\\" to be a disappointment. It is not clear for whom this book is intended. Philosophic schools, historical and social trends, and the people who sought truth are described in brief and somewhat disconnected brush-strokes. Most disappointing is the apparent inability of the author to shed a narrow focus on people and their times (often with idiosyncratic and not always relevant pieces of information thrown in) and not place ideas and works in a broader social and cultural context. Without other knowledge, one would have a difficult time understanding the importance, and particularly the historical consequences, of the ideas that are described."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Esoteric Sound Bite","review":"Frankly, to attempt to present even an admittedly brief history of seekers like this volume is nearly blasphemous. This is the fast-foot, USA Today version of the history of seekers. This was not a whetting of the appetite for more--this was inappropriate. This is like the Reader's Digest Version of the Ring of the Nibelungen or the Eroica Symphony. To hear only the first minute of the first movement is less than a insight. It is, like this book, a meaninglless waste of time. I can find little good to say of this supeficial survey. In its attempt to \\"accessibility,\\" it presents unsatisfying fluff. Some things, i.e., the history of thought, must not be reduced to bathroom reading. With his other more ample volumes, what happened here? Did the author run out of time? This is consumerism at its worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing after Creators and Discoverers","review":"I've read and re-read The Creators and The Discoverers. Maybe my expectations were unrealistically high for The Seekers. The relatively slim size didn't bother me; I trust Boorstin's scholarship and assumed that he simply stopped when the material was covered. However, my impression is that for some reason the author or the publisher needed a book in this niche in time for the holiday market, and rushed this one.In the Discoverers, Boorstin's powerful use of language enhances the flow of ideas from one seemingly unconnected concept to the next, along with a thrilling feel of mystery. In The Seekers, rolling tides of majestic adjectives seem a little empty and pompous. Maybe I needed a little more, or a little less, eggnog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hullo? There's life outside the library","review":"Boorstin is not an original thinker, but a representative of a new disturbing intellectual trend. Instead of presenting us with his own original thoughts, he has kneaded together a dough of old ideas and philosophers that does not rise because it lacks the catalyst of imagination. Boorstin and his ilk are the literary equivalent of the disco dub machine, endlessly reworking old melodies to a new beat that sounds like all the other new beats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Dolph never was an actor but he is still a S...

The problem with this book is that it is written by a FEMALE FOR A FEMALE READER. There is no disclaimer to this fact when buying the book. Fair minded women and all male buyers beware, I found this auther to be sexist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"how to\\" dvd for healthy eating!","review":"First let me say that Dr. & Mrs. Fuhrman are not professional entertainers, so this dvd won't appear like a show from the Food Network. But they demonstrate how they make some of their favorite healthy meals and they give tips on preparing larger quantities so you have food ready in the fridge when you get hungry (to keep from being tempted to munch on unhealthy snack foods because better choices are not at hand). My wife and I enjoyed the dvd and have already prepared the stir-fry (big hit), the hearty vegetable soup and the kale. While the recipes require a relatively large number of ingredients, the results are pretty impressive. It's a wonderful help for enjoying the journey to better health!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eat to Live cooking class","review":"This is not of the caliber of the Food Network, but it is charming and informative. It was enough to get me convinced to start the ETL program, seeing that it was not that difficult to prepare. I will admit I also bought the VitaMix blender after this as well -- I was amazed at what they were able to do with whole veggies -- even more than my food processor. But then, I am a kitchen gadget junkie! Back to the DVD, interesting recipes included and demonstrated -- a great accompaniment to the book, Eat to Live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"I really enjoyed this video and thought it demonstrated how easy it is to make some of his recipes. I was especially impressed how he made the anti-cancer soup. I thought why didn't I ever think of throwing whole vegis in my soup? I agree it's not Food Network quality but who the heck cares. Didn't expect either one to be professional tv stars. I thought the video was really informative and most important I can't wait to make some of these healthy, delicious recipes and improve my health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan of the concepts but disappointed in DVD","review":"I'm a great believer of Dr. Fuhrman's concepts but the DVD was disappointing. I agree with other reviewers that it was amateurish and seemed more like a commercial for the Vitamix blender. The DVD was definitely not worth the price, and the money would be better spent in getting his books with recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I didn't really like the DVD or the subject content. I don't think it is a livable way to eat and with economy like it is alot of the foods and eating suggestions are expensive for the everyday person.

I have loaned this out to family and they love it as much as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuhrman's home movies","review":"This DVD was not what I thought it would be. The title says \\"Secrets to healthy cooking\\", well . . . they're still a secret. What the video amounts to is an unscripted amateurish display of Joel and Lisa Fuhrman preparing their favorite dishes. Most of the recipes are concocted in a blender or VitaMix, with the Fuhrman's usually forgetting to mention all the ingredients in the recipe. The recipes are never repeated at the end of a presentation so you have to rewind to make a note of what was included. There is none of the in-depth explanation for combining foods, or heating vs. raw foods, that I was expecting. The recipes are no doubt healthy and tasty, hence my two stars, but the DVD was not especially informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same...","review":"I ordered both this vid, and the eating like a nutritarian vid as well as some other books of his.

They will be giving you useful information just as soon as you open them up and as you use them more and more and work with the accompanying book, you will actually learn astrology, not the stuff in the newspapers, but the real thing.

Buy it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Karma Cards - The do-it-yourself fortune tellers.","review":"With 36 cards and detailed instructions, I give this book a 9.

Good for all levels of fitness!","review":"This is a beautiful book. The explanations are clear and beautifully illustrated with photos by the very fit author ... she is an inspiration. She divides the workouts in a variety of ways ... there're workouts for the Core, Lower Body, and Upper Body; and each focus area has a basic, intermediate, challenge and express workout so you can start at your current fitness level and build up in 6-week increments. In addition, each level has variations for beginners and advanced exercises ... it is very thorough. The nutrition chapter is a solid, basic plan for a lifetime ... not a diet. The only drawback is that the exercises do not always specify exactly which muscle you are working altho she does give you pointers on how to find certain muscles and feel them working. This is a great resource and very good value for the money. Highly recommend it for all fitness levels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful for new starters and more advanced.","review":"I got this along with a large exercise ball to overcome strength loss due to aging and I like it a lot. It does not waste pages on machine exercises (not my interest) but uses body weight, light hand weights and the exercise ball. Boy is that exercise ball a great idea. The first time I've been able to exercise for 45+ minutes straight at a good pace and not experience lots of muscle stiffness after. You just feel good the next day. There's plenty to use here if you're younger and stronger, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent teaching aid","review":"My daughter is a Pilates instructor and fell in love with this book and has incorporated many of the exercises into her programs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength training in 15 minutes a day","review":"I have been very impressed with this book. The strength training only takes 15 minutes a day and you can do it at home with only an exercise mat, exercise ball and 2 free weights. There is no excuse not to do it when you can do it at home in 15 minutes. She incorporates stretching with the weight-lifting - so you feel better afterwards.

I like action, adventure, and/or survival books. This was not any. I don't read much and this is the kind of book that makes me not want to read. I read the back, looked at the cover, and thought it had to be one of those. I thought Daniel would run into trouble more than he did. I thought there would be more action and excitement. The book isn't even a good for telling you what it was like in the 1800's. The book didn't go into enough detail in anything (except that new governor.) I would suggest pick it up from the library, and if you really do like it then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely boring most of the time. Fair plot.","review":"My 6th grade class read this book in school and I must admit that no one thought highly of it. It was unbelievably boring and the plot wasn't great.

If you are looking for a book on the Revolutionary War I'm sure you can find better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A slow and boring story!!!","review":"In my opinoin, this book is a poorly told and poorly sturctured novel about the Revonluntionary war. Although I'm sure many people enjoyed this story, I found it slow and pointless. Also, the plot was hard to follow. The end of this novel was bearable, but I strongly recommed that you stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Agatha Christie Collection Featuring Peter Ustinov (Dead Man's Folly / Murder in Three Acts / Thirteen at Dinner)","review":"These are good videos because the actors carry off good performances and the Agatha Christie stories have great plots. Peter Ustinov is one of the best Peirots! I think I misspelled the name. I can say it, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three very good movies","review":"Before David Suchet came along to set the gold-standard for playing Agatha Christie's famous detective, Hercule Poirot, the role was dominated by Peter Ustinov. These three movies (Thirteen at Dinner - 1985, Dead Man's Folly - 1986, and Murder in Three Acts - 1986) are probably the weaker three of the movies he made, and they don't measure up to the intensity that David Suchet brings to the role. But they are nonetheless three very good movies. If you like Hercule Poirot, I do think that you will enjoy these three movies.By the way, a fun point about Thirteen at Dinner is that it has David Suchet playing the part of Inspector Japp!(Review of Agatha Christie Collection featuring Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Agatha Christie's Poirot","review":"I have almost all of David Suchet's Poirot, which I have watched many times. I enjoy Peter Ustinov's portrayal of this detective a bit more.His manner is not as condescending as Suchets. And Hastings is most delightful. I have read some of Christie's books and I think Suchet's portrayal is more accurate, but I still like Ustinov a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Ustinov great","review":"You can't go wrong with Agatha Christie or Peter Ustinov. Love all three. I have all his movies and all Agatha Christie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Poirot is out of place in the 1980's here!","review":"I'm a huge Poirot fan and thought that I was open minded enough to see Agatha Christies' Poirot in any sort of reputable production. I like variety. But this \\"variety\\" was too far afield. The entire setting made no sense to me. Poirot set in 1980? The foundation of Poirot's character has no place there (nor in this production) Great actors (expecially when David Suchet plays Japp in Thirteen at Dinner) set in a production that is so horribly flawed I will never watch again. I hate to even give the DVD's to anyone. What a waste.I wish I had believed the other reviews saying this before I ordered. Warning, this will ruin your immage of the Agatha Christie Poirot. It will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peter Ustinov couldn't do a Belgian accent","review":"These are dry, dry, dry! Peter Ustinov couldn't decide on what was a Belgian accent , and often sounded like he was German, or someone from a Slavic country. Ugh, it was awkward, and boring!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was expecting the films to be set in the 1930s/1940s instead of the more recent time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly waste of Peter Ustinov's time and talent.","review":"Hrcule Poirot acted by David Suchet is so far superior than the Peter Ustinov's portrayal. He had a silly accent; David Suchet as Inspector Japp was terrible and while the whole thing I think was meant to be tongue- in-cheek, their tongues should have been bitten instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Three Great TV Movies of Peter Ustinov","review":"I'm so thrilled to hear about Agatha Christie DVD Collection Featuring Peter Ustinov (Dead Man's Folly, Thirteen at Dinner and Murder in Three Acts) being released on September 12th.

Peter Ustinov gives a great performance as Hercule Poriot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edie Claire has done it again.","review":"Edie Claire has again presented us with an easy to read, interesting story with a little bit of romance combined with mystery.

But I continued to watch. Only to be completely \\"blown away\\" by the horrible ending. What a waste. I basically watched the entire movie to get the big race at the end, and I'll admit that I was slightly more interested in the characters at this point, so what do they do? KILL the star, and thus, the relationship with the girl. If your into torture, or a laugh then rent it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy, Secure & Versatile","review":"This is a GREAT wall mount with swing action, full 360 degrees rotation and 45-degree tilt. Easily mounted 24\\" Gateway monitor above desktop freeing up space for \\"non-mountable\\" items such as a printer and speakers. Based on construction of product seems the 50lb weight limit would be appropriate. Advise to mount high enough to accommodate the cables from the monitor that extend to other components and test fit placement before mounting permanently. Would definitely recommend product to another person and would personally purchase another if needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"I purchased one of these mounts and installed a 32 pound LCD TV on the wall. I made sure the mounting screws that were provided in the kit were solid in the wall studs. The TV came crashing down in less than 10 minutes destroying the TV. The mount isn't too bad but the hardware provided is far too small to support the 50 pound weight the manufacturer claims. The screws pulled right out of the wood studs due to their small size and length. I wrote to Amazon and then the manufacturer who would not address this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stoners great tire protection","review":"This product shines great and protects against harmful UV rays. It looks professional and is not messy! Goes on smooth right from the start with no drips, nice and even."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did I miss something?","review":"I just finished this book, and I was disapointed. The subtitle \\"The Bill Tarrant Story\\" should be more like \\"inspired by Bill Tarrant\\". The book contains very little about Bill, the story of his death, a couple of stories about judging dog trials is all. The rest is a bunch of narrative about Mike Gould's philosophy about dogs and Native Americans. Nice enough I guess, but I expected something more like a biography."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book is a MUST HAVE!!!!","review":"I wish I had had this book YEARS ago. The information and ideas in Prescription for Natural Cures has literally changed my life! I can't recommend this book highly enough! Ya gotta get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Prescription for Natural Cures","review":"This purchase was money well spent. Refer to it numerous times. Every home should have one as a reference tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Library","review":"I have always used Prescription for Nutritional Healing as a reference book and this one is the perfect companion. The only problem I have with it is the assumption that everything has a remedy. I prefer the holistic view that encompasses the entire person and use the remedies as \\"tune-ups,\\" rather than as \\"the answer.\\" Great reference book, but again, I prefer \\"Forget the Cures, Find the Cause,\\" both books to really get started at being well and then referencing this book for finer details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good advice, but also some bad","review":"This book helped me diagnose my candidiasis about 9 years ago so I'm grateful for that, but now that I'm much more of a critical thinker and more educated I know it has some bad information in it as well.It promotes homeopathy throughout the book which I'm passionately against. Homeopathy is not supported by scientific evidence and isn't even plausible so it wouldn't even be good speculation. It also has minor mentions of reflexology and other dogmatic advice which would waste someones time when they could be trying a proven treatment.So instead of weeding through the bad advice in this book, I would just recommend getting another book, such as my favorite: Health and Nutrition Secrets, by Russell Blaylock M.D. Dr. Blaylock doesn't just give you advice but also the reasons why and the evidence to support it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not trustworthy information","review":"I bought this book based on multiple positive reviews on Amazon. I am not sure what motivated people who wrote them. Most likely it is ignorance and inability to distinguish real science from quackery. This book does have some useful general information about common health conditions. But this type of information is available for free on multiple health related websites: Mayo clinic website, WebMD and others. A lot of proposed treatments are the same for most conditions: don't eat a lot of sugar and take vitamins A, B, C, E. Some of the proposed treatments are out rite quackery: chelation therapy for example. I would not recommend buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it didn't last longer.","review":"A cute show that was yanked off the air too soon. Tori Spelling basically makes fun of her life for laughs. She figures everyone else makes fun of her, why shouldn't she? You'll love her little mental flashbacks to her younger years that make her the way she is. Her memories of Shannon Doherty are hysterical! Loni Anderson as her mom is great. I can understand why her real mother wasn't so thrilled with her \\"role\\" on this show. Her friends are funny and make her look like the normal one. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved this show!It is such a shame it was cancelled.The show portrays toris life over-dramatized.Her friends are hilarious and make the show unforgetable.My favorite episode is the one with the massuse who spreads rumors throughout the friends to try to get one of the friends' tickets...Or the many episodes which poke fun of Candy (Toris' mother).Great Show! It is such a shame it was cancelled.I give this show (and thusly DVD) 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So funny!","review":"I bought this show because it was on sale for $1.99 at the pawn shop and thought what the heck, I'll give it a shot. I was honestly surprised at how funny this show is! I have never really been a fan of Tori Spelling, but I have a whole new outlook on her now after watching this. She's a very funny person, I love how she can make fun of herself and be completely okay with it. The whole cast is great, they all work so well together. I would pay full price for this, very worth the money. I have watched this probably 10 times or so since I bought it, it's hilarious! Great show, so underrated, wish they had made another season! I've recommended it to many people who have all bought it and love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show","review":"So Notorious is hilarious! The only problem I had was that I didn't want it to end!!!!!Tori Spelling is so funny.

We wanted to play the theme song for background music so we purchased this cd. It's NOT Little Richard singing and not the version our child LOVES. All of the songs are done by the same person. I will give them credit for annunciating and making the lyrics clear unlike the originals but they should make it more clear that that is what it is. Through the laughter, my husband summed it up best, \\"It's like we're at a class reunion at a Holiday Inn w/ a cover band.\\" Now, none of those things are necessarily bad it's just not what we wanted or expected.

Its a quick read and lots of laughs. I can relate all to well to the cubicle world that the lead character, Jay Thompson finds himself in. I love the description of the corporate world and especially his co-workers - Sport Guy and the management staff. I like the way the story weaves in his personal life , so you get a view of his live-in girlfriend, wacky friends and family. I see a lot of myself and my friends in the characters described in the book. My only criticism is that the book is too short - its a quick read and I miss the characters!

It has an incredible bias in favor of its subject, namely the Phoenicians (as the ancestors of the Lebanese), and is therefore not objective. For example, in what amounts to a single page the author dismisses the majority of scholarly opinion which holds that the Phoenicians were practitioners of child sacrifice. Trained historians do not operate in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama-mentory","review":"This is more in the vein of Sharon Kay Penman's triology (Here Be Dragons et al) of early Wales/England. Sadly, it is not quite as well written as that.In spite of this being my grandfather's heritage, I could not maintain my interest in continuing reading. It would have been far better to present the actual known facts and how it is that we know these facts (i.e. what evidence exists to support it).Perhaps, one day, someone will actually write a history of these worthy people.

This pyrex container is better than the regular pyrex container that comes with a microwavable plastic cover without the venting tab. The cover without the venting tab tends to shrivel up a bit after heating due to the steam and pressure resulting from heating. This pyrex container will not have that problem as it has a venting tab which allows the steam to come out during and after heating, consequently, will not result in shriveling.

It's the kind of movie you rarely get from the major hollywood studios. They apparently can't take the risk. There is nothing for your sub-woofer and no special effects (i.e., no cheap thrills). It's a shame that it didn't get any attention. This was the Ashley Judd that I first 'met'.

A must see for real movie buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slice of Life","review":"A quiet, unassuming film about a woman searching for her identity.

He is my favorite philosopher. I was quite startled to learn that he had such an addictive personality. He overused both nicotine and alcohol. The fact that Alan Watts had substance abuse problems doesn't reflect on the wisdom of his teachings, but it does raise the question as to the value of these teachings to positively effect a person's life. Obviously, these teachings did little to help Watts. His early death at age 58 could be considered a deliberate suicide through the abuse of the legal drugs nicotine and alcohol. The author may have sensationalized some parts of Watts' life, but I believe that his private excesses have been well documented elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apathetic and disappointing","review":"Both my parents work in the ER so I've heard ER stories all my life and I know that people who work in ERs have ample justification for discontentment. That said, I was repelled by the apathetic way Dr. Grim dealt in her book with her disaffection from emergency medicine. If there is a problem, why not directly address it as Dr. Pezzi does in his book \\"Believe It Or Not! True Emergency Room Stories\\"? Furthermore, Dr. Grim does her readers a disservice by leaving us hanging at the end of the book. She spends countless pages describing the rationale behind her exodus from American ERs, and then . . . nothing. In her afterword she gives updates on some people mentioned in the book, but curiously she doesn't utter a peep about the central character in the book: herself. That's inexcusable given that the main theme of this book was that she was burned out and was trying to figure out what she should do with her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all you armchair MD's!","review":"After enjoying Dr. Grim's articles in Discover magazine, I couldn't wait to read her debut novel.

Thank you, Queen Afua, very much, for sharing this book with the world and reminding us that all answers are always within."},{"rating":"2","title":"BOOK IS AWESOME!!","review":"This book is a saving grace for many whom are seeking the natural route to cure certain ailments...even the most serious conditions!!I have only read 3 chapters thus far...however,from what I have read soo far I am content to say that this book is a great starting place for holistic health care.This wonderful book not only gives you meal advice or whatnot,but it also gives you an structured plan for the meals..and schelduled timeframes to eat the meals ect.Most of the healing comes from detoxification of the body...and an rested/peaceful mind...which the author explains the importance of the mind and thoughts when trying to achieve significant health.This book is amazing and I am glad I have purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being Rejeuvenated","review":"I find Queen Afua book \\"Heal Thyself\\" very informative, it gives me a sense of wholeness and peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stainless steel value","review":"Looks great in the kitchen with the other steel/black components. The dial (rather than number pad) takes a bit of getting used to but works fine. I love the popcorn button! It cooks fast. We moved from an 11-year-old Sharp carousel R-230 rated 700W -- but this Panny cooks in about 2/3 the time with only 100 watts more rated power. We have 1000W Sharp microwaves at work and this is just as fast. I think Sharp overrates their magnetron power output. Only quibbles are: power cord attaches to the underside front right, so it is more visible than I'd like; the green LED display could be brighter; its made in China so long-term reliability is a question mark. For the money, though (under $100) this is a handsome, powerful unit. Great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portable Microwave Fits The Bill!","review":"Read all the reviews on this product and have found it lives up to the best of them so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic 0.8 Cubic Foot Microwave","review":"As it appears that the heat levels in this model are higher than older models, therefore requiring less time, it's been a learning process, and frustrating at times.

As expected, the display is difficult to read, but that isn't a show-stopper for me.This microwave is just the right size, seems powerful enough, is attractive and appears to be made well. I got used to the dial time mechanism quickly enough.Seems to be a good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The devil's in the details.","review":"I find two things about this microwave very annoying on a daily basis. There is no number pad on this product. Any time I want to enter a number, whether it is setting the clock or entering a cook time, I have to turn the dial. The dial seems to work: 10 sec, 20 sec, 30 sec, 5 minutes. Come on guys; how much money did you save by eliminating the number key pad. Second, the glass plate has three notches to synch up with the gizmo that turns the plate. However, the gizmo has only one element. Therefore two of the plates notches are not aligned with anything, which caused the plate to slip and clunk until the parts line up again. It appears to me the manufacturer has done minimal cost reductions at the cost of customer satisfaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother buying refurbished \\"remanufactured\\"","review":"Bought this bread machine refurbished. It limped along for 4 months with overly burned crusts on light setting and hardly rising whole wheat breads. Finally it died right when we were hosting 11 guests. I called Cuisinart. There is NO warranty on the machine as they scratch off the bottom model number and code. They offered to send out a new one with 3 year warantty at $139. The old machine went to the dump where the worker was very excited to see the stainless steel. Anyway, Crazy and desperate I had them do it.

We are extremely happy with the Breadman Pro."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Made by Cuisinart. Must be good, right? Like the Sham-Wow! guy says, \\"We all know that Cuisinart makes good stuff\\". Except this one does not work well for baking simple loaves of bread. My trusty Hitachi HB-B301 had a broken drive belt, and as Hitachi stopped making this item a dozen years ago, supplies of replacement parts dried up a half dozen years after that. So I bought Cuisinart. The whole concept of its system is different. Two paddles instead of one, a horizontal loaf rather than a vertical one (looks more like the loaf you'd buy at a bakery), and a zillion options to do all kinda of fancy things from fruit cake to jam, but the bread it what I got it for. And the bread was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it.","review":"I bought this machine two years ago. I had a different bread machine for years, loved it, and apparently used it to death. Bought this one because of lots of good reviews. I actually posted a review on a different site after it burned the crust, left flour in the middle and basically didn't work right..ever. That review got several \\"thumbs down\\", which begs a question; is someone being incented to write good reviews? Bottom line is this: this machine is a piece of trash. I tried all of the settings, couldn't figure out what \\"I\\" was doing wrong, and finally realized it wasn't me. It's the machine. HUGE waste of money. I was very surprised & disappointed. Cuisinart usually makes such good products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Baking cycle","review":"This is a convection oven bread machine, which is great! Accept the baking times in the programs are for traditiuonal ovens. So any thing prepared that requires baking will be burned if you allow the program to complete.

It's not just the text and layout, but the book just plows into technical detail with little regard for what makes sense or what is practical.

I personally learned a lot from this book.There are some shortcomings, though.First, the book may be too difficult (or too mathematical) for beginners.

With this size, the letdown does most of the work for me - on the smaller size I found I had to use massage much more. They're also much more comfortable because they're closer to the right size. It's too bad they don't have a larger size in the plastic and that they don't give a more precise way to measure which size you need.

Weaving history with fiction, biography and comedy we are never sure where he is leading in a tale spanning continents and centuries.

To say V.S.Naipaul is a an exquiste writer; a writer's writer would be an understatement.A Way In The World represents a novel of such genius, I was and continue to be in awe of the magnificent and masterly control of the English language. I am in love with writing again. Thank you V.S. Naipual"},{"rating":"1","title":"not a strong point for Naipaul","review":"I am a huge fan of V.S. Naipaul. The premise of this book--exploring the effects of the colonial situation upon the lives of three men--is excellent. However, this book is a confusing conglomeration of three separate and unrelated stories, and there were times when I found myself wondering what was going on. I love Naipaul's flair for narrative and description, but the sections on Miranda are almost entirely dialogue, with lots of obscure references. I actually skipped over the last section on Miranda because I just could not get through it, whereas normally I am unable to put down Naipaul's books. Not one of his best works...in fact I don't recommend it to anyone aside from those hardcore fans who are determined to read everything this great novelist has ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile and Challenging Book","review":"An excellent book. At times it is difficult but it is not impossible. A series of failed revolutionaries and their follies occupy the mind of a narrator, an aspiring writer seeking his place in the world. Modern day revolutions like socialism come and fail, not very different from the past where the imperial powers vied for power with a host of different racial groups in South America. This is my first book I've read from V. S. Naipaul after hearing that he won the Nobel Prize. Based on this, I'm going to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a bad book...just sort of 'scattered'","review":"To borrow the authors' own words...this book is a slippery piece of work. You slip about and lose your footing. It's nice and easy and clear and brilliant for many pages...then, you suddenly feel you've not been paying attention. The author would say those periods are precisely the places you (the reader) have to identify as that is where the writer decides to add and hide things. The book is VERY well written. I learned a lot from the historical aspects of the novel. There are four intersecting stories going on in this book and I think four separate EXCELLENT novels would have been a better arrangement. It does assist in telling you that 'I have to discover myself again'. And it profoundly hints that success comes from a little good luck, talent, knowledge and prestige. I also laughed when I read a line in the book: 'You are tormenting yourself needlessly' as that was how I felt at certain moments of reading this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"bulky, heavy, too big has no sense of design","review":"this model of Steinhausen I fainted when I found that I often had to manually set the little day of the week dial, as it did not stay synchronized with the timekeeping of the watch, this one in particular is bulky, heavy and too big for normal hand, also the Italian fake leather would fall the pin having an opportunity to loose your watch.

I guess it wasn't enough of a feel good movie, or didn't have enough star power, or maybe was just too realistic for the megaplexes to like. This is a movie to make just about everybody squirm, and that's part of its charm.

It is a thoroughly beautiful story about friendship, in particular a lifelong friendship between 2 couples. I know of no other book that explores this topic so well.

Crossing to Safety is the story of two couples from very different backgrounds who form a lifelong friendship during the Depression when both men are professors at a university. Stegner tracks their lives at each point of intersection with empathy and beautiful prose. The book reads as a meditation on idealism and the individual and group reactions of these inherently 'good' people to the blows that life and circumstances inevitably inflict upon them.Read this book, and then read everything else Stegner wrote, especially Angle of Repose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"In Crossing To Safety, Stegner follows the lives of two families and the friendship they maintain for more than forty years. Upon finishing the book, I was literally stopped in my tracks before I could choose another book to begin. I was so moved by the story and by Stegner's writing that I did not want to start something else. His prose is powerful, and he captures not only how the years go by and how simple days are spent but also how we choose to die. His ending is as suspenseful as any thriller and it involves only life and friendship. The final two words of the book are beautiful and portray friendship in its simplest -- and most real -- form. In the end, a good friend is one that calls out or answers you in the night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare jewel of a novel","review":"I started to read Stegner's \\"Angle of Repose\\" and couldn't get into it. Then I read \\"The Spectator Bird\\". Really good, interesting, and even a bit shocking. It gave me an idea of Stegner's breath as well as depth. But \\"Crossing to Safety\\" is more than just a story - for me it was a memorable experience. Some of that involved the intersections of my life with those of Stegner's and his characters in the book: University of California, University of Wisconsin, Harvard, New England. But mostly it was the compelling story of how we are all shaped by life, love, friendship, ambition, personal tragedy and transcendence. The writing is just beautiful, done with a wonderful sense of place, of nature, and insight into human relationships. This is a book to savor. Stegner was a prolific writer (and much more), but this book has to be up at the top with his very best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant story-telling","review":"Haunting, sweet, sad, the characters have incredibly well-developed depth and complexity. I'm a huge Stegner fan and this story does not disappoint. I just re-read it for the 3rd time and enjoyed every moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story to Savor","review":"Good story well developed. I don't know why I am enjoying it. It is slow by most standards. Perhaps that is the style that draws me into the story allowing me to savor the experience of the characters. Perhaps that is why most modern novels leave me feeling I have entered a two dimensional world while this story is rich in detail and plays gently on all my senses creating a place for me at the banquet. I do not want the book to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing Safely","review":"Read this along with End of Life Book Club and loved it! Lots to talk about in with my book club friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story for friends","review":"My fiance and I gave a copy of this book to our best friends, and it has been a topic of conversation ever since. It's a beautifully written story about people who you wish were real - they're just the kind of people you'd like to meet. Share this one with the people you love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Print too smal","review":"The story is wonderful but I had to buy another book. The one I purchasedwas a \\"small\\" book with very small print. I couldn't read it. I didn't realizeI was purchasing a 1/2 size book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing to Safety","review":"A truly great novel. Stegner is an astute observer of the private lives of people...families, friends, husbands and wives. I bought a used copy and the qualiaty was excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the finest if not THE finest book I've ever read.","review":"This is a novel obviously borne out of a life-long love affair...an affair of philleo love between twoacademic couples. Stegner places his story in the halls of academia and includes much of the angst of that world,Crossing to Safety is brought to life by the Morgans and the Langs, two couples whose friendship bridges a span ofthirty-five years, through their young years as green professors at the University of Wisconsin through theirthe growth of their families and the ultimate and inevitable ravages of time that bring each to treasure their relationships.This is a story populated by loving and lovable characters, clearly drawn and living in a real world with real problems.Stegner's prose is incredible, his decriptions vibrant, his affection for his story and characters obvious."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the great 20th century American novels","review":"Wallace Stegner is one of the great American novelists of the 20th century and this novel is his final one and the crowning achievement of his career.This is an elegaic work that spans the lives of two couples from their meeting at college till near the end of their lives. It is a deep, profound meditation of friendship, aging, career, & competitive jealousies.My favorite scenes are the Italian festival in which the protagonist watches as a predawn procession of peasants with candles draw mysteriously closer and closer to him. The last scene, set near the close of one of the protagonists' lives was heartbreakingly beautiful and I couldn't help but cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have ever read","review":"Wallace Stegner is simply one of our finest writers and this book is great on so many levels. Remarkably little happens in the story, and yet he brings you so close to the characters that you can't take your eyes off of them. He won the Pulitzer for \\"Angle of Repose,\\" which is also great, but I found Safety a far speedier, enjoyable read. If you have an intellectual bone in your head, you cannot go wrong with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be missed","review":"This book is a gift to everyone who is a friend or has a friend - basically everyone. It is the beautifully-written story of two couples who remain close despite changes in physical location and life-altering situations. Wallace Stegner writes of each couple's unfailing courtesy toward and compassion for the other in truly memorable prose. The reader is able clearly to see each person individually, as part of a couple and as a member of their quartet. I truly hated to see this book end and I already look forward to reading it again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that reflects the true nature of friendships","review":"This book made me remember how friendships develop and how powerful they can be. Stegner draws you into the relationships. I did not want to finish it and when I finally did, I appreciated the friends I have and those I have lost. My brother in Amsterdam is reading it now. He just keeps muttering about how great it is. If you've known real friendship, it will touch you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice follow up but I still love \\"Angle of Repose\\"","review":"Crossing to Safety is a nice follow up to Angle of Repose although lacking the depth and detail of Stegner's prize winning work. The prose is fairly tight with vivid images, interesting plot and detailed character portrayal. Substantial but again, just love 'Angle'!read it. you'll definitely walk away satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The reviews for this book persuaded me to purchase it, however, I was disappointed. It was a rough read. The sentences seemed to run on and often I got lost. The ending was no ending at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I stopped on page 50","review":"I took a course on the art of reading at the Teaching Company. The professor, who was very good, told us that we should give novels that we don't immediately like a chance. If, after 50 pages we still don't like it, he says we can put it aside without feeling guilty about it.So I made it to page 50 before giving up.I gave it two stars because the quality of the writing is excellent. The characters are round. But the plot is lacking. Nothing happens. The people aren't terribly interesting. They have career and medical problems, just like everyone else.Read it if you're a writer interested in literary fiction. Otherwise, I would skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"CROSSING TO SAFETY","review":"Though the writting in and of itself was not bad, there was virtually no story of interest, no depth to the characters or their interaction, no educational value as to learning about new things, new places, or new ideas. This was the incredibly boring story of the very long relationship between two couples. At the end of the book, when finally some attempt is made to understand the dynamics of their relationship the book simply ends, leaving the reader frustrated and asking why they even bothered to finish it. It is a sad reminder that too many people live life on a very superficial plane and are content, as it is clear this author does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the worst","review":"While this is not the worst book that I have read, it falls to the bottom of my list. I found the book to be tedious, the characters to be poorly developed, and the style inadequate. The characters never came alive for me and I was glad that the book was over. It was like eating an old, soft, tasteless apple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, manipulative, melodramatic","review":"One-quarter of the way through, I had to keep forcing myself to finish reading this book. But read it I did, every insipid, insufferable page. The author tries so hard to make us love the narrator and the other three characters but I failed to see their charm. I found them unsympathetic and unbelievable. Ultimately this is an old professor's fantasy, with the oh-so productive yet self-effacing wise narrator, his virile friend who, despite his wife's resistance, only wants to write poetry, and of course their supportive wives. The friend's wife is revealed to be somewhat of a nag and control freak but we love her anyway. Sure enough, each wife becomes seriously ill. With little effort, you can see how this book could be adapted into a movie for the Hallmark television series. This schlock is dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crossing to Safety","review":"I have talked to others and all either loved the book or could not even finish it. I could hardly finish it. The problem is nothing happens which makes the book too drawn out. I found the first 1/3 of the book was enjoyable enough, but after that I felt nothing was going to happen, and realizing this, I did not want to continue reading to discover I was correct. All the while, Stegner congratulates himself that a book can be written about nothing and people will enjoy it (one main character is also an author, maybe even Stegner). If you want to read about two couples, one with a very controlling wife, and their not too exciting lives then this book is for you. But do not read it for other reasons because the writing, the character development, even the description of the couples' relationship is average at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to understand the title","review":"After reading this wonderful book return to the Robert Frost quotation that introduces the novel and think on it for however long need be. It all falls together. How many of us cross to safety while the Customs are sleeping -exhilarating"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written!","review":"Stegner's beautifully written tale of friendship between two couples is a pleasure to read. This study of the duration of a friendship that is at the same time ordinary and extraordinary is absorbing. However, the lack of depth in most of the characters, except for Charity, is disappointing. Why does Larry stay with Sally? Why does Sid stay with Charity? Indeed, what makes a friendship endure? Nevertheless, Stegner's beautiful prose makes up for the lack of character development. He weaves a memorable tale of four quiet lives intertwined."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern English at its best!","review":"Stegner is a master of the English language. He is able to give you a complete feeling of being present with his characters. You learn about the people, the setting, the mood and you feel part of it. Compared to Angle of Repose, this is uplifting and will make you feel at peace. It is a novel that describes the struggles and defeats of life, but promotes an acceptance and a finding of beauty in even the most mundane of circumstances. As one of the characters in the book mentions, this book is about ordinary (and yet rather rich) people who experience everything a normal human does. Stegner makes it interesting to watch ordinary life unfold in the characters. And gives you rich prose that creates a whole world into which you can immerse yourself and become familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate, complex and surpisingly moving","review":"Right away, in the first few pages, Stegner writes of a walk in the woods listening to all the \\"shy little rustling things\\" - I was charmed. I just love that image. The delicate, forgiving, deeply human, almost uncomfortably honest musings on human frailty and the heartbreaking beauty of the world we live in make this book much more than a story of four people. Stegner's view of the limitations and surprising resiliency of love are truly inspiring. The kind of book that makes you want to know the author, have coffee with him. His wisdom and wit, his quiet observations that, on reflection, are almost startling in their honesty and clarity... I can't recommend this book more highly. That we have lost Wallace Stegner as a writer is truly sad. Crossing to Saftey, Angle of Repose, and Big Rock Candy Mountain... all should be on your shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"We all want a Battell Pond","review":"After finishing this novel, I realized that despite the controlling nature of Charity, all human beings want and perhaps deserve a deep, rich friendship to accompany them through life's ups and downs. But how can you not sit back and say, \\"Poor Sid\\"? As others have mentioned, the ending is emotionally devastating, not tragic, yet somehow appropriate.I wish Stegner had written a follow-up novel about the remaining 2 Adams and the crippled Eve. It would have been interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crossing to Safety","review":"I found this book strangely compelling. I kept waiting for the sordid details to be devulged about these warm characters and yet Stegner finds a way of pulling us in without putting them down.A true life tale of friendship, love and the real meaning of life. Although the ending left me puzzled, I overall thoroughly enjoyed my time with these characters and hated to see the end of the book come."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great bookclub read","review":"I enjoyed it. It was a sophisticated look at a seductive culture and the intricacies of relationships. What we choose and why we make the decisions we do. It was insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story of two couples diverse in nature, but linked by devotion","review":"Wallace Stegner is an engaging writer, gently weaving storylines through the academic beaucracy of universitity to the gentle story of the professor's wives. Two couples from different social and economic backgrounds meet and are forever linked through friendship and their growing families. Compassion, trust and devotion for each other as life changes and turns.

I first read Crossing To Safety ten years ago and have reread it again and again. This story of friendship touched me greatly and I have shared it with many friends. I also recommend The Spectator Bird and A Shooting Star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down","review":"I must admit that I started this book at least three times, not being able to get past the first chapter or two. My friend had recommended it so highly, I figured there must be something to it. I did get past those first ten or fifteen pages and that was all she wrote. I couldn't stop reading this book until I had to - when it came to an end. What a tremendous story of friendship, acceptance and love. I am going out to purchase Angle of Repose tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life as it is","review":"I am agonizing over recommending this book to my book group; this very night I am still waffling. This book is a peek into the lives of two somewhat ordinary couples. I relished reading, from a man's perspective, about the overbearing wife of his best friend, and his feelings at being married to a woman with severe physical challenges. As much as I enjoyed the book and know that great conversation would be stimulated by it, I believe that my group will find Crossing to Safety to be too tame and perhaps even tedious. My advice to you: read this if you are interested in normal people and what makes them tick; avoid it if you are a devotee of fast moving fiction, heavy on sex and disfunctional families."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Master's Masterpieces","review":"Wallace Stegner came into my life in the way your curtains flutter with the first spring breeze. I needed him like a breath of really really fresh air. I searched for a new awareness...and new way of seeing.This is slice of life. Understated. Sensitive. Poetic and romantic and tragic. It is about us, and our days--if even through the story of four we never knew. If I could see as clearly as Mr. Stegner, I am not sure, but I would hope to remain so humble not only in my self, but in my way across the page.If you need hot hard action, there is only a little here. If you like things to come up behind you and whisper in your ear, or poke you between the ribs, this is good, choose this. This will hold you for the rest of your life.

The message I got from MS support was that this was a problem in the software that was 'hard coded' (their words) and so when trying to update construction info you get a message that says 'can't find the update server' - evidently they moved the location of the update file and neglected to update the software.

But the annotations contain hundreds of tidbits that are useful for general purposes.Together with a book like \\"Art of Attack\\" this is all you need on the topic for starters (then get Tal's Life and Games).

For those who, like myself, grew up with the \\"Little House\\" books, these titles will be a disappointment. The writing is extremely average, the plot lines are thin, and the author seems to be more interested in narrating the live of a widowed clergyman and his rambunctious children (and his search for another wife) than anything else.If it were not for the \\"Little House\\" connection, these books would never have gotten anywhere.

The technical aspects were simply explained without being condescending or disinteresting.

Alma Mahler must have been possessed of much charisma and fire to attract the geniuses that she did, but Keegan's dry account of Alma's self-absorption and reputed beauty left me wondering what she had missed, since the portrait does not accord with the events of the subject's life. (The movie of the same title, by the way, has the same flaw, though it at least paints an atmospheric picture of turn-of-the-century Viennese society, which the book also fails to do.) The book also bogs down with information about Austrian history and classical music that is far too inside-baseball to be interesting to a general reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I don't believe in premium cables.

While I'm not overly impressed by Monster Cable consumer hype, I am greatly impressed that they offer a highly specialized cable in a perfect short length. So I don't mind paying their price, because it is a perfect fit. No buyers remorse, either. I bought this cable because it was an exact match for my needs, but I'm also happy with the quality of construction and connectors.

I can relate to you how Rush Limbaugh is a hypocrite for using drugs and evading the draft and since he claims to be a conservative, I can argue that all conservatives are using drugs and do not wish to serve the country.In the end, Tammy Bruce is using her name and background as a way to make a substantial, yet dishonest, living.Save you money and borrow the book from the library like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Obvious Stuff","review":"Fairly interesting, but obvious stuff. Only a completely blind and ignorant person could not see that the \\"Left\\" has been lying, distorting and manipulating the media, courts and general public discourse for at least the last ten years. A group of amoral people guided only by power politics is bound to be treacherous and and dishonest. That's what feminism/homosexualism/liberalism are all about.

Though I have no opinion of the woman, there are several other routes Bruce could have taken, but she kept with the Dr. Laura option.She does make several key points, but she never solidifies them. They are only opinions and they remain as such. She offers absolutely no solid evidence on why she thinks her viewpoint is right. Only opinions that are slanderous and also libelous.As a newspaper reporter, I found myself seeing how much she doesn't know about the media, though she tries to come off as a self-imposed expert. I also have the feeling that she missed the mark on several other issues as well.Not a very well-developed book. Really it's just rambling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tammy Bruce hits a home run, but the liberals will miss it","review":"Tammy Bruce has written an outstanding review of our society today. This kind of honest criticism is right on target, andit comes from an author one might expect to take the other sideof these issues. I agree with her on virtually every point, butthis has to be a book that the liberals will not criticize but will totally ignore. Well written and interesting; it is difficult to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gutsy Defense of Classical Liberalism","review":"Tammy Bruce is that old-fashioned, almost extinct thing--a liberal who also believes in real fairness. In this exciting book she explains how the collectivist, socialist, PC beliefs of the elites in American culture are robbing us of the most basic of rights: the right to say what we think without fear. This book is actually more useful tham Bernard Goldberg's \\"Bias\\". Bruce gives dozens of examples from universities, newspapers, television, and government to show how determined totalitarian-minded people try to restrict the limits of discourse in society. Most impressive is the clear way she sees how her own allies--the feminists and left-wing gays--are some of the worst offenders. (She reminds me of a female Andrew Sullivan.) A book this courageous and stirring doesn't come along very often. You should read it immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"democommies can't stand it","review":"Democrats can't stand to hear that they are lying.

I agree with some of the basic premise of Ms. Bruce's book, that forced conformity of thought is detrimental to the proper functioning of a democracy (spare me the Republic vs. Democracy argument). The reason I gave the book one star is that the same people who hold freedom of expression so dear are now the same ones who label any dissent from the current administration as \\"Anti-Americanism\\", and I feel Ms. Bruce would be among that crowd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sophomoric read.","review":"Even though I find my self in agreement with most of the author's opinions, this book is not terribly interesting. Though Tammy does get in a few eloquently written pages, most of the book reads like one of the better composed messages on an internet chat room thread war.Any reasonable informed person won't find much that is new or insightful here. This is a collection of a few personal anecdotes, many pages that amount ot nothing more than expressions of personal angst with the left, and yesterday's headline news.I would rather read a well composed treatise by someone I vehemently disagree with than a pedestrian work by someone who shares my views.

Excellent, candid, thought-provoking - we're passing it along to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on the sad state of America","review":"Tammy Bruce's book is a wonderful comentary on the damage being done by politically correct thought. Bruce, who is a liberal, exposes what she sees as inherent contradictions in the liberal ideology, as well as takes vehement opposition with the tactics employed by liberal politically correct scholars. Bruce argues that the liberal agenda is rooted in censorship of alternative points of view, with the systematic destruction of anyone who opposes the liberal voice.If the book had been written by a conservative, it would easily be billed as propaganda. The fact that it was written by a liberal (former President of the LA chapter of NOW), gives the book formidable credentials and a unique voice. Bravo to Tammy Bruce for this insightful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the best book on the subject of Left leaning thought control I have ever seen.I was sceptical when I purchased it because of the description of the author but thought I would give her the benefit of the doubt.Tammy Bruce absolutely nails it! She exposes, many times through personal experience, all of the things we have suspected for years.Anyone on the right should read this book get an insider's confirmation.

For my entire life, I have had the same notion about organizations proposing to represent my point of view on any given opinion, yet it was rare that I did not immediately feel discomfort when surrounded by the members of each organization who seemed to treat their cause as the only point worth listening to. There was never a discussion of how someone outside the group might view the same issue, just a beating of the drum for the cause. Ms. Bruce offers real evidence based on her vast experience and that should be interesting to not only those who oppose the liberal viewpoint, but those liberals, like myself, who do not blindly follow without examining the issues more closely. Ms. Bruce has real bravery, a quality all too rare in these black and white times."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Thought Police","review":"Ms. Bruce's book is one of the most thought-provoking books on politics I have read in a long time. It is filled with fascinating stories \\"from the inside\\" that reveal the dangerous effects of political correctness run amok. Her writing style is terse and engaging. I would have found it difficult to put the book down, but for the fact that her insights into the psychology of politics were so interesting that I found myself constantly pausing to ponder the implications of her ideas. I strongly recommend her book for reading by anyone interested in politics, whether you are on the left or right."},{"rating":"2","title":"We NOW know why the left is bashing this book","review":"I notice many on the left are bashing the book, the reason is the fact that this book shows the hypocrisy of the left and how they want the general public to be as brianwashed as they are.Tammy does a great job showing that NOW has nothing to do with women and everything to do with Far-left politics and how Pat Ireland was a liberal activist and not a activist for women!Like a reader said before \\"this should be required reading on college campus\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"wah! daddy didn't let me have the car tonight","review":"Bruce's claptrap can be summarized by that.Learn to think, Tammy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break!","review":"This book is a joke.

Tammy Bruce speaks the truth about mind control and the media hype. We are now being judged on our opinions and not our actions. However, the way she has written the book does not do it justice. In this book and earlier books she makes statements such as liberals and PC people think child sex is OK and gays want to ctach AIDS as some mark of respect? Sure there may be some loonies out there, but most of the left PC are not this crazy. By including these far out examples it makes the rest of the examples less believable"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts","review":"Tammy Bruce clarifies for many of us what we've known all along; the weak are like pack animals.

Personally I couldn't possibly give enough praise to Miss. Bruce. How enlightening this book is for the general public who look at conventional TV and news and wonder who they are talking about when they say us. Thank you Tammy Bruce for telling us who \\"they\\" are speaking to and \\"their\\" real motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a GREAT BOOK","review":"This book is for anyone, conservative or liberal who wants to know the real truth behind the insidious attack from the left on free speech. What was most impressive about the book was the candor and honesty of Ms. Bruce, a lesbian and feminist who should be defending the actions of the liberal left, but instead she exposes them. I had a very tough time finding this book...it seemed every store I went to was sold out (from other reviewers I guess I was not alone). Well, I pursevered and finally found a copy and boy it was well worth the read.

It's called open-mindedness, and is the smart approach. Desperately hanging onto old views even after seeing evidence that they are wrong is NOT smart.Example: I used to be a big proponent of increased gun control, including banning of many different firearms. Now, I have the opposite viewpoint. Does that make me a hypocrite? It doesn't, because I learned more about the issue, filtered through info from both sides of the debate, and concluded that tighter controls will limit only the \\"good guys\\", because the \\"bad guys\\" don't follow the laws in the first place.I applaud Tammy Bruce for having the guts to think for herself, and not simply read the script handed to her"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is bandana","review":"Alright, this is a bit ridiculous.

While this visage itself may be helpful for young people, it had an exaggerated, self-caricaturing effect. Most importantly, however, it was designed to create an imaginary solidarity between Britney and her fans.

I give the book a perfect 5!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed very much!","review":"I liked this book very much. Although the plot itself was good, the Spears' team needs a little work with their descriptive imagery. They didn't use a lot of creative words to describe the scene, though some good ones were randomly thrown in. The book itself is very good, but beware cheesy mushy moments. I preffered the times when Holly's mother embaressed her. Those were realistic. It is a struggle-at the end all better story. It did keep me interested throughout, even if the plot was unoriginal. It is a teen book, because they talk about teen issues such as drinking and the likes.

Holly loves to sing, and she is great at it! Her and her mother have a very tight bond together. A bond that begins to crumble when Holly gets accepted into a very rich, and very nice music school, Harverty. As soon as she arrives, she feels embarrassed by her humble beginnings and her homeade clothes, compared to the other rich girls'. But, her room-mate, Ditz, is fascinated by her small town and loving mother, as opossed to her parents that buy her everything just to get her out of the way, and never have any time for her. At the end of the book, Holly's mom tells Holly a very crushing secret that could destroy their relationship forever.......Read it, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"I read \\"A Mother's Gift\\" by Britney & Lynne Spears because I am a big Britney fan and enjoyed their first book.

The book is an amazing heartwarming story about a girl who doesn't have much in terms of material things but when she joins a school, because of her fabulous voice, full of rich students with lots of things she realizes how rich she really is with all the love surrounding her and her single mother in her small town. I know this sounds like the same old story we've all heard several times, but this is really different. The story has twists, secrets, and surprises and is written from the perspective of a teen girl in high school which makes it an interesting and great read all the way through. I would suggest this book to all (especially teens) - Britney fans and those who will be after reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"I think this book was amazing.

I've discovered numerous typos, creative sentence structure, and an annoying hick's-view-of-the-world perspective that was offensive to anyone who lives in rural areas.I feel sorry for those who spent $15 on this -- it wasn't worth the $1 I paid.

Britney may be able to sing but she can't write."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who told Britney she could write?","review":"... The story itself is sugarcoated, sterotypical, and unoriginal. The country girl is a poor redneck with big dreams. The rich girl, Ditz, is materialistic and unloved/ignored by her snobbish parents. The writing style is horrible. There's barely any flow between sentences and it's really awkward at times. This story is definitely not one to read if you can't sort things out.

To read this book I think you must start reading it with an open mind...and forget who wrote it. Because it IS really a good book and i think people under-estimate Britney.

In the hands of a talented writer it could be a interesting and engaging story, however this book was not written by a talented writer, and story suffers. The plot is predictable and the writing is awful. This book has wide margins and a large typeface. This book is discouraging to writers like myself and others(who have shared their opinions) since it seems to prove that you can get a book published without any talent whatsoever.

I have another capresso in another place and it works fine, other than the shell is cracked. I tried the cuisinart coffee mill and coffee grinders and did not have much luck with them, as to the consistency of the grind. The coffee mill did OK, but after a year it jammed because I did not know you have to clean the opening every so often, otherwise it plugs itself shut. I am still sold on the capresso, it is a nice grinder, but next time, I shall go to Bed Bath and Beyond, so that if there is anything wrong, I can return it exchange it instantly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a consistent grind","review":"The grinder at the office broke and we replaced with the Capresso Cool Grind Model 501. The big problem is that some of the coffee beans don't grind at all (or just get broken into \\"quarters\\") and grinding longer doesn't result in a finer grind. The result is a mix of grind size and no control over the level of fineness. (I consider this a basic failure of a grinder)On the plus side, it holds a -lot- of coffee beans. If you have a 15cup maker (or larger) this seems like it would handle the number of beans required. For our 10 cup maker, we fill it about half to 2/3 full.

The grounds stick to the sides and bottom and I have to smack it several times to get all the coffee out.

The new grinder was inexpensive (my Melitta had also been quite inexpensive). The Capresso's design was also very similar in to my old Meltita (at least that's what how it seemed). However, the texture of the ground coffee it produced was very disappointing: very uneven -- small granules plus lots of big chunks -- and additional grinding didn't fix the problem. I was grudgingly willing to put up with this situation rather than hassle with returning the grinder and selecting another...... Then, after less than 1 month of use, it died. While grinding one morning, I detected a burning motor smell (motor oil), saw fine wisps of smoke, and within a 1 or 2 seconds it konked out.What a piece of junk! Very very very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly planned construction","review":"Bought this grinder, white version.

This one stayed in the box until I actually opened it. I cleaned the grinder, got my coffee beans out, and plugged the grinder into the wall socket.... and discovered the switch was broken and the stupid thing wouldn't turn off. I'd call that a dangerous malfunction.I returned it for a refund. Don't waste your time or money on this grinder.

However, for grinding coffee it comes way short. If you grind for the thirty seconds it wants you to, then the grinds it produces are way too dusty. Dusty grinds makes for a bitter, gross coffee. Grinding for only about 10 seconds makes some nicely sized grinds with a lot less dust, however there are still entire beans left in the finished product. I have to pick out some of the larger chunks and re-grind them. I'm not a coffee aficionado, but I can definitely tell that going by the instructions with this grinder produces practically undrinkable coffee.For a cheap grinder, it's certainly held up well over a year or so of occasional use.

The book is presented as non-fiction, it's clear from early on that it's complete fiction. Which is fine if that's what the author is selling, but from reading the editorial review and the about the author section it's implied that the book is a true story. The author may have worked for the CIA(I have my doubts) but the book seems to have been written by a teenager.

Because of the Viking telltales he leaves behind at every murder scene, Hank eventually becomes known as \\"Odin.\\"Hank is a uniquely flawed character, a true antihero; his shortcomings make him more believable, and oftentimes even admirable. Put another way, though witty and streetwise, Hank is also imperfect. Despite his many skills (e.g., fluency in several foreign tongues, mastery of a brutal martial art),Hank still makes the occasional mistake, some almost fatal, and has his fair share of bad luck.

I have a problem in the forward where the author identifies \\"The Sons of God\\" of Genesis 6 (this applies to the Book of Enoch, which greatly expands on the enigmatical v 2-6 of that chapter) as the Godly line of Seth (Seth being Adam's third son after the murder of Abel by Cain), and the \\"daughters of men\\" being pagan cannanite women. Every ecclesiastical as well as scholastic authority states that the \\"Sons of God\\" were fallen angels (also known as the Watchers), and that is plainly evident in the Book of Enoch (which the author of the forward obviously didn't read or just missed that part). I've only read The Second Book of Adam (as well as Enoch and the aforementioned forward) as well as some reviews which say that some of the books should be ignored.My main purpose in writing this review is to correct the aforementioned error for the benefit of those who might purchase this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good book for serious beginners","review":"Pretty good starting book for serious beginners in the network security area.

After a free replacement from the company (which took months), the second system decided to blink the red light after a week's use. We decided to just keep it and use the old calendar instead of relying on the electronics. Then, after about 3 months, my 6 yr old son accidentially pushed on it and it broke right off. For what you pay, a bit of abuse like that should not just break the whole thing off, making it impossible to repair. Why not use metal instead of flimsy plastic that develops inevitable leaks? I will not continue to buy any Brita products, however sleak they may look. Don't be deceived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic is as plastic does","review":"As everyone else has been saying: great water and cheap plastic faucet mounting. You touch it to swing the faucet out of the way, it falls off. You bump it while washing dishes (inevitable) it falls off.

It was much more convenient than a Brita pitcher filter, and much faster to get a glass of water. The filter worked well, the dirty filter indicator was helpful, and the spray faucet setting was actually very useful for cleaning dishes. However, just last week, after nine months of enjoyment, the faucet filter started leaking. See the round neck on this thing that screws onto your faucet tap? Right underneath that, water just streams out. I should say that at least it isn't spraying water all over the kitchen, and the filter does *appear* to still function. But there doesn't seem to be any remedy to the leak, other than buying a replacement faucet filter! And you can bet that my new faucet filter will *not* be a Brita!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The filter light stopped working after 1 month","review":"I bought this filter for our kitchen sink.

When the indicator light completely went out we didn't know if it was filtering the water properly.I have heard good things about PUR- but I have no idea if their faucet filters would have the same problem or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's why faucet filters don't work...","review":"It doesn't matter whether it is the Brita or the PUR. The problem is where they are installed: on the end of your faucet. Guess what happens about ten times a day? They get bumped. They get banged. They get whacked. They get loose. They start to leak. They break. That's it. Simple. They make perfectly good filtered water but they don't last because they mount in the worst place possible: right where you wash your dishes. You cannot help banging against them all the time. You can buy new ones over and over and they will break. I guarantee it. Get the countertop pitcher and be done with it.ekw"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"The price might seem a bit high, especially once you factor in replacement filters, but it is worth every penny. The water tastes great and filters last long enough to justify the expense.Installation is as simple as screwing it on to the end of your faucet and installing the filter.Other reviews have complained about the quality of the product. Personally I have experienced no problems. The plastic is very solid and it doesn't leak as long as you make sure it remains tightly attached to the faucet.One word of advice: If you're going to order this, pick up a couple filters ahead of time. I found the price of filters in retail stores to be quite a bit higher than the prices here."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRITA SINK FILTER, JULY 2002","review":"MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN ABOUT THE SAME AS 2 OTHER REVIEWERS, WORKED GREAT AT FIRST , NOT EVEN A YEAR, AND THEN AS THE UNIT LEANS AWAY FROM THE FAUCETT?

After hearing a brief description of this problem, a Brita customer service rep guessed (correctly) that I lived in the New York City area. It seems that the size of sediment particles in NYC water is too small for the initial screen in the filter. This causes the main part of the device to clog up...which causes the filter, after only a few days of use, to dispense perfectly filtered water but only in drips. Brita is aware of this difficulty. There is no way to fix it, except to change the filter every week or two--an expensive proposition. The Brita customer service rep immediately offered to refund the purchase price and sent me a prepaid mailer to send the filter back to Brita, which I did. BTW, the Brita pitcher, which uses a different filtration system, does not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filter & Shower in one!","review":"Will just reinforce the fact that these things are poorly designed.

Together, they led Loose Diamonds through several critically acclaimed releases. Since then, Campbell has released 2 great solo projects, while co-writing songs with songwriters from around the world, and Newcomb has become one of the most in-demand guitarist/producer/songwriters that Austin has to offer.You should get this disc, which will show you the roots of 'Americana' from the band that embraced that style of music before the term had even been coined."},{"rating":"2","title":"The introduction to Spider Shepherd","review":"Stephen Leather has written many books featuring Spider Shepherd.

It's a water filter pitcher combo made of cheap plastic. The container is flimsy and could easily shatter if dropped on a wood or tile floor; be careful with the lids that open and close, as the hinges are thin plastic and easily snap off. We've always enjoyed Brita water for the convenience and improvement on the nasty taste of tap water, but these pitchers are garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine pitcher, with some reservations","review":"The top of this pitcher is a bit fragile; if you drop it on a tile floor, it can break, or at least the small spout cover can break, so beware.The water does filter \\"slowly\\" but acceptable. I say \\"slowly\\" because the job of filtering water by gravity naturally takes some time. The water has to percolate down through the filter surface area; this just is a slow process without any help from positive or negative (vacuum) pressure.The pitcher holds 2 quarts. Frankly, if your water is bad-tasting, you will be filling this pitcher up many times a day. If that is the case, get an inline filter instead. This pitcher is ok for a small family, but for a large, water-drinking, Kool-aid making, tea drinking family you may need a lot more. We have one, and we use it a lot, so I have to say it's pretty good, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim design, but poor-fitting lid","review":"This pitcher fits nicely in the door of my refrigerator which is great!

I don't understand how any industrial designer could feel proud of this pitcher.I'm giving it two stars because the water tastes great, fits well in the refrigerator and looks nice when set out for use but try to find one with a lid that doesn't crash to the floor whenever you pour yourself a glass.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product bent after wash","review":"I replaced my old Brita pitcher with this new one.

But getting it right after it falls off requires more effort than a product like this should.

Bush into an easy to read manner. Each chapter is dedicated to a President and gives six points upon which they are evaluated, which makes comparisons with other Presidents in the book easy. Even with only 223 pages nothing seems to be left out. The book is engaging from beginning to end and before you know it you have gone through twelve presidencies. To end it all Greenstein wraps 13 chapters up in a magnificent conclusion titled \\"Lessons from the Modern Presidency\\". There isn't any more one can ask for.

This game, unfortunately, is the second Batman game I've played ever(the first being Batman Returns on the SNES, which is a good game, btw.). I'd been kinda hesitant in trying the game out because I hadn't seen too much on the game anywhere. So, recently, when I couldn't find anything else to play, I picked up the game and I'm glad I did. They got the feel and look of the Cartoon dead-on. If I had any gripe, it'd be with the controls. For the most part, they were good but, in some areas, it wouldn't do like it should. They'd either be too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Regardless, it wasn't enough to take away from the gameplay experience. I finished the game and had me a blast doing it. I hope they come out with a sequel to this game.If you're a Batman fan or if you're a fan of the cartoon series, you'll find quite abit to like about this game. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It looks nice, gameplay is lax.","review":"It's not such a bad game, but it just isn't much fun. A Batman Animated series title should be GREAT, it has so much more potential if there are creative minds behind it. I felt the writing was poor (like many of things Joker said, for instance). There's not much to it, it seems better suited to 2D. I remember a Batman animated game for SNES was great, they should look to that. Maybe Mask of The Phantasm would make a good game, or SubZero, or any of the original series cartoons, scripted by Paul Dini. It's essentially, a nice-looking 2D game, I think games have grown better since then, though, so much of this was a chore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everlast Hand Wraps","review":"Purchasing from Amazon was much more convenient than going to my local sporting goods store.

This book has to be one of the worst stories ever written. The characters were flat and one dimensional, with unjustified motivations. The story was as interesting as watching the grass grow. I noticed a lot of people who liked the book were huge fans of the subject matter and said little about the attrributes of the book itself, that is because the book is a waste of time. Do yourself a favor - read the preview and see just how right I am."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I stumbled onto the Pearl's first novel, 'The Dante Club', and was pleasantly surprised. When I saw Pearl's second novel, 'The Poe Shadow', I was excited.Unfortunately, the sophmore slump has struck. This book deals with the mysterious death of Edgar Allen Poe. The main character, Quentin Clark, becomes obsessed with trying to find out the circumstances of Poe's death and why many people (including relatives) seem to be hiding things. Clark travels to France in search of the real person who inspired Poe's character, Dupin.This novel moved very slowly, and I found it difficult to keep my interest. The character of Clark was very obsessed with the death of Poe, but I think the end did not justify the efforts that he put forth. The end wrapped some of the story lines too neatly for my tastes.Sorry, but I would not recommend this book. Definitely give 'The Dante Club' a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring books ever written","review":"I am reading this for extra credit in an English class, I sure wish I had picked something else. Never have I take so long to read a book. It is boring and hard to read as it just doesn't move at any kind of exciting pace. I am a Poe fan so I selected this as my project, big mistake. Will be hearing the autor speak this coming week and hope I can refrain from telling him how awful it is.Almost done reading it and still it hasn't caught my attention....this book is not a pleasure, it is a punishment.If I picked up a book to read on my own and it was written like this, I would have long ago put it in my donate box.Unless you just need a book to put you to sleep in under a dozen pages, look for something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A confusing and over-long novel","review":"This novel reads more like a rough draft than a finished novel. Throughout the book the text contradicts itself frequently - for example: in one section of the book the main character is unable to sit up due to restraints around his neck. Only two sentences later, he sits up. Also, the main character loses consciousness very frequently, and so that action loses all of its drama after it happens a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"the emperor has no clothes","review":"This book may be written about a fascinating literary figure at an interesting time in our history, with a potentially atmospheric setting and an intriguing mystery to boot--but it all adds up to nothing when the prose is so bad. I listened to about half this book on tape, but found I just could not bear another minute of it. It was stilted, repetitive, and trite. The language used in dialog and at moments of high drama was just plain embarrassing. Some suggest that the author was trying to emulate the way people spoke in the 19th c, but I don't believe anyone in history would've been this ponderous or repetitive in everyday speech; if so, such conversations are best forgotten.I love mysteries and historical fiction, but have read boilerplate novels in these genres which are far less agonizing and more entertaining to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"... just can't finish it ...","review":"Really.I've tried three times.

I literally dreaded reading it.I've skimmed some of the other reviews for The Poe Shadow and I was relieved to find that I am not an overly-critical, literary snob in my judgement of this book; many others share my view. The book had potential to be great (written about the literary king of macabre, Poe; change of scenery, from U.S. to France; semi-strong unconventional female character, Bonjour) but it just seemed to ride on the coat-tails of historical facts. There were too many facts and not enough development of the plot or pacing.I had hoped it would at least end with a bang but alas, it did not. I'm not even sure if it ever reached it's climax, it was that weak. =\\\\"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Repetitive!","review":"This is one of my most disappointing reads in a long while.

I can finish a book in 3-7 days but this book took me at least 3 months. The topic of the death of Edgar Poe was interesting, yet, the interest failed as the story was so slow to unfold.

Even trapped on a cross-country flight, I could not keep interested in the plot or major characters. The author does a good job of imitating leisurely and feverish 19th prose, but this is the 21st century. I don't have the endless reading time of a wealthy person of the 19th century. For feverish writing, I'll return to any book by T. C. Boyle; for leisurely, any classic of 19th century literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Mysterious Death of Poe","review":"What a great book! For the lovers of Poe, this is a must read. The author delves into the mysterious death of Poe with vigor. He takes on finding how he died with new evidence of his last days that he discovered. Though he is unable to declare how he died, we, the readers, learn what transpired in his last days; it is fitting that we are left with a mystery, because Poe is the inventor of the modern mystery novel. The book is imaginative and very well writen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unforgivingly Disappointing","review":"It was terribly unfortunate that given such an intriguing premise, this book was an incredible disappointment. Edgar Allan Poe has been a source of literary inspiration since I was quite young. To have to read about his death through they eyes of an annoying and unlikable character (actually, the only likable character was Poe himself, not truly a character at all) was painful. I went into it thinking that this would provide someone's theory on how Poe died, yet it never fully accomplished that, making me wonder what it was all for. I have put 3 books down unfinished in my lifetime.

So when I saw that he had written another book I was excited, esp sice it involved E.A.Poe - one of my favorite writers. I was highly disappointed with this book. It's narration is disjointed to the point of distracting, rushed and hurried in some places and slow to the point of dreadful in others. The plot twists are more annoying than suspensful because you just really want to get the story over with instead of having to read another confusing storyline. Overall i finished the book only to see if it got better towards the end and because i can not leave a book unfinished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly-contrived potboiler","review":"'I didn't find this book very interesting; in fact, I didn't finish it. It is a work of fiction, a period piece, in which a young lawyer in Baltimore, one Quentin Clark, attends Edgar Allan Poe's funeral in that city (Poe died there in mysterious circumstances on October 7, 1849, at age 40). Afterward, Clark travels to Paris to look up C. Auguste Dupin, the father of all fictional private detectives, introduced to the world by Poe. Clark's purpose for this visit is an attempt to put together the true story of Poe's demise.The book should have interested me because I have read much Poe, I like mystery stories, and much of it takes place in Baltimore (although around 1849), in a suburb of which I have lived for many years. But somehow it didn't. For me, it was an overly-contrived potboiler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps the most boring book I've ever read.","review":"As a fan of Poe, I was drawn to this book. However, this book is tedious. I find that the most I can read at a sitting is about ten pages. It has a virtually meaningless plot told by even duller prose. It could have been improved by cutting about 300 pages on the editor's floor and duplicating Poe's prose expertise--the short story. Do yourself a favor and read some of the original work of Edgar Allen Poe. I rate this a 1 star because Amazon has no zero stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow Going...","review":"I'm glad that I borrowed this book from the library so that I didn't feel compelled to finish it because I paid money for it.

I was truly happy to be done with it today so that I could check it back in and move on to some GREAT fiction!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nevermore","review":"Being a Poe's fan, I was excited to find this book. I am an avid reader but I have not been able to finish it. Annoying characters, slow and tedious plot,repetitive. It takes more than 100 pages to get something going. I was close to drop the book before that but I kept on reading, with the hope that something good will come. Sadly, it was not worth. The main character seems too dumb to breathe while the rest have almost supernatural powers, being able to fool the whole world. Maybe Poe died of desperation after he realised what mistake he made hiring this guy as his attorney. That would certainly explain it. A huge disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearl Jam","review":"One of the factors that makes for good reading is that the reader must identify, in some way, with the protagonist. This doesn't mean he/she has to like that person - i n some books the protagonist is The Bad Guy - but the reader has to feel some sort of empathy with what that person is doing or trying to do.The major problem with \\"The Poe Shadow\\", one that was a minor problem with Pearl's first work, \\"The Dante Club\\", is that the protagonist, or \\"hero\\", is, to put it mildly, an annoying, uninteresting Jerk. When you add that to a plot that doesn't even start to unwind for the first 100 pages or so, you end up with a work that is best suited for a free gift to your local library.I have a private little mechanic I use for reading novels. If I have to say to myself \\"You've gotta be kidding\\" three times, the book gets tossed. With \\"Poe\\" , Number 3 rang out somewhere around page 100 . . .A major disappointment, and a shadow of the real Poe."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is amazing","review":"This book is amazing!

I am not one that buys a new novel on its release but when I was in Borders the other day and saw this one, having been very impressed with The Dante Club I picked it up. The additional percentages off didn't hurt either.While it did have its \\"thriller\\" moments and Clark seems a bit of a strange bird at times Pearl does provide us with an intellectual exercise worth contemplating. I confess I collect novels with Poe as a main character in fictional works. While Poe is really not a character but the reason for the story,if you are a person who is fascinated by Poe lore this is definitely one to pick up.I thought The Dante Club is better written in the thriller sense. However I do believe Mr. Pearl is definitely a writer who deserves to be read and probably one of the up and comers of this genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Disappointed","review":"As a Baltimorean and a fan of Edgar Allan Poe, I was immediately attracted to this book. I had also read Dante Club, which although not one of my favorites, was well written and engaging. The Poe Shadow, on the other hand, was a terrible disappointment. The actual writing was terrible, the plot lacking, and the characters uninteresting. The main character was abysmally stupid, and his inner monologue almost drove me crazy. I wanted to put it down without finishing it, but I thought that it might get more exciting. That was not to be. If you are looking for a mystery, pick up Sir Arthur Conan Doyle or if you are looking for more about Poe, read a biography.

When Clark learns that Poe's fictional detective, Auguste Dupin, was based on a real person, Clark risks both his career and his engagement to track the individual down and discover the true cause of Poe's death.

Check out the beginning of Natural Science (\\"Wheels within wheels in a spiral array\\") - if you listen to the song while following the transcription, you will see that what is written is wrong.Overall I'd recommend this book - is there such a thing as a BAD drum book?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend for the Intermediate to Advanced Drummer!","review":"I have been using this book for over 12 years now. I received it as a gift during my senior year of high school, and used the book so much that it was literally falling apart. I had to get a replacement. I have also used this book to teach to some of my drum students. Although I have found a few mistakes, the rhythms and time signatures are very accurate.I find it very useful to not only teach time changes and reading skills, but to teach continuity even when mistakes happen.Neil Peart's drumming exhibits finesse and is incredibly intricate. The drummer that uses this book will learn not the K.I.S.S. (keep it simple stupid) method to drumming and timekeeping, but the M.U.S.I.C. (make up something interesting and complimentary) method.I would highly recommend this book to any RUSH fan or intermediate to advanced drummer looking to add a few more \\"tools\\" to their percussive toolbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precision transcription, this is not","review":"Considering that Neil Peart is best known for his precision and consistency, I was disappointed with this frequently inaccurate effort. The inaccuracies are sometimes amusing - Mr. Wheeler's 'imagined' fills are in places a bit harder and less intuitive than Mr. Peart's actual parts. Mostly I was disconcerted however that the author himself apparently has not quite mastered Mr. Peart's work and subsequently has misled rather elightened many students of the art. I'm curious to know if Mr. Peart was ever made aware of the errors and if so what his reactions must have been (he has said that he does not read music and hence did not review the transcriptions personally)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee maker fine. Frother bogus.","review":"I brought the capresso maker for primarily the frother. After two uses of the frother, it did not work, or it took too long.That was about 200 dollars for a function that I do not even use now. It is basically a coffee maker, which i could have PAID for a lot less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coffee maker","review":"We received this coffee maker as a wedding gift 9 years ago and love it. We finally had to get a replacement when several things stopped working (the water container leaked, the steamer wasn't working very well and the little knob to select 3-5 cups broke). It stilled brewed excellent coffee, but too many things were broken, so we decided to buy a refurbished one. The refurbished one is like new and working great. After actually reading all the instructions this time, I think this one will last longer with proper care. It's very important to not only clean the steamer parts within 2 hours of use, but to also turn the steam on without the parts attached to clean it out properly. Decalcification of the coffee maker and the steamer are also critical to keep everything functioning properly. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but pricy","review":"Very hot water makes good coffee, but it doesn't stay hot for 6 hours (more like 2-4 depending on how much milk you add and how hot you like your coffee), particularly if you drink a cup here and there, letting cold air in each time. Still, it's a lot better than burning it on a hot plate for 4 hours.Milk steamer/frother works but is a little messy. You need a pitcher with a smaller opening on top so less splashes out -- the steam blows into the milk pretty hard (actually, you don't want wimpy steam) and spurts a bit at first, and this causes the milk to splash up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Coffee maker and frother.","review":"The thermal carafe portion is just awesome. You no longer have a hot plate to worry about. Coffee has stayed warm for ever 6 hours and was still hot when poured and had to cool before drink. Frother / steamer is very smooth and easy to clean. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"We are on our second one","review":"On the second day everything just stopped. We unplugged it, plugged it back in, hit the buttons and nothing. Capresso sent us a new one immediately. After two months the new one is now not working. It took us two weeks to get a return label from them. Coffee if great when it is working but unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow !","review":"This coffee machine combines brew-through the lid technology, stainless steel thermal carafe, and a detachable milk frother. We use the frother just as frequently for making quick hot chocolate drinks from chocolate milk. The coffee brewer is superior and so is the well-designed stainless steel carafe. Capresso is the leading edge in coffee maker design and has an outstanding customer service department. We just were in such a hurry to use our new machine we didn't bother reading the instructions, so we ended up calling the toll free number twice and each time we were treated courteously and efficiently. We got the impression that this is a small enough company that still cares about it's customers. This machine is a winner and we are now giving them as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"great way to wake up in the morning","review":"THe aroma of freah brewed coffee is a sure way to start my day.The main reason that we purchased this coffeemaker was for the FrothXpress.I have used a press for years simply because I did not like the coffee from prior coffee makers plus, heated my milk in the microwave and used a small beater to get simi-froth.THe Capresso makes a really good coffee and as a plus it is easy to prepare and clean.Now for the frother - the milk goes into a separate container and attaches to a nozzle located on the side of the coffeemaker, you place your mug under the sprout and turn the button and a nice stream of heated milk and froth is poured into you mug.I have discoved the easiest way to clean the froth part is after I'm finished with my last cup of coffee I empty the milk out of the plastic container, rinse and put fresh water in it and process this through the steamer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"We had been using a mini hand-held frother every morning along with microwaved milk to make our lattes, so this was the perfect machine for us! We watched the CD that came with it and found using it to be very simple. The only thing I have discovered, which might be helpful to others too, is that if I don't rinse out the steam pieces just before using the frother, many times the milk doesn't come through, only steam for some reason. (I do rinse the pieces out after each use and let the steam come through for several seconds as the manual says to do). So I have added this step which is not a big deal and it's great! What I am amazed at is how hot the coffee is--far hotter than our previous thermal coffeemaker was even though we preheated the carafe with hot water each morning. We have used the Capresso daily since the end of June 08 and love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one that you've been looking and holding out for","review":"If you're looking for a pump-driven cappuccino system combined with a programmable coffee maker, look no further! After an exhaustive search for the aforementioned, I took the leap with this easy-to-use, and easy to maintain machine. We are so thrilled with it! However, we are fortunate in that we don't care for super-hot drinks...I think that this machine suits our taste well."},{"rating":"2","title":"great coffee maker","review":"I love this coffee maker. I make mocha chino by adding chocolate milk to the milk area. The coffee stays so nice and hot in the carafe without over cooking it. I got this for christmas and all of my relatives loved playing with the steamed milk feature. It also makes a great cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to return FOUR Capresso Units","review":"We ordered, took delivery, opened, tried, called customer service and returned four different Capresso units over a two month period. The frothing function wouldn't work correctly. We decided to keep our four year old capresso coffeemaker (which works pretty well)and canceled our order. On the positive side, I did learn how to return merchandise through UPS and thankfully, UPS did a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capresso should be ashamed","review":"I bought this extremely expensive coffee maker because it purportedly made better tasting, hotter coffee. Not only does it fail to do that, it's not a well made product. The swing out arm for the coffee basket has broken in three places. This is under gentle usage. The frother works well, but $200 is a bit steep for a coffee maker no better than a $30 Mr. Coffee and a frother. I don't know when I've ever bought anything that was more of a disappointment than this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short lived Quality","review":"It was heaven!! For 2 mos., we had tasty fresh brewed coffee with frothed milk at our finger tips. We were spoiled. But now, 4 mos into the $200.00 plus coffeemaker, it is leaking all over the counter if we try to use the \\"auto\\" feature. And worse, the threads on the steam nozzle have eroded and the froth feature can only be used if we literally hold the apparatus together with our fingers! Otherwise the pressure blows the nozzle with a burst of steam, down into the cup below. It is a complete disappointment. I have contacted Capresso and asked for a replacement nozzle. Instead they want me to send the entire coffee maker (leaving me with NOTHING). Very unsatisfactory and for the money, not worth it. I could have spent the $200 on a more reliable machine and frankly, won't buy this brand again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep coffee hot","review":"I'd give it two stars, but for the price and the poor job the thermal carafe does keeping the coffee hot. I normally make about 6 cups in the morning. After 20-30 minutes the coffee is not even drinkably warm. Frothing feature works, but it's more trouble than it's worth. Capresso says it's not aware of the thermal carafe problem, which I do not believe (see epinions.com) and will not exchange the machine for a different model. They said they would send me a new carafe, though I don't think that a new poorly designed carafe that doesn't live up to its manufacturer's claim (hot coffee for 4 hours) will solve the problem. I use a Cuisinart thermal carafe machine now (99.00). I set it to make 6 cups at 5:30AM, and it is piping hot, even if I don't drink it until 7 or 8 AM."},{"rating":"1","title":"customer disservice","review":"After having this machine for less than two years, it had an electrical problem and I sent it back to the company and for $65 they sent me a new unit. Unfortunately it did not work and customer service after stating we must have a bad electical outlet, sent us another one. It didn't work either and this time I plugged it into my computer plug which is fine as is our kitchen outlet. To get my money back I had to talk to a supervisor, but he didn't call me back. Three phone calls later they finally sent my money back, but still no supervisor called us. I wrote to Mr. Kramm and complained about the shoddy treatment I received from customer service and from the broken units from the repair service. NO RESPONSE from a company that is supposed to depend on word of mouth to buy their very expensive product. Shame on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was skeptical but wanted a good frother badly!","review":"Pretty decent bit of a contraption for a real coffee drinker. Honestly I only drink iced coffee in the summer and thats my coffee experience each year. I now have this machine for almost 2yrs and its still in fairly new condition.The frothing mechanisms worked marvellously but I lost patience with the intense cleaning...the novelty just wore out for me. Don't get me wrong, the coffee brews perfectly each time and the coffee really does stay hot for about 5hrs if you keep the lid on tightly. Currently its just another pretty gadget for my counter top. I would consider selling for the right price, its in new condition still with all mechanisms in place and only been used a few times."},{"rating":"2","title":"used over 2 years","review":"Well worth (...). Makes great coffee, carafe keeps coffee hot, at least for a couple of hours. Brews close to the optimum temperature, around 190 degrees F. Most coffee makers crap out in a year or so.

I don't know about the co-leads but Jennifer Love Hewitt is a awesome actress and how she interacts with those who are crossing over as well as those grieving from their loss in simply incredible. This show has not only real heart but is surprisingly enlightening.However the down side is that the show becomes almost formulaic almost like Scooby Doo. There is so much that can be done with this show which it seems like it attempts to switch directions towards the end in realization of this fact. Unfortunately I don't think it was pulled off well.In part the lead Jennifer Love Hewitt is all this show really has in acting, as well as a several quest stars. The real strong suit of this show are a few shows that are spot on perfect yet to repeat their theme would be to cheapen their beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"No subtitles","review":"I purchased the first season based on the fact it was advertised as having English subtitles.

I will certainly not be purchasing any additional tapes of this series and I am frankly upset at the misrepresentation made by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh, the intro is interesting!","review":"This sort of reminds me of Dead Like Me. As in, if you took Dead Like Me, took away everything that made it a good show, added some stupid to it, and shook it up I'm relatively certain you would come out with The Ghost Whisperer.Jennifer Love Hewitt's character is perfect. So perfect, in fact, she comes off as one dimension and fake. I'm not sure if it's just poorly written, or if she's just a bad actress.The guest stars tend to be very strong, but the plots often feel contrived. I enjoyed the supporting cast a bit more than Hewitt, especially Aisha Tyler. Only, I did not see much of them, as the show was myopically centered on Hewitt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, fantastic thriller....","review":"Strongly recommended for those with an inclination towards the wonders of the spiritual world....and an absolute unexpected last episode....worth checking it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Whisperer","review":"The First Season was great!!

Just a few startling noises or sudden movements. The ghosts pretty much just look like people. I think maybe I would describe these as ghost stories for Grandmothers.

I eventually found out while reading the track listing in my car that half of it is unreleased live tracks, while the rest is old material previously released on The World Needs A Hero album. So Why Bother? Why didn't they release the rare and hard to find tracks like DUKE NUKEM, CROWN OF WORMS, ONE THING, COMING HOME, NEW WORLD ORDER, SYMPHONY OF DESTRUCTION (THE GRISTLE MIX), and TRUST (ECW INSTRUMENTAL REMIX) along with the live tracks. Those tracks are harder than heck to come by, so they should've released them instead! AGHHHHHH Only buy if your a completist. Hopefully Megadeth will release another album sometime in the future with all of their rare tracks much in the vein of Hidden Treasures. We can only hope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Use the man indeed.","review":"Well, if you haven't figured it out by now, this isn't exactly a \\"new\\" Megadeth album. What it's supposed to be is unreleased tracks (throwaways?) from \\"Rude Awakening\\" and some tracks from \\"The World Needs a Hero\\".The best of the live tracks is easily \\"Time/Use the Man\\", whose inclusion almost justifies buying this. Yes, I am a big Megadeth fan, have been for years. But, I bought this CD not knowing what songs were on it ... and was more than a little disapointed when I found out that half of the album are tracks from \\"The World Needs a Hero\\" which I had purchased days before.That said, this is for die-hard fans only, and that's just for the unreleased tracks from \\"Rude Awakening\\". Save your money and buy \\"The World Needs a Hero\\", it's much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"De ja vu!","review":"First off i'll start with the albums praise. The two new songs \\"Time/Use the Man\\" and \\"The Conjuring\\" are stellar live tracks, especially the latter. But other than those two the rest of the cd sounds vaguely familiar. Well that must be because the other live songs are on \\"Rude Awakening\\" and half the cd is off of \\"The World Needs a Hero.\\" If i hadn't heard all this before it would have made a great album. My guess is that this cd was mandatory to fufill Megadeth's contract with Sanctuary. So if your looking to start your DethCollection, start at the first and work your way down the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's your head Dave? (or Sanctuary...)","review":"With the ghost of the once mighty Megadeth hanging above the heavy metal world, Sanctuary Records has decided to release this compilation featuring two whole unreleased live tracks, a few other live songs from Megadeth's first domestic live album \\"Rude Awakening\\" which was released earlier this year, and six tracks from Megadeth's \\"World Needs a Hero\\" which was released last year. The two unreleased live tracks (\\"Time\\" and \\"The Conjuring\\") are worth a listen or two, and if this was priced quite a bit lower I could maybe warrant a purchase, but if you already own \\"World Needs a Hero\\" and \\"Rude Awakening\\" than there is absolutely no point in wasting money on this. I just hope that Megadeth will return someday so Sanctuary Records doesn't have to keep putting these types of compilations out just to fulfil a record contract."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why even bother?","review":"Not worth the plastic it was pressed on. Come on Dave, I know you like to make a quick buck, but at least be realistic. The two whopping live tracks that are new you can probably find elsewhere. If anything, some live tracks of other stuff they have played in the past would've been good. 99 ways to die is an example, I've only ever heard once live. My recommendation is that if you are going to buy something, the Rude Awakening DVD is probably the route to go, since it has a mix of everything they've ever played."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contract fulfillment, pure and simple.","review":"So, singer Dave Mustaine 'injures his arm' in January, they release an abysmal live album mid March, then 2 weeks later decides to inform the public of his 'injury' and announce the disbandment of Megadeth.5 months of silence, then the sudden announcement of this little \\"gem\\" comprised of 5 tracks that didn't make the cut on the aforementioned live album, and 5 already released tracks from their last studio album 'World Needs A Hero' - 5 tracks of a 12 track album recycled for this aborted release. Either they owed Sanctuary Records another release or Dave has resumed 'self medicating' himself. Either way avoid like the plague."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful. Buy this over the pitcher models","review":"If you can spare a little more room in your fridge I HIGHLY recommend buying this 2-Gallon UltraMax over the pitchers. It lies flat on the shelf and has a easy to use tap. MUCH MUCH better for kids and anyone else who has trouble gracefully lifting 3 quarts of liquid with one hand (read: most everyone). With this design you simply open the door and fill using the tap. With the pitcher models, the tilt and weight tend to be awkward and I think spill or overpour about 30% of the time -- especially in the middle of the night. The Ultra Max hold about 2 1/2 times the water (less refilling) and costs only $3 more.This change in taste has dramatically changed how much water I drink. Highly recommended. A great gift, especially for those people with the pitcher models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tasting water at last!","review":"I bought this after getting tired of nasty tasting city water. To fill it, I use a big plastic pitcher, and it sits on the counter near the coffee pot as I don't require cold water for drinking. The taste is so much better! The filters are not all that expensive; I bought a box of three when I purchased the thing and they lasted me almost a year. I am in a one-person household. I feel this system is much easier to use than the pitcher or the on-the-faucet systems which have been known to pop off in use, and much less expensive and easy to use than the in-line systems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"I have received the shofar, the first thing I noticed it was the size, instead of 9-11\\" that one has 8\\" inc, the hole has a split, I am very dissapointed, the company never anwser me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal","review":"This is really nice item expecially considering the price of $20.

The only reason i rated this at 4 stars is petty. The pillows that hold the watches, i felt were not as large as i would have like and not as soft or pillowy.

I guess the story line isn't too bad, but the acting......really,really bad ! The actors/actresses seem decent enough, maybe they were rushed through the scenes or something ??There are some good parts, although they seem to have slipped my mind at the moment. Did I mention the bad acting? Actually, the young girl and boy(who were in the basement) did fine, well..OK. It was the mother and father that needed acting lessons, or maybe the director needed directing lessons(?)

There is no other book on design basics that can compare to Zwimpfer's meticulous, encyclopedic compendium of the ways in which we perceive the two-dimensional space. I require it for all my Foundation students, no matter what field they end up pursuing. They find it not just useful, but eye-opening. Zwimpfer objectifies what most non-visual people would consider ineffable.What makes this book indispensable is its flawless design. As one turns the pages, the lavish use of space; the unambiguous, unadorned presentation of text; and the pacing of images all combine to provide one delight after another. Anyone thinking about a career in design--and most of those already practicing it--must own, read, and cherish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy, Unless You Are a Real Estate Mogul","review":"I bought this book because I thought it would tell me more about \\"Playing Monopoly with Real Money\\" and it was $1.50.

I have bought other refurbished products over the years, computers, scanners, etc, etc, and only had this happen one other time. the other product was yet another vtech cordless phone (different model).

If the reservoir has any water in it, and you pour a glass, the pitcher overflows because the parts do not fit tightly together.Get a Culligan Faucet purifier and fill up a pitcher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a start, but after a while....","review":"I brought this Brita pitcher 2 Christmases ago, and have used it ever since. However, be warned, you might have the problems I have been having. Basically, the whole top of the pitcher is broken. The little plastic piece that you open to put water in the filter broke and fell off about 6 months after I got the pitcher. Now I have to buy a new one. So be warned and try not to handle the thing too roughly, because it can't take any abuse. Of course, it still filters water, but it's a hassle just to get it out of the 'fridge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get ready to get soaked","review":"If you have any water in the top reservoir of the pitcher, then when you pour water our, the weight of the water in the top reservoir makes the lid fall off and soak you in water. You have to hold one hand on the lid to prevent it from toppling over when you pour water. So, it is impossible to pour with one hand and hold the glass with one hand.I also agree with other reviewers that it is very messy and gets a lot of water on your refrigerator shelves.I gave it 2 starts instead of 1, because the filter makes tap water taste good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent performance and value","review":"The Brita creates highly drinkable water very easily, and for a relatively low price compared to bottled water. While I don't think the taste is as good as Evian (a very high standard), it is nonetheless very clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"design flaws: the top won't stay on anymore!","review":"Brita's got great filters, and the pitchers *used* to be great -- the tops stayed on like magic. Now, though, they come off constantly -- if there's *any* water in the top section, it'll be all over your counter if you dare to try to pour it. We're switching brands because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Design Flaws","review":"Brita filtered water tastes the absolute best but I could do with out the hassle of this particular pitcher. The flap on the lip broke on the first day because the points that hold it in place arer very tiny. However, the entire lid wantrs to fly off everytime I pour a drink. There is nothing securing the lip to the pitcher itself. Also, if you have recently filled the pitcher, don't bother pouring another drink until it has filtered entirely or all of it will spill out. Major design flaws make this item more trouble than it's woerth so after a month of using this product, I'm scouting for a betteer one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Water Water Everywhere","review":"This is the worst Britta container. First water leaks out the top near the handle when it's recently filled. Second, the cap does not fit tightly like in the smaller filters. When pouring, if you have water in pre-filtered reservoir, it leaks through the front to spill all over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great if you want to tone your arms","review":"I've had the pitcher for two years, and the water is great. With all the money I'm saving, wished I'd make the switch from bottled water sooner. However I can't recommend the Deluxe Water Pitcher, because it's been two years of frustration. Two years of having to take the pitcher over to the sink every time I pour a glass of water because the lid does not close. The moment you tilt to pour the lid comes loose and the water spills. I thought I had a defective pitcher, but when I saw that other reviewers had the same problem, I wrote a letter to Brita. Their \\"response\\" was to send me a new lid (no response to my question about the lid being a design flaw). The replacement lid has the same problem. I not going to pass my frustration on anyone by giving away this 'mistake', I'll add it to the recycle bin and and find another brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea!","review":"I purchased this pitcher as a Christmas gift for my daughter who lives in the country and doesn't like her well water. She loves this pitcher! Says it makes her water taste like bottled water. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Tasting Water","review":"I love this pitcher! I don't have to worry about carrying bottled water in the elevator to the 17th floor or the expense. The filtered water tastes just as good as bottled water, to me. These pitchers last forever, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Strike me dead if I ever buy another Brita product. They have the worst product design! Well okay maybe not THE worst, but they are in the running. I just got done mopping up the kitchen counter, again. Lets start at the top. The lid is not secure and cannot be secured. The pour spout runs like a wide mouth waterfall. The filter reservoir is hard to get in and out and the design itself is lacking in a clear way to make sure you have the reservoir in correctly. Not having the reservoir in correctly results in the tragic half gallon dribble glass.Maybe they should include a towel with each pitcher (They could put their logo on it!) that and the warning to always hold the top on.Granted this would be funny to see, and maybe it was, the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - a dribbler","review":"I previously had a great Brita water pitcher and bought this one as a replacement (I accidentally broke the original). Thought this would be an upgrade but find that most times when it is used, water will flow down the pitcher from under the spout onto the countertop or wherever you happen to be when you use it and dribbles onto the shelf in the refrig. A poor design for the spout. Just proves an upgrade is not always an \\"upgrade\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brita 10 cup Grand model Pitcher ( 60258 42556 on bar code)","review":"After having enjoyed my original Brita Pitcher for many years Ithought I would try this new 10 cup model with digital timer built in reminding you to replace filters.This is an awful pitcher to use, simply tilting it allows the filter to just fall out allowing the unfiltered water to fall in to the filtered water whereas my old model it was snug and fit tight.I cant even believe Brita would release such a lousy pitcher. after reading the reviews it seems others have experienced exactly the same problem.Oh well its going back to the store where I purchased it and will be looking for alternatives to Brita products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning mine","review":"I bought this Brita Pitcher, and an HM water meter. I ran over 10 gallons through the filter, the water filter only takes out about 10% of the measured particles in the water. Brita claims to filter over 90%. My water meter showed my tap water went from 510 total dissolved substances, to 480. Less than 200 TDS is recommended for safe drinking. This Brita filter didn't work as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sizing things up!","review":"Conserves space on the top shelf of refrigerator where all the tall items are kept.This particular shape plus its capacity did the trick and is well worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Top falls off constantly when I pour","review":"This pitcher has flaws! The top is warped and falls off every time I pour from it. Bummer! I contacted Brita, lets see if they replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the filter, buy the Brita 2-Gallon UltraMax instead","review":"If you can spare a little more room in your fridge I HIGHLY recommend buying the 2-Gallon UltraMax instead. It is also by Brita but the lies flat on the shelf and has a easy to use tap. MUCH MUCH better for kids and anyone else who has trouble gracefully lifting 3 quarts of liquid with one hand (read: most everyone). With this design you simply open the door and fill using the tap. With the pitcher models, the tilt and weight tend to be awkward and I think spill or overpour about 30% of the time -- especially in the middle of the night. The Ultra Max hold about 2 1/2 times the water (less refilling) and costs only $3 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Pur instead","review":"I had a small Pur pitcher already and was very happy with it, but I wanted a larger pitcher, so I picked this one up at Target. They didn't have any Pur pitchers and I assumed the quality was about the same...I was wrong. First off, the design of this particular pitcher is really bad. The lid doesn't fit on very securely; it tries to fall off all the time. Also, there is a little indentation that fills with the \\"bad\\" water at the top and leaks all over when transporting the pitcher from the sink to the counter. I used it for 1 month and the whole time, the cartridge leaked carbon particles into the top chamber. As for the taste, it was better than the tap, but I could still taste chlorine. It basically tasted like good tap water, but not as pure as I would like it. So, I'm back to my tiny Pur. I have to refill it often, but it tastes better and it doesn't spill when pouring or moving the pitcher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"This is a pretty good item but it is awfully heavy when filled. Also, you need to be careful when pouring. I've had the top come off and water went everywhere. The filters last about 2 months so if you can buy them on sale, do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Tap Water","review":"We had quite a \\"fancy\\" water purifier for many years and since we couldn't decide what to purchase to replace it, we ordered a Brita for the transition. It's been a good purchase since it makes the water taste good, but it seems the filter goes out way before the two month suggested change. It begins to taste \\"off\\" after about 5-6 weeks. There's two of us using it, me and my husband, and we do like to drink water ... but I would think it should last longer.It's easy to clean and easy to fill. Nice design for its purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigger, but tastes like Charcoal","review":"In Columbia SC we have been voted to have the best city water in the nation. I first purchased the small Brita to filter out the Chlorine but dropped it so I replaced with this larger one. At first I was thrilled with the Brita but noticed in the last few months the water tastes like charcoal even after I replaced the filter and ran several pitchers through it. My husband said the same thing with the pitcher he bought for his work in Charleston, 2 hrs away so different city water, same bad taste after going through the Brita pitcher.I have a bladder condition so the water I consume is very important. I now only drink Deer Park water because it has a Ph of 8 and the bottles are made of less plastic than regular water bottles.If you still want to try this product, buy the small one first to see if you like the taste or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Brita is the Bomb","review":"All I have to say is that this Brita is one of the best purchases I have ever made. You can't put a price on freezing cold water on a hungover morning. I have two homes, one in LA and one in NYC, and I have a this Brita in both. The tap water in either place is not particularly good however the Brita removes the lead flavor and replaces it with tasty water goodness. In NYC, a large poland springs bottle from the deli (nice and cold) is about $2.25 on averages, so what's $25 for never having to leave the home for tasty water awesomeness. The perfect hangover remedy, while offering well needed hydration. Indeed the bomb!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's o.k. but........","review":"I really like the size of this pitcher but there is one thing that I'm not too happy about. The filter doesn't \\"lock\\" down into the top and when you tip the pitcher over to pour the water out, the filter plops out of the top, causing the whole top to fall out of the pitcher. It's very aggravating and just about makes it more trouble than it's worth. The other Brita pitcher I have, the filter locks into place and doesn't do this."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it","review":"It may hold 3 quarts of water, but if you fill it all the way, it leaks when you pour. Also, the manufacturer says that you shouldn't empty it all the way because you want to keep the filter in water. You're left with about a quart per refill. And the lid broke off when I accidentally knocked it with the faucet. Finally, when you get sick of it after a use or two, make sure not to vomit in it. I don't think think it can filter out the trust you had in brita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!

Having travelled worldwide for decades I was familiar with the Brita name from Sweden so I was sure I would get a good product. I was not wrong because from the very beginning of using these interchangeable filters I was very happy with results. I had the water that comes from the filter tested for purity and it hit a homerun of 99.7% pure, and you can't get better than that.

At the 24 inch maker the same, on and on until the end of the ruler. 16 inch centers should also be in red with an up arrow, but is in black, the same as the general numbering system, with a tiny diamond above the number.

There is a clear line of aggressor and victims here, which was Milosevic trying to create a greater Serbia by attacking neighboring republics. This is evident in the facts that no war was faught on Serbian territory and that Nato ended up bombing Belgrade, in Serbia, and finally that Milosevic was handed to the Hague war crimes tribunal by fellow serbs. This war was a tragedy for all involded, and hundreds of thousands of victims, misplaces, refugees, and raped women shouldn't be insulted by the writings of an insensitive blow hard who is simply trying to create a name for himself by stirring up controversy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me.","review":"Sorry, but this one didn't work for me. It seemed as if Sarah and Cole spent the entire book playing cat and mouse games. Also, Sarah was rather immature in her expectations of Cole and her sister.

The oils released from grating the herbs cause the grated herbs to clump and they remain in the grater. I took a handful of basil and oregano and absolutely nothing came out of the grater.

Like others have said, the leaves get stuck in the blades and must be dug out. If you watch the video a reviewer posted, you'll notice that only a couple little pieces drop out after about 15 cranks. The rest is all stuck in the blades, a wet mashed up mess. Sorry. But that's the reality of this mill. If you had dried leaves, it work work better. But then, you can just crush dried herbs in a mortice for small bits or in your hands for larger bits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do I still own this?","review":"I've had this herb mill for 10 years after receiving it off my wedding registry, and frankly I'm surprised they are still selling it. I thought it would make the tedious task of chopping fresh herbs much easier. Well, it doesn't. Basically, anything even remotely leafy gets macerated and caught on the tines and doesn't come loose. Then, you have to disassemble it to try to scrape off the crushed little bits, which stick together & to your fingers and are hard to distribute into whatever you are cooking. I end up getting out scissors and just using those instead. Don't bother with this...at least for fresh herbs. I guess it might work to chop dry herbs into smaller bits, but I can usually do that with my hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Item Sucks","review":"Herbs are not chopped as advertized.

I bought it expecting some new insight and/or advice, but mostly it's a \\"beginner's primer\\" that defines betrayal, looks at childhood and how this figures in, etc. Very elementary, very basic. If you're just starting down the road to recovery after betrayal, and have not spent years talking to a therapist and reading books about it, as I have, then this particular book is probably a good place to start.

Although this book did not provide me with the reason \\"why\\", it helped me understand what type of individual I was dealing with and why someone would behave this way.

It did not involve marital infidelity, but was equally crushing. One of the great problems in a situation like this is trying to find language to express the existential pain that one feels. The wrenching emotions are there, but in order to deal with them, they must first be identified, articulated and defined . This is much harder than it seems. I found the best part of this book to be the way it helped me to get my arms around the feelings, and thus help come to terms with it. The book helped clear a path to understanding, dispelling an undefinable pain, and resolving it into something rationally comprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ladies Watches","review":"This watch box is not big enough for mens watches.

Extremely amateurish in layout and design, it has nothing to offer the art lover. The choices in artwork are not the classic images one would hope for, and have nothing to do with the most important developments in the medium. I would not have bought this book if not for the rave reviews here, and now I regret it. Bad on all accounts, I will porobably never open the book again.

Bad choices for pictures, cos there not the best ones from the comic books, just ones that you idn't see before. The way they lay them over each other and put fake shadow under the top one makes it look bad, like you eye cant tell whats going on. They should re-do this one or take it back and have somebody else do it good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly done mish-mash","review":"This book is visually confusing, because they don't print the artwork the way it was in the comic book, they make a montage of a bunch of different panels with photshop, so there's always parts of pictures laying over other pictures, and they don't relate. They do the same thing with the writing, so you can't follow what they're saying, like a cut-and -paste job. Real ugly graphics. I used to love comics in the '60s and '70s, but they hacked them up and tried to make them look like modern comics where your eye can't tell where you're supposed to look. Just a hatchet job by somebody who went crazy with photoshop. And no good history of the comics or creators, either, just tiny short blurbs, which seem more like one-liners. Very disappointing. I'd rather read re-prints of the comics themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop looking at the cheaper models!!","review":"Reason: I needed it to press the water out of my shredded potatoes for great hash browns.Short review: Heavy gauge steel.

I prefer using this rather than a hand masher. I purchased specifically for only making mash potatoes;the results are always light, fluffy, airy + delicious mashed potatoes. Sure, some \\"work\\" is involved(only allows for 1 or 2 potatoes at a time) but it's certainly not back breaking, in my opinion. Seems pretty solid, much better than the cheaper and flimsier versions.

I notified Amazon customer service that they may have a bad inventory of ricers but they responded that I should contact the manufactuer....I returned it and I guess I'll buy it somewhere else. Cuisipro is a very good manufacturer and I'm sure Amazon just got a bad shipment of ricers. Amazons return process is pretty painless so give it a shot but I wish they where alittle more receptive to my warning.Updated 11/5/05: I re-ordered the ricer awhile ago and it works great.

Boil the potatoes in their skins, cut them in half, and put them through the ricer. The skins stay in the bowl or on the plunger of the ricer for easy disposal.

That product has not cured my eczema by any means, but it has stabilized it. It does maintain it's moisturizing effects for a few hours after application. Best of all, it reduces the itchiness to a great degree so I don't have to apply steroid creamanywhere near as much as before.

My blood was checked out OK for coagulants and other things that may have impacted severe nose bleeds.A co-worker told me about Ponaris-nasal-emollient that her fellow SCUBA divers used to help with dryness/nosebleeds. My ENT doctor confirmed this is a good product and well known to help some nose bleed sufferers. I started using the product and haven't had a nosebleed since. I use a Q-tip dipped into the bottle (instead of the dropper) after my morning shower and before I go to bed, sometimes mid-day if my nose feels dry.

Members in my support group have mentioned this emollient, Ponaris, as being very helpful. After ordering, I tried using it several times, but not according to directions. Putting drops in nasal passages can lead to something called lipid pneumonia, so I just used a Q-tip and gently coated the area just inside my nasal passages. I found it not to be as effective as I was hoping, although I do like the fragrance. I would caution anyone who uses this to speak with your doctor first, as it could be very dangerous if not used correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved continual Dry Nasal Passage","review":"This product was recommended by my ENT doctor to resolve a constant build-up of 'crust' in my nose.

Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-Hype Emeril","review":"A nice little book that brought back fond memories of the region. Look elsewhere for authentic recipes. This book is enjoyable for what it appears to offer: a brief glimpse into a unique culture and special cuisine. The current hype of Emeril doesn't mar this book. Maybe some people take the kid from Fall Rivers, MA seriously! He's entertainment, nothing more, nothing less.Don't buy this book until you've purchased real books on the cuisine; any or all of Prudhommes will give one's library a good foundation of the creole/cajun art of cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Someone Help","review":"This book is a good find but some of the recipes call for exotic foods.

It is a no hype, no fluff, no nonsense book, that lives up to it's title. It features down-home recipes, and provides an interesting, and concise, cultural background for the recipes. Recipes such as his simple Jambalayas, are the perfect vehicle for improvisation with local ingredients. His Skillet Corn Bread recipe has more corn content than typical northern corbread. His Creole Onion Soup recipe features a broth that is enriched with cheeses. I look forward to trying these, and many other,recipes in this book.

It is well known throughout the cooking world that he couldn't boil water to save his life. The recipes in this book are borderline insults to real Louisiana cooking. For someone who keeps repeating that cooking 'aint rocket science', his recipes are anything but easy. Is it possible for him to cook just one dish without using a ridiculous list of ingredients and acting like a moron? Doubtful. I've even been to one of his tapings. What a rip-off! The audience is reminded over and over when to cheer for something he has done. It is also told how to react when given little tidbits of some amazing dish he threw together. Most of it was absolute crap. What it looks like and what it tastes like are two different things. The man has an over-sized ego and very little talent. If you want real Louisiana cooking, look for a book from Paul Prudhomme or John Folse. Either of those could cook circles around this clown.

This book should be discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pork fat does NOT rule!","review":"As a Jew and a vegetarian, I find it completely unconscionable that Emeril would use his fame to profit from a book that pushes the virtues of pork fat. Doesn't he realize that there is a small minority of us out there that doesn't subscribe to his over-the-top method of cooking everything with pork fat, as well as other animal by-products? I've watched his show a few times, and got this book from a friend a few months ago. While the man has some talent, I find it really distasteful that he profits from his fame and over-hyped ego. I looked in vain throughout the book for a recipe that would be culturally and morally sensitive, but came up empty handed.

Soon, it becomes clear that Mitsu is instead attempting to accept himself. As you read these marvellously creafted pages, the story will creep under your skin. Oe's extraordinary feat is that, as the strory builds into its climax, you become so involved in the events that this becomes YOUR story. Your inadequacies, your hidden talents and, specially, your difficulty to accept yourself. At the end of this book, you have read your biography and maybe, just maybe, you'll be able to live with yourself... at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"This novel is indeed a masterpiece. Oe shows why he's a revered writer. The book, which is told through the eyes of Mitsu, who seems to be searching not only for peace of mind but also closure to several tragic but unresolved happenings in his life. Oe continues to pull us in with the introduction of several very interesting characters and events including a riot among the village peasants. It builds almost invisibly to a crescendo and a remarkable end. This book is a masterpiece"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Oe novel.","review":"I've only read three other Oe novels and this one is my favorite. It's also one of my favorite books in general and I'm an avid reader. It's a very mature book so I DON'T recommend it for a younger audience. As the other reviews say, it's dark and can even be painful to read at times. It's quixotic, brooding, bleak, and to borrow from another reviewer it does leave you unsettled and unnerved. However, it's also beautiful in an odd way... so if you're looking for something different this could be it. To summarize it, it's about two brothers who visit the village they were raised in.

Too often, Nanes seems to delight in the intentially ill-turned phrase. Why? Is it to deliberately engender audience dissatisfaction? These two symphonies are all too reminiscent of his other music: that is to say, alternatively boring and unpleasant, and ultimately wholly forgettable. The overblown title references (e.g., \\"The Holocaust Symphony\\") designed to attract attention and interest, don't fool us for long.

I was thinking it would be more of a biographical sketch of the person regarding his background, etc., with some factual information (I realize it's historical fiction.) It's actually the story of his life, each chapter told by a different person with whom had had one sort of relationship or another. For example, it begins with narratives from neighbors when he was a boy, progressing as he ages with stories from cow-hands that he rode with, family members, etc., and culminating with stories from a judge who sentenced him and the newspaperman who wrote about his death. At first I didn't think I'd get into it, but eventually I did. It's an interesting way to tell the story, albeit I was wishing there was a bit more factual information added.

I would recommend it to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN INTERESTING TALE","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and got caught up in the plot of a life of tragedy and disruption. Certainly, this is not a \\"feel good\\" novel as the times were harsh, sad, and unforgiving. The main part of the book created a window into a bygone time that was worth the read. A few details diminished what otherwise would have been a five-star rating. First, the modern-day introduction was trite and unnecessary. There could have been better ways to introduce this fictional biography. Also, while the main character, Molly, was said to be precocious, it was hard to believe that a thirteen year old would have written in the style introduced in the first part of the book. In addition to a commentary of the times, the book also addressed the plight of an orphan of the era, living among ghosts, lacking security, withdrawing into reverie, being threatened by any change (good or bad), and having difficulty trusting and forming relationships. I would recommend this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and the only reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is that the premise is far from original. The life story of a smart and spunky girl of humble beginnings who manages to make the best of it all has been done. It is reminiscent of Fair and Tender Ladies, a book I also loved. Anyway, the characters are memorable and the story details captivating. For me, it was hard to put down. Lee Smith rarely disappoints me."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We had just returned from a trip to Charleston and the South and someone suggested this book to me. Well, it was not to be. For one thing, I tire of this 'oh I found this diary, let me share it with you'. The college girl in this case was an unnecessary character, and the girl in the diary, well, she just would not have written the diary in this way. Her voice was false and way to old for a teenager. As other reviewers noted, there was much too much of the day to day doings in the plantation to really interest me. I skimmed much of the last section, got the basic gist, and decided that there probably are better books about Charleston in that time period than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow beginnings","review":"I always enjoy Lee Smith's Southern novels and this one was no exception. I did find the beginning a little slow as the reader has to piece the family situation together bit by bit. I enjoyed the book so much more once the main character was a teen and then an adult. Ms. Smith's characters are never flat and I found the adage \\"Home is the place that, when you go there, they have to take you in\\" going through my mind as the novel wound to a close."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"This book had such great reviews, and the description looked so interesting that I had to read it. Wow. Maybe I am just missing something, but I didn't get it at all. The whole books seemed fragmented and bizzare. The main character never resonated with me, and frankly, the jumps in her life and personality didn't even make much sense to me. This will certainly be one for my \\"sell it as a used copy and hope to cut your losses\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"historical novel with memorable female character","review":"Like most of Lee Smith's novels, this is excellent. It reminded me of \\"Jane Eyre\\", the classic British novel about an orphan girl who faces tremendous challenges in her life. It may also remind you of \\"Gone with the Wind\\", with the post-Civil War setting (except that the Ku Klux Klan in this story have no redeeming qualities at all- which is more accurate), and the amount of suffering experienced by the heroine. The first part of the story, Molly Petree's childhood, is really the best- it is haunting. The rest of it is nearly as good. At one point Molly writes \\"I gave it my whole heart. I would do it again.\\" That also describes how I feel about this book.

To be honest, I had such a hard time getting into this book, that if I hadn't been trapped on an air plane, I would have put it down and never picked it up again.

Huh.Just for comparison, I decided to look closer at the \\"Cuisipro 7 inch cone strainer\\".

I've heard all the advice in it a million times before - there's nothing here that you can't think of yourself. Figure out when you like writing. Do mechanical stuff at times you're not as alert, and real writing when you're raring to go. Make an outline, divide it all into manageable chunks. Stick to it, pace yourself, be a tortoise not a hare. Make a schedule and keep it!There's not really much of the muse in there at all, is there?

There is nothing funny about playing a practical joke on someone so credulous that he never suspects he's being put on, even when there are obvious clues (the casting director is named \\"Roman Polanski\\").

The metal grommets did end up bending and nearly ripping out of the tarp due to lots of wind force focused on those points. You need to make sure to really use the corners for most of the pressure when tying this tarp down otherwise the other grommits not on the corners will rip out of the tarp.

After another week we were able to reinstall the program but I had to start from scratch -- lost all the data... but now the program won't \\"restart\\" the way it did when it began. It won't even let me choose the \\"type\\" of company we own so that it will pregenerate the deductions we need to use... like: gas.

Well, he obviously is not a composer since what he put together here is no good music. It is just notes meandering aimlessly around for almost 2 hours. The Budapest String Quartet (not the one you know but a more recent hungarian troop) must have needed money desperately to sit through these recording sessions paid by a wealthy dilettante. Mr Nanes would have done music a greater service if he had supported some promising young composers or performers.

For the price, I would have expected better quality control and simpler operation. Also, from the picture you cannot tell that the filter door opens to the wall behind the Capresso, meaning that you have to reach around the side of the door to load the filter. A coffee maker should be simply designed and easy to operate, and in my view the Capresso has too many moving parts to ensure reliable operation over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic parts","review":"I had the same problems that some of the other reviewers had, cheap plastic parts that broke and render the coffe maker unuseable, and that darn drippy carafe that made us have to locate a towel close by to constantly wipe up afterwards.

Yes, you have to pay attention until you've got the hang of it, but this model is just fine and brews a great cup of coffee quickly. The \\"pour\\" is nice and full with no spills whatsoever. The removable water basket with water filter a very nice feature. Once you learn to (1) securely snap the coffee filter holder into place by making sure either that you've folded down the edges of the paper filter (as required on most coffee makers), or making sure that you've fully positioned the gold mesh filter, and (2) properly screw and unscrew the coffee pot cap, it's a synch to use. ALSO, comes with a gold mesh filter, so don't order one separately as I did. Pre-heating the pot, as w/ most thermals, a good idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was a total waste of money","review":"Just like the other people's experience, the clock timer of my coffee maker broke after a couple of months.

Since I didn't use the programmable feature so often, I thought I could put up with it, so I contined using it.But right after the warranty expired (1 year from purchase), it started to leak from the bottom, spilling about 1/3 of the water I poured in the reservoir all over the counter.I phoned Capresso for service, and they told me to pack it securely and have it picked up by UPS to return it to them at our expense, then they'd repair it at our expense (again). At that time we were living in Hawaii, so consindering the UPS rate and repair cost, we could have easily bought a brand new coffee maker.There was no dealership that could repair it locally in Hawaii, so I had to throw away this machine after all. I'll never buy from them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Value","review":"OK, so I'm a piker but this is the most I've ever paid for a coffee maker. It is no better than my previous $69 Krups. and it makes only 8 cups. This was my first purchase of a thermal coffeemaker and I guess I expected miracles but the carafe doesn't keep the coffee any warmer than my previous 15 year old carafe. The main problem is trying to get the carafe lid on; it takes at least 2-3 tries which is not the most pleasent thing to deal with in the morning.I should have tried Consumer Report's best buy for a thermal coffeemaker--the $49 Mr. coffee and let Capresso perfect their product before buying one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 3 Months","review":"For many years I used a Capresso thermal coffeemaker with great results, until the heating element gave out. Three months ago I purchased the Capresso Elegance. It doesn't heat the water beyond tepid, and today a plastic part broke off the bottom of the filter basket. The coffeemaker is now inoperable, unless you insert something like a knife to line up the basket with the drip mechanism, and then carefully withdraw the knife and try to close the basket door. I'll be contacting Capresso to discover whether they might be able to forward a new basket to me, but this Capresso product no longer rates high on my list!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, Cheaply Made","review":"I purchased the coffee maker because I hate the taste of coffee after it has been on the burner for too long.

While his book does have some interesting ideas, he fails to support them. The evidence that he supplies is shaky at best. He also makes some very blatantly racist and sexist remarks (not quite as clear in the book itself, but definetly come out when he's speaking). A major problem in the book is that he really fails to come to any sort of conclusion.

If you are even somewhat critical of America, you are anti-American.So, while people like Flynn talk about how the \\"Left\\" is Anti-American, they want to limit your right to use rights that made America great to begin with.

Suppertime conversation must be something to behold. There's nothing like ignorance by the right to make me proud to understand that this country is made up of people with varying opinions.

Americans are a diverse group of people and you don't learn to \\"LOVE\\" anything by division. It's through common ground that we focus on what it great about this country. This is the same humorless rhetoric we've heard since cavemen scratched their balls. Daniel Flynn's explanation: They do it because they can and people who don't, well they must not have balls to scratch.

Did not think I would like the vortex cleaner though, but now Im hooked. Just rinse off your shaver heads and pop it in and in cleans and lubricates it for three hours. Before this I was Mach 3 only.

I bought the untra cheap model with the yellow trim but it felt like a toy and worse, shaved like one.But this model cuts like a dream. I dry shave my leathery old face and it works a treat. I even use it to keep my shaved head slick, which allows hte current summer heat to disspate just a bit better. I highly recommend this shaver.

Not worth it in my opinion for the price you pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean shave","review":"I replaced a Braun shaver with this Panasonic based on a recomendation. This shaver is much better and gives me a much closer shave. It holds a charge about ten days for me and is quieter than my previous shaver.

This Panasonic shaver is a great unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Panasonic Vortex Shaver","review":"Very pleased with this shaver. The shave is close and smooth, and it is very easy to keep clean. You don't need the hydraclean system to to keep it clean on a daily basis. I prefer to follow the quick clean tips that come with the shaver and use the hydraclean every 60 days.

I would hope it's closer since my old one had been used for years and should have been duller.It feels good in my hand...not too big or small.The noise is no different than my old shaver, just the usual buzzing. No problem.The cleaning system is pretty slick. After I shave I plug it in when I go to work and when I get home it looks great.

Razor burn, cuts, and all that. I wanted a simple easy shave in the morning. The reviews looked good so I gave it a shot for a couple weeks.The razor itself did a decent job on the cheeks. As far as the neck when, a blind barber could do a better shave. It either gave me unbelievable razor burn or completely missed huge patches of untouched hair. For whatever reason if you had a stray hair left on the neck it couldn't seem to get it no matter how many passes I'd try. Any blade system from disposable to mach whatever is superior.

I've seen no improvement in those three weeks, and even though you're supposed to use it for a month to see results, Amazon's return policy leaves me no choice but to guess that another week won't help that much.I have a very course beard, and at first this razor did a great job on my cheeks, it barely touches my chin, and does virtually nothing on my neck except cut me. With my Mach 3, I soak my beard in hot water for at least five minutes before shaving, and I did no different with this Panasonic. I'm not interested in shaving with this razor then going back over my whole face with an expensive Mach 3.Take this with a grain of salt if your beard isn't this thick (I have a permanent five o'clock shadow like Homer Simpson unfortunately), but keep my experience in mind if you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as advertised","review":"This shaver looked like a good one but it does not shave close enough.Every time I shave I have to shave with the trimmer to get a closer shave because the shaver does not shave longer hair.I was very disappointed with this product and I am in search of a better replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"After using a Norelco rotary razor for years, I decided to give this style of razor a try. It works just fine. Not as close as a blade but plenty close. This type of foil razor takes some adjustment as it is easy to burn your skin when you are first adjusting to it. Takes several weeks to adjust to it. It take longer to shave with the back and forth motions and the need to change directions on your face to get a close shave. The circular motions you use with a rotary razor seem to be more efficient. The cleaning system works very well but is somewhat loud and takes several hours to clean and dry. Not really a problem for me as I am not around while the razor is going through the cleaning cycle.

I generally shave with a razor in the shower, but there are plenty of days where I don't shower until later in the day. On these mornings, I hit the beard with the ES8077s to keep from looking too scruffy.I also use it before going out at night if I have a bit of a shadow, and it works great for that too. I tried it wet in the shower as a replacement for my trusty razor and didn't like the results at all, so I now use both..and am happy.No matter what anyone tells you, the electric doesn't get as close as a blade, but the convienence factor outweighs that in the right situations. I use the Panasonic about 50% of the time, the razor the rest. Could I replace the razor? Sure, but why? I like using both."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied with Shaver","review":"Switched over from a Braun shaver. This shaver, in terms of actually shaving, probably give me a closer shave than the Braun (but it could be because it is brand new). Battery charges lasts over a week, so it can easily be taken out of town without the charger. The real beauty in this machine is the cleaning mechanism. You can use the Vortex Hydraclean system, which does a great job of cleaning out the shaver. All the little hair particles are gone, and the blades actually shine like new. The best part is you dont even need to use the Vortex system, because the cleaning cartridges can get expensive. You can use just regular soap and water. I use hand soap, pump once into the blades, Turn on the shaver, and the soap starts to lather. Then while the shaver is still on, run water over it. And this works just as good, and there are instructions how to do this, in the box. All in all a excellent shaver. Also comes with carrying pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE CLEANING SYSTEM IS OVERKILL","review":"The razor is a beaut, smooth and close shave everytime.

Because I was disinterested in having a big black box sitting on the sink all the time (the fancy cleaning system), I bought a Braun shaver. What a mistake! It runs so slowly that shaving took twice as long, and its screen irritated my face. I finally bought this Panasonic and when I opened the package I discovered I could just skip using the cleaner and charge it by simply plugging it into the transformer. The shaver is great, running at a high speed (they say 13,000 reciprocations per second) so that every stroke actually cuts beard. To clean it, I simply open the head and rinse with water and occasionally run it briefly with liquid hand soap rubbed on the screen and the head stays clean and fresh. I highly recommend this shaver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissappointed - asked for a refund","review":"Hunh ... lot's of positive reviews, but I don't get it.

It cuts right thru the stiff (I say stiff, should say stiffer, my beard is really not that tough) hairs under my lip. The Panasonic \\"Daisy\\" shaver just sits there and cries. No joke.Honestly guys, this thing is really pretty bad. Think twice before you spend your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Shower Shaving","review":"I shave my beard and head in the shower. This is much easier than shaving with a razor. The charge lasts a LONG time. Took my skin about two weeks to get used to it (you have to give it some time).

Excellent product so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great shaver, don't need cleaning unit","review":"The shaver is fantastic, like all the top Panasonic shavers. It cuts close,doesn't irritate the skin, and holds a charge for a couple of week's worthof shaves. The trimmer is small, but I don't need a powerful trimmer.It feels good in my hand, and is easy to shave with.Cleaning the shaver is easy without the cleaning unit base. Just put afew dabs of hand soap on the head, spread it around, and turn it on.Then rinse everything off, and it's in great shape.My only complaint is that the cleaning base is not really necessary.Unless one has trouble with the simple cleaning procedures, the baseis a waste of money. Save $20 and get the ES8043SC, looks like thesame shaver without the other base.

When used with KISS MY FACE MOISTURING SHAVE, an incredibly lubricating shaving lotion, it also works great for personal areas. It is remarkably easy to clean even though it comes with it's own cleaning station, which I've used sparingly, as it's so easy to clean manually.

Well it didn't get any better and now it's too late to return it. Specifically, it takes twice as long to shave with the 8077 as it did with my last shaver (a remington) and often times no matter how hard or soft I press the razor leaves some hairs behind that I end up having to pull anyway.

And, if you don't want to travel with that apparatus, you can use liquid hand soap to clean up and air dry it.

Long story short, it doesn't cut neck hairs very well at all. It doesn't matter if you try the wet or dry method.It left my face and neck broken out in small red bumps that itched terribly. I thought it would just take time to break in the razor, but the \\"rash\\" never went away. It finally got so bad that I couldn't even sleep at night because it was so irritated.On the plus side, it is a very quiet cleaner it barely made any noise.I definately would not recommend this if you have a normal 5 o clock shadow.

Now the second unit's cleaning system has quit working. The shaver still works fine and the charger works, the cleaning system just won't turn on. (This happened just after I bought 3 more expensive cleaning filters). I have changed filters regularly and kept the unit clean; the cleaning system just doesn't hold up well.In summary, the unit gives a decent close shave, but the cleaning system is junk!

It would turn itself on and wouldn't turn off by using the on/off button. At the same the shaver alternated between normal and high speed vibration which made impossible to use.As the unit was out of warranty I decided to find out what the problem was, so I disassemble it and found water inside.

One possible flaw is that I'd probably prefer for it to have a bit more theory and a bit less practical examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"I had been using cheap tarps that I bought at Wal-Mart which did not last very long.

The author focused almost exclusively on the basic movies (fists & kicks, plus a few throws), the various stances and counters inherent to his style, and discussion about weight training, katas and kumite ... but he neglected to focus to any meaningful degree on the mental and philosophical aspects of his art. Sadly, a lot of people take relatively little interest in such things, but they meant (and still mean) a lot to me, and unfortunately the author glosses over such things.There are plenty of other books out there that take a much more ambitious approach, with the material, and as a result are much more satisfying to read and ponder.

As much as we try, the theory of the \\"purple suit\\" military and interoperability, i.e., all services working together, has not been achieved. The saving grace of this unfortunate situation is that our military forces usually demonstrate the flexibility to overcome these shortfalls and prevail. I commanded a rescue squadron which was tasked in an important support role for several of the operations thatColonel Carney wrote of in this book and several that were not included. The Grenada mission was not the only one where we were unsure as to which command was really in charge.

Numerous studies -- as well as common sense -- show that alcoholics/addicts are a diverse group, and that many people benefit from approaches OTHER than those that are based on the 12 steps. AA is fine for people who have a religious or spiritual bent, but other groups (like Secular Organizations for Sobriety and SMART Recovery) are appropriate for alcoholics who want to become sober without relying on a Higher Power.This book would have been much better if it had been written from a more open-minded perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"modern-day stereo mediocrity","review":"Sound quality okay; generally clean good for background music and ambient audio when hooked up to video system.

It has scholarly evidence in detail, but also fleshed-out conclusions, and unflinchingly looks even at evidence that doesn't \\"fit\\" our modern image of ancient peoples we want to like, in its quest to bring us a living, breathing image of the Minoans. (It also has illustrations in plenty; I feel a bit juvenile to admit this, but I very much appreciate illustrations, as no verbal description can quite convey the brushstrokes, the maze-like floor plans, the quality of line.)It's not a perfect book---I agree with another reviewer who complained that people probably had more houses and fewer temples than Mr. Castleden concludes ---but it is an excellent one, especially for an \\"armchair archaeologist\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading & poor","review":"I expected an accurate review of Minoan civilization but instead found an odd seemingly out-of-touch and misleading review. I have no gripe with the author wishing to emphasize the religious aspect of Minoan civilization but he actually conflates Minoan and Mycenaean things in a most misleading way. These two peoples were quite distinct and to use late Linear B texts as explanations of early Minoan culture is quite misleading - he even quotes such texts from Pylos as allegedly shedding light on Minoan ways. In one place he even states that the wars between city-states in Crete in Roman times shed ligth on their alleged interactions 1000 years earlier! Not only does this book contribute nothing new to our knowledge of Minoan civilization it is actually a negative contribution regarding understanding by the interested layman.

The main characters are unconvincing and badly developed. They tend to be stereotypes (i.e. noble Roman soldier representing ancient values, depraved aristocrat representing the new) rather than convincing formed personalities .The 5th century with its background of collapse of civilisation is a fascinating period which has been well covered before.

As a history buff, I am always looking for good writers in this vein. I have to say that I was disappointed by the writing style and the sledge hammer subtle plot development. The important points were emphasized and repeated ad nauseum to the point of distracting from the flow of the narrative. The romantic relationship with the principle woman was not very convincing or moving and I found myself skimming those passages rather than being moved by them. The characters seem somewhat 2 dimensional as well. Mr. Whyte has written many books on interesting subjects and time periods, but I doubt I will try any others since I was so bored with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disapointment","review":"I picked this up looking for a good summer read, and hoping to catch on to a new series. The premise looked promising,as well, and I will read anything with Romans in it.Well, while the premise is great, I felt I was reading 500 pages of story setup, with characters who sounded more like 20th century intellectuals than the people of the place and times.Story segments that could have been suspenseful where revealed over way to many Dinner conversations. My Dinner with Britanicus in Londinium would have been a better title.Still, the setup is fascinating enough that I will give the series another chance and get the sequel. Maybe the setup will be worth it. For now, I am just happy I borrowed this one, rather than bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another cracking good tale!","review":"My prior review was a bit in error... I got the titles reversed. This is in fact the first book in the series. Jack Whyte does a superb job in this continuation of his version of the Arthur legend. This is the way Arthur really could have come to power. I've read this series (9 books in all) at least 5 times front to back and plan to read them again often at least once per year probably. I can't say enough good things about this author and this series!This book explains the making of Excallibur and sets the foundation for the rest of the series. This is truly and outstanding epic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Riviting and Absorbing Reading","review":"I have the pleasure of having all four books in this series. I have read the first \\"SkyStone\\" and the second, \\"Singing Sword.\\" I was impressed with the first and awed at the second. Mr. Whyte has taken fact and mingled it with fiction to make a more than plauseable series of events leading to the Arthurian period and legend. If you are a Roman History Buff or an Arthurian junkie you need to emerse yourself in these books. My only worry is that Mr. Whyte will stop at the four, when I think he should continue on through Arthur's reign and death. The characters are real. Villian's are villianous, calculating, a ruthless. Heros have problems but are as calculating and ruthless when required. Mr. Whyte also addresses issues that are paramount in out society today, such as domestic violence. The SkyStone is a must read with three more to follow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent portrayal","review":"I thought that The Skystone was an excellent book that portrayed the leaving of the Roman legions very well. It seems quite possible that the Arthurian legend could be a \\"leftover\\" from the old days of Roman occupation of Great Britian. I love the way Jack Whyte puts some fact into fatansy and gives believable explanations for formerly unbelievable events such as Excalibur. I also like the way, unlike most books set in this time period, the main character is not completely flawless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I chose this book because it was outside my comfort zone of what I usually read and it didn't work out too well. There was too much fighting, battling and military strategy in it for me - most of it went over my head. I think that someone who likes that sort of thing would probably like this book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whyte has himself the beginning of a series...","review":"...just like Children of the Lion. The main player comes off a little 'know it all' at times. This could put some readers off their feed. Whyte's research is right on the money. Is Whyte a Brit ? I'll have to ask Amazon what else he has written. Out of the blue, his work is now right next to the Cornwell and Frazer in my library. The story is about Excalibur and Arthur, but, wow, what a different view point. It never came to my mind, where did it come from, or who made it. Until recently everyone thought Arthur was related to Santa, and Excalibur as real as Batman's Belt. Thanks to Whyte and other fine authors, we are now much better informed. If you want to get a real buzz on, try reading Jack Whyte's book at the same time as you read Bernard Cornwell and Stephen Lawhead, also on the same subject. If I'm not carefull, I'll end up a Turtledove... That a 30."},{"rating":"2","title":"A seat at the round table, a tour of Camelot!","review":"Knowing the man behind the book, Jack Whyte is charming and intelligent in his quest to unite history and heroism.

A must read for history buffs, and those who love Camelot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And now for a something not borrowed.","review":"\\"And then Merlin zaps the pour scwab into submission....\\"Well, This is not an excerpt thank goodness. Instead of guitar playing magic talisman evoking mystical spells to shed blinding light unto the hapless minions of darkness, one gets a heavy dose of third century reality. It's nice to learn as you read. After I read this book. not only did I know more about 3rd century Brits, I found it to be one of the more well thought out stories in the fantasy genre. (The book realy should be classified as historical fiction) The historical realism along with the realism of the characters set's this one apart from the typical Authurian fare. I throughly enjoyed the perspective of the narrative. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent view of military life in Roman Britain.","review":"Mr Whyte excels in relating the every-day details of military life in Roman Britain. The main characters quickly become very engrossing, and the villains are always up to the unexpected."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best versions of the Arthur legend I've ever read","review":"Of course, this is only the first book of the series, but in terms of literary content, style, etc., I would definitely put this series on a par with Mary Stewart's Merlin Chronicles. Of course, Whyte's books seem a bit more down-to-earth, with little (if any) magic involved - the comparison is invited because, as in Stewart's books, the characters seem so real, so fleshed-out, that you can easily believe that they were and are real people. I can't remember a single character that I didn't believe in - even the most pompous of the lot, Quintius Varo (Britannicus' brother-in-law).One final point - if you buy the paperback of this book, and you find it has a \\"preview\\" of the next book in the series, READ THAT PREVIEW. Talk about a cliffhanger - this is the best hook for buying the next book in a series I've ever seen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TMI (to much information)","review":"When I pick a book, I usually find it by walking amlessly around a book store or library. This book was no exception. I read a viriety of different books, and I must say this was one of the better books that I've read.Skystone is a good read, all-in-all. There are about 200 pages of usless descriptions as far as I'm concerned, but for the most part this is a really interesting read.This book also has great action. There are quite a few bloody and gory chapters (and even more sexually-explicit ones), and I think just about anyone with some time on their hands (and who doesn't mind a bit of a long read) would like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The man knows naught.","review":"I love history. I love the Arthurian legends. I rarely love them together and this man is a reason why. He has little understanding of the legends, the era, the Saxons, the Romans, or even techniques of sword making, no matter how much he pretends. I find this sort of writing an embarrasment to historical fiction -- O'Brien can do excellently, Cornwell and Forester decently, and Whyte not at all. His characters moan for a Roman Republic over 400 years dead without the least understanding of its mechanics. In many ways this is merely a poorly written Libertarian fantasy, a pointless anti-government tract posing as historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"I was disappointed by the very thin character development for female characters, and by very pompous and unnatural dialogue.Definitely the male equivalent of romance fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and innovotive retelling of the classic Authuriana","review":"lays foundation for a great and innovotive retelling of the classic Authurian tales.

I not even halfway through and i can't wait to see what happens next! John, age 10"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Find","review":"Jack Whyte is an 'off the beaten path' author writing historical novels on 'off the beaten path' topics. In this case, Roman England. The book is fast paced and starts the Camulod Chronicles off very well. He clearly researched the history of the era and the tale is well told. Overall, the novel keeps you moving through and enticed me to read the following volumes. So far, none have disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Camulod Chronicles as a Series","review":"Jack Whyte's series, the Camulod Chronicles, starts out laying a strong foundation on which to build Arthurian legend. The problem is that he never constructs much of an Arthurian legend. He spends about 6-7 of the 9 books building up to Arthur, and then when Arthur becomes a man he is but a secondary character who is not very involved in the books. I was extremely disappointed by this series and would recommend readers not to pick it up. If you are looking for a good Arthurian tale, look no further than Bernard Cornwell's 'Winter King' series. It is spectacular and I would read it 100 times before reading Jack Whyte's Camulod Chronicles again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I saw this book on the book shelf and picked it up, thinking \\"Hey, I love historical fiction. I wonder what the author can do with Arthurian Historical Fiction! \\" However, I was unable to get past the first 100 pages, for several reasons. First of all, I found the character developement rather weak, the sex and language rather overused, and a weak grip of historical accuracy haunted this book. Don't get me wrong, I have no problem with sex or violence in a book, but in this peice I found that the swearing gave the book a clogged-up character and was rather distracting. It didn't seem natural, it didn't flow. If you want to read some good historical fiction, read \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Steven Pressfeild. Although it's not about Arthur, it has violence, sex and profanity well interlaced with historical accuracy and sympathetic characters which creats a much more solid book than this peice. All in all, I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skystone Disappointing","review":"I am a long-time fan of fiction relating to King Arthur. However, I was very disappointed with Whyte's work. The sexual content is gratuitous; it did not relate to the plot in any way. The explicit descriptions of Varrus' frequent sexual encounters read like a male smut novel, Whyte's own fantasies. The female characters were flat. Luceiia did not live up to the foreshadowing of a strong, independent woman. As soon as Varrus saw her, the descriptions consisted of his lust for her physical beauty, and after the two slept together, Luceiia quickly faded into the background."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Disappointment","review":"This was one of the most difficult books I have ever tried toread and one of the most disappointing. The story line has promise,but Whyte ruins it by gratitous and overly explicit sex scenes and byusing modern military language to talk about the Roman legions that isentirely inappropriate. He needed to read some books about how thelegions were organized and led instead of assuming that there wereparallels with the modern military. If I had wanted to read explicitdescriptions of intercourse, I would have picked up a HarlequinRomance. I'm no prude, but the book didn't need any of the scenesWhyte included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad writing, polemical","review":"What a disappointment! I requested this book for Christmas, but after about 125 pages I pitched it. In addition to bad writing, it became clear the author had a political agenda in writing it. Not that injecting personal points of view is inappropriate; T.H. White does it brilliantly in his Once and Future King and Book of Merlin. It's just that the worldview Jack Whyte advocates is adolescent, ignorant and simplistic. I won't know how Whyte will treat the complex mythopoeic stories of Merlin and Arthur; I hope with a lot more depth and nuance than he began his series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blend Between History and Fiction","review":"Simply put: Historically accurate in the big picture. Consistent and well defined characters. Well paced between detail and action. Brought Roman rule in Britain to life (having spent time in England at various Roman sites, this book provided a new level of understanding for me to those ancient days). If you love history and a good tale... this is the book and series for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing New Take on a Classic","review":"As a lifelong fan of fantasy novels and the stories of King Arthur, I approached this series with some trepidation - not wanted another tired recap of the same old story. What I found was one of the most well-crafted and intelligent series of books I have ever read. Starting generations before Arthur is even born, the Chronicles weave a complex plot of love, adventure and loyalty that help to shape a nation. Beginning with a very intruiging premise - the generations before Arthur - Whyte does not dissapoint one bit. The most amazing thing is how Whyte tells the story without the use of magic - instead comes up with provocative ways to make the story completely realistic. This is a series that I would highly recommend to anyone interested in fantasy or history and is well worth your time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Premise, Lackluster Execution","review":"I was intrigued by the concept of a historically-based retelling of the Arthur legend, but found this book disappointing. The beginning is promising enough, with a terrific action sequence, but the rest of the book is hampered by stilted dialogue and explicit but stilted sex scenes. Also, the narrator, Varrus, is an expert soldier in the Roman military, but his Christian conscience fills him with guilt after killing. The result: He slaughters scores, then pukes his guts out in self-revulsion. Not the most subtle way to portray a conflicted character."},{"rating":"2","title":"grandaugther loved this dvd","review":"my grandaughter loved this dvd....the stories are so cute...especially samari pie...she does the dance with the characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BackYardigans Are Fantastic!!!!","review":"I am totally in love with the backyardigans.

I had never heard of this artist and I know she will reach many people who love the Lord and reach people who don't yet know Him! I'm 30 and she really moved me! Her voice is truly a gift.Also I beleive that God is reaching out to secular artists also.

Eventhough you have to be careful in the application of the protectant by wiping off any excess from glass or paint work or go the extra step and cover the glass and paint work the benefits of RaggTopp protectant far exceed the time it takes to cover the exposed areas of the car. Previously I ordered RaggTopp from a well-known auto detailing site but I had a problem with the nozzle. The product \\"pooled\\" leaving dollops vs. an even spray pattern. I had spots on a black fabric top. I suspected a design flaw but I did not receive a response from the seller to my e-mail inquiring about the problem.

No cracking, discoloration etc. Great.So I thought to use the same brand on the grey fabric top of my new Boxster.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT. Although the water repelling feature is there, the grey is now a lot darker overall, and a different, lighter shade where the fabric is under higher tension (above the frame rails). It really did a \\"job\\" on the top. Looking closer, it appears that the solvents attack the vinyl layer underneath the fabric and some of it's dark color leaks along the fabric's fibers to the top.Do the product developers at Ragtopp know how much a new top for a Boxster costs ?!!?So, unless your top is really ragged and needs this for some other reason, stay away from it! I learnt it the hard way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!!","review":"Best fabric convertible top protector on the market. Recommended by all major auto convertible manufacturers. Use in garage if possible. Do not use outside on a windy day as you don't want overspray on paint or glass. If you do get spray on paint or glass, just wipe off with dry cloth.

First of all, I opened the box and found that the manufacturer had forgotten to include the power cables and USB cable as promised. Using my own compatible cables, I hooked up the drive, and then the pain began. The drive made my computer hang every time I put in a disc. An absolutely disastrous product. I have Windows XP as well, but I don't think that's the problem. The computer recognized the drive, but everything stopped once I put a disc in.

A wounderful family book!","review":"Ralph Moody's books are a national treasure demonstrating life at the end of an era while teaching timeless values in an enjoyable and appealing fashion. Almost all of Ralph Moody's books have that \\"read aloud\\" feel so rare in literature disigned for families. Told in the first person he tells his story simply with feeling and often some well placed humor.In this volume Ralph is drawn into the Cattle/livestock business and unwittingly forms a partnership that leaves him unbelievably in debt. Ever resourceful Ralph rebuilds a new business and works to overcome his turn of bad luck.This is a wounderful story whose enjoyment will be enhanced by reading the other books in the series first as this in the last book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am so glad we discovered these books!","review":"The characters and incidents in this book are so well portrayed by Ralph Moody. This is a compelling picture of life out west in the early twentieth century. The issues the characters face are much like those we deal with today. Moody's effortless portrayal of a strong work-ethic is accomplished so easily without \\"preaching\\" to the reader. His characters of varying personalities are enjoyable to get to know. There is the dependable experienced farmer, the irate sheepherder, the loyal small-town switchboard operator and the shady bankers just to name a few.My teenage boys love to read these books.

But you get what you pay for, and I won't be buying any more cheap chargers.My recommendation: spend $20 on a powered USB hub.

Following her advice and plans will make you more fit. I have lost several pounds and several inches by following her plan. I never feel hungry and I don't have cravings like I used to have, maybe because of the encouragement she peppers through everything she does. Many of the recipes were well received by my family so I don't need to make special meals to stay on her plan.

You'd be better off checking the Jakarta web sites for information and examples on the tools covered, and buying another book that actually covers XP.This book could have been great if it didn't try to be an XP book, covered the tools much more in-depth, and removed the clutter of the appendixes and repeated poor examples throughout. In addition, proper editing could really help remove the countless typos, grammatical errors, and punctuation mistakes.

This is not a book on extreme programming - if you purchase this book looking for insightful information on XP; you will be disapointed.This book is mainly about the open source development tools Ant, JUnit, and Cactus. The information provided is brief at best. It would have been better if the authors focused on fewer tools and gave more indepth materials.The book includes API descriptions for most of the tools discussed - this consumes about a third of the book. I am not the biggest fan of have API description in books, unless it is explicitly a reference book.In summary, if you are looking for further, quick overview, information on the OS development tools like ANT and JUnit; then this book is for you.If you are looking for meaningful information on extreme programming only; avoid this book like the plague, the information covered is cursory at best.It is a pity the title is misleading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is a great book.

The only reason I am doing it here is that I don't want people to make the same mistake I did with this book. I read the reviews here and bought the book.

Surfing all over web reading little bits of documentation and examples that exist for each tool.3. Trying to make sense of how they work together to streamlinethe process of rapidly designing, building, testing and deploying high quality scalable web applications and services.....

Murdoch's challenge is to find out who she is and who killed her.It was refreshing to read an historical mystery set in Canada. Ms. Jennings did an admirable job of creating a sense of time and place. Murdoch is an interesting character, particularly his relationship to his friends and dead fiancée.

Put your iBook to sleep.2. Plug iTV Link into your TV and your iBook3. Wake-up your iBook4.

I'm going to try another brand that has a contoured shape that would actually snap securely to the crotch of panties. There is so much room where they attach the whole thing could spin around.

The book has much to recommend it: thorough research, jargon-free prose, experts' opinions, survivors' stories, common-sense advice, humaneness and sensitivity, and (this came as a surprise) moments of true hilarity.

There is no suspense, no tension, no conflict between characters. Everything is laid out and explained for the reader. It's a real snooze! Add to it that the author tells us what a character's personality is like, but doesn't have the character act appropriately. Jack Langdon despises magic? Well, he sure doesn't act like it. Even the \\"attraction\\" between the main characters is deflated and uninspired. In fact, this entire book is deflated and uninspired. It starts out like the next installment of Harry Potter, by the way. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much magic","review":"The book is over run with magic.

She was horribly abusive in how she imprisoned her son - not to mention that she damn near succeded in her attempts to kill him. What she did to that little bird has haunted me for weeks - and not in the way great art does. Bacon leaves the question open: Did she brutally murder the bird because he took her son's affections away from her? Or, was it a mercy killing? Nice try. When you're flush with cash like she was, there are vets around to check broken-winged birds out. Even if you don't have a dime, there's the ASPCA. Her son honors her at the end, like she was some model maverick. If only someone had done her in - but slowly, like the tortures she'd inflicted on the defenseless - instead of her deciding on her own that her job was done here. I have a high threshold for pain and intensity in movies, but not when the filmmaker is asking us to revere the lowest scum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage Masquerading As Art","review":"Is there anythingamusing, lighthearted or redeemingabout extreme psychological illness,sexual depravity, child abuse, suicideand attempted murder?This movie would have you think so.There is no reason to view this filmand numerous reasons not to.Do not be seduced by its pedigree.It's technical merit is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't understand the rave reviews","review":"I just can't understand why the reviewers here like this book so much. Character development is weak at best. The pacing is disjointed and jerky. The dialog is stilted. I can't remember who talked about \\"disbelief suspended by the neck until dead, dead, dead\\", but it seems appropriate here. Supernatural, quasi-natural and pseudo-scientific explanations are jumbled together without any thought or consistency. The villains are cardboard, but that's alright because everyone else is.It's just a bad book overall. And it's not even frightening.Customers should save their money and avoid this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bidding Farewell to Guilty Mothering","review":"This book does a great job of addressing the biggest situations in everyday life that tend to induce mommy-guilt - from mealtime to bedtime, and every single moment in between.

Hanley connects the citizens of a small South Korean village to the reader and leads them into the No Gun Ri massacre. The accounts of the villagers are extremely viseral to truly convey the real gore that took place with the landing of the 'Gerryowens'. The book takes many points of view throughout describing both US and South Korean experiences. I recommend this book to anybody wanting to learn more about the Korean War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent history, Excellent writing!!","review":"I thought this was a wonderful read, both in terms of the craftsmanship of the writing as well as in the informational/historical sense. It was meticulously well researched and as such it offers a very personal look at the Korean War. I knew very little of this \\"forgotten war\\" before reading this book and I was so thankful to hear the story even though it was brutally sad at points. It is no wonder the authors were awarded Pulitzer prizes for this massive journalistic effort. Kudos to them!! Go ahead and take part in the fruits of their labor."},{"rating":"1","title":"America is the Enemy","review":"From the beginning these journalists seem bent on portraying the American soldiers as a bunch of drunken fools, a massacre waiting to happen. The South Koreans, on the other hand, are peaceful, beautiful people. When I read something so unbalanced, especially something purporting to be history, I generally hope to see a list of the sources supporting each fact. No such luck here, the journalists cannot apparently deviate from their media style, not a footnote to be found, no evidence at all.

It also really holds a lot of stuff - he has about 12 pairs of cufflinks in there and 5 watches and there is still room.I priced these around in person and I seen some really expensive watch valets in stores and this is on par with most of the ones they had for about 100 bucks; they had ones for 200 bucks which blew this out of the water but they were 200 bucks and I wasn't looking to spend that much.

However, it was extremely detailed and went through every phase of the struggle. The text was not filled with statistics, as books often are about this topic. Specific incidents weren't in any way 'sugar-coated' and it was clear that the black struggle has been worse than the media and even our presidents have ever admitted. The last chapter, and the most current, proves that few strides have been taken to improve the lives of blacks. We see that times are getting better, but not for all people.

They initially worked really well even though one would occasionally fall off my foot. They really do improve traction, even on glare ice -But they won't make you invincible and you can still slip if you're not careful!Unfortunately, they only lasted me about three weeks before they started to self-destruct. The rubber bands that hold the steel traction coils get pinched between the coils and the ground and eventually break leaving the Yaktraks unusable. If you don't walk very much these may be right for you. But if you do, you'll go through several pairs of these a season because they wear out fairly quickly. I ended up getting Stabilicers.

I assumed that these would last at least through the winter, boy was I mistaken. I calculate I trekked maybe 12 miles in these before the rubber degraded enough to make the entire item fall to pieces. First day I wore them a coil came off, so with a fair amount of time and a pair of pliers I fixed them temporarily. I would not recommend this product to anyone. At all. The rubber they're crafted with stiffens when cold and causes misalignment and constant correction. Then they fall apart shortly thereafter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but quality has gone downhill","review":"I bought my first yak-trax walker years ago and they lasted 3 years.

I wouldn't take my daily hikes down the trail without them, but I'm very disappointed in the quality. I may try the pro model next, but from the pictures they don't look any better.

When the snow starts to melt, we hit the lower elevation trails and hike. This year there has been so much snow that even the low-lying trails are still covered near the top elevation gain which makes the last bit of the hike slick and treacherous. Now, instead of slipping and sliding all over the trail, we slip on our Yaktrax Walkers and feel secure that we won't be slipping and falling. They work GREAT! They're easy on, easy off, and improve stability on ice/packed snow. I highly recommend Yaktrax Walkers...so much so that we have purchased them for our elderly parents who live in snowy/cold climates. I feel better knowing that they have a better chance of not falling down in the ice now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yaktrax","review":"Simple device that functions extremely well on icy surfaces.

While the traction improvement was noticeable, the spiral rings decoupled from the rubber supports after about 1.5 miles. Many of my postal customers did thoroughly scrape their walkways, so some of that distance was on bare concrete. I suspect this accelerated the degradation of my Yaktrax. In any case, that's still a very short distance so I can't recommend them for anything but light duty and/or occasional use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yaktrax Walker Traction Cleats for Snow and Ice","review":"I'm a mailman. I used The Yaxtrax Walker Traction cleats as soon as I got them. I thought they were great. I was able to keep good footing as I delivered my entire route.

Not anymore.","review":"I slip on the ice all the time. But with my new Yaktrax I can walk over the ice with confidence. I love my Yaktrax and won't walk on the ice without them. The downsides are that they must fit your boot tightly making them a little tough to put on. And they come off when I walk through snow that's more than an inch deep. But even with these downsides I'd never be without and would recommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"Having had two pairs myself and having gifted another four pairs, I can say that Yaktrax Walkers are a good idea but one poorly executed. Spiral wires are held in place by a frame of elasticized plastic. The plastic is quite fragile and the problem occurs because the wires aren't long enough to cover the entire expanse of the shoe's sole (which would prevent chafing of the plastic with the roadway). Too soon the plastic chafes and breaks - never a full winter of use, in my experience. Before they chafe through, they are excellent. I would recommend that anyone ignoring my review, pay the extra that the Pro model costs because sooner or later you will almost certainly walk out of the standard (strapless) model and lose it before you know that it's gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"YakTraxs no. Kahtoola Microspikes yes.","review":"I went through two YakTraxs this year. Wore one pair in three storms last year. The other was brand new. Both tore apart while shoveling ice off my driveway this year. YakTraks are good for casual walking or for an emergency, like leaving in your car. The bottom springs on YakTraxs cut the \\"delicate\\" rubber assembly apart otherwise. I started searching for another option and stumbled upon Kahtoola Microspikes. They are fantastic. It's a slip on like the YakTraxs, but the system and assembly is rigorous, well constructed and solid. They look and act like snow chains for your boots. YakTraxs don't stay in place on your boots either. I'm very, very satisfied with the Kahtoola Microspikes and will never buy YakTraxs again.YakTraxs are inexpensive throw away light walking wires. Not for icy hills or rigorous snow sports / work.Cheap and the rubber breaks, is cut by the spike easily.Find a better option.

I keep them on my work boots all winter long. They fall off my boots all the time, and I've had to bungie cord them to my boots to keep them from falling off. Right off the bat the coils start to crack and break and the sharp edges cut the rubber, and the whole things starts to fall apart. I've now ordered myself some Stabilicers and hopefully they will last longer. I don't recommend Yaktrax at all for constant wear. I imagine they are fine for very light use, or emergency use."},{"rating":"1","title":"seemed like a good idea","review":"Tried them out today for the 1st time. Was a little difficult to get them on my boots but not bad considering I have not used them before. Walked over some snow to get to the sidewalk and 1 came off. OK, I figured I just didnt get them securely on. Put it back on and walked again through the snow and it came off again. Put it in my pocket and decided to walk with the 1 to see how it worked. Crossed the street and walked through a small amount of snow again and the other one came off too. Not only would they not stay on my feet, they are clear and very difficult to see in the snow. My guess is that they probably work really well on ice but there cannot be any snow.

Think about it... uneven steel coils wrapped around thin rubber strands. I wore them when shoveling a hilly driveway; the sideways force caused the unevenly spaced coils to partially unwind on the rubber strands. Whenever a tight section of coil reaches a rubber junction (of which there are several under your feet) it cuts or tears the rubber. One rip and it's all over, no fixing these puppies. I got ONE use out of the last pair. Ridiculous.A much better product is the ICE TREKKER DIAMOND GRIP- ICE CLEATS. No rubber under your feet, diamond shaped cleats to bite into ice, much more durable. Worth every penny, available through Amazon and others.Learn from my mistake, shop carefully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Dangerous!","review":"If you use these, make sure you inspect them before each use. The rubber framework is not very resilient and can break. While running, my Yak broke and I stepped on the broken piece. I subsequently tripped and landed on my face. I broke a tooth and it became imbedded in my lip. I needed oral surgery to remove the tooth. This is not an isolated incident. I know another runner whose Yaks broke and got caught on her pants.

I figured that $15 or so bucks is a lot cheaper than a broken ankle, xrays, and my co-payment, even if they only last for one season.

I found a web site that mentioned that roofers are buying these like crazy due to the great traction benefits AND the fact that they cause no roof damage. I find this to be absolutely true and could not be happier with them. I use them also now for taking the large dog for walks on slippery roads. They work fantastic for that too. This dog has Malamute legs and pulls like freight train but these Yak Trax keep me stable and locked in place unlike before. The only thing they don't work 100% on is polished glare hard ice. But they still work OK on ice. I have ice spikes for that if it is glare ice throughout the walk. But on snow and polished snow there is nothing like Yak Trax.Mike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful for walking on sidewalks with snow, sleet, and ice!","review":"I got these for myself, my husband, and my mother-in-law a week ago.

My mother-in-law had been afraid to leave her house to walk a few blocks on icy sidewalks, but she tried the yaktrax and said they worked great and she loves them. I take care when putting them on to make sure they fit into the grooves on the bottoms of my boots, and they seem very durable and stay on very well so far.

Prior to the breakage, my daughter's Yaktrax kept coming off her foot. To finish our trip, we rigged the broken Yaktrax to make them useable. On the second day, the third pair broke.

They worked well and we wore them.They WILL fall off - straps can be fashioned with velcro or shoestrings. Like any traction aid, I wouldn't want to wear them inside. They will be slick on hard floors, but can be left on for that quick trip inside at the convenience store.Durability of the coils on concrete is a concern, but this is probably true for other devices.

Traction is incredibly enhanced over several different footwear I've tried them on. I've tried these in just snow and a combination of snow and ice and traction is significantly improved. I havent tried them on pure ice yet, but I could seem them working very well there as well.Pro's:- Price- recycled and reduced packaging- easy to slip on and off- easy to clean/dry- can use inside (not recommended for a long time)Con's:- Made in China- the small size could take some effort to stretch on, so if the person is elderly it might take a bit to do this (maybe put on before putting shoe on can help)."},{"rating":"2","title":"They are for shoes like chains are for tires!","review":"I love these YakTrax!

Seems like the wire rusts awful fast on our new ones, and the stretch stuff is more brittle. They break now even more often, as the elastic gets cut by unraveling coils, and more recently loses its elasticity. Probably cheaper manufacturing!They have always acted like roller bearings on dry surfaces, so be careful or your feet will be sliding out from under you when you walk into a store or hit some dry pavement. Lucky they're easy to take on and off as you go inside, and we always carry a small plastic shopping bag to put them in our pockets, as they're usually full of snow and ice melt and sand.Best to keep them warm before putting them on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Product","review":"If you are afraid of falling when out walking on the ice buy this product.

My wife lost one (without realizing it) while walking on snow and then slipped on an icy spot and smashed up her right wrist and distal radius. She ended up needing an operation and a metal plate insert. I've had some bad experiences with this product as well; it often slips off, shifts up my shoe/boot -- and the rubber frequently breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"DURABLE AND KEEP YOU ON YOUR FEET","review":"My Wife and I both received a pair of these as a gift.

Very affordable price.","review":"I purchased these for my wife who is prone to slipping on the ice. Before purchasing them, she had slipped and fell on the ice and broke her wrist.

I had been incredibly hesitant to go out in icy conditions, not being sure of my footing. Yaktrax are unbelievable. They grip the ice like it was dry pavement! I would especially recommend Yaktrax to those people whom may have a fear of falling, such as elderly or disabled persons. They definitely give an extra feeling of security and confidence when out in poor weather. Another benefit is they do not have spikes that can easily damage carpet/flooring if not removed immediately. Instead of spikes there are smooth wires 360 degrees that grip.If you live in an area that only occasionally receives snow/ice, keep a pair of these in your closet and make any pair of shoes safe for the conditions!Yaktrax also have a Pro version which has an additional stabilizer that goes across the top of your shoe if you are more active and use them for running in the snow or on ice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traction cleats for snow","review":"The cleats worked well at first but later one slipped off one of my shoes. Since it was transparent, it was extremely difficult to find it in the snow. Also, when wet they slipped dangerously on tile floors.

I had ordered the smallest size, so probably wouldn't recommend these unless one planned to take them off when indoors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until they fell off!","review":"I was so happy when my Yaktrax walker traction device came in the mail today, I immediately put them on (carefully) to run some errands, it's pretty icy here in Maine. Within 5 minutes, both of them had slipped off and I lost one. I was pretty happy with the Yaktrax Pro Ice Walkers that I used last winter but they were hard to put on. These lighter Traction Device Walkers were much easier to put on and clearly easy to remove, much too easy! I can't even return them as I now only have one. I am going back to the Pro Ice Walkers, the velcro trap keeps them on my shoes where they belong.

Unfortunately for us, it was the most snow that had been in that part of OH for several years. On the bright side, this saved my workouts. I could still go for a jog even with snow on the ground. One caveat, though-be careful on the sidewalk that is composed of bricks-these make those types of surfaces infinitely more slippery!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YakTrax","review":"I have used this product for two years and they are absolutely wonderful on ice. I have to care for horses and the yard area gets compacted snow which turns to ice. Wearing the YakTrax keeps me from falling and since I am an older woman falling is not high on my list of things to do. I also wear them when walking my dog on the street in the winter. I have found that the sizes indicated on the package are not very accurate. A medium was supposed to fit my hiking boot size but I had to return the medium for the large which fits perfectly. They were also cheaper from Amazon then buying them at a local Sports Store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I walk my dogs daily. I hoped that these would help keep me from falling on the unshoveled icy stretches of the sidewalk. They did that well. However, they were slippery on the clear part of the sidewalk. To get the best use from them, I would have to alternate taking them off and putting them on every 10-20 yards. That is not a good answer with dogs on leashes, and nowhere to prop while tugging them off my shoes. I tried two pair, thinking the first might have been flawed, but neither set lasted more than 10 miles, which is pretty poor quality. The plastic bands break so quickly, and sometimes you are left without one on the way back home. They got the second star because I didn't fall or even slip on the ice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yaktrax","review":"I order a pair of these for all of my adult children.

I found them to be great for healing, and they introduced me to regular yoga exercise. Schlorholtz has arranged the routines on the disk to provide many different options in level of exercise and time commitment needed to complete the routines. Doing them regularly has been very beneficial in terms of general health and flexibility. By creating your own customized program of routines, you really can find an individual, progressive path from gentle beginner exercises (where I was when I broke my ankle) to more challenging levels. I recommend these DVDs highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I have been using John's DVDs several times each week for almost two years. As a 53-year-old woman with an average fitness level and no significant physical limitations, the DVDs have been wonderful for increasing my flexibility and over-all feeling of well-being. They are easy to use and to tailor for different workouts on different days. I have even found the chair DVD good for hotel rooms where I really don't want to get down on the carpet. John's approach is very accessible to persons new to yoga and for those who want a more \\"gentle\\" approach--both toward mind and body. I would highly recommend both DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ageless Yoga","review":"This is the best yoga dvd that I have come across.

The zipper was very poorly attached and constructed and was of low quality. I had to fight with him to get it on because it wouldn't start easily and the patience of a 13 month old is short. After trying to put it on for the 3rd time (we didn't want him in his carseat with it on so he wouldn't get too hot) it just plain broke. We tried to repair it but to no avail. He cruised around his aunt's house with the costume half open. Also the brown fur easily gets stuck in the zipper or ends up in your or your baby's mouth and nose.One good this is the style.

The book is filled with selfcongratulatory preambles and introductions, photographs and observations that are meant to represent the feel of being at a reading at the KGB Bar, but instead it feels as if you are rifling though someone's old yearbook. You know it matters a lot to the people inside, but there isn't enough there to hold your interest. I prefer the way in which the original KGB Bar Reader was put together, offering interesting prose with out all the fancy wrappings. And has anyone noticed that the essay included here by the bar's owner seems to [resemble] the introduction from the original book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this book","review":"Women are catty - what a shocker. Jane Austen was writing about women saying mean things to each other in her books 200 years ago. Unfortunately, it is the nature of the beast. It is the method women use to compete with each other - words and exclusion. The majority of this book is taken up with anecdotes, most of them ending with \\"so then I quit my job.\\" Honestly, where did the author find all these wimpy women? There no ground-breaking techniques given to deal with other than try to understand, confront, or remove yourself from the situation. A grown woman reading this book will learn nothing new in dealing with difficult women that she hasn't already picked up in her journey to adulthood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond Mean Girls","review":"Cheryl Dellasega's Mean Girls Grown Up makes an important contribution to the study of RA (relational aggression). In her clear and engaging book, Dellasega shows how \\"mean\\" childhood patterns can and do persist into adulthood--and how damaging they are. The author of three other books, including GirlWars, Dellasega also encourages readers to see that they needn't be victims of bullying (or continue to be bullies). Other positive points about this book are its inclusion of a good number of firsthand anecdotes and its movement beyond the usual territory of female RA studies--not only into adulthood but beyond the upper-middle-class white suburbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!

That's what I'm looking for and this book does not deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long and detailed","review":"I read this book while working on my Master's degree in English history, with a focus on Thomas More. Even though I knew the background to the story, the story was still confusing. It alternated chapters from the Utopia that Quiroga was trying to found and chapters describing the author's adventures in researching the book. It was a strage juxtaposition and one that was not very effective. At points, the author's chapters described drunken outings and nonsenical adventures that made me wonder if the author had lost his mind while writing this book (or, conversely, if the author's chapters were more fiction than he tried to represent). I actually only made it through about 200 pages before I apathetically put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new sound","review":"Anton Schwartz is a rarity in jazz today.

After doing a preliminary sort, I was able to clean up and crop 450 in a couple of evenings. Several great things about Bibble Pro:1. It's easy to work with a folder full of images2. It's easy to apply the same settings to multiple images3. You can output many images in a given format (TIFF, JPEG) in a single background batch task4. The \\"Perfectly Clear\\" optimizer does a good job for probably 75% of images - the others need more careful tweakingThe 4.8.1 release seems reasonably stable - it did crash once, but I didn't lose any data.The bottom line for me is that I get much better results from Bibble Pro than I do from Adobe Camera Raw, and in much less time.

It's not hard to do once you get the needed help. It seems to me the manual should have addressed tethering, that would have been helpful.Over all I like the program and would recommend it for easy to use and powerful batch processing. After getting Bibble I started shooting in RAW full time because it's easy to view, correct, and convert to jpg, tiff , ect...After a couple of product shot sessions I'm finding I do save time with Bibble Pro tethered to my Nikon D80, I wouldn't give it up.

HOWEVER, I cannot get any minor problems addressed by the company. I waited 10 days for them to respond to an email about an installation issue, and they only responded because I threatened to start writing reviews. I am now waiting 4 days for a followup. I can't get into their forums because they won't recognize me as a customer so I can't get advice that way. I also find the interface confusing but I'm hoping they fix that in version 5. In the meantime, unless you're confident you can figure anything out on your own, BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gret Product But Needs An Update To Accept TIF Files As Input","review":"I use Nikon Capture NX to 1.34 AUTOMATICALLY remove chromatic abberation from from the raw Nikon .nef files. They are saved as 16 bit TIF files.However Bibble Pro 4 cannot read TIF files, but ironically it can save as TIF files.I'm still buying this program shortly as Bibble 5 is expected to be able to read 16 bit TIF files, and will be a free upgrade. Bibble 5 will cost more too.I love its AUTOMATED Perfectly Clear feature and its tight integration to Noise Ninja - all run in batch mode. This work flow produces the best picture quality with the least fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good software, easy to use raw editor","review":"Very good raw editing software. The next version of Bibble will also provide layers and additional photoshop type features over and above its raw editing capability. To achieve this now I purchased this in addition to PS elements (very limited raw editing) and I can do everything and more over photoshop at much less the prices"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bibble Pro","review":"Good..but the same as Bibble Light, unless you are batch processing. With a hefty additional price tag"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Solid Content, Helpful Notes","review":"Solid book with good, clearly written \\"lesson plans\\" for using with your small groups. Positive suggestions for getting started and continuing on. One of my favorite parts of this book are the margin notes for new or beginning youth ministers or cell group leaders. The authors are very eager to teach their readers to adapt, adapt, adapt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad - but not as advertised.","review":"The wheel is advertised as \\"Bakelite\\" and it isn't. It's probably ABS - durable, but Bakelite would have been more durable and heavier - that would give it a better \\"feel\\". The center wheel is solid and spins smoothly. The felt was heavy and good quality. The red color was dull and not as shown. The chips were fair.Amazon paid for return shipping and gave a full refund - good job Amazon.I decided to go with the wooden wheel (12 inch) sold on Amazon, and bought the felt and chips separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible in every aspect","review":"This book is just terrible. The examples don't help you do the problems. The answers in the back of the book are completely random, they're all over the place and some are even, some are odd. But some are randomly listed."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst probability book out there.","review":"I dont know why professors continuously use this worthless book but they do! PLEASE stop! poor examples, poor introduction, poor everything. the author could have done a much better job if he had gone into detail. take another class if you can use a different book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate description at Amazon","review":"I thougt I bought a book (hard copy), and even got a shipping date and estimate arrival...
