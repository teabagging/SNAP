I must have been confused by the \\"After the Merger\\" title, there is limited value to this book if you are looking for strategies of how to handle merger integration, and little value for other purposes as well. The book describes generalities, for example: it takes the authors approximately 15 pages to relate that mergers should not be focused on cost cutting \\"efficiency synergies\\", rather they should be focused on \\"Growth Synergies\\".

Ng Sin Lin is so pretty even though she plays a common looking female in it. Chingmy Yau is fine as always...especially with all the plastic surgery she's had.

If there is any noise in the background the person I am talking to can not hear me. The range is basically none existent. If I place the phone in my pocket on the opposite side that I am wearing the Bluetooth on the connection breaks up instead of just being full of static. If I place it on my kitchen table and walk to the stove in my small kitchen the Bluetooth becomes so garbled the person on the line can not understand what I am saying.

My unit won't charge unless i physically hold it pressed into the base unit. It doesn't appear to be missing anything, and it charges when i hold the two pieces together, so i call this a bad mechanical design and would recommend not buying this product, but the 510 or anything else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good product","review":"This product is horrible.

The quality on my end is very good. However, most people on the other end of the line complain of poor quality audio, clipping, and static.

Hopefully those of you using the Pearl will have better success pairing with this headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"First of all, the listing here is inaccurate. The 645 does not have multipoint. The only plantronics headset to feature multipoint is the 510.Additionally, the holster is terrible. Assuming the holster will work to hold the headset will pretty much guarantee you will lose it.Sound quality is fine, however there is a significant delay between when the phone starts dialing and when the headset picks up. Same goes for answering calls.It's also extremely easy to accidentally trigger the auto-redial button.The only positive feature of the 645 is that it's comfortable, however certainly not enough so to merit the pricetag.All told, I would steer clear of this. Not worth the cost. If you're looking for a high end headset, I would suggest the Jabra JX10.

First of all the ear piece does not fit securely in the charger; consequently it does not make good contact with the charging posts and will not charge unless you hold the ear piece down. The second problem that I had with this device is that the charger and supplied adapter that it came with did not fit together tightly; it would not charge using the supplied charger assembly.

We follow her voyage from southern England to Australia, where she slowly adapts to and ultimately embraces life on the frontier, minus the many comforts with which she had been raised. We see not only Rachel's transformation, but a fascinating study of life in the Australian outback, and the triumph of hard work in a frontier that was at times quite harsh, yet which ultimately provided a good life.

Cullen had a great chance on \\"Ripple\\", but even that starts off abbrieviating the opening, the signature of the tune.Maybe Deadheads will buy this and enjoy, but I didn't-this can't decide if it's New Age, folk or rock and none of the arrangements are fully satisfying.

Her style on this CD is very Peggy Lee like. I really enjoyed this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Bette, but...","review":"I cannot tell you how disappointed I was in this album. I love Bette Midler and think she is one of the greatest entertainers we have today. But, my impression of this album was that she came into the studio, sang a few Peggy Lee songs, told them where to send the check and went home. To add insult to injury, there isn't a photo or anything else on the CD itself, just barely legible \\"This side up.\\" Sorry Bette, in the future I'll stick to you singing your own material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed , but your next cd project sounds exciting!","review":"I am a long time Bette fan, but feel that most of her albums don't have enough good songs on them. I only own 2 Bette Albums, No Frills (her best) and Rosemary Clooney songbook. Of course she has other good songs, but her other cd's don't have enough good songs on them to keep. Sadly, that's the case with her new cd: Peggy Lee Songbook. 7 of the songs are boring. I think she made a mistake with the song choices. And her singing is flat and boring on most of them. The best song is the duet with Barry. I heard that she wants to do a Laura Nyro tribute cd. If she does, I hope she picks a different producer, maybe someone like: Richard Perry, Steve Levine, or Nile Rodgers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bette's got Fever!","review":"There couldn't be a more worthy tribute to Miss Peggy Lee than one sung by the incomparable Bette Midler.

Not only does she add to the style of Peggy Lee, she embelishes it. An added feature are the DVD performances of some of the songs.

Like most folks, I found the Clooney tribute way too short but very, very well done, in fact it's one of my favorite Bette albums. This endeavor however, well, I've listened to it 4 times yesterday and 3 times today and I just don't get it - once again, half a CD's worth of music but worse, what's here is flat and thinly produced - Manilow, are you sure you worked on this release? This one will join Bette Of Roses in my \\"rarely listened to\\" section of my Midler collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great CD .. if it will play","review":"This is a very good CD .. if it will play. Being a dual disk, I found out the hard way that it won't play the CD side in either drive on my computer. Oddly, it plays just fine in my ancient 15 year old Sony 5-CD changer.

Invest your money is something that might actually work and avoid dual format."},{"rating":"1","title":"HARDLY A BEST BETTE","review":"Bette Midler is trying hard to be the white Ella Fitzgerald --- first a tribute songbook to Rosemary Clooney (an acceptable accomplishment), and now a tribute to the woman with fever. But this is far from a best Bette. It was musical director and guest vocalist Barry Manilow --- his arrangements are marvelous --- who suggested the divine Miss M do this recording; Bette's lack of Lee's depth and accomplishments show. \\"Fever\\" is finger-snapping imitation that never hits its mark; \\"Is That All There Is?\\" has Midler excessively emoting in a way in which Lee never did; even through Bose speakers, it's so over-the-top it's embarrassing.

Bette Midler: they're really targeting the artists with the criminal element as their fan base."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected better","review":"Because I like Bette Midle I purchased the CD. It was so bad I could not listen to the entire CD. Bette has her own style and should have stuck with it rather than try to imitate Peggy Lee. Giving it one star is being kind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Plain.","review":"I am a fan of both Peggy Lee and Bette Midler. It's extremely ambituous to do a disc on the signature tunes of Peggy Lee. From a marketing point of view, it makes lots of sense. But from a musical point of view, you have nobody to measure to but Pegge Lee herself. And did Bette prove that she can carry the tunes just as well as Miss Lee? The answer is no. The CD is well recorded and well produced and Bette's voice is fine. However, there is no spark, and her renditions fail to provoke any of the sexiness, insinuating, and sometimes non-chalant attitude that Pegge Lee exhibited so well in her signature tunes like \\"FEVER\\", \\"BIG SPENDER\\", \\"IS THAT ALL THERE IS\\"..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thinly disguised vehicle for tired liberal complaints","review":"The author was not content to simply write a book about recreation. The book is loaded with political editorializing, including a section blaming the Detroit riots of the 60's on \\"society\\", constant harping about the inequalities of the recreation opportunities for rich and poor, and a pervasive hostility towards private recreation resources. I do not recommend the book at all except as a mildly amusing piece of trite socialist hogwash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticky Buttons","review":"Purchased this phone for my in-laws to replace an older phone. within a month the buttons started to stick.

In the first place, her books are quite long and she takes the time to develop a real storyline along with her mystery. In the second place, she writes of real historical happenings - in this case a summer uprising that occurred near Cambridge about 7 years after the Black Death. So not only do you get a good story with a good plot, a good mystery that keeps you guessing to the last minute, you get a little education too. This book was exceptionally good, I thought. And the denouement at the end shocked me completely. I usually guess who the murderer is in a lot of mysteries, but I did not guess the whys and wherefores of this particular mystery. Also, be warned that Ms. Gregory seems to turn up a lot of dead bodies in one of her stories. In this case, some eight or nine. I won't say anymore because I don't want to give the story away. That would be a shame because this one is such fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Summer of My Discontent","review":"This book started off with a dismal view of the time period. Well, it was a dismal time so maybe that was realistic. Unfortunately the story then became peopled with nasty one dimensional victims who you were not inclined to mourn.The plot twisted and turned and finally tied itself into knots.Nothing made sense; nothing was believable and I gave up before I finished. Something I rarely do. But my reading time is valuable and I didn't want to waste it.Sorry - I really wanted to like this book.

It's very dated now, but it's still a great story. I think the writer should do a sequal in today's time, where P1 comes back again. Alternately, if it were updated, it would make a pretty good movie. It's hard to explain how invested you get in the relationship between a computer program and his creator, but you really do get swept up in it, plus, now, I get caught up in noticing how everything has changed.

These tracks are actually on Ayreon's Universal Migrator Part 1: The Dream Sequencer, which is a full album sold separately from Flight of the Migrator. While Part 2 is primarily heavy progressive metal (and excellent at that), Part 1 (where these four tracks originate) is much more on the lite prog side. Think Spocks Beard and Lana Lane and you'll get the idea. Lots of heavy keys, smooth vocals, and more about atmosphere than banging heads and crunching guitars.

Peter Skene Ogden did just about everything imaginable during this time period. In the year 1810, at the age of sixteen, he joined the North West Fur Company to travel and trap the vast Canadian wilderness. After the Hudson's Bay Fur Company bought out the North West Fur Company, he then worked for the HBC. In the 1820's he lead five trapping expeditions, called the Snake River Expeditions, into all parts of the Pacific Northwest in which he and his men (and families) faced incredible dangers and hardships of hunger, hostile Indians, mother nature, etc. Later, Ogden was sent further up the Pacific coastline towards Alaska to establish trading posts for the HBC.

The print chapter never discusses CUPS or XPRINT - it only covers the traditional lp and lpr print systems.

The author Mary Ryan is actually one of their descendants and she has obviously put a lot of work into the research. However she has also filled in the gaps with some speculative fiction. Rather risky.I can imagine many people liking it, but personally I got bored.

Another immediate highlight for me is Arlen Roth's intense Upstate Rag. On disc 2. Henry Kaiser and Michael Manring brew up some twisted electronic madness to contrast the already varied acoustic picking that dominates this set.

The sheep itself was cute and very easy to operate. We used it several times a day for naps and bedtime and it worked great...for about three weeks. Then the sound started to cut out, and eventually died entirely. I thought it must be the battery so I changed the battery. No change.The sound would work for a few seconds, or sometimes even a minute or two, and then would cut out unexpectedly. We found the sound worked better on some settings (the whale noises) rather than others. Sometimes if we fiddled with the volume, we could get it to work for longer. Other times, nothing we did could get the sounds to play for more than a second or two.After a couple of weeks, we just gave up. I was really disappointed, because otherwise we thought it was a great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I like it and my little one likes it. I do wish it came with a timer longer than 45 min. This is the only reason why I gave it four stars. My little one wakes up almost immediately after it shuts off. There are times he needs an hour nap but won't sleep at all without \\"white noise\\" of some sort so this product gives us at least some nap time. The wales are pretty cool and the stream is neat too. Really, the sounds are based on preference but are not obnoxious like some I have encountered. The volume dial is very versatile from soft to loud. Nice product. Worth the buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft and cuddley","review":"The sleep sheep is a soft and cuddley with soothing sounds that baby loves. It is quiet and cute and perfect to hang on the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have for newborn","review":"I love this product! We have both the full size and the travel version. I like the smaller one better actually. We use the larger one in our room since baby sleeps in the bassinet there and it sits on my night stand or in our bed for now. The smaller one is attached to the side of the crib and we are using it for naps. Baby loves the ocean and whales best. As previous review has mentioned, a continuous mode would be nice because he does start to stir when it goes off and I have to creep in and turn it back on. He does go right back to sleep once it is back on. At night I just reach over and press the button as well and he goes back to sleep. I wish it had a remote for when he is sleeping in his crib so I don't have to creep in there and possibly wake him all the way. All in all this is on my \\"must have\\" list for a new baby. I had no idea how well it worked, but I completely attribute it to my baby sleeping very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"2mth old daughter loves this","review":"Tested both this and the giraffe.I think the giraffe is 1) cuter looking 2) more interesting to look at (contrasting colours for baby) 2) has the playful sound - upbeat safari theme soundsThe sheep however works its magic wonderfully. My 9 wk old is immediately calmed by the soothing sounds (all of them are very soothing). Only complaint is that there is no upbeat playful sound (like the giraffe). I'm very pleased with the volume control (from quiet to quite loud in case the car/party is loud, baby can still be soothed by the sounds on high volume). I love that you can remove the sound machine to wash the sheep! I also think the to-go version is the perfect size - can't imagine needing or wanting a larger one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleeps best friend..","review":"We registered for this after seeing a friend use this with her little one before we even got pregnant.

I had heard mixed reviews, but it works incredibly for my son! I even bought a second one as a back up, just in case, but for the past year this has been a lifesaver and has worked perfectly. I highly recommend it to any new mothers. Whenever my son would get fussy outside of the normal schedule, you press the bottom sleep button, which has whale sounds, and he is out again within minutes. It did take a little bit of time for us to get used to the noise on the monitor, but hang in there, it's worth it. Works like a dream!

So, this really does help keep her asleep! I put it on to 45 mins & she slept great! Wish i would have had this for her first 3 months! Great gift idea, let's face it...having a portable music machine for background noise is genius. No cd player to lug around. The adjustable volume is a great feature & I like that it goes for up to 45 minutes! It's soft & cute, also.

We turn this on whenever it is nap time and it immediately calms him down and helps him fall asleep. It also drowns out noise that my husband and I make, so we don't wake him up. I also use it while my toddler naps to drown out noise. We use it multiple times a day, and I still haven't needed to change the batteries. The noise machine easily comes out of the sheep for easy washing. It gets quite loud, definitely loud enough to be effective for soothing a newborn who is used to the loud womb. The only reason I gave it four stars is because I wish there were an option to not have it automatically shut off. It would be nice for it to stay on for entire naps so I don't wake my kids up in our small house by making noise. I definitely recommend this product! It's my most useful baby item other than swaddling blankets, pacis, and baby carriers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed","review":"The problem is that I don't want it to stop at 45 minutes. I would rather have the option to stop NEVER! At least, to leave it going for at least eight hours. Because sometimes, when it stops abruptly after one of its preset number of minutes, baby wakes up. And that's frustrating. I can't believe they would not give you the option to run for a full sleep cycle, basically."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute, but no help","review":"This item is cute and portable.

Babies really do respond to swaddling, being on their sides or stomachs, jiggling and \\"shush-ing\\" noise. We have used all of the white noises on this sheep and they all work to various degrees. We found the ocean sound to be closest to a parent \\"shssssh/shush\\" with breaths in between. Rather than shssssssh your lips off till your throat is bone dry, this Sheep does lots of the work for you and can be adjusted in volume for any ambient noise. Great item and did wonders for our little one's \\"4th trimester\\" She switches off like a light now when she recognizes the preparation and sheep sounds!

It helped soothe him everywhere from his bassinet to his carseat to his stroller. It was nice to have such a PORTABLE sound machine so that we could place it in his pack and play when he was napping somewhere other than home.I only have three complaints, all of which could be easily remedied by a few small product design changes -1) There is not option to keep the sounds playing continually. This would REALLY improve the products overall effect. When you are using the sheep to drown out outside noises so baby can nap, you need the product to stay on until you turn it off, not shut off on a timer.2) When the sounds finishes, it simply shuts off abruptly, rather than fading down slowly. As my son got older he was awakened from his sleep on more than one occasion by this feature.3) There are no womb sounds or mothers heartbeat, which should be a MUST on any infant sound machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave as a gift","review":"The new mother said that she was very pleased with this product.

When my youngest son (now 5 months old) started showing signs of colic, we bought the travel version hoping that it would help him to at least rest a little while we were out and about. The product has all kinds of technical difficulties - there's a timer that's supposed to allow the sound to play for either 25 or 45 minutes. Doesn't work. The machine frequently shuts off after a few minutes, usually right as the baby is about to go to sleep which of course wakes him back up. Also, I often have trouble getting it to play at all and have to fiddle for 5 minutes with the volume knob and trying different buttons to get it to start. It's not the batteries because we change them constantly.

Reviews had stated that the regular one was a bit large and we didn't feel we needed the heartbeat for my 16 month old. We love the sounds although the Whale recording is a short loop and not as good as we had hoped. The problem is that the one we received does not shut off automatically at the 23 or 45 minute intervalls. It also stopped working altogether and this happened the same day it arrived. I am requesting a replacement but we are disappointed in its workmanship as my baby just loves her Sleep Sheep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can barely hear the sounds","review":"I got this cute set for my baby shower because I had heard wonderful things about it. The little sheep is very cute, but small in size. The little music adaptor slips in and out of the sheep and sometimes falls out, but that is not what I didn't like about it.The problem with it is that I can barely hear the sounds. You have only 4 choices and even when I turn the volume up to max, the baby can barely hear it. The sounds get drowned by the baby's kicking and cooing.It's definitely not worth buying, however, the blanket that cloud b offers might be good as compared to the sheep.I am thinking of using the sheep myself while doing yoga or something to create a calm environment.Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lifesaver in the car!!","review":"I LOVE this thing!!

The noise device can be removed and you are left with a cute stuffed toy. I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is GREAT!","review":"I bought this for my son when we decided to move from one state to another. I thought it would help him transition during the unfamiliar sounds of the car and the new house. It did just that. It gave him a sound to concentrate on that was familiar while he drifted off to sleep helping him orientate himself. This saved us quite a few fussy nights! The reason I only gave it 4 stars was because the velcro on the side of the sheep does tend to pop open and the music box part will slip out! I simply added a couple extra little velcro dots on the inside to insure that the music box didn't get lost in transit when this was on his car seat. All in all a great buy. Very soft."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Keeper","review":"I got this one instead of the jumbo sheep. It has all the same sounds except the heart, but none the less its great.

My daughter likes the Ocean sound, and will often turn to it while she sleeps in her crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Little Nephew","review":"I bought this for my nephew. My brother wasn't convinced that it would help his new baby sleep at night, but little nephew showed him! I chose the travel size over the regular size because in the website pictures, the regular one looked enormous. Seriously. Bigger than the baby! This one attaches to baby's crib with velcro. My brother's family lives about 400 miles away, so I just had this shipped directly to them (thanks, amazon, for making it super easy to be a doting aunt from a distance!). I was amused when I saw it in person on a visit to find that most of the sounds are water-type sounds... rain, ocean waves, etc. I think if I had known that, I'd have gotten him the Cloud B dolphin. Not that it matters. (And anyway, what was I expecting--bleating noises?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Timer Options, but No Continuous Play?!","review":"I was hoping this would be the answer to our prayers and bought the full-sized and the travel-sized Sheep for our baby. Two things that make this not so great for us: (1) there is no option to just turn it on and let it play continuously. The only options are 23 and 46 minutes, then it shuts off... waking the baby! Timer option is nice, but should be just that, an \\"option\\". Anyone who has used a sleep aid for a baby should know that continuous play is required for many babies to get a good nights sleep or even a decent nap. Secondly, it does not have the basic white noise as one of the sounds, which happens to be what our baby likes the most and works the best. Disappointed for sure. Now I'm searching for a battery-operated sound machine with continuous play white noise! (Recommendations welcome!) The only good thing about this is that our baby likes to look at it... as for the sleep part.. not so helpful in our house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great smoothing/sleeping aid","review":"Great device to help little ones to fall asleep and create a sleeping routing.

She is 21 months old and loves turning this on to help her sleep. The travel sized one is a good size and not too big.This will comfort her when we stay with my in-laws since she is not in her own bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the right size!","review":"I originally purchased the sleep sheep and it was too big so I got this one and it's just the perfect size. They both play same sounds. The only difference was the size. I don't think this put my baby to sleep however it prevent her from waking up especially right after falling asleep. Overall I'm happy with it. It looks cute too."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was key in our planning our best vacation ever","review":"While we don't share Rick Steve's taste in lodging or dining, this book was great in helping us plan a driving trip across Europe that focused primarily on the Romantic Road in Germany, Salzburg and Switzerland. We had a elementary school child in tow and his suggestions were among the ones that she found the most interesting. Super practical advice on being flexible, allowing experiences to happen, searching out more than just the usual pre-packaged touristy stops at any destination. (However, even though it was informative, we were a little unimpressed with the Sound of Music Tour in Salzburg!) I would recommend this book as basic reading to anyone considering a trip to these areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many Errors !","review":"Way too many Errors ! Cannot learn from this book. Samples from the CD won't compile either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent coverage of array of topics, easy to understand.","review":"This book covers a ton of things about the Java language. Some reviewers who have suggested that the coverage is 'rushed', but I think that's more because the book covers soo much material. This is a great reference. The explanations are easy to understand, and I loved the explanation of Threads. Unfortunately, the index leaves a lot to be desired and sometimes makes it hard to find what you are looking for, so you have to rely on the table of contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear explanations from an authority.","review":"Thoroughly explains lots of subtle issues surrounding the subject.

Although a bit confusing in overall structure and flow, it had its moments. The first sign of trouble was when I installed the JDK which I downloaded. The book's instructions on how to name the directories had conflicting examples, happily I worked through that one on intuition. It starts to get unbearable when the examples in the book AND cd have syntax and logical errors. Not being one to waste my money completely, I will continue reading the book (albeit with a critical eye) to grasp some, hopefully not entirely incorrect, concepts. Sorry to say, I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using Java 2 Platform: Special Edition","review":"I bought this book thinking that it covers most of the topics in JAVA but I was wrong. It does cover all the topics but not a single topic is covered well.... there are \\"tons\\" of errors in this book. Most of the time the book contradicts itself. I would recommend \\" Java2: A Completee Reference\\" by Patrik Noughton for the beginers and the advanced Java Programmers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broad but full of errors and annoying style","review":"The good part is that the book covers a broad range of Java-related stuff. However, the writing style is annoying at times, and is almost impossible to understand at some points. Worst of all though, are all the errors. The book can't have been proof-read, the samples contain errors (even on the CD) and have obviously not been tested. A typical example is the JDBC chapters, which explain the underlying mechanisms in detail, but every single example contains syntactical and other errors. When reading this book, I found myself getting so annoyed that my wife forced me to throw it out. There must be better books that cover the same topics. Please look for them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of typos, would make it hard for a beginner.","review":"I bought this book after using BEGINNING JAVA by Ivor Horton (If Beginning JAVA 2 is as good, buy that instead). The book has numerous typos and errors. Not too bad for someone with experience to spot, but could be difficult for a \\"fresh\\" coder. A book like this shouldn't have typos (well not that many!) and the code should work \\"straight off the page\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of errors! Often uses JDK 1.1 instead of 1.2","review":"This is worst tech book i have ever bought. It's obvious that they tried to rush it to market because no one seems to have edited it. The writer obviously does not have a good idea of what changed from 1.1 to 1.2. I hardly ever use this book and can never really trust it. It's a thick book but covers very little in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for those moving from C++","review":"This book is great for those readers moving from C++ or other object oriented languages. The explinations of the API are easy to follow and make getting up to speed a breeze. However, this book is not for true beginners. If you are brand new to programming get something like Beginning Java. If Java is your second or third language though, this book is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a RIPPPPPPP!!!!!!!!!","review":"If I could give this book a zero, I would. The main reason I bought this book was because the text in the book specifically said that the JDK was on the CD-ROM enclosed in back of the book. I even tried downloading the JDK off the internet and I had even more trouble. When I was finally able to install the JDK, I had trouble running most of the programs in the book. Take my advice, if you don't have the JDK, just buy the CD-ROM then install it on your computer from it and save yourself time and money by not purchasing this book. I expect coming up with problems while programming, but not while installing software god d@1313it!

What chops!.....It's a shame he's no longer with us.....There's a story told by sax player Walt Parazaider that in 1968, Chicago was playing at the Whiskey a Go Go in L.A. and Jimi Hendrix caught the show.....Later on, Jimi told Walt that Terry Kath was a better guitarist than even himself....I recommend this remastered edition wholeheartedly just for Kath's musical virtuosity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Documentation Chicago Live Back Then","review":"I was a huge Chicago fan back at the \\"Beginnings.\\" Saw them live at the Fillmore East some time before this performance.

If you don't have \\"Live in Japan\\"... keep looking hard and get it too, if you can find it. Both of these CD's are different, but equally outstanding in there own ways.

This is how live music should be performed. For those out there who actually LIKE live music to sound just like the studio version this isn't for you. But if you want to hear what a late 60's era hard-working touring band sounded like night after night when mainstream audiences cared about musicianship and composition without the \\"repairing\\" of such recordings by later studio work...then this set is an excellent example.

Some are just as good and some are not Chicago toured hard back in the day and at this point in their tour were tired. As far as the fourth disc is concerned there are three songs that are better than the studio versions.1. Listen2. Sing A Mean Tune Kid3. South California PurplesI urge everyone to listen to South California Purples it gets stretched out here to an amazing 12 minutes. Listening to this will have you realize why Jimi Hendrix said that Terry Kath was better than himself. Terry plays some of his best and most intense playng on this song he absolutely shreds. Robert Lamm gives a great vocal along with lots of Hammond B3. The rest of the band is great as well, you will not be bored during the 12 minutes!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Friends","review":"Growing up, one of the first records I ever bought was Chicago V.

When I'm on the 2nd floor and looking over the roof on my low roof, the gutters look crude.

Dirty, ugly, gritty, too real for many, but an accurate depiction of what a tiny frontier town was like. A must for Western scholars to see, and a \\"James Dean\\" role for Michael J.

Particularlly the Anything goes match that Austin, Terry Funk, Mick Foley, and the late Owen Hart had against HHH, Jesse James, Billy Gun, and Savio Vega who was replacing Shawn Michaels. But I guess since that match was so brutal and unsanctioned that the wwe decided against it. I was also hoping they would include a few more matches from the WCW days like the legendary tag team match him and Pillman had against Flair and Anderson and a few of the matches that Austin mentions in his book. I am glad they are including the famous Red and Yellow skit in there from WCW.

I felt the way his story was presented was very well done because it showed how Stone Cold paid his dues for years and then ultimately became a really big star.The DVDs have about 20 of his matches in their entirety, but I wish the Bret Hart submission match at Wrestlemania 13 would have been one of them.

I found the following areas most interesting and helpful; appraisals, boosting value through creative improvements, and information on HUD homes. I did have a problem with how the author down plays the stock market with things like \\"you mine as well buy lottery tickets.\\" He claims he was once naive when investing in real estate, I believe his naive nature still exists when making such general comments about the stock market.

Even as some real estate markets seem to be too hot to continue to hold (or gain) value, the advice in the book continues to be timely and well worth the time to read it. From helping you determine whether real estate investing is for you (and providing the reader with justification for why real estate investing is a competitive proposition), to identifying the best candidates to maximize your return and increasing value of your investment property while you rent it in the most favorable way, the book is almost as good as a living/breathing realtor.

Toth is realistic about these kids' likelihood of making it, but her very human portrayal of them leaves room for hope, and she provides dignity to her subjects even when they are at their worst. I would have liked a little more analysis of the systemic issues of race and class that determined much of the kids' lives before they were even born. At times Toth's tone stinks of noblesse oblige, and somehow her status of white/liberal/middle-class/college girl shines through in every word without ever actually being addressed.

That should tell you something right there. This is an old-fashioned ghost story that builds slowly, and nicely, upon the dread one might feel stuck in the middle of the ocean when strange things start to happen. And the author sets the scene very well. One can almost hear the rigging creaking. It's interesting to imagine how an early 20th century audience, that hadn't been spoiled by seeing too many movies of ships at sea and pirates, might have taken this story. I suspect they were deeply creeped out. The only drawback for me was that I don't have the nautical lingo down. I don't know all the terms for the different parts of the ship, sails, and masts and such, so I had trouble imagining what was going on at times, but that didn't prevent me from enjoying this very well crafted tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ambient Masterpiece","review":"The movie Mysterious Skin is often a harsh unflinching look at male prostitution and child molestation but it was so well made and offset by such a beautiful score it worked.Here on it's own the score by Robin Guthrie and Harold Budd turns out to be extremely good on it's own.Back in the 80's Harold Budd and Brian Eno turned ambient music into an art and this is a welcome return for Budd which will hopefully introduce a whole new generation to his music.The soundtrack not only works as soothing background music but if you listen to it in it's entirety it's hypnotically satisfying.It's a measure of greatness of ambient music if it's as interesting in the foreground as it is in the background and Mysterious Skin succeeds in that aspect.Also because there are no big John Williams type numbers that totally belong to certain movie scenes you can enjoy this soundtrack without ever having to see the movie.(though you ought to see the great film)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Since The Pearl","review":"and The Moon and the Meldoies have these two released the likes of this. . . which is good in that why should they repeat . .but one can only feed for so long on the same dish . . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious Skin - Great Music","review":"The etheral sounds on this cd are as haunting as the film.

Rabbi Kaplan writes about a daunting subject in an easy to understand style.

As far as current scholarship on the key text of qabbala within the contemporary Jewish tradition (post Lurianic) this work is the best and simplest serious study of the texts themselves. Kaplan discusses all the known texts, gives voice to all major scholars in the field as to the date of this text, then carefully analyzes this mystical text line by line. There are many great works out there Kaplan refers us to (Scholem of course), and alternative directions (Lullian and hermetic), but for a very comprehensive yet straightforward look at the major qabalistic text from a traditional Jewish view of today, you can't go wrong with Kaplan"},{"rating":"1","title":"A list of boxers","review":"this book tells of 11 current boxers starting with mike tyson and ending with Oscar De La Hoya. The articles are good but in some parts of the articles the facts get confusing. The real problem is in the appendix, it shows fight files, records, but there are many mistakes and many cut offs, they dont finish something after they start it, the facts in the book are not exactly the same as the appendix's. So overall this book is not good at all and a discrase to something called EDITING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A superb performance of Rachmaninov's finest music.","review":"As much as I love the piano concertos, the Paganini Variations and the solo piano music, Rachmaninov's Symphonic Dances are my favorite of all his works. In their lushness, drama and variety, they showcase Rachmaninov's genius as a melodist and orchestrator like nothing else in his oeuvre. He truly makes the orchestra dance! The 1992 recording of the Symphonic Dances by Charles Dutoit and the Philadelphia Orchestra is as fine as any I know, and you also get an excellent performance of the Symphony No. 3 on the same disc. This is music to stir your blood and excite your imagination on a cold winter day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in variety","review":"I have to firmly disagree with the reviewer below. As a fan of Justice, Vitalic and others in the French Electro scene I had high hopes for this album. However, after listening each song on this album they comes through as more of the same. The style and effects used on each track seems almost recycled song after song. The album does not scream variety to say the least. There doesn't seem like there is a broad creative expression, instead almost a French stubbornness.Another thing that bugs me is that a lot of it sounds like reworked Boys Noize tracks rather than having a distinct flair of originality.Honestly, I would recommend the following five albums over this one any day:Justice - CrossVitalic - FlashmobDaft Punk - DiscoveryYuksek - Away From The SeaBloody Beetroots - Rombarama"},{"rating":"2","title":"I passed my test the first time!","review":"I got this book on the 20th of December and my test was on the 31st which was this past Monday.

There will always be the jokes on the show about their past, talking about things that happened in long-ago seasons and you have absolutely no idea what they are talking about. Well, I bought this book to catch up on what happened in those not so long forgotten days and I found everything I needed. This book gives you all the info on Sunnydale, the hotspots, demons, vamps, witches and pretty much anything that goes \\"bump\\" in the night. They have actor interviews and behind the scenes photos which include make up and costume putting on. Now, I know everything a fan needs to know and more and I've actually read the whole book three times (just in case i missed something) and i always find new things. It's really great, and if you're a fan, it's a MUST GET!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"When I first saw this book I knew I liked it; the attractive cover the glossy pages and the realistic looking pictures.

The only problem was once the 2nd series was over it seemed mostly useless but the interviews and quotes are still magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Brilliant","review":"This book has everything you could possibly need to know about the show in general, the stars (even some of the guest stars), episodes in seasons 1 & 2, and anything else you can think of.

The episode guide had some great \\"behind the scenes\\", \\"did you know\\" type of tidbits, and the Behind the Scenes section of the book is more than worth the purchase price alone. However, I did not like the abundance of quotes, especially when the same quotes get repeated over and over again. The folklore section of the book was extremely dry even though I usually like to learn about that stuff. I didn't think I would ever get through it. Also, there were many errors and misquotes in the book. All in all, I feel that it is the best Buffy book yet. Next time, I just hope they cut down on the quotes and proof read the draft better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right along with the stake and holy water...","review":"An excellent companion to the hit WB television show.

It was nice having this book cause I could find out what was in the episodes I missed and it helped me keep up with the plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"useful at times, but overall boring to read","review":"The most useful part of this book is the multitude of quotes supplied for every character, theme, and episode. The book is also peppered with interesting sidebars containing trivia, the show's famously funny stage directions, and Buffyverse info only noticeable through multiple watchings. Yet the character descriptions, intro to Buffy mythology, bios, and other text-heavy parts of the book are deadened by a juvenile style of writing that lacks color yet overdoses on complimentary language. If you are considering buying this book, you probably already know how great \\"Buffy\\" is and how clever Whedon is, and don't need to be convinced. The general gushiness, which is tempered and balanced by serious character and plot review in other books, is dull when supported only by lengthy, boring recaps. My suggestion: buy it used, because it's not worth the list price or Amazon's price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a fan of the show, you need the book.","review":"I missed the series as it was originally broadcast on the WB, had to wait and see reruns on FX, I've liked it from the start but always wanted to know more about what was going on. This book gives you a lot of information on each episode including background stuff and character quotes. You'll need it to really understand what's going on sometimes. I've got this book and the one for seasons 3/4, any fan should have them, there's just so much here it can be slow to wade through but worthwhile anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable Companion to the Hit Show","review":"This book is excellent for people who have just began to watch the show. It fills them in on the beginning of the show. The best part of the book is the quotes from the show they are the most enjoyable to read. The only problem is that they probably should have waited another season before writing this book since the third season has been filled with tons of surprises"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"This is a great book about Buffy the Vampire Slayer. There's lots of info, funny quotes, interviews, pictures, etc. There is a great episode guide comprising of portions of scripts cut from that episode, what weapons Buffy uses in that episode, pop culture IQ and more. Lots of info on the mythology and monsters also. And if you're a romance fan like myself, you'll love reading the romance section. This book is awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book, even if you're not a rabid fan","review":"Generally, I find books like this to be a little tedious. But, this book (while I sometimes felt that I heard much of this before in interviews with Sarah Michelle Gellar and David Boreanaz especially) was great. Lots of cool little tid-bits, like quotes that were edited out of the episodes and bios of not-the-5-main-characters like Principal Synder, Kendra, Oz, Spike and Dru. Much of the book was amusing and I loved reading it (and re-reading many parts of it). I passed it around to friends who also devoured it. Whether you are a sort-of fan or a rabid one, if you like Buffy at all, this is worth reading.

It is mostly descriptions of characters and a synopsis of each episode.

Hilton has an amazing ability to recognise talent before it happens and he certainly has done so here. The author has managed to find some unpublished photos of this driver and it is enjoyable not to see the same old pictures that everyone else uses!I enjoyed the historical aspects and HHF's rise to glory, however I would have liked more 'in depth' dialogue with the racer himself: His thoughts on winning his first race, his thoughts on his team-mate's horrific accident at Monaco in 1994 and his stormy year with Williams. Perhaps as Frentzen's star rises Hilton will write a sequel and once more we will enjoy his easy, sometimes witty, thoroughly factual style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring","review":"Mr. Hilton should stop to write cheap bigraphies about any racing drivers and focus only in real sucessful drivers, like he did with Ayrton Senna and Jacques Villeneuve. \\" Fast track to Glory\\"?

What I don't think is that he's destined with a \\"fast track to glory\\"... He's just an average driver, like the rest of them all in F-1 nowadays, ( with the exception of Schumacher ).

It also has a cap, which means you don't need to flip the razor around to store it safely; you can just cap it. The convenience is nice if you use it a lot.Overall, I'd recommend this one if you need a small scraper for tight spaces or if you just don't plan to use it that often.

'Timeless' will make you love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caroline Lavelle - unsung star?","review":"I have reviewed her album Spirit and the same comments apply here. She has a wonderful voice and is a classically trained cellist. Her voice is a mix of Mary Hopkin and Joan Baez with that plaintiff and folksy quality that is both soothing and engaging. Well worth a listen if you like eclectic music with a folksy/modern overtone. I first heard her on an album called The Dawnseeker by Sleepthief in a track called Nightjar.

It seems as though Steve Callaghan is just trying to get rich from putting the \\"Family Guy\\" stamp on this book. Many of the jokes are rehashed from episodes of seasons 1-3. And instead of using this book as an opportunity for fresh new visual gags, there are simply just pictures from various episodes with maybe a few photoshopped words added to them. In the end, I gave it 2 stars becasue there are a few good one liners, but I think that it is \\"Stewie's\\" voice that really makes lines like those work and you really can't get that from a book.

I think this expansion pack is even better than the actual original game, although you only get 5 missions per side (USA, China and GLA) as well as the skirmish setting you get another feature called Generals Challenge. This effectively gives you another 49 missions as you pit your wits against 7 other generals and their specialised weaponry. The weapons within these missions are pretty hi-tech.Overall this game is excellent, i only gave it 4 stars though as it requires a 1GHZ chip speed to play it, this slows down play on my 867 powerbook, and i'm sure a lot of people who want to play this will have the same problem.

Make sure you buy the book with the cd; hearing how the tunes are played will help you to learn a lot better then the book alone. This is the best instruction book I have every seen. Clear, concise and never overwelming. You will not only love to play the whistle, but love learning to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Lessons","review":"I really enjoyed all of the tunes in this book. It helped that I could read music to begin. The process of reading music is explained briefly and not until after you've already played a few songs, but the CD would definitely help anyone who was learning to read the notes on the staff for the first time. I don't think this would be a stumbling block or a reason not to get it- just something to be aware of. One thing I really liked was that there are short histories and backgrounds on the style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I choose five stars because I ordered the book on Monday and on Wednesday I received it. I don't have the whistle yet it is still on it's way but I listened to the CD and looked through the book and it looks easy to follow. The CD will really help since each song is played on the CD so if you don't know how it sounds just pop the CD in! I can't wait to use it and I would say anyone who is interested in learning the penny whistle should get this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very Helpful","review":"I bought this to go with the two whistles I received for Christmas this year. What a blessing. It has helped refresh my memory concerning note reading and helped immensely with using the whistle on tunes I love(That's an Irish Lullaby, Amazing Grace, The Parting Glass, etc . . .) Great purchase and well worth the money. The CD is helpful and the book includes 10 lessons covering everything from how to place your fingers to playing the complete scale and with plenty of music included to help you along. Highly recommend this for anyone who wants to learn how to play!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely music, great instruction","review":"I bought this book and CD to help me improve my playing. I haven't had time yet to listen to the CD, but I have looked through the book and it seems very good. I know that the whistle is, by nature, a rather piercing sound. My cats leave the room when I practice. Hopefully, the music will soon be finer with the help of this book and CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deluxe Without CD","review":"This is the same book as the Deluxe Addition, but without the CD. If you can live without the CD this is a great deal for a book that has a ton of great reviews. It's written for the key of D. The book is great. The lessons are set up in such a way that if you know nothing about music this will get you off the ground, and if you can read music you can dive into a new instrument, or even if you're not new to the tin\\\\penny whistle it's still a great little songbook. On top of everything else the book has all these adorable old-style pictures that set you right into a folksy mood.Mine arrived in two days in good condition. Mostly I'm writing this review because this great bargain didn't have one yet. For more thorough reviews just check out the Deluxe Edition page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Cons: from a totally non-music person, I am still struggling with the basics. Would have liked more information on holding, playing and other beginner level things.Pros: love the CD so you can hear what you are trying to play and history of whistle."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for beginners","review":"If you would like to learn how to play the tin Whistle, use this book! I have other books on playing the tin whistle - even from Ireland, and none compare with this approach. It teaches in a logical manner and even more advanced players may learn a thing or two. Having a solid foundation is so important to learning anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to learn a lovely instrument!","review":"I've listened to lots of Irish music, and have always loved the sound of the tin whistle, although I thought it would be too complicated for me to play. This great combo of tape/instruction book demystifies the process, and within a short amount of time one can play lovely pieces. Having the tape really helps to focus the player on the music. Recommend for the beginner and intermediate to advanced players as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Florence Foster Jenkins of Marxist-Leninism","review":"Proof (if any were needed) that high tessituras and hardline Stalinism can make for a fruitful cocktail. Comrade Kim Jong Il, the Dear Leader , is not only the rightfully crowned King of Socialism but also a formidable opera queen in his own right. The chapter \\"Charlotte Church: Crossover as the Dialectical Logic of Late Capitalism, or Just Some Cocky Welsh Teenybopper? \\" is worth the price of admission alone. The best work of its kind since Pol Pot's \\"Maria Callas: The Bel Canto Years\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't pass","review":"Everyone says the MPRE is a blow-off exam and that you can ace it without studying. I wanted to increase my chance of passing by studying, so I bought this book based on the outstanding reviews here. I followed the instructions, watched the DVD and took all 3 practice exams, which I scored very high on. All in all I spent about 10-15 hours studying using only this book. I was confident going into the exam. However, scores came in yesterday and I fell well below the needed score for my jurisdiction.I'm not sure I'd recommend this book to someone else. A book on MPRE test-taking strategy would have been more helpful and likely prevented me from having to take the November exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"No pass, no good","review":"Failing the MPRE won't end your life or hurt your pride, but it is REALLY ANNOYING.All you need to do with the MPRE is pass. That said, if you'd rather not study for... wake up for... and lose a Saturday for the MPRE *twice*, I highly recommend another method of review.This book does not reduce the chance of failure *quite* enough in New York (pass = 85). The DVD lecture is dull, and I didn't find the practice questions predictive of success on the MPRE.After reviewing with Supreme Bar Review the week before the November '07 MPRE, I got an 82. You MAY pass with Supreme, but the chance of NOT passing is still high enough that I don't recommend it. 2 of my friends also used Supreme: one is at the top of our class and passed by a few points, and the other failed by several points.I took the free Pieper class before the March '08 MPRE, read over the notes several times and took 2 practice exams. I passed by a landslide."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than enough to pass the MPRE","review":"I bought this book the week before the November 2007 MPRE and studied from it two days before the exam, completing all the practice questions. I probably put in no more than 15 hours of studying total.Like many others, I doubted this book's value when I came out of the exam thinking that I didn't do very well and may even have failed. Folks who prepped with BarBri felt the same way. Well, today MPRE scores came out and I got a 137--far, far above the score of 85 I needed for my jurisdiction.Clearly, this book worked. I can't recommend it more highly. Buy it, study from it, and ignore any bad feelings you have after the MPRE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Outline - But Damaged DVD","review":"The written materials in this book were adequate for the task of giving the reader a summary preparation for the MPRE. However, the accompanying DVD, which forms much of the the basis for using the written materials, was damaged, and mostly inoperable.I began studying for the test two weeks prior to the exam. I spent the first week reading and studying the materials, and by the time I discovered the problem with the DVD, it was too late to order a replacement. I should have watched the DVD all the way through when I first got it in the mail.If you're going to use this book, I suggest you check the quality of the DVD as soon as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else","review":"The outline is adequate BUT the real value are the explained answers to the questions. If you want to learn the material - find a better study aid - this is a Band Aid."},{"rating":"1","title":"inadequate","review":"I used this book as a primary study guide and took the MPRE a few days ago. Following the exam, it was clear that this book was an inadequate source. The outline/review of the model rules was poorly written and disorganized; and rules that were critical to answer choices on the exam were not covered in the outline. I recommend finding a more comprehensive source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, out of date, and misleading","review":"This product contains questions from earlier MPREs that do not reflect the current state of the exam. Do not purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a helpful review.","review":"I used this book and the DVD and I got a 72 on the MPRE, which was not high enough to pass. I felt that the material was just a quick overview, and didn't really teach me anything useful. I later took the 4 hour BarBri class before re-taking the MPRE, and my score jumped to 116. So, I would have to say that this course was not helpful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Not Very Good","review":"I didn't take the MPRE too seriously, but picking this book was a big mistake. The outline skips over a lot and the DVD does not prepare you for the most difficult questions on the exam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets the job done","review":"Yes, the DVD consists of a professor reading the rules to you. It's not exciting, but it gets the job done. I took the MPRE and passed the first time without having taken Professional Responsibility. I did this program along with the Barbri review. The problems in the back of the book are taken from past exams, and the explanations of the answers are very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos!","review":"The book is full of typos. What does Professor Lazarus say to students who submit papers with this many typos (missing parenthesis, misspellings, wrong words, bad spacing)? The content of the book seems adequate. The DVD is horrifically boring (the Professor reads from a paper on his podium - couldn't they spring for a teleprompter?). For the price - this will do the trick, but don't expect a very polished product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"I bought this hoping to improve upon my previous score. I was hesitant about the stiff cost, but, mostly based on the other reviews, I took the dive and purchased this practice book.What a waste.The most egregious sin is packaging freely available test questions. The questions, and more importantly, the explanations, are available on the official NCBE website. Moreover, many of the questions between the two practice sections were duplicates. I can't speak to the 40 page outline, but it seemed harmless enough.In short, you can freely and legally download 80% of the contents of this book.Save your money, and order past tests from the MPRE website."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I have bought many things off of Amazon and never have felt the need to write a review. Supreme Bar Review should be \\"subject to discipline\\" for actually charging money for this product and touting it as a sufficient study aid for the MPRE. I strongly recommend that this book SHOULD NOT be purchased.I bought this to help prepare to take the MPRE for the second time because I am planning to take the bar in another jurisdiction and my prior MPRE score has expired.The outline is completely inadequate and vague.The \\"web lecture\\" is available for free on YouTube and the lecturer basically reads off of the outline verbatim.Most of the book consists of practice questions and a practice test, which are essentially a reprint of the materials available on the NCBE website.Most of the pages came off the binding while I was doing the practice questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled and go on the cheap!","review":"I bought this product because I wanted to go cheap and didn't give the proper credit the MPRE deserves and got a scaled score of 73. This material is outdated and does not reflect the type of questions you will get on the MPRE. I did all the review, watched the 4 hours of lecture and it made little difference. I will be retaking it, but urge you to use a different set of materials, I know I will. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Old","review":"This version of the book was written in the 80s. Don't bother buying it, much of the information is out of date."},{"rating":"1","title":"With a voice like SPEDDINGS, you need the guitar to do the talking","review":"Unfortunately that does not happen on this cd. Some of the lamest covers of blues classics with one of the most horrible voices in music. Not one redeeming feature. I thought maybe a cool solo here and there and it would be listenable. Well there aren't any on this cd. It is as if he has also forgotten how to play the guitar, or this effort was phoned in from a stoned day in the west indies. The old chestnut ALBATROSS is the best track ( that should give you some idea ).There are really no others that are worth mentioning, so i won't.Save your money. This one is not worth it.

No software installation required, plugging into the USB port worked flawlessly on OSX.Within 45 minutes I had composed my first little ditty in GarageBand.

Those things must be huge.While large, it is very light and will easily sit in your lap as long as the chair has no arms.My only gripe is that the keys make a clunking sound at full stroke so if you are playing it while wearing headphones to not bother others, you will bother them with the banging sound the keys make bottoming out."},{"rating":"1","title":"XP doesn't always recognize, materials are CARCINOGENIC","review":"Thankfully another reviewer brought to my attention the fact that this M-Audio keyboard is made of chemicals including lead that can cause cancer. You are actually advised to *wash your hands* after handling. Will you find the warning displayed on the box? Nope, it is at the bottom of the last page of the manual. Nice.Add to this the problem I have with Windows XP recognizing this keyboard (have to really work at it) and this is a total piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIDI controller generates error with MC-303 sequencer","review":"I bought one of these to control my Roland MC-303 sequencer. It generates a \\"err 02\\" after pressing a few keys. Will not make music for more then a few seconds. Tried another one at a local music store and a both a keystaion 61es and 49e, both had the same problem. In talking with the salesman he said that other customers have reported simular problems, sound dropping, error codes with a variety of equipment. It seems that it works really well via USB to a computer but there are many issues with the MIDI out. I they tried a Radium 49 and it worked like a charm. From what I hear the Radium series is made by another manufacturer and is totally different.Bottom line, if your not going to use the MIDI out it would probably work great, it also may work well with some equipment. Just would not work for more then a few seconds or notes with the Roland MC-303.Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivers Are Terrible","review":"Where do I even begin with this? I received it in the mail after reading fairly good reviews, and then tried to install it. Many hours later, after closely following the instruction manual and downloading \\"new\\" drivers from the m-audio website, I finally installed it on my XP machine. The drivers are not certified, whatever that means, but even m-audio recognizes that. I had to install it several times before it \\"took\\" and eventually worked. I had fun for a few weeks using this keyboard with Fruityloops, until one day it simply stopped working. My main XP box, my laptop and a friend's computer would not recognize the keyboard, even though I went through the same steps over and over again trying to install it. The LEDs work, so it's getting power, I just don't know what to do with this thing. Now it's sitting in a box in my closet. I don't recommend this product if you value decent, working drivers. And the warranty sucks too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funky & Fun","review":"This release is for those rebellious jazz fans out the who like it on the edge. The edge of fun that is. This is a funky, hip-hoppy, sometimes real instruments -sometimes not, groovy experience. While there are various excursions, experiments, and flavors on this disc, I think the best cuts are the funky pieces: \\"Beatnik,\\" \\"You Dig,\\" \\"Crazy Man,\\" and \\"Here We Go\\" are my favorites. Bob Ward is a George Bensonish guitar player and adds nice touches usuing only real guitars. Larry Goldings does a great job with all the keyboards. I usually detest any music with synths and other phony instruments, but somehow these guys make them work here. Some might consider this background music and maybe it is, but it'll definitely get your toes-a-tappin'. Great for a summer night, in the hot tub with your favorite person sipping on a nice cold beverage. Nothing heavy, just plain old fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun jazz CD","review":"I heard a song from these guys on Sirius. I've found other groups this way and was sometimes very disappointed because that was the only good song on the CD. However, I wasn't disappointed with Voodoo Dogs. It's a light and up CD. Everytime I put it on I think \\"oh, why don't I play this more often!\\" Don't look for anything complex on this, it's just fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Theroux's novels to date","review":"This is the Theroux novel I have waited years for. The reader shares his frustration at being appreciated primarily as a travel writer, a role more documentarian than creative. Thinly-veiled characters and places add intrigue to the storyline, but the main attraction in this novel is Theroux's keen powers of observation and his candid commentary on the places and characters he encounters therein. The first segment of the book, the drug trip, becomes frustrating and tiresome, just as the trip is to the characters. Then it takes off to places we've all wanted to go, but were afraid to do more than hover at the edge of. Theroux has proven himself as a master of the novel and he has improved with age, a concept and inevitable outcome that he will always be at loggerheads with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Paul Theroux ever?","review":"I too have been a fan of Theroux for a long time. This book, however, was a major disappointment. Another reviewer had it right when they said it was a poorly written porno novel. No thank you, and his depiction of the doctor character, even though she does deal him a bit of his own \\"medicine\\" at the end, is flat and misogynistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new Blindness giving A new Vision ,","review":"The story is simple,inducing temporary blindness might give you anotherplane of Vision- accepting that blind persons have augmentation of other sensory perceptions- this temporary blindness might give new 'light'and a new vision for ourselves,present,past and future?His prose is as usual scintillating,and the flashbacks to earlierlife show human sexuality at times beyond imagination.In fact its so uncannily well done I fear Mr Theroux must be an extraordinarily experienced lover,I was a bit envious of the main character, but as a mix of fantasy and reality this made a remarkablenovel, novel.So thats my personal opinion, Theroux is a brilliant writer,and this is not a travel bookBut beware,do NOT read if you have prudish tastes or dislike fantasy as part of normal healthy human behaviour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Form Mimics Content","review":"This is the first time I've read fiction written by Theroux, and it will be my last. The writing is as bad as one imagines that of the protagonist must be. Indeed, there is no discernible difference when the character's writing is revealed to the reader. Self-indulgent, uninspired, maybe the mist of writer's block, this manuscript should have remained in the desk drawer. Hopefully, it was an exercise in preparation for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"fatally flawed from the outset","review":"I've only just picked up BLINDING LIGHT so am conscious I have little original to say buT I am squarely with those who think that Theroux must have been competing for the annual bad sex award. The descriptions are embrassingly absurd but, more important, unnecessary. After 50 pages I had had enough of it and was struck by the absence of any likeable characters. This was my first Theroux novel and I can't belive his reputation is built on stuff like this .. \\"blinding light\\", hardly the most creative pun given the plot's predictable development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for Theroux Fiction","review":"I am a great fan of Theroux's travel books, as his journey and perspective is always amusing, educational, smart, and insightful. His fiction, however, can be overly self-absorbed, constricted, and sometimes just plain dull.This one is slightly better than that -- he seems to have taken time to actually write a whole novel, as opposed to a good idea written poorly. Here, both the idea of the book is great, a stalled writer opened by taking a mind-altering drug, then blinded and redeemed by the visions unleashed, but the execution is also interesting and the pacing strong. Miles above his last Hawaii book, this one has interesting interludes with Clinton, copious sex, and lots of drug use and abuse. Right up my alley! Seriously, though, if you have given up on Theroux's fiction, you may want to reconsider and give it a try. There's plenty of the good Theroux lurking in this book, and it was a pleasure to read and enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Porno Novels--Please!","review":"OK Paul, now you've written a dirty book. Please don't do it again. I slogged through it because even when you're bad, you're a good writer, and I've read just about everything you've published. But the weird premise, the unlikely plot, the baroque, excruciating sex scenes, the pretension of name dropping the rich and famous (and the pretension of not name dropping the most famous), the unlikeability of any of the characters--it was pretty awful. The endless scenes with Steadman rattling around in his drug-induced blind horniness got old real fast.There was some good stuff, which others have talked about, so it wasn't a total waste. But at your age, writing so graphically about sex labels you as a dirty old man. You don't want to end up in that category, do you? You can do better than a Henry Miller ripoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible disappointment","review":"Easily the worst book Theroux has ever written. The story telling and prose is OK, but the plot, such as it is, is absurd, the super graphic sex unnecessary, the metaphors far-fetched, the smug disguised egocentrism is painful, the imagining limited and creaky. I've loved Theroux for many years and labored through 2/3 of the book out of respect. But what a monumental failure! Interesting only to see how a great writer can be so wrong about himself, but why did a publisher buy this? is obviously they knew PT's fans would expect more and pay anything for the promise. Pray for the regeneration of Theroux's skills and literary soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!","review":"What an overextended bad plot proposal. Some cheap shots, e.g., listing famous names at a party, i.e., Bill Clinton! (He did this with Jack Kennedy in Hotel Honolulu.) Don't go here if you want to know about yage; nothing new. A cultivar of a common species of Amazonian Datura. Or not. You never know. An excellent example of the decline of the competence of editors. Skip this one. It never delivers. Oh, yes, a \\"Happy Ending\\". When did a real life drug addiction ever have that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete misrepresentation of Datura","review":"This book is full of romaticized reefer madness style clichés about 'drug use' that conflate opiates and psychedelics. Why does Theroux use the name 'datura' for his fictional drug? Datura, an actual psychoactive plant, doesn't cause blindness, isn't addictive, and definitely does not turn people into telepathic sex fiends. It is however fairly dangerous and generally considered unpleasant, see http://www.erowid.org/plants/datura/datura.shtml"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine started leaking almost immediately","review":"Unless it's in a place totally protected from the wind, you'll find serious leakage.

I can't believe that I almost didn't buy it because of some of the reviews here. I guess it's not for everyone. People have their own tastes. However, if you love the range of Mullins' voice and acoustic guitar, I think you'll really like this album. I especially like Alaska and Faith. It feels like an eclectic mix of stuff with some Celtic and maybe a bit of gospel influence. I think its variety is one of its strengths, contrary to what some others have said. Sample it and then buy it if you like good acoustic and music with heart and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Album-","review":"I have never written a review before, but I saw that this one wasn't 5-stars and I just couldn't let it slide. This cd has all the acoustic sense of Big Blue Sky and the mature production sensibility of the last two albums. I was worried when Soul's Core first came out that Shawn's music would loose it's raw power in the more polished production. Boy was I wrong; he just keeps getting better and better. This album is more acoustic than the last two, but to say it has no emotional depth is crazy. There is not a \\"B\\" song on the whole thing. He achieves more depth of charater and varied textures with his voice than 99% of the acts out there get with their whole bands.On top of that, I was lucky enough to meet him at Eddie's Attic a few months ago and there is not a more gracious, more down to earth artist anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shawn's roots are showing","review":"Yes Shawn's roots are showing, they are showing that he has a touch of alt-country in his roots. These songs are all very good. Beautiful Wreck is an up tempo rocker. Blue As You is a great easy listening song. Cold Black Heart is a roots/blues cut that is just great. Every song is very good. His cover of House of the Rising Sun is very cool. This cd was produced by Shawn Mullins. He knows what he is good at and this cd is it. Keep up the good work Mr. Mullins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got it for free on a promo and would have paid for it had I known how good it was!","review":"I hadn't heard of Mullins before the CD was offered as a free promo. I picked the CD because the title intrigued me. I put the CD in my computer to rip it to my iTunes and was surprised at how much I enjoyed the music. It's a bluesy mix of country and pop. So far, \\"Beautiful Wreck\\" is my pick of the bunch, but I'll certainly be listening to the CD more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better In Concert","review":"We recently saw Shawn Mullins in concert and of all concerts I've been to, this one blew my mind. He is an amazingly talented performer and musician and one of the few these days who sounds better in person than recorded. This CD is great and is one of those that grows on you the more you listen to it. The tracks are ecclectic, as some reviewers note, but they show a range of talent and aren't just fillers. In the age of itunes, I rarely like a CD enough to buy ALL the songs, but this was an exception to the rule."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed","review":"I agree with the first reviewer.

Any possible conflict between characters or threat to them is resolved so quickly that the reader doesn't even have a chance to start wondering about it. While I enjoy a book that has some quiet moments and introspection, \\"Owlknight\\" is almost all quiet moments and introspection, which makes it very dull.\\"Owlknight\\" is definitely below Lackey's usual standards. She knows how to make a book interesting and have a good balance between action and introspection. One wonders what happened with \\"Owlknight.\\"The first book in the series, \\"Owlflight,\\" was quite good. The second, \\"Owlsight,\\" was somewhat lacking in action, but sometimes that happens in the middle of a trilogy. However, one expects the third book to have a rousing climax, not limp along from one pat solution to another, as \\"Owlknight\\" did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I LOVE Lackey... BUT....","review":"I have to agree with the majority here... I always quote Lackey as my favorite author, but I agree that her latest works just aren't nearly up to par with her earlier works. It's so sad because I used to be in her fan club as a teenager (Queen's Own) and used to tell everyone I knew how wonderful her books are. Last Herald Mage, Arrows of the Queen.... best books EVER WRITTEN in my opinion. I'll continue to read and buy her books, but I just hope, Ms. Lackey, if you're reading this, that maybe you'll take some time off from writing if this is what the demands are doing to you; you need a break and then maybe you can come back to your writing with the care for the characters and their relationships that you showed in your first novels. Because in this series, these characters are far too two-dimensional and non-sympathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Lazy","review":"I agree with many of the reviews of this book that I've read here. The Owl series is certainly Mercedes Lackey's weakest, and I think I've read just about all her books. I don't understand why her editors haven't sent these manuscripts back with a suggestion to cut out 200 of the first 400 pages and add a plot. Possibly they think that we will all keep buying her books no matter what she throws together - and I probably will. But I keep hoping to find a plot, or at least a new idea, and the Owl series has been one disappointment after another. At least her writing still flows and still spreads a feeling of peace over the world ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second review, hope this one get's posted.....","review":"First off, if you want to know what i think of this book, read my other review. this one is a message to all who insulted this book.

That includes nearly all of the ones in paperback. Sometimes I get a hardcover version from the library and buy the paperback later, when it comes out. I have read all of the Lackey books I own at least twice. While some may not be as good as others, I consider them all worth reading and buying. My adult daughter, Margo, likes them too.The reader who decided to boycott future books because he or she didn't like Owlknight, will miss a lot of good reading. It would be better to check them out at the library and buy those you like (for rereading etc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"owlknight","review":"Owlknight is the 3rd book i have read by Mercedes Lackey and it is one of those books you aren't able to put down until you finish the last page."},{"rating":"2","title":"owl knight","review":"The book is a little slow at the beginning, but you must learn the players in the story and their background. After that it takes off and holds your attention. The entire trilogy was entertaining and worth reading"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was nice but unsatisfying","review":"I liked the book, but it was rather shallow. There wasn't really any character development,and all of the personalities are quite linear. The plot had really no excitement. The author could've gotten into detail about a lot more things in the book, like Keisha and Darian's relationship, but everything seemed to be glossed over. The book was nice, but bland. Frankly I enjoyed the earlier books like the Mage Winds trilogy a lot more than this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I agree with some of the other reviews here but would also like to add the the story was quite disjointed. The first half of the book focuses primarily on the Hearld and Shandie's assignment to the area. This is such a primary focus that you are completely surprised when the main character suddenly decides to go find his parents. So the last half of the book is about a personal quest for family, the first half about politics and clash of culture. I was disappointed and wondered if Ms. Lackey was in a hurry to finish the book for publication. I also thought the timing of the book was off, the second volume ended with the main character getting his owl and by Owlknight he is a full adult. I feel like we missed a lot of adventures and growth for this character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh how the mighty have fallen..","review":"I waited with bated breath for her newest novel to come out. What a let down in all areas. Have the two switched rolls??? Is Ms. Lackey doing the pictures and Mr. Dixon writing the book? That seems like the most likely occurance....the plot was non-existant, and the pictures were lousy. Nothing in the book was up to what I thought of as their normal standards. UGH!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hmmm...Can't Complain, but.....","review":"Mercedes Lackey is a professional writer, and if anyone thinks they can do better, give me a call, and let me read your stuff, but still I do agree that this book wasn't equal to her earlier books. The plot was plausible, and the characters stable, but the end was a little too convient and quick. It left me feeling incomplete and wondering about \\"What happens next?\\" In the course of her books, Ms Lackey has led us to believe that the Mage-Gift is hiereditary. if this is true, did Darian's parents have the Gift? More importantly, did his new siblings? Will the ley lines ever grow enough power for him to become an Adept? You want to know what happens in the future. It leaves you with questions, and I hope Ms. Lackey will explore it a little deeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read them all!","review":"I don't think I can quite put my love for these books into words.

Thank you for warding me away from Knight. I posess the first 2, but will save my money for when Ms. Lackey returns to her former writing glory of the Arrows, Mage and Mage Storm series. As a former member of the fan club, my Herald persona longs for those days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Musicians - Terrible Recordng","review":"I was severely disappointed by this album.

Apparently about 30 times or so to make sure we get the fact she's not a babe. Fine. She's plain. Move on.When I find myself talking to the heroine, telling her to get a backbone, it's always a bad sign. Jane is brave on occasion, but is an utter doormat and victim when dealing with her father, another person who reminds us Jane isn't pretty. Her willingness to be abused by every man in her life made me a little sick.And, the sad attempts at humor by changing cliches and sayings into vampiric mottos got tiring very quickly.The book had a great premise, but a good editor would have made a huge difference in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Case Of Trying Too Hard","review":"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the \\"The Remarkable Miss Frankenstein,\\" I can not say the same for \\"The Reluctant Miss Van Helsing.\\" Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't a romance novel contain some romance. Asher's constant lascivious thoughts about Jane made me feel dirty given his obvious contempt for her. It is unfortunate that the author felt the need to beat the reader over the head with Jane's lack of external beauty as if we are too stupid to grasp the simple concept. Did that fact truly need to be reiterated 5 or 6 times in each chapter by everyone she came in contact with. We get it; she's not beautiful, and she's not considered worthy to be with Asher nor is she considered worthy to be a Van Helsing. Also, the author seemed overly concerned with getting laughs that quickly became extremely irritating. I mostly just felt very sad for Jane's part in a verbally abusive life."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does one fall in love with a jerk?","review":"Regardless of the paranormal/comedic premise, this is first and foremost supposed to be a romance. I just don't understand how the heroine fell in love with the hero since he repeatedly tells her how much better he can do than her and how ugly she is. The book's popular-at-the-moment sub-genre notwithstanding, it's old-school in that the hero doesn't show the heroine much affection or respect until the very end of the story when (of course) she's in danger. That's not original, it's just an old, worn-out plot device that most contemporary romance authors and editors (thankfully) eschew."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reluctant to read","review":"This book reminded me of the Cheshire cat, it is laughing so hard at its own jokes that it disappears without a trace.

Given a new chance to prove herself in nabbling the Earl of Wolverton, she lands herself in fresh pickles and prat falls. The tale follows a steady course, poking fun at both Regency and vampire tales.It just doesn't work, despite hitting the occasional humorous mark. This is not simply due to the woeful historical inaccuracies with which it bristles.No, a parody must actually be genuinely funny and not just telling you it's funny by hitting the reader over the head with gags and giggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book gives pop culture a blow to the mouth!!","review":"The author spends a great deal of the book's 342 pages attempting to impress the reader with her knowledge of pop culture and cramming as many references as possible in between the teensy bits of plot that the book contains. I get it! You've watched Buffy! You've seen Bela Lagusi movies! You know who Bram Stoker is! The cutesy references quickly become annoying distractions. Overall, the 342 page novel is a pleasant 75 - 100 page short story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like it, but...","review":"I just didn't. The constant puns and pop culture referneces were annoying by the fifth page. By the 300th page I had a headache from clenching my jaw. But the bigger sin, for me, was the utterly unlikeable \\"hero.\\" He was a flat-out b@&%!$d. He was insufferably arrogant and cruel to our Miss Van Helsing and had absolutely no redeeming qualities. He was described in great detail as breathtakingly handsome, but nothing makes up for his selfish nastiness.

The authors state that it is commonly thought that the women of Sodom and Gomorrah were having sex with male angels and that is why Jude mentions going after strange flesh. This is patently false and seeks to make the women the scapegoat for what happened at Sodom and Gomorrah, a complete reversal of the real truth. It is clear in the Bible that the judgment on Sodom and Gomorrah happened because ALL the MEN of Sodom and Gomorrah sought to violate male angels and there is no way a reasonable person could construe those passages to mean anything other than that.

Not one lousy image graces the inside of this book. For a book on XAML which lives and breath's graphics, this is a fatal flaw.2. Chapter 20 is obtuse enough to make you want to rip out your hair. The chapter is supposed to be about properties and attributes. So what does the chapter talk about for the first 20 pages or so? Some lousy XAML cruncher. Only the last page of the chapter has a useful summary, that really should have been at the beginning.3. It is long on tutorials code, and explaining the code, and short on explaining the principles that the chapters claim to talk about.4. He will go out of his way to show you (pages and pages) of odd and useless syntax, that does nothing but confuse and strain the patience of the reader.Don't buy this book.Petzold was good once, not anymore.He should retire to Florida and save us all some grief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails for lack of XAML","review":"The simple fact is that Peltzoid completely misses the point of XAML. He ignores it as if it was a toy, and not a technological breakthrough in the separation of UI and logic. Shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice cover, bad content","review":"The writer is a guru in the field of Winforms applications.The first part of the book is rather from this angle, the Second part discusses the markup (XAML). The book contains much code (C#), enumerations and is as a result, badly readable.It contains no information about the technique behind the WPF, essential for understanding the new generation of applications which you can make.If you want to learn the WPF I reccommend the book \\"Windows Presentation foundation Unleashed\\" of Adam Nathan. That one is filled with colours impressions and examples, very usefull working with markup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on windows based graphics","review":"I am still on chapter one, going through the book while coding the examples and learning from them.

It's really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Petzold failed on this one.You can only loose time reading it. the author clearly missed the concept here. Yes introducing XAML from the first chapters IS important and also important are images and graphics on a book like that (not to make you understand the concepts, that's not the reason of course). In a later book of Petzold about 3d graphics he starts immediately with xaml.Difficult to follow with unneccesary hardships. Sorry, cause otherwise Petzold is a great author and teached many things regarding MS's product line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Introduction to WPF","review":"This book provides a good overview of WPF. The author's writing style is concise and understandable. There are lots of code samples. Be aware that XAML is not introduced until chapter 19 (there are 31 chapters total). Code is used instead of markup for the first 18 chapters. Overall, I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best book on WPF","review":"This book was obviously rushed to market. While Charles' excellent writing style almost makes up for the lack of illustrations, organization and layout, it does fall short.I highly recommend Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed (WPF) (Unleashed) by Adam Nathan instead.

I did notice a negligible difference in the color of my teeth but nothing spectacular. The next time I went to the dentist I was told that I had three cavities! I take impeccable care of my teeth and was amazed that I would have so many cavities at one time. The only explanation that I could come up with was that the whitening strips had eaten away at the enamel of my teeth and left me with cavities. The whole experience was not worth it. To think, I paid more than $30 to have slightly whiter teeth and a bunch of cavities!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I tried them all","review":"I tried Rembrandt before, and their product worked but it wasn't very good. The best product I have tried is Crest Whitestrips Classic. I haven't tried the premium but it really does work. One thing to look out for though, is how you place the strips on your teeth.

Bad idea! These strips are so tin and narrow. They slide of your teeth if you move your jaw or tongue a little bit. If you have big teeth, these strips are not long enough to cover your teeth completely, especially bottom teeth. So they slide and ride up al the time. And this taste of peroxide along with sensitivity! I had none of these problems with Rembrandt before. They are pretty thick and stay on your teeth secure, no sensitivity and a great result in 7 days with 1 strip a day. So 14 strips only (7 upper, 7 bottom) instead of 56!"},{"rating":"1","title":"They were disgusting and very disappointing","review":"I found crest whitestrips to be very impractical and inconvenient. I used them on both upper and lower as directed. If I would swallow or move my mouth in any way, the strips would end up moving and bunching together. Most times, I would put them on my teeth before walking so they would have a chance to work properly and I could concentrate on not moving my mouth. After taking them off, there was a thick film left on my teeth that almost made me throw up. I would have to scrape it off and keep spitting out the rest. I did not see much of a difference in my teeth after fourteen days. Compared to the Colgate white strips, there is no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent as a gift but was not delivered","review":"This is a great book and I would love to have a copy on kindle and send it to friends as a gift.

In each chapter, Adam presents the most common and convincing arguments for both sides of an issue. Then he gives his conclusions and his personal stance on the issue.

Even though there is three rings I ordered my normal ring size and being they are skinny in width they fit my finger (I usually have to order a size larger for stack bands to account for the ring widths).Cons: The bands widths are skinny making it hard to notice the tri-color contrast.

We've read on-line there is a \\"capacitor\\" problem. Years ago they could be fixed, now repair just isn't worth what it would cost. I'm shopping for a new TV, and I'll say one thing, I will NEVER buy this brand again. 3 years ago I paid $997.00 right after the price dropped $300 or so. Now I will research brands and models more carefully, checking Consumer Reports and Amazon reviews. UPDATE 9/2010: The right or proper thing to do would have been for the company to recall all of them for free repair. Instead they will lose many many many customers loyal to the brand name. Oh well, in today's world of business they'll just begin making TV's under a new brand name.

Right now it literally takes me an hour and I know it sounds crazy but it is true. It is sad that I have spent over 900$ for something that lasted 2 years when my tube TV has lasted over 15 years. The power light blinks, and the screen flashes, and it turns itself off. push the power button and start all over again until I give up or have time to wait it out.

The picture would cut off, randomly, for 20 seconds to 2 minutes. I called Magnavox a few times, I was told to run updates which did not help (I just learned to deal with it). After about 14 months the delayed start, after pressing power, became longer (2-4 minuets). As always I downloaded updates, no help. By 19 months I had to press the power button and hold for several seconds then the power indicator light would come on and eventually the TV would come on. At 21 months the TV stopped working, would not come on at all. I called Magnavox and was told to take it to a repair shop.Twenty-one months too late I went online to research problems with the model/brand and most of the comments stated \\"Magnavox TVs typically only last 20-24 months\\".

Not only are they hard to find in stores now, but now that most people will be ordering them online they changed the sizing. Worse, if you order direct from K-Swiss they will take a return but will deduct $5.00 unless you do an exchange.

The problem is no one wants a curio table that's a gonna shed all over the place. So we'd fine sand the hair down to bristle length. Took us FOREVER to fine a sander with variable speed that went low enough so as not to pull the hairs out by the follicle. But this little beauty here did the trick.

They should be enemies, but are drawn together by something greater than blood, revenge, or politics. Fans of Morgan Llewlyn or Parke Godwin will find this very similiar to their writing.

You build a courthouse, a guard post, a torture guild, a punishment, and whenever the criminal has his bag out you click on the guard with the black staff then on the criminal then he will bring him to the dungeon to await his punishment.

I agree it is difficult in the beginning learning how the buildings work, Guard Post, Court House etc. Once you get use to it you will learn to love and really feel your people are working hard to make you proud.

The tripod was really flimsy and none to stable. If you lifted the tripod to move or adjust it the legs would fall apart. The grill is held in place by one thin chain that swings. If what ever you put on the grill has some weight to it like an 8 cup coffee pot and it is not on center the thing starts to tip.We mostly used it as a hanger for the lantern."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great cooking over fire pit","review":"Bought this because was going to vacation in WI northwoods.

The problem is that it has pointed ends to dig into the dirt and secure the unit. I wish it was just flat pieces. The more difficult part of the Tripod is that each leg breaks down to three pieces that stay togethter with bungy cord running inside the tubing. Whenever you try to move the unit, the peices break up. A real pain. I think I will just superglue them together since I don't want/need it to break down to carry. If you don't plan on using for backpack camping, I would advise full peice tripods without the sharp ends that aren't needed. Otherwise, you'll need to figure out how to tighten up the bungy cord so it stays together. Watchout for the tubes getting hot and wearing down the bungy string that touches part of the tubing or just from the high heat. It will work for you but it is a bit flimsy IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift idea","review":"This was purchased as a gift for a friends anniversary.

It was a historical fiction and he apparantly thought it was a true story. He didn't like it and blamed the pedestrian script, which (I must confess) I wrote. That's his perogative but there are no balancing references. The review could have mentioned the awards the movie won. (The pedestrian script by the way was nominated for a Cable Ace and was strongly reviewed in People, USA Today, the LATIMES, Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. I strongly suspect that Mr. Matlin didn't actually watch the movie. He just didn't like the subject matter.

Otherwise, this is a handy little tool for the film enthusiast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maltin is very pretentious!","review":"He hardly like's any movie he sees. He puts them all under a microscope and if there's a flaw he attacks it. He's not reasonable, not by any means. There are critics that go to see movies and enjoy them more than Maltin does. Why, you might ask? - Because they are more reasonable than he is. I don't enjoy reading his reviews on Amazon anymore. Because they all seem to be negative. He never praises a film without harshly scrutinizing it first. He's a very UNREASONABLE critic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics are Meatballs","review":"Leonard Maltin is clueless, as is almost all film critics. Critics like Maltin were nerds that never had a date because they were too busy stuffing their opinion at people. In his observation of Meatballs, he can't even use his own words.

Being human, he has biases. His previous books and programs have focused on Disney, The Little Rascals, The Three Stooges, etc... . So look how he rates \\"Looking for Mr. Goodbar\\" -- 1 1/2 stars!!! Or \\"Salvador\\" -- 2 1/2 stars because: \\"It takes time to grab hold because the lead characters are such incredible sleezeballs.\\" -- Then look at his review for the unwatchably bad \\"Streets of Fire,\\" 3 stars, because of it's \\"refusal to take itself seriously.\\" Yeah, it's pure garbage, and Lenny says it's as good as \\"Children of a Lesser God,\\" -- \\"Waterdance,\\" -- \\"The Player,\\" or \\"Streamers,\\" all of which also received 3 stars. Lenny's perspective comes from his position as a millionaire, straight, white, male, living the good life. Watch out for this bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is better to be uninformed than misinformed.","review":"I have yet to read a Maltin review that did not have factual errors. Could it be that he just reads the titles and start writing.In the movie \\"Friends\\" the only thing he get right is that the movie is about a boy and a girl that have a baby. He somehow does not know that the girl is french even though she speeks French in the movie. He also states that at the end of the movie the childrens parents come and get them, but the girl is an orphan, and the movie ends before the boys parents arrive, so we don't know if anyone gets taken home.Here is what Maltin has to say about one of Donald Sutherlands best performances. \\"hippie soldier Sutherland isn't credible in 1940s setting.\\" I guess he must have been horified by the car in \\"Blazing Saddles\\".

He likes his movies to do good box office, and to be heartwarmingly decent and uplifting (that is, banal) in the good old Hollywood tradition. Any hint of the subversive--well, forget about it!

I am a fan of Mr. Maltin's, and find his reviews to be interesting, well-thought out and, occasionally, hilarious. That he gets blasted by some for his reviews is amusing; all criticism is ultimately subjective. Because he doesn't like 'Blade Runner' doesn't make him an idiot; I didn't like it, either! The best film critics give the prospective viewer enough information to draw their own conclusions from the criticism; Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert are both experts at this. I highly recommmend books by either of these film critics."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Comments","review":"Although, Leonard Maltin has given many excellent and well-deserved ratings, he sometimes dissapoints me by giving a low rating for a very good film.

For example, when Mel Gibson's Braveheart was released, he gave it a three star rating. the following year, when it won Best Picture, he changed it to a three and a half. The same happened when he first rated Earthquake. He gave it a one and a half. Nowadays, he changed it to a BOMB. Neglecting these flaws, the book is a gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best reviewer for me!","review":"You should always buy a movie review book by an author whose philosophy of movies (and life) you agree with. I like Maltin. If he has a bias, it is in the direction of a morality, while still appreciating the art in movies which may slant in the other direction. I like his coverage of old movies too, being an old movie buff myself. In addition, I listen to and enjoy his talk show on radio, where he occassionally reviews movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a superb guide","review":"This is simply a great book. I don't agree with Maltin on all of his reviews but he's generally right on the money. It's a case of debating whether a movie warranted 4 or 5 stars- but if he says something is bad, I know not to waste 10 mins of my time to find that out. As a movie buff, it's an invaluable guide to info such as who directed or starred in a specific movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Movie Lovers!","review":"We use this book about as often as we use the dictionary! The descriptions are longer than those found in the TV guides, but are still pretty short. I don't think they could be any longer without leaving out a lot of titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"No doubt about it, Maltin is the king!","review":"Leonard maltin is simply the best Film historian of our generation. His extensive cross-referencing, widescreen glossary, and trivia go far above and beyond any other film guide out there. I have bought two editions of his wonderful guide and I am waiting for the 2000. Being a Canadain, I regulary watch Saturday Night at the Movies, hosted by the wonderful Elwy Yost. Maltin's many appearences on the show is a delight, since you can see two of the greatest film historian s of all time. A wonderful book! If only we hade more books and authors like this. But that would make it less special, so never mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accurate information, strange ratings","review":"I couldn't find many errors as far as the whos and whats of a movie, but the ratings left me puzzled. Maltin is a big fan of camp, and readers should realize this before trusting the book. A really awful movie might get a half-decent rating because its \\"so bad its good.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR POOR POOR POOR POOR POOR","review":"THIS BOOK STINKS.

Or, a mass reference?","review":"Poor alphabetization - against all accepted rules and thus difficult to use.

Poorly done, really."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a 0 star rating...","review":"I've never liked Leonard Maltin's take on movies. I can live with Roger Ebert, but Gene Siskel I will miss, because at least he had some good thoughts about movies in general. Maltin is just an automotron from some distant planet who never REALLY watched a movie in his entire life. He's contradictory, and that really bugs me. I say go see a movie if you really want to see it, and don't listen to critics unless you are prepared to hear something you dont want to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for the data, forget the opinions.","review":"Unfortunately this is the only consolidated source of data on recent films. The opinions offered by the editor and staff are more predictable than a B movie. For them a \\"great movie\\" is a famous, profound (whatever that means!) and/or ethnically correct movie. Not a drop of insight and even less originality. They could be reviewing theater plays. Its reedeming(?) quality is the enormous list. Not much in terms of old or foreign films, but still a reference one can turn to in case of need."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad","review":"sometimes i wonder if Maltin even watches these movies... often it seems like he read the back of the box or watched a preview... very rarely do i ever agree with his ratings... even though i don't alway agree with Ebert, i find his reviews much more informative and intelligent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maltin should watch movies BEFORE he rates them","review":"Do you want bizzare? I will give you a list of movies that Maltin gave a \\"not bad\\" 2 1/2 stars. If one of your favorite movies is on this list, don't say I didn't warn you. The Shawshank Redemption 2.5 The Usual Suspects 2.5 Monty Python and the Holy Grail 2.5 The Princess Bride 2.5 Amadeus 2.5 A Simple Plan 2.5 The Truman Show 2.5 Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade 2.5 Miller's Crossing 2.5 Terminator 2: Judgement Day 2.5 The Outlaw Josey Wales 2.5 Pleasantville 2.5 Forrest Gump 2.5 Out of Sight 2.5 The Big Lebowski 2.5 Unforgiven 2.5 Taxi Driver 2.5 Exotica 2.5 I found most of these examples really easily through the Internet Movie DataBase. The IMDB should be all that you would want in a movie guide, for volume, accuracy, and wit. But if you want a near equal that you can take to bed with you, buy the Video Hound Golden Movie Retriever. It's accurate and indexed like no other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read some of this, before you buy it!","review":"Leonard Maltin has quite an impressive vocabulary. Unfortunately, most of his reviews are negative, biased, and devoid of information or plot of the film. Maltin maybe a film historian but, even Ebert is more open-minded than him. I recommend the Video Movie Guide 1999 by Martin & Porter, which is more informative, easier to comprehend, more fun to read, and definitely more positive. In other words, check out other movie guides before SETTLING on Maltins'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased against Ridley Scott!!!!!","review":"I posted a review of this piece of trash a few months ago and since then I have learnt two important points about this book. First is that the writers are biased against one of the best directors of all time: Ridley Scott, the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise and 1492: Conquest of Paradise. He might have got away with it if he had simply slated all his films, like he has, but he discredited Alien for its violence, yet loved the sequel that was directed by James Cameron, yet was infinately more violent!!! Secondly Maltin has clearly failed to reach pubety, (that beard on his mug shot on the cover has to be a fake!!), since he lacks all vision and slates brilliant, adult classics for their violence like Taxi Driver, which he called sick!! I BEG YOU NOT BUY THIS BOOK! INFACT ONE STAR DRASTICALLY OVER RATES IT!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Beginning","review":"This book was well written and easy to understand, and even though it didn't go into the concept of the tax sales it did explain however the idea that purchasing tax liens can be worth while when investing is concerned.

Parhams, Author of The Blues for Annie Mae","review":"There is reading material and there is cherishing material, this book is definitely placed in the latter category.

She tells stories with her own country grammar and country charm."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL! WONDERFUL!","review":"I had a wonderful time reading J.

Now I have read all of her books, and I have turned my mother and my sister on to reading her books as well. Keep up the good work SisterGirl, and hurry with another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Ok... I feel a bit guilty about not putting 5 stars as everyone else, but I guess I just need to let others like me know what to expect when they read this book.The main reason why I bought it was because everyone put 5 stars on it, and I do have to admit I liked it. It is filled will lessons of life, some of which are very funny, others are a bit sad, but in the end the messages are encouraging and motivating.Now, the reason for the 4 star rating is that I found some of the stories a bit unbelievable, and although I love happy endings, there were way too many here. Also, I found the writing style hard to understand sometimes, since it uses a lot of \\"argot\\", which made it difficult to focus and keep the stories flowing.Having said that, I do have to point out that this is definetly a Happy Book, full of funny characters, nice stories and lots of love ... it will put a smile on your face and fill your heart with joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wise, down-home stories that show life as it is","review":"Cooper is a master at revealing truths about simple, yet complex life events. These stories are some of her best (and I've read all her short stories). Her characters are real people like my aunts and uncles and cousins and myself. Common ordinary events are handled with care and insights that most of us don't have. Each story is a perfect jewel; all the elements are clearly defined in language that I can not only understand, but which evoke deep feelings in me. I KNOW her characters as surely as I know my friends and relatives. Cooper is an extraordinary writer! If she reads this I want to know when she will publish another short story collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"True to life stories","review":"These stories remind me of stories that I heard my aunts and uncles tell.

This is a wonderful movie and you will laugh till you cry. I love all the crazy characters like the crazy Nazi, the cross dressing director and the flower child actor that plays Hitler if I'm remembering correctly.

The show becomes an instant hit, because the premiere audience after hesitation adore the camp Springtime for Hitler show.The show's director Roger Debris and his secretary Andreas Voutsinas play the most over the top gays you can think of,outrageous!!!!!!this movie is for laughs, and needs to come out on DVD asap!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrifically funny film!","review":"How Mel Brooks came up with this one is anyone's guess, but the film works at every turn -- from the hilarious opening scene where Zero Mostel is conniving little old ladies out of their savings to the look on Gene Wilder's face when he finds out he'll have to pay those unsuspecting ladies 25,000% of the play's profits.This film needs to be re-released.

And I'm continually haunted by one question: who is funnier? Dick Shawn? Or Kenneth Mars?Shawn, as LSD, the star in the Bialystock/Bloom production of \\"Springtime for Hitler\\" is outrageous, broader even than his wonderful turn in \`It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World'. Mars, who many will remember as W.D. \`Bud' Prize on \\"Fernwood Tonight\\", is spectacular as Nazi pigeon ranger cum playwright, Franz Liebkind.The Producers never misses an opportunity to stack gag upon gag--physical, musical, intellectual-no holds barred. At 88 minutes the film falls flat at about 65, but at that point you're so full of good humor it really doesn't matter anyway.Kudos to Andreas Voutsinas, and Christopher Hewett, both hilarious in smaller roles.If you haven't seen this film, see it today. If you have, see it again, it doesn't lose a thing the second (or third) time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldie and a goodie.","review":"Much better than the remake.

Now it is justifiably recognized as a cult comedy, one whose images, performance, and dialogue live on in the mind of those fortunate enough to see it. Zero Mostel is just brilliant as the crooked Max Bialystock, muttering \\"Where did I go right?\\" when he discovers to his cost that he has produced a Broadway hit. Gene Wilder makes a suitably neurotic sidekick, screaming for his blue blanket. There are a clutch of wonderful cameo roles, from Kenneth Mars' Hitler-loving, pigeon-fancying actor, to Christopher Hewett's director, putting a big 'C' into Camp, and Estelle Winwood as one of the old ladies willingly seduced by Bialystock.

I've always heard great things about this movie. As a result, I'd waited years to see it. It's a real letdown. Every scene is built around one joke.

This is not just hilarious, it's imaginative. It must be hard to make a very imaginative fantasy, but I think it's just as hard to make a movie this imaginative that exists in the real world. It's also pure fun, like all of Brooks' other movies. It has a real heart, and it's wonderfully acted. Zero Mostel, especially Gene Wilder, and the supporting cast are excellent.

Much to there suprise the show becomes a comic hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Schtick don't stick","review":"After watching this film, it seems quite obvious this was Mel Brooks's first film. The playing out of the gags, the directing, the progression of the film, it all just didn't feel quite on the mark for Brooks. Sure, it's without a doubt his style, but a whole lot of it isn't funny. Springtime for Hitler is hilarious, sure. Their solution to their dilemma, funny. A Hitler-obsessed writer. It's all there. It simply lacked execution. It's as if the soul was taken out of the flamboiant gags and left us with a shell of what might have been.

If they suck, I figure I can finish them and reflect on what went wrong. Or heck, maybe they'll end up having funny moments and have a small amount of redemption value. Instead, this movie turned out being the biggest bucket of .... I've ever seen. The humor is just too old. Within the first couple minutes the audience is treated to seeing a fat guy fall on a table. Boo, Mel Brooks, boo. The entire Springtime for Hitler thing is a great idea, but come on, it's no longer the 1960's, so the initial shock value it received is lost on an audience that can hopefully hear a song about Hitler without laughing its retarded socks off. While everybody else seems to adore this hunk of garbage, I must disagree. Unless you come from a time when comedy wasn't invented yet, do not see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest comedy of all time?","review":"I've got to say I was very excited about watching this movie.

As the movie was supposed to be so good we continued to watch. Repeatidly saying \\"this is stupid!\\".To put it bluntly it is the worst movie I have ever seen.

It wasn't anywhere near their advertised speeds...The only good thing about the EP Memory is that it has an LED lite to show its in use...Thats nice but really not needed if watching the monitor for use.

It does the name of Dreamworks entertainment injustice to call this an actual movie. The story is awful, so is the dialouge. I feel this is one of the worst cartoon I have ever seen since The Lion King. The original Shrek was a good enough movie, nothing to go nuts over, but funny just the same. But this.... is just too much for me to bear. Dreamworks should close down after making this horrible movie. What a sellout!

I would reccomend renting from a movie store and get the one time laughs and then never watch it again. The first time I viewed this film I laughed my pants off and almost peed them do to some of the brilliant animation. BUT.... Even before I saw it the second time I was tired of it.

Without him, I would have given up on the movie before I finished it. His hairball attack as he was about to kill Shrek is hysterical. Not one other laugh either before or after that though. I kept asking myself why I was watching this.Fairy Godmother is evil and stupid, Prince Charming is way to annoying. The evil step sister was a transvestite. On the way to Far, Far Away, Donkey kept asking \\"Are we there yet,\\" to the point is was aggrevating, not funny.Thank goodness I only rented it and didn't waste my money buying a movie I will never watch again.

Disney animation has revolutionized the animation industry, and you just make fun of them. That's a real shame. You should be thanking Disney for all what animation offers nowadays. Disney classics have heart, humor, and a beautiful story. Shrek 2 lacks that.

Big dissappoint, since it makes it look good.Another thing is that you HAVE TO watch the commercials. Not aloud to skip + it's on the main menu trying to force you to see it.The biggest dissappointment is the movie itself. At the end, I asked myself, \\"Is that it?\\". Shrek 2 was cute, but that's it. Really the only thing you need to know is a cat joins Shrek. Wow, big changes! Oops, guess I spoiled the movie. Sorry! Wasn't that good anyway.Go get Garfield, Cinderella Story, Elf, or something cute to watch, because this DVD is boring and a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal to or better than the first","review":"This movie was very hilarious. It had the same gags as the first one did, but with many more characters and with a much deeper plot.This time, Shrek and Fiona are married. They get an announcement from \\"mom and dad.\\" (That being FIONA's mom and dad) that compels them to journey to the land of \\"Far Far Away...\\"Donkey's back, as is Gingey and the whole crew. Here, we meet Puss, Fairy Godmother, Prince Charming and we get a glimpse into Fiona's true heart.... a glimpse that makes Shrek question his own existence. Honestly, this movie is very well done. The animation is sharp and bright. The motivation and the plot are both believable, even amid the backdrop of purest fantasy.Who is Fiona's true love? It's no secret that, by the end of the movie, we learn that Shrek is just THA MAN! (Or is that THA OGRE?)I really enjoyed this movie. I think it has something for every age."},{"rating":"2","title":"AS GOOD IF NOT BETTER THAN THE FIRST","review":"This is a wild and funny movie that had all of my family (children as well as adults) constantly laughing. Much like a Marx brothers movie, there is stuff constantly going on. Much like the first Shrek, the donkey has all the best lines. The plotline makes no sense; but then who cares?A word of advise: do not leave the theater as soon as the credits start rolling. If you do, you will miss a small addition to the movie that breaks into the middle of the credits that is just about the funniest part of the whole film.

Each scene of the film is full of idiomatic expressions culturally-specific references. Even students who have seen the film in another language develop a new appreciation for it in English and class discussions are fairly effortless, coming as they do from the numerous questions related to \\"cameos\\" and digs at Disney, for example.

The bad news, as others have noted, is that before you can watch the movie you're forced to watch 4 minutes of promos for \\"Shark Tale\\" and some other crappy movie with the ever-annoying Ben Stiller narrating.

It is bad enough that Dreamworks would put this material to play at the start of the DVD, but to disable my ability to SKIP it if I don't wish to see it??? That, as far as I am concerned, is a demonstration of pure contempt for it's customers by Dreamworks. I will avoid purchasing future Dreamworks DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"ADULT GUILTY PLEASURE","review":"I probably would never have seen \\"Shrek 2\\", if someone didn't force me to watch it recently, and it's a handsomely produced ugly duckling-in-reverse fairy tale boasting a smart sense of humor and enormously creative production values. As funny and enjoyable as it was though, the story itself is a little vacant, dependent on the crafty characterizations and animated effects. The celebrity voices have been deservedly praised but so too should be the unknowns who apparently acted out these scenes in human form before they were turned to animation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films in 2004","review":"Shrek 2 is just as good, if not better, as the first one.

It is a great kids cartoon movie. It also has enough content to keep adults not only occupied but entertained. It is a commedy that anyone can enjoy if looking for a good laugh. The characters are well rounded and they have personality. These characters are believable. The aimation in the movie is amazing. It is hard to imagine how this was all put together. Not many people think about that aspect of it, but being an artist I can't help but notice it. Everything looks so real. This world is so believable and just adds to kids imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sequal That is Just as Good As The Original","review":"Shrek 2 is definately one of the best movie sequels ever made. It added to the story of the original Shrek without taking anything away. All of the performances were still wonderful and the new cast of characters brought even more laughs. All of the voice talents were great including the newcomers John Cleese, Antonio Banderas, and Julie Andrews. The animation had definately improved. The backgrounds are now definately more rich and detailed. All in all it makes for one great sequel. I highly reccomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun","review":"Now happily married, Shrek (Mike Myers) and Fiona (Cameron Diaz) travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews), only to fall into the clutches of the Fairy Godmother (Jennifer Saunders), who still plans for Fiona to end up with Prince Charming (Rupert Everett). This is a bright, cheerful film with great CGI and plenty of laughs. The character of Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) nearly steals the show. Though not quite the equal of the original film, this is a really fun movie with excellent voice talent and amusing characters. The soundtrack of popular music becomes a bit overwhelming at times, but not enough to detract from the overall experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute","review":"My family and I went to see this movie.

I enjoyed both of the Shrek films, and thought the 1st one was better than the this sequel. However, these are NOT on the same level as the Pixar films. Finding Nemo is better than either of the two Shrek movies. It has more advanced animation, better writing, and definitely more heart. The Shrek movies are very entertaining and funny, and much of the animation is great too, but Pixar is the King of animated movies in the present moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kids loved it & I did too","review":"I would give it 4 1/2 if I knew how.

It is a major flaw in the DVD, and it is why I will never buy another DreamWorks product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't skip the trailer","review":"I am going to try to return this DVD tomorrow morning. There are 10 minutes of previews at the beginning of the movie that you can not skip by advancing to the menu nor by skipping chapters.The best you can do is fast forward which still takes far too much time.This is worse than commercials at the theater and I will not support studio that thinks is OK to charge $15.00 to $20.00 and still forces me to watch a commercial.Do NOT buy in my opinion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot Skip Commercials","review":"The story was ok -- not as good as the original.However, i strongly recommend that you do not purchase this DVD for the sole reason that it contains about 10 minutes of commercials at the beginning that you cannot skip -- at least not on my DVD player.

That one is way better"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than the original","review":"I took the liberty of going to see Shrek 2 yesterday with the intention of already knowing it would be better than the first one. It is much better and I have to say that Puss n Boots was even better than Donkey by a slim margin. I could even sense a little jealousy in that lovable loudmouth when Shrek started paling around with the adorable Zorro-like feline. I thought that Julie Andrews and John Cleese were great in their roles as Fiona's parents. Prince anything but Charming and the un-Fairy Godmother (pardon the insults) couldn't be trusted any farther than they could be thrown. I can say that I would see this movie a second and possible third time and am looking forward to when Shrek 2 comes out on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the first","review":"This movie was excellent. Same clever humor and phenomenal animation just as in the first. The first movie was a bit darker in places due to the storyline.

I would highly recommend this wonderful movie from Dreamworks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, hate the DVD","review":"Some smart marketing person made it so you can't use the Menu or Fast Forward keys while they show the two excruciatingly long trailers before the movie. Not friendly for parents of smaller children!!!!! How very irritating!!!!!!

Shrek is such a wonderful hero, I am absolutely in love with him. I was so disappointed by the message of the Disney movie \\"Beauty and the Beast\\". I kept telling myself all the way up to the end of the movie that the Beast would NOT HAVE TO change into a handsome prince for he and Belle to be happy together. What a lost opportunity to teach a life lesson! I must have been just waiting for Shrek to come along. It is just such an exciting, joyous, wonderful, music-filled movie. The music was epic. There were a lot of great lessons here: loyalty, values, courage, learning that handsome is as handsome does... Also so funny, I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life, I literally had tears running down my face. And Antonio Banderas as Puss In Boots! How much cooler can you get?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the #1 comedy of all time.","review":"Shrek 2 is definatly not the #1 comedy of all time. I never laughed during the whole movie and I think Barney is funnier than this piece of crap. Dont buy it because it says the #1 comedy of all time. It is the #1 worst movie of all time.

I won't waste my money on it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who exactly is this movie made for?","review":"This movie shocked me. First of all, I didn't like the first one. Burping, farting and other crude behavior doesn't make me laugh. Secondly, why on earth would people choose to be ogres when they could be prince and princesses? I understand the point of the story, but why such extremes?Shrek 2 went beyond crude. Were my eyes playing tricks on me or was Pinochio in a pink G string? Was there a transvestite bartender? Was the cat licking himself provacatively? Not to mention a slue of other shockers that were completely unsuitable for a young audience.I realize the movie was rated PG. However when you put out an animated movie, all the children are going to want to see it. They are all marketed toward young children. There was no reason for a lot of the content in that movie. If you have little ones, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four-and-a-half star movie, two star DVD presentation","review":"I was shocked that after paying nearly $20 for this DVD that I will be forced to see a lengthy advertisement for a mediocre-looking movie called Madagascar, Every Time My Kids Want to Watch This Movie For All Time, even after \\"Madagascar\\" has been released and forgotten. Disabling the ability to skip this ad is just impolite of Dreamworks.Oh My Goodness. Avoiding ads is a primary reason for buying discs instead of watching broadcast TV. For that reason alone, this DVD will either get returned, or will \\"dissapear\\" from the kids-area of our collection.All that said, Shrek 2 is a fine sequel. Compared to the very swank DVD presentation of Shrek 1, however, this disc is a big dissapointment. Doubly so at its list price of $30!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie, but what the is with the commercials?","review":"They literally >LOCK< the option not allowed me to skip their stupid commercials.

However, where the first Shrek was funny and charming, Shrek 2 feels stale and tired. The jokes are the same this time around. The clever, clandestine pokes at Disney do not elicit the laughs they once did. The story seems a rehash of the plot from Shrek. It is as if the filmmakers felt they did not have to think of anything new or fresh and could merely reheat Shrek and serve it to the masses (which judging by the boffo box office, they were right). I would have rated this movie higher had the first one not been so utterly superior to this movie which, to its credit, does have some mildly amusing scenes. However, as long as Dreamworks is content to lampoon other people's work, Pixar's originals \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Toy Story\\" will remain on top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad version","review":"This was a bootleg sent it back because it had a scratch on it after looking further I realized it was a boot leg version.

My family enjoyed watching it. However, I really got mad when I was forced (you can't skip to the title page) to watch 2 lengthy previews for movies I really don't care about. You can't skip over them and get to the menu. When you get a movie free from a cereal box thats exceptable but when you buy one this shouldn't be. My son doesn't want to see previews. Maybe I being over critical but I just want someone to see this so they dont contiue forced previews. I don't mind previews but make it an option to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie / Terrible DVD","review":"I'm extremely bothered by 'un-skippable' commercials (previews) at the beginning of this DVD.

Gets -4 Stars for HORRIBLE DVD","review":"You can't avoid the commercials at the beginning! It won't allow the \\"skip\\" or \\"menu\\" buttons to work on the remote, the only thing you can do is fast forward through them. I paid for this because I would like to watch it multiple times and every time you put the DVD in, you have to watch 4 minutes of ads for \\"new\\" Dreamworks cartoons (one is Shark Tail, already out in theaters).

And not to mention the beautiful animation, I really like the scene where Pinnochio, the three blind mice, grandma wolf and piglets, and Gingy rescues Shrek, Donkey and Puss In Boots from the dungeon.

Shrek was fresh and original, but this is formulaic and boring. The story line is predictable and annoying.It's an adequately (barely) entertaining movie, but the reason this might be worth renting is that the \\"Far Far Away Idol\\" extra was fun to watch.

Nearly all DVD's allow you to either fast forward using your chapter forward button or your menu button so that you can go straight to starting the movie instead of watching other promos.

Well, if Dreamworks does it and no one complains. Then all DVDs will end up forcing you to watch what they want before you can watch what you paid for.

How much new material can the writers adds to an old storyline? A lot, actually. Shrek 2 turns out to be almost as good as the original Shrek.This is NOT your typical Disney movie; it has an intelligent sense of humor and an unconventional view regarding love and romance. Fiona is torn by the apparent lack of welcome from her family. Ogre develops inferiority complex. Talking donkey gets a new rival. Fairy godmother is the evil bitch, and the owner of a magic factory, who is determined to see his son, Prince Charming, married to Princess Fiona.The main theme of this movie: is attractiveness possible without the physical beauty? Fiona and Orge struggle to find the answer.Go watch the movie. It's worth the bucks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shrek 2","review":"This is a super cute and funny movie.

The Legalines guide has helped me get through this material as well as the Gilberts.Casebooks aren't exactly known for their entertainment quality - as this one is certainly no exception - but it covers the material in a thorough manner and isn't too difficult to understand.My biggest complaint is the tiny typeface used for the Notes following each case. My teacher concentrates quite a bit on these extra factoids and the tiny print is a bit of a strain on the eyes (especially at 2:00am). Otherwise, this book is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Conflicts textbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"While the construction is good, these banana plugs are only compression style, so you have to insert the wire from the side only and tighten the screw.

Combining traditional Gaelic songs with progressive keyboard arrangements and percussion that is simply brilliant, this album will quickly become a favorite in your Celtic dance collection.Some of my personal favorites from this album are \\"Two Pence worth\\" and \\"Two sisters.\\" The introduction on \\"Two Pence Worth\\" is a good example how Thomas & Maggie build up the dance beat before Maggie's clear and enchanting vocals have you dancing to their unique blend of Celtic music.Another significant attribute of this album is its \\"playability.\\" The songs quickly take hold and you soon find yourself humming along. This is one album that no matter how many times we play, it sounds just as fresh and uplifting as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"More a Manifesto for Agile Development than a tutorial...","review":"This book tries to cover too many things. The book is more a Manifesto for Agile Development from an experienced programmer than a technical book.Thus this small book misses all the details any technical person would like to see. The book is definitely not a comprehensive API guide to Spring or Hibernate, nor does it intend to be. The author repeatedly said : \\"more to come later\\" or \\"we'll see this in later chapter\\" etc. But that moment never arrived...The books can be used to get an overall idea for a manager or a programmer who is totally a newbie to the concepts.The more interesting part is on Agile Development where it seems to be a Manifesto but definitely not a tutorial."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back","review":"As you have probably read from other reviews, this book is very difficult to follow because its so poorly written. If you told me that the author just sat down and winged it when he wrote this book, I would reply that \\"it shows\\". I don't know what I was thinking ordering a book without reading the reviews. Will never happen again.

There is nothing agile about this book but it does have a bit info on Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse. After reading this book you will be more confused about the subject than you were before."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke","review":"This is nothing but an overview. The code is hard to follow since there is little or no code in the book. I felt that it was way to hard to get to the code on SAMS website. (Why do I have to register to obtain the code?). To really understand anything in this book you have to google a lot and buy other books.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much title for too few content","review":"I bought this book because I already had the sensation that Eclipse, Spring and Hibernate were the new top-knotch combination to develop web applications. I bought it, then, expecting this book to be a practical introduction to the way they interact and they way you can actually develop a project using them. Instead, it limits itself to recognize what I have just asserted above (that this combination is indeed powerful), and to make a brief introduction (absolutely insufficient for practical purposes) to each of these technologies (and some others). So, in my opinion, this book was deceiving. Too much superficial. I read it, but I didn't learnt anything I didn't know before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need Sample Code and Other References to Understand","review":"There is some useful information in the book that describes the technologies and how they relate to each other. Not a bad way to get your toe wet if you have not worked with these before. But I never got a firm understanding on how the Spring framework actually worked until I read other material elsewhere. It would be nice if the application's class relationships and the processing sequences were presented in UML diagrams. That way one could really understand the composition of a Spring application and how the application's components interact with each other. You will be left on your own to go figure that out. And a lot of us travel on business and with this book lacking diagrams or complete code samples you can't just read the book on an airplane or elsewhere. You really need to work through the code, study other reference material, and figure all that out while you read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"May not be for programmers","review":"This book tries to combine so many things in to one. Thus it looses the detail any technical person would like to see. It skims over Extreme Programming, RUP without saying much about it - it is understood as it is not the focus of the book.The architecture it discusses is just a three layer one, which I believe any programmer would know before hand. This talks about lot of freewares and then it goes through Hibernate and Spring, which I believe is not enough for a technical person. The books can be used for overall idea for a manager or a programmer who is totally new to the concepts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Most of the information in this book can be easily found on the Internet.

I read the whole book, waiting for that moment that I could say: Oh, that's what the author meant by repeatedly saying: \\"more to come later\\" or \\"we'll see this in later chapter\\" etc. That moment never arrived. This book looks like a hurried and lousy compilation of 5 day presentations on each subject that this books claims to cover, without proper editing and attention to detail.I read the book riding the metro in Washington DC and I can honestly say that I would rather see DC tourists block the left side of the escalators in the metro stations on a busy rush hour day than read or refer to this book again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost insulting","review":"This book was a huge disappointment and is more of a reference to online documentation sources than any sort of content. Time after time the auther just lists links to online documentation, FAQ's, etc instead of addressing it in the text. I bought the book b/c I found the online docs to be insufficient, I really don't need a book to point me where to go. If you are not able to use Google to find online info on Hibernate, Spring and eclipse, maybe this book would be of value. Otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half-baked","review":"The book fails to impress despite the rather impressive title. If you haven't bought this book yet, do yourself a favor and go to the home pages of Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse respectively, and just read the introductions. This book provides no more useful information than the individual websites' introductory pages. Moreover, the websites show better examples instead of asking you to refer to a zip file after every 10 lines or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just nothing of any use","review":"This book's title doesn't match the actual content within. I read this book in about a week and I wasn't very impressed. You are better off going through the tutorials that are available online and learning from your mistakes.

HYDE combines soft sounds with emotion to create a world all of his own. When I listen, I get swept up in this world, and find myself feeling every song like they were my feelings alone. My favourite tracks from this CD are the wistful \\"Shallow Sleep\\", the tearful \\"Cape of Storms\\" and the dark \\"Secret Letters\\".A warning to listeners: If you enjoy this album, you may not enjoy his next albums, \\"666\\" and \\"Faith\\" unless you're a hardcore HYDE fan or a J-rock connoisseur. It has a much harder rock sound, but is enjoyable to me nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Noise in the least appealing sense","review":"If you enjoy music that sounds like good to the ear, skip this CD. \\"Till I found you\\" which is in rotation right now is absolutely irksome.

The only Mignola art contained within is precious little.Buyers beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"great softcore.","review":"I'm not sure when it happened, but softcore has sure been turning a lot more explicit in the past few years. I guess being a Playboy production has something to do with it. You can see everything short of penetration in this film. There are 4 actresses nude in the film, all of whom I've never seen in anything else (either in hardcore or softcore). But they all look natural (some look prettier than others) with knockout bods. The sex scenes are great and look pretty believable (all boy/girl; 7 of them I think). Really liked the redhead's scene; I'm a sucker for arched backs. Oh, and there's some plot about a haunted house. The acting is OK, especially for softcore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among Sabatini's best.","review":"The Black Swan (1932) is among the author's later works, not the best, but certainly among his better novels. Although perhaps more sophisticated and better written than his earlier and more popular works, The Black Swan also lacks much of the swashbuckling action and intricate plot twists that made Sabatini a household name in the 1920s. Oddly for a pirate novel, most of the story takes place on an isolated Caribbean isle, where the hero and villain try to outwit each other. The ending is a surprise, however, and there are no slow spots throughout. Sabatini is particularly good at bringing historical figures to life, and his portrait of Sir Henry Morgan, buccaneer turned colonial governor, is no exception. A recommended, easy and thoroughly enjoyable read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as earlier music","review":"I wanted to like this CD so badly, because I loved Rick's first three CDs. But this release is nowhere near as good as that earlier music. Gone are the excellent, rambunctious honkytonk tunes and the heartbreaking ballads. This CD is nothing more than the fluffy pop crap that passes for country music."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting trip in time","review":"High schooler Katie is going on a summer trip with a likeable group of friends and their history-loving teacher. Katie's epilepsy, now well under control, is only a minor concern for Katie, her Mom and her friends. But when a mixup leaves her without her medication, she is thrown back in time and becomes Kathryn, also dealing with epilepsy, but in the days before the illness was understood and treatable. Kathryn is in great peril, and modern day Katie must act her part and save both of them. This well written and suspenseful tale combines a strong fantasy with a realistic potrait of a young woman handling her medical condition with a level headed maturity. Slightly dated (it was written in 1974; the young women fuss alot about their clothing and \\"freshen their makeup\\") it still makes a decent read today. This novel will appeal to preteens who enjoy Nancy Drew and similar mysteries with a strong female protagonist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book to replace one from childhood","review":"I had been looking for this book for a long time.

However, Ms Rudd is too often stuck on defining femininity in a traditional, stereotypical way. Knocking down male stereotypes only to replace them with female stereotypes is no way to help anyone. There are typos, Ms Rudd is clearly not a writer full time, she makes references to studies and magazines that she obviously doesn't read, and shows enormous disrespect to feminists and feminism (the movement that continues to try and help women attain equality and which paved the way for men to question their gender roles).

Instead of his regular swingin' jazz style, De-Phazz opts for a more moody atmosphere. Barbara Lahr's vocal delivery is the standout, though -- very Weimar-era cabaret. Several of the songs were inspired by famous poets -- William Blake, Sylvia Plath, William Carlos Williams -- which elevates the lyrics above typically insipid sentiments.

However, the musicians are faultless, Chrissy Hynde is at her best and I personally enjoyed every minute of it.The only thing I don't like about it is in the DVD recording. There are no DVD sound options (or any menu options apart from scene selection for that matter) and your amplifier needs to be turned right up past 10 o'clock to get the true concert experience. The picture quality could also be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretenders Isle of View","review":"This is definitely one of those albums that everyone should have, like the Peter Frampton live album.

Andrew Cohen communicates with simplicity and precision, yet also with suprising depth and subtlety. I found myself disturbed and intrigued reading this - as many (most!)of my ideas about enlightenment were deeply shaken, replaced by a growing seriousness and demand to live a different and extraordinary human life. The fact that this was the result of reading this book should not have suprised me after reading the foreword by Ken Wilber,in which he warns us that Andrew Cohen is a serious teacher, but what did suprise me is how it seemed to happened. Just reading it, did it. By the time I realized I was intrigued, it was already too late - this book is that experiental. It has actually changed the way I view and think about life,and I find myself deeply grateful. I look forward to reading more from this man."},{"rating":"1","title":"All ego","review":"I agree with the recent reviewers and those mysteriously wiped off recently and no longer here to see that dared criticise him. The problem with Cohen is his complete insecurity. He cannot for a moment bear any criticism but requests complete adulation. I read his books and attended one of his lectures. Never again. He is total ego and loves laughing at people making fun of them in front of others while he has the microphone. I know he desparately seeks enlightenment himself but surely this is not the way Andrew.

I used to watch Crunch fitness on a regular basis, and loved it. I am very dissapointed with this product. The moves actually start out difficult, resulting in a lot of rewinding to get them right, and get easier as the tape goes on. They also get more ridiculous as the tape progresses. I was looking for a tape that would get my heart pumping but though my heart rate did increase, I did not break a sweat while the instructor did. Her favorite move, \\"the swim\\", combined with her hooting and hollering did nothing for me. I would recommend other Crunch fitness products to people but not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly produced exercise video","review":"I've seen much better exercise videos--they didn't put much thought into this one. I'm experienced with aerobics classes and have never had such difficulty following the moves. She's difficult to follow partly because the moves change quickly, and she doesn't give cues that adequately identify the moves. Also, the videographer didn't give much tought to the task: just at the point where you need to follow the instructor's legs and feet to be sure you're with her, the camera moves so that you're seeing the participants or instructor from the waist up. Too bad--it looks like it would be a pretty good workout if one could just follow it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An almost perfect hi/lo cardio workout","review":"While the Crunch Fitmess format can be a little obnoxious, with a lot of forced hooting and hollering, the instructors are always the tops in their field. The music is generic dance music and the choreography is interesting and challenging without being too diffcult. It alternates bewteen hi and lo intensity sections to give you an interval training benefit. The warm up is decent- could use more stretching- the cardio section cruises right by as you are having fun. The cool down is way too short because they were trying to keep it at 30 minutes, so I suggest stretching and cooling down more on your own for about 10 more minutes after the tape is done, or use another tape's cool down. Even if you are in great shape, it will challenge you and if you're not, regular use should take you there.

First of all, I'm sorry but the style of the video is just too corny for me, with lots of whooping and cheering by the cast, harsh lighting, and no-frills setting. That probably shouldn't matter, but it did to me. Secondly, I don't think I'm a complete klutz but I found that the steps were too tricky for a beginner; they are not explained very well, but instead the instructor just launches right in to the workout. It takes several tries to figure out the steps, and by then it's not long before you begin to get bored. In a class, the instructor can vary the workout from week to week, but on video, once you learn the routine, that's it: if you want variety, you have to buy a different tape. Obviously a lot of people like this video, because it seems to be popular, but it didn't work for me. Since then I have found other exercise tapes and routines that I like much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Workout","review":"This video is sensational.

Her voice sounds the same, she does this \\"Uh Oh-- now try this\\" line over and over again. I scanned it once to see how hard the moves would be, then tried to do it myself. The moves were fairly okay, but the video itself really got on my nerves. The group working out here also yells and whistles and acts like they are having the best time in the world, and the general feel of the tape just made me want to put in my old Cher tape and appreciate how less annoying it was.Don't get this if you are someone who would find working out with the Spartan Cheerleaders annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ty's Really Got It Together!","review":"It's obvious that Ty has been working very hard on his music these days.This Christmas Album will reach out and grab you!Ty definitely put his own touch on the traditional songs, and the title cut \\"Not So Silent Night\\" would be the perfect Christmas Music Video.Two Thumbs Up to all who were involved in this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"yes thats right! back in the 90's this game kicked butt!

Where is the gripping story of finding and rescuing him as so many other Devereaux heroines in the past have done?

I'm not really a believer in the whole psychic thing but the quick reason as to why she got her powers totally seemed out of left field. And to me, that ruined it all.I can't help but wonder if she is now going to write another story about how Darci and Adam get together again.

Their theme song must be \\"What was I thinking\\".If you invested your reading time in the first two, probably like me you will make yourself read to the end of ALWAYS to see what happens.

The ending explained so much and gave me a totally diffent opinion of the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine ending...","review":"I have just finished reading \\"Always\\" and found the book to be delightful. Unlike other reviewers I found the ending to be quite satisfying; especially liking the way she left some things to the reader's imagination. I don't feel that I have to have every word of the story spelled out for me and there are enough subtle hints and quiet statements in the text to clearly show the intended ending of the story.One other thing and I know this is a little off the subject. Hats off to her publisher! I found very few typos in this book making the read much more pleasant. Quite often I find tense errors, wrong words (like wash instead of cash), and in general poor proof reading. I don't know about other readers, but I think this is certainly a problem that publishers need to address."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well but problems with the cover","review":"The KitchenCalc does conversions as promised and is very good at them. The timing functions also work.But, the device came with a flexible plastic cover to allow it to be used in a cooking envronment. To put the cover on, you need to stretch it to the point that several keys at the edge are forced down. This keeps the calculator from working.How can a product be sold without even minimal functionality testing? Yes - it calculates. But, no, the KitchenCalc is not splashproof. Didn't anyone try using the calculator with the flexible plastic shield on?It's worth buying, but keep it clear of the cooking area. Rated 2 stars because the lack of a functional cover keeps it from being used in the food-preparation area."},{"rating":"2","title":"much needed!","review":"To any pro chef this is a needed device in the kitchen. Just like your robo coupe, kitchen aid and favorite chefs knife. Instead of spending valuable time doing conversions from metric to standard, 30 portions to 9 portions for a special group, you can just enter the recipe and it converts everything for you. Some might not be inclined to do so because they think that these things should all be done in your head or on paper..... they are wrong. every second counts in the kitchen and if I can shave time off every day by using a calculator that tells me how many grams are in my 6.5 oz dish then I'm all for it.Every cook home or pro should own on of these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great time saver","review":"I often take recipes from very few servings to servings for 50 or more to handle feeding volunteers on Kingdom Hall construction projects.

Calculator is big (HUGE!!) and I don't find the operation to be at all intuitive. It never gets used and it takes up quite a bit of room in my kitchen drawer. I'd probably throw it out, but then it would take up a bunch of space in a landfill instead of my kitchen. Absolutely my own fault for not fully understanding what I was buying. The KitchenCalc 8300 by the same company is much more compact and might have been a more appropriate choice, but I think there are even better options than that.If you have a smartphone (Android or iPhone), iPad, or iPod touch then there are several cooking and unit conversion apps that offer much more flexibility and ease of use.

But it kinks like nobody's business and that is my biggest gripe.25 feet is nice and long so I've used this in 2 pools in unstructured under-water routing and it kinked in both situations. And, it doesn't like to go back to an unkinked state. If you bury this outside your watercourse I can almost guarantee you it will change form and kink and your flow rate will suffer.

There are too many books on the market that read the same and have the same information on metal clay. My advise, free tutorials on the net are the best way to learn. Not only are the books on the market the same on metal clay, but do all of the authors have to word their instructions on every single move that their hands make? In conclusion, this book is good for the basics of metal clay and to make the designs in the book only. You can incorporta your own ideas after learning the way to execute a design.

It combines tactical FPS elements with squad-level logistics, land navigation, and open ended objective-based game play. Elite Warriors: Vietnam could perhaps have been my favorite game of all time, but unfortunately even after I applied the patch it has several game-destroying bugs. Far too often, when the game tries to load a new FPS map, it passes garbage values for ammunition count, and slows to a freeze. Reloading saved games and reloading the level do not fix these game-destroying bugs. Even though I am in love with the concept since the game has been released with major bugs that completely undermine the long-term planning and logistical aspects of the game, I am afraid that I must give it a poor rating of 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary Game","review":"Released in 2005 this is a great game for planning surgical infantry strikes.

Not only did this slim little book tell interesting stories, it told them *well*. So many well-meaning authors talked down to the reader or simply retold hero stories with a girl in the traditional masculine role. These stories have the weight of the oral tradition behind them-- they did spring out of real cultures, not just second wave feminist minds-- and the women in them save the day in many ways, from swords to smarts to stubborn determination to hold on no matter what. Another aspect I love is that these women are brave for themselves as well as for families, for lovers-- and, in Kate Crackernuts' tale (one of my favorites)--for step-sisters. It's easy to say \\"sisterhood is powerful\\", but it's special to find a story where it really is.

Kelly Palomino, the completely unlikeable main character, is without any redeemable features. He is not particularly witty or clever, he cannot hold a job, he is not described as being remotely attractive, he hears voices in running water (?) and he spends his time lurking about following and terrorizing the innocent (although equally dull and unlikeable) heroine, Colette, with whom he becomes obsessed on her wedding day when he sees her kick a football. The plot and especially the ending tries the reader's patience and insults female intelligence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down!","review":"Tim Sandlin's outlook on life is a bit disturbing. The plot of this story is definitely strange and if you're looking for a surprise ending, you'll find it here. I didn't find the characters to be a bit believable. This book only evoked a mild disgust in me. I know it is just a story, but the premise of this book is not harmless. I consider it a bit insulting to women.

The description on the back cover sounded fun - a guy goes a bit crazy for a while after some bad times, and becomes obsessed with a beautiful stranger.I was disappointed with how the author presented his two main characters. His description of Colette (the beautiful stranger) didn't appeal to me, and Kelly Palomino (the obsessed guy) had an unconvincing character with a mish-mash of character traits that didn't seem to add up to a real person.In the end, I disliked the book as much as my girlfriend had because the characters and the plot didn't seem to add up.

Sandlin introduces us to Kelly Palomino, a dishwasher who hears voices in running water for reasons that are inadequately explored, leaving the reader to wonder why this aspect of his character was ever introduced. He falls in love at first sight with the story's equally unlikeable heroine, Colette, on her wedding day, and terrorizes her throughout this creepy nightmare of a story. The reader will shudder and wonder why as Colette seems to be slowly won over by this charmless, stubborn wierdo. The characters in \\"Sex and Sunsets\\" are not sympathetic or realistic, the plot is sickening to say the least, and the ending is out of sync with the real world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is made of wood...","review":"This story traces a few months in the lives of a couple of wooden characters. The book's premise of a \\"loser\\" finally getting the girl had potential, but the author made the main character (Kelly Palomino) a bit too unlikeable. His conquest, Colette, was also unlikeable. I was left wondering what the two of them could ever see in each other.If you have time for a good read, I'd highly recommend Kurt Vonnegut, J.D. Salinger, or Tom Robbins, all of whom Tim Sandlin has been compared to in these reviews. I don't think that this book measures up to the comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the first draft?","review":"If you've read the other reviews, you'll know that \\"Sex and Sunsets\\" is about a weird guy (Kelly Palomino) who falls in love with a stranger on her wedding day (Colette) and pursues her doggedly even though she is married and he doesn't know her at all. His persistence slowly chips away at her resolve for reasons never fully explained, and the reader is left confused and a bit disturbed at the outcome. The narrative style is casual and a bit irritating, and parts of the characters' psyches (like Kelly hearing voices in water) are not dealt with at all. This book seems like a rough draft, not a finished novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"All smoke, no fire, and to top it off I'm out 30$.","review":"Ah, there's nothing like a lighthearted little tale about...what else...stalking! This book is all smoke, no fire. The main characters are so unlikeable that I found myself wishing a car would come out of nowhere and hit-n-run any or all of them. Every once in a while you read a book that makes you feel like literacy is overrated. This is one of those books. Back away slowly, folks, and hold on to your wallets. The sun is about to set on this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You're too old for this stuff","review":"I enjoyed Tim Sandlin's books, like the Grovont Trilogy (expecially Skipped Parts), when I was in junior high school. I liked them because they had a lot of teen sex in them and were banned by the library. But as a twenty-something and a much more seasoned reader, Sex and Sunsets is just a recycled romance novel. The plot is implausible, a happily married woman falling for a stalker (albeit a very dumb and ineffective one)? The dialogue is very choppy, and there are enough cliched situations and stereotypical characters to make you puke. Just like babies need to be weaned, you should do the same and move on to more solid books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all of the hype?","review":"People seem to love this book or hate it. The general consensus seems to be that Tim Sandlin is not to be compared with Salinger or Dostoevsky. I agree wholeheartedly. I would not call this \\"light\\" reading, it is more on the vapid side. But I do think it is serious when a man is portrayed as a stalker who eventually wins over his victim. I just don't see the point of an unbelievable story like this. It is insulting to my intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ancient Mysteries Sacred Places","review":"This is not a very modern dvd but the subject matter does not change.A fascinating dvd, would like it to have been longer and even more embrassive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Restful","review":"For the first few minutes of listening to this CD it seems to deliver what it promises - a burbling background of rushing water to soothe the senses. However, shortly one's attention is drawn to the fact that the recording quality is quite poor as microphone wind noise pops up intermittently. And to top it all off, about 12 minutes in a rather startling ornery cat appears meowing loudly and aggressively. This cat makes periodic appearances every 5 or 10 minutes for the rest of the tape. Each appearance is more startling than the last. Hardly restful.It is astouding that any self-respecting recordist would allow this CD to be marketed as tranquility-inducing as the repeated appearance of a yowling cat forcefully brings the listener out of his reverie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap Control Even Worst Flow","review":"This could have been such an awesome game.

Then you over paid by 78 cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD For Anyone","review":"The reviewer from Philadelphia should come back down to earth. According to the \\"reviewer\\", only the \\"serious\\" listener and musician should purchase this CD, it is not for the \\"novice\\". DO NOT LET THIS SNOBBERY DISUADE YOU. Mehldau is a truly gifted musician, and this, his fourth volume in The Art of the Trio, is arguably as good as the others. The Trio was definitely \\"on\\" this night. Each track is truly a joy to hear, and will give you hours of listening pleasure as you will hear different nuances with each listen. I only wish I could have been there that night. So, if you are familiar with Mehldau, and happen to be a \\"serious\\" jazz listener, buy this CD. If you are not, and are simply a \\"novice\\" jazz listener, buy this CD, you will not be disappointed in either case."},{"rating":"2","title":"NAP Spitfire Replacement Blades-Keep 'em Sharp","review":"It doesn't take very many practice shots before the blades in any broadhead start getting dull and in the case of mechanical broadheads they are likely to take a bend: affecting both flight and opening.

It was listed as a \\"paperback\\" in the book category. I have several of Frances Klug's books which this is not. Her \\"books\\" are usually over 200 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sister of Darkness","review":"Sister of Darkness is basically the life story of the author, Lili Bita, a Greek woman. Sister of Darkness is written in a very difficult way to read. Lili Bita uses a very complex vocabulary to write this book. She writes extremely with many details, which makes the novel very boring. The story is written in a chronological order since she was born in the Island until she left Tasos forever, when she finds freedom. How sad is Lili's life as Tasos's wife. She was happy, until she destroyed her life falling in love with Tasos. Lili Bita is always looking for freedom in her life; however, she can not find it, because of a war and then a cruel marriage. After she left Tasos forever, which is the only part of the novel I liked, she could find herself free of violence. Anyway, we can find a tough woman, despite these circumstances. I would give this story 2 out of 5 stars, because it never kept my interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"the black boy from miami","review":"Lili writes as if she has known her readings for an eternity. She has no fear to what you think and she explains everything to the fullest. She doesn't beat around the bush what so ever. As a little girl coming from a Greek island. Having the curiosity that she had as a little girl can make most parents go crazy. She just wanted to know how things were and she went after what she wanted to know. Not caring what was in her path. Then she noticed that she was addicted to sex and somewhat became a prostitute. She kept it real from the beginning to the end of the book. SO you can see how real her life was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeply inspiring","review":"Lili Bita draws you into her world within the first page of her work. You are transported to her island, you live with her as she overcomes the heavy male dominated culture of post war Greece, you experience her struggles being a beautiful talented girl with dreams and ambitions, you travel with her as she faces her talents, her oppressor, and eventually her triumph. She is an inspiration to all girls and women of today. Her courage and fortitude shine through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enter the dark side and never escape.......","review":"I was appalled to learn that I enjoy this noise. It's fAST it hits HARD, and it never repeats itself. I honestly have no idea which track I happen to be listening to at any given time. However, this is the opposite of musical chaos. Every note and whine of feedback is carefully planned and executed. If you thought Dillinger was the epitome of math metal (like I did) you would be sorely mistaken (like I was).Your grandparents most likely wouldn't even be able to recognize this as \\"music\\". They would probably scream in horror, thinking for certain a hostile supernatural entity was making it's way into our dimension intending to deafen, terrify, and finally kill and eat them.But YOU.. I think you'll like it just fine. Once you have listened to this CD and accepted it as music, you can never go back. Your musical tastes have been permanently warped and perverted- and you love it. Join us on the dark side, baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Im not sure how anyone can enjoy this","review":"i saw this band live last night, and was NOT impressed. i love metal (real metal, too), but this stuff is not music. it's just a bunch of screaming over pointless noise. i can get into converge, and even some dillinger escape plan, but there comes a point where it crosses over from being insane/complex music to pure noise. this band has crossed that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alpha Video Cheats Us Again","review":"Once again, it's an Alpha Video Release. Rare Tex Ritter films that have been altered. Music cues and sound effects such as the sound of broken glass has been added to the sounttrack. Why they do this I do not know. I suspect Alpha wants to \\"brand\\" the movies and lay claim they own them. I like old cowboy westerns but to discover they freeze frame screens, add their logo in the corner of the screen and then add sound effects to the sound track (and the sound effects stand out very clearly, it's very distracting) is too much to bare. This is why I try to avoid anything manufactured by Alpha Video. (Besides, they probably got their films from VHS videos bought at the flea market. It's the kind of quality they offer on their DVDs.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Margaret Sams has done it again.

From a magazine that is famous for depicting beautiful naked women there is a noticeable lack of them in this DVD! It basically contains interviews with the ten girls and a documentary about their photoshoots. About the only nudity is half-second cut-overs to the still pictures that we have already seen in the magazine. This is a real shame because some of them appear to be very nice indeed. If you are interested in hearing why a 'beautiful barista' wants to appear in Playboy buy it - otherwise save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading!!!

I received a cover that said Jeep instead of what is pictured and since that is what I ordered it for anyways I'll just keep this overly priced single break cover. The quality is good but to only receive one and one that I didn't even see pictured is a major rip off in my opinion at $22 plus shipping and handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic for Amateurs","review":"This high quality and well written book will certainly join Burnhams three volume set as a long term classic, for those wanting to explore the sky with binocs. The numerous drawings and charts are priceless in locating interesting objects. It's a pity this excellent book is listed as \\"buy it used\\" by Amazon, with none shown as available used, since mine arrived spanking new in three days from Richmond to Maine via UPS in a highly professionally wrapped box for only a... handling fee and zero shipping charges from Willman-Bell the publisher. The inclusion of the outstanding Tirion Star Atlas is a huge plus, highly useful with only the naked eye, as well as with binocs and small telescopes. A Best Buy for anyones library.

Dark, witty, well-paced, tragic and a trace of lingering optimism. The ludicrous nature of the ending actually made me cry - as did the cracking one-liner delivered by Miller's dad. And by cry I think they were actually genuine tears as much as tears of laughter. 13 years after reading it still stays with me. If you like sarcastic wit and the driest of humours then Colin's your man and this is the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book keeps you interested from beginning to end.","review":"Colin Bateman has a simple way of thinking: He can take you wherever he wants if you want to go along. Death or \\"The Angel of Death\\" is a central character in this novel. It keeps you waiting, it keeps you feeling, but above all, it keeps you thinking. It's hard to say weather we are capable of having a political view.In this book, what matters is What is personal? and What is social? This division makes the whole story worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the rest of his work","review":"I've read all of Bateman's work, and this is the palest of the pale. Takes much longer to get into, and you're left with a disappointing taste in your mouth after the investment put into getting through it. I'm always entertained by the randomness inherent in Bateman's work, but in this one, much more so than the others, the randomness is used to cover bad plot holes and lacklustre characters. If you're reading chronoligically, skip over this one and come back to it when you wistfully realize there's nothing more available (yet!). If you're looking for \\"good\\" bateman, look for Divorcing Jack or Empire State, give this one a miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"These guys are a hoot","review":"The Red Hot Chili Pipers - what an idea! Rock 'n' Roll with bagpipes. And they're fun to watch, too.I like different things, and these guys sure are. It was only by chance that I found them. I was at Urguhart Castle on Loch Ness, and in the restroom heard this unusual music. What is that? It's bag pipes, yes, but what else is with that? Electric guitars? Keyboards? Wow!So I went hunting and found their DVD. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and had to find an NTSC version to play at home in the states on my big-screen with surround sound.

Then, the other woman came, and she ran into a wooden house(!) and, well DUH, he broke down the door. As I said, it's unbelieveable that this movie was rated PG.

The bear attacks are quite good but it is still a cheap tacky film and it doesn't for one second recover from this fact.So if you are collecting animal attack films by all means buy this, everyone else buy the Yogi Bear Collection, he's a much nicer, smarter than the average bear.This film is a pure boo-boo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as scary as I remember","review":"When I was a kid this movie really scared me, but my memories of Grizzly were amplified by my childhood imagination. While there are some tense moments in this film, the good points are overshadowed by the mediocre acting and poor film quality. The DVD tranfer isn't great. The film isn't very clear and sometimes the sound fades in and out. I would recommend this film only if you really like B movie horror flicks, in that sense I enjoyed its campy quality, and the bear footage isn't half bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Claws with MANY flaws","review":"This film was the first to rip off Spielberg's masterpiece, Jaws, followed quickly by Orca. No suspense, crappy dialogue, overuse of red kayo syrup,( blood), no originality. I couldn't wait for the entire cast to get eaten, so I could turn this off. Gee, Brody as the ranger, Quint as the grizzly expert, and Hooper as the copter pilot, wow, I never noticed. Some of the worst makeup and slowmotion you will ever see. Hell, the grizzly actually looks petable, how ferrocious. Soundtrack is enough to make you hurl, better yet spending money on this film will make you lose your appetite. This is probably the worst looking,(grainy), dvd I have ever seen. The producers even know this piece of trash isn't worth remastering. Skip this exploitation film and view Jaws or even Piranha, which is a tongue in cheek tribute to Jaws. Grizzly doesn't roar, it whimpers....big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same","review":"I havent seen this since i was a kid, Im a little dissapointed, i was hoping that the bear wasnt just some bloke in a suit and its not-its worse...

Definately a lifetime favorite in horror movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a caution","review":"The real problem I have with this film is not it's quality or the work that went into it. It's actually better than some movies considered classics, with higher production values than such credible and successful horror movies as \\"The Blair Witch Project\\" and the original \\"Halloween\\". The problem is with the threat itself. I live in grizzly country, real grizzly country, where these big bears behave much as they did before the continent was tamed. Grizzlies simply don't act the way they do in this film, and not even disease or injury could change that. A rabid animal will succumb to the disease or fight an opponent it can't beat (there aren't many of those for a grizzly), not engage in the prolonged reign of terror depicted in this movie. A pain maddened bear will go off somewhere and die, not on a rampage. Anyone who sees grizzly should keep in mind that this is fiction. I worry that it would justify murdering bears the way \\"Jaws\\" has nearly made the great white shark extinct."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the evil-fake-bear attacks!

It also isolates the mouse from the fabric of whatever you happen to be sitting on with your laptop to keep fibers from entering the mouse. Thin and TOUGH material, great for travel, fantastic for accuracy. You can also cut the square one in half to have a micro surface that is great for chair arms and the like.

It is intensely geared towards rail and bus travelers, but many things in Germany are worth renting a car to see--in which case the book will not cover those areas at all. Hotels chosen by the book will be in relation to train stations--which aren't always either a good deal or a restful place to stay.

After having read its 220 pages what can I say? All the useful info could take a mere dozen pages.There is lot of advice that could really be summarized like this: 1) be logical and think about the environment before inventing your race's characteristics; 2) read all you can about ethology; 3) Humans are obviously a scientifically credible race, thus in creating humanoid races you cannot be wrong. Ah great! I am glad to have read a whole book to learn just that.

The book isn't a step-by-step \\"How to Create Aliens\\" guide, so you might be disappointed if you buy it for that reason.

It also deals with making proper stars and planets and what alien science might be like. Could of used more details on the subject of planet building, but there are other works that get into the nuts-and-bolts of that subject. This book touches lightly on alien culture, view points and history, not just the science of building an alien creature. Also, some of it might be outdated with our increasing knowledge of other planets and solar systems. It looks more and more like our idea of planet forming and how systems form might be slightly incorrect (if not out right wrong). That is why I held back a star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aliens and Alien Societies","review":"Excellent product to springboard thoughts on making an alien race for a novel or roleplaying game.

The picture quality of televison broadcasts and DVD movies surpases one of my televisons. If you would like a LCD TV but can't afford thousands of dollars. Get this with a good computer monitor.

It does not stray away from or gloss over the dark humor that high school inevitably draws out nor is it apologetic in its over-the-topness.

This movie really applies to the real life in high school. there are all kinds of groups -nerds, jocks, popular, geeks...I also loved Rachel McAdams' acting, although she is like 28, she still pulled her high shcool character really well. This movie is very funny, and it also teaches a lesson. An important lesson...calling someone fat won't make u any thinner; by calling someone stupid won't make u any smarter. Just be your self and try to accept people around you, even if they are different."},{"rating":"2","title":"*~*mean~girls~movie~review =04=*~*","review":"I thought Mean Girls was a really good film! i would give it 10/10 on a scale!here is my top 5 characters and their best quotes!...1- Karen Smith- \\"if your from Africa why are you not black?\\"2- Regina George- \\"love ya biatch xx\\"3-Cady Heron- {Regina says to her as an excited expression-\\"shut up!shut up!shut up!\\"}, Cady replysconfused- \\"i never said anything?\\"4- Mrs George- \\"so galz whats the 411?\\" & her xmas dance is sofunny aswell!5- Gretchen- \\"its not my fault im beautiful & popular &everyone loves me!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"GREATEST FILM EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I really liked this film when I saw it in theater.The first review from a Amazon customer is not true at all.YOU SHOULD BYE THIS DVD IT IS SO COOL!(...)I know it has some bad words in it but I think kids from 10 and after should see this dvd!It's like totally cool!BUY IT AS QUICK AS YOU CAN IT WON'T DISSPOINT YOU!(...)LOVE THIS DVD!(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprising","review":"I was not excited to see this movie. I eventually cracked and went to see it with my sister. I loved it. It was extremely humourous for a teen comedy. I usually find teen comedies to be detestable, stupid, and poorly acted. However this film is rather humourous and not stupid, like I expected it to be. Lindsay Lohan is not in the least bit annoying and all the characters are funny. The film is also very honest for a teen movie. It's view of high school cliques is dead on and it makes cliques funny, while still making a point. I recommend seeing this, but you might just want to wait for the DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mean Girls","review":"This movie was off the chain.

But am I the only one who finds her shallow 'moral of the story' in the movie, \\"Making fun of other people will get you nowhere\\", a little hypocritical, since she makes fun of people for a living? Im making too much out of a crappy teen girl movie.Basically, everyone in the film is stereotypical right down to the makeup. And the gay guy is too gay. and the \\"rebel\\" girl seems psychotic more then 'different'. and nothing about lindsay lohan makes me think \\"Nice Girl\\". She looks like a diva to me. Even with her boyish good looks.read my other opinions and leave some of your own on www.xanga.com/bogdana"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a children's movie","review":"This movie should have been rated R for language and content. Mean Girls is a horrible movie about girls fighting over boys and popularity. The main character Cady gets mixed in to a crowd of girls called the plastics who get involved in things that kids younger than 16 shouldn't watch and use language that no one should use at all. I would not recomend this movie for a family outing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is A MOVIE!! NOT A BORE!!!","review":"This movie is a reality movie. It tells you about what its like in middle school and what is coming up. This movie had some curses that were used in a good way. But then after using them they were excelled with a punishment.

I am very disappointed. I used to be a fan of hers when I saw her in the Parent Trap movie. I've seen previews for the movie and it doesn't look good. Who would want to sit and watch an hour and a half of fighting? Go to www.screenit.com before you see a movie. There you will learn if it is acceptable for kids to see. If we don't go to see this movie then we will show the movie producers that we don't want this kind of movie and they will start making better movies. Don't go see New York Minute, either. That is a disappoint. However, if you are wanting to see a good, clean and funny movie go see Cheaper by the Dozen or the Lizzie Mcguire Movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My whole family saw this movie in a prescreening on Thursday, 4/22. We left totally disappointed. Why a homeschooled young adult would want to go to a public school is a ridiculous notion. My wife and I have been homeschooling all of our 5 children for the last 10 years. All of my homeschooled children disliked the movie and thought it was unrealistic, vulgar, and wished that we walked out after the first 10 minutes. Lohan plays Katy, the main character, who's socially stupid for a homeschooler. Academically she is outstanding, but has to downplay her intelligence to try and win the attention of a boy and associates herself with Plastic girls. She isn't honest with herself and painfully learns her lesson to be herself and to tell the truth. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off great","review":"I love mean girls, and i was thrilled to find out that it was paired with clueless.

The author brings the characters to life in a manner that helps you quickly take interest, with a continuity to hold that interest through to the last chapter. The style of writing made it easy for me to visualize the surroundings and experience what the characters experienced; which is very important to me. Be prepared for a stimulating tug at your emotions, and some interesting surprises. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the title","review":"I took a chance on buying a new band since almost all of my old favorites have stopped releasing new material or release new stuff only every five or ten years. I'm talking about bands like AC/DC, Motley Crue, Ozzy, Dio, Quiet Riot, Ratt, Wasp, Scorpions, Y&T, Twisted Sister and so on. This band reminds me more of 80's rockers like LA Guns, Warrant, Def Leppard and Winger. The songs are very strong and raw. This release is truly a diamond in the rough for 80's hard rock fans. If you like any of these bands including Sweet Cheater, you will love a couple of other new bands that I recently bought named Smash Alley and Loud N' Nasty. I'm really happy with all three of these hard rock releases especially compared to everything else out there right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"sweetness !!","review":"This cd is really good and worth having,if your into that hard edge soundSongs like romina and summer are really catchy.There's alot of good guitars in here a well.This is similar to the likes of hericane aliceand roxy blue.But it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Volatile","review":"Envy are one of those bands that although sung in a different language(they're Japanese if you didn't know) you can feel the emotion bursting from every screamed and spoken word. For a second there is no language barrier, you know exactly what they are trying to convey. Not many other bands i've heard have put so much emotion into a disc as Envy does, they're like an extremely volatile bomb, one touch and they violently explode. Both epic and devastating this is one album you don't want to miss(along with all of their others).

I can't comment on the quality of the dresser itself, as I made no effort to assemble it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly scary","review":"I can't agree with the other reviewer. I found many of these stories scary precisely *because* they were based in metaphorical hells - hells we might actually live in, rather than encounter after death.

This one makes you think AND feel. It starts with the protagonist, Menachem Daum lamenting that religion in general is in danger of being taken over by hate-filled extremists. We find that Daum's two sons are Yeshiva students who have no particular desire to associate with those who aren't Jewish.\`Perhaps, through their grandfather, perhaps, through their studies, they've developed the mindset that non-Jews are basically dangerous and that it's best to erect a barrier between them. This is a journey as father reunites his children with the Polish couple who risked their lives to save the children's grandfather and uncles.The story drags in part, but press on. The end more than accommodates the lack of professional editing, and it has a few life lessons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relaxing, fun and a good challenge :-D","review":"Keli Roberts is one of the best instructors. She's brought us another great workout. It's kind of unique because of the foam roller. It massages almost all of your muscles (and some you didn't know you had) and it's very relaxing. As you get rid of your knots, you are also becoming a little more flexible as it's great for helping you to improve your range of motion. You can adjust the roller's position to get a deep tissue massage or gentle relaxation.In this you'll work your abs and total core and feel really good afterwards. It is about 30 minutes and so it's perfect for using at the end of a stressful day. I'm loving mine and it will make a great treat for yourself or a friend because almost everyone can do this routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the Orange version","review":"Hopefully the new version has this corrected, but I purchased the orange-covered version in 2008.

This was the only one she liked.While today it is dated -- we'd have so MANY more means of advertising, and we DO use them -- the principles and thoughts behind this book still pertain.The book is fast-paced, adventurous, and does not omit the social commentary about a world gone bozo over adverts. There is humor as well. No, not great literature, but I'm still giving it a 5, considering what it revealed to me in the world of words on a page when I was quite young."},{"rating":"2","title":"truly stands the test of time","review":"Written 50 years ago, you might expect this book, set in \\"the future\\", to be hopelessly trite and dated, but it holds up remarkably well. If anything, many of the issues in the book resonate more today than they may have when it was first published. The characters are believable and well constructed, and Pohl gives them a story to tell that moves quickly. He avoids the pitfalls of some authors who write future-based morality plays -- there's no preaching or sidebar pontificating here, just a very good read.

Moreover, for obvious commercial and legal reasons it is impossible to make any quality or value judgements in print. So what can an author (who admits to be a \\"power tool junkie\\") do when writing a 260 peage book on power tools? Well, our author took the easy way out of the dilemma: Load the book with beautiful pictures of new and old tools and supplement that picture album with some basic and superficial text. The end result is a beautiful sales brochure incorporating all brands not just most popular ones. If you wish to get a brief description of what the market has to offer in power tools, then this is the book for you. If you wish to learn more and seek the answer to questions like how are power tools constructed internally, how to distinguish their quality and durability and how to use these tools efficiently, then this is not a book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jernigan History","review":"I found this book at our local library. It is out of print and I am currently looking for a used copy. It is a Jernigan history and I did find my own ancestors listed there with incorrect information listed on my grandmother's family. As the author was visiting the old homesites of the Jernigan ancestors, she wrote her feelings about the visit. That was my favorite part as it reminded me somewhat of John Boy Walton's writing in the t.v. show. This book would definitely be recommended by me to any Jernigan family members along this line.

His work on the subject of the Jews is interesting. I disagree with his stance on proofs of nature and some of His views God's restorative plans for Isreal, but who had views for God to restore Isreal 300 years ago?If you like reading books, this one is diffrent and well thought out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Salt Desert Tales of Genius","review":"\\"Great God Pan - Salt Desert Tales\\" sandblasts off layers of smog and grime that have been clotting up the West for the past hundred years. This is a history that has been abandoned or neglected, and when one delves into these tales a clear appreciation of this idiosyncratic region takes hold. These stories are not mere anecdotal tales, but stories with unlikely heroes, impossible eccentrics, and visionary madmen. The best part is that all of this is true. The writers of this book have gone to considerable lengths to find histories of the West that step outside of the traditional homage to the individualist, Western Expansionist prototype."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spinoza Der Maler","review":"My favorite performances of the various Kammermusik are on old lps, often very modernist and edgy. An old one with Peter Rybar as soloist comes to mind, for instance. I got this set a while ago but it is very different. There is a vigor to the readings and yet everything is played sub specie aeternitatis. Almost like a fascinating modernist filigree in the heavens. The effect is odd, but enjoyable, as if the performers -- or more likely, conductor -- had the opening filigree of Mathis der Maler in mind as a guide. Again, odd but enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling Music","review":"This is for sure a great sample of 20th century music.

I found the dialogue to be witty and creative many times, but the artifical cast and phony scenes made it seem completely self-serving and flat. I do understand the characters were intended to be shallow and often laughable, but something more than surface glibness would have been nice. Sevigny's character was the only one with any humanity or depth. While it can be a good time to laugh at the self-absorbed, two hours of watching ineffectual, spoiled kids from NYC lost its appeal. Besides, I highly doubt the velvet ropes of high-profile late 70's & early 80's clubs would have parted for the lukewarm Ivy League guys in this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, Not Subtle--Simply Awful.","review":"I'm amazed at the number of reviews I've read here that descibe the \\"witty dialogue\\" in this film, or that describe it as a \\"representative piece\\" for the 1980s. Good Lord, I sat through this film last night, and it was the most vapid movie I've seen in quite awhile. I waited--in vain--for the dialogue to become witty and insightful. I generally love films with a lot of dialogue, but this was a \\"talky\\" film that had very, very little to say. I began to think that the point was, perhaps, that these characters were so shallow that they had nothing of note to communicate to one another. If that's the case, this could have been done with more style and with some semblance of a plot or character development. The actors sound like they're trapped in a bad high school play--indeed, I think I've seen high school and community theatre productions that were more engaging than this pretentious waste of film stock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should come with a dictionary!","review":"For those that lived the era of the Megadiscos this movie is silly! The story line is entertaining yet sometimes hard to follow with all the names being tossed around with $12 words. Imagine a writer who writes about something he has only heard about yet never experienced and you get the feel of the movie. Music that spreads a gap of about 10 years for a club scene set in the early 80's. Dress that also is reminiscent of 1970's but also of 1990's? (What's with the Tommy Hilfiger \\"rapper\\"head bandana on the ONE gay couple? )One profound statement exists in the film however, how some will look back on a very influential era and only see John Travolta with his finger in the air in a polyester suit, hedonistic values and widespread drug use. Ah..memories......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moves slowly at first... ok ...but not quite as good as the sexy cover shot!","review":"The best part about the movie is the cover. Kate Beckinsale looks grrrreat! Chloe can act as well.

No way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte is fun to watch","review":"but Charlottes are no fun in real life. This movie was easier going down than Metropolitan but Metropolitan may be a better movie and Last Days of Disco just more entertaining. In the back of the mind while I was focusing on Carolyn Farina, I got the feeling that the people in Metropolitan weren't very nice although they were nice towards each other. In Last Days of Disco, they weren't nice to each other but they sometimes seemed nicer than the ones in Metropolitan. Barcelona doesn't count because it's two American guys in Spain so of course, the Spanish are nice and throw off the curve. I had no sympathy for Alice although I've been on the receiving end of Charlottes. I just enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in a variety of black dresses.Charlotte points out \\"Audrey Roget\\" by name so no worries if you are watching for Cynthia Farina's cameo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Available on Region 2 DVD","review":"I'm not going to write a review, as many others have done that (though I love the film), but I wanted to let people know that in Summer 2006 it was re-released in France. The video may be watched in English without french subtitles, but the disc is a Region 2 disc, meaning it can only be watched on a computer (if you're willing to switch from Region 1 to 2) or on a DVD player that is region free and can convert from PAL to NTSC color. Anyway, as of this writing, the DVD is very cheap on Amazon.fr, and may be the only way to get it on DVD for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like watching paint dry.","review":"I could only stand about 45 minutes of this garbage.

I hate when they do period pieces and then they can't get it right. Forced \\"disco songs\\" wardrobe was terrible. Characters were not compelling and boring. If you want disco, get the American classic, Saturday Night Fever. It had nothing to do with Disco, so the title was not appropriate. Putting the average top 20 overplayed disco songs in a movie doesn't make it disco. This movie did NOT capture the disco era at all. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute pants. Avoid this movie like the plague.","review":"Surely the most overrated movie of all time. I had heard rave reviews about Last Days of Disco, and was eager to watch it. I saw it as part of a school trip and was bored within the first ten minutes. More interesting than the film was the competition Alex and I had trying to hide under chairs! (Yes, we were that bored.) We couldn't wait for the film to end. Our feelings were shared with the other fifty or so students on the trip, and all the teachers! If you watch this you must really want to waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid and self-indelgent","review":"I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie.

I only gave it one star because that was the lowest rating that could be given. The people were vain, selfish, and immature. The dancing was poor, the music was not mediocre, and the plot was thin to not existent. Generally in a Dancing Movie, the music is good and the dancing is great, IE Saturday Night Fever, Flashdance, Dirty Dancing to name a few. But this movie just was poor all the way around and had no redeeming points. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable as entertainment","review":"I have read various reviews of this film and find most to be articulate and praiseworthy. I enjoyed the movie, both for the story and music. I remember those years vividly and though the characters were self-absorbent they were the lead in to the \\"me\\" generation. The story was simple but moving. The characters were alive and the depth of their neoursis was apparent in all. Not many movies live up to expectations- this one did."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST Disco Movie Ever!","review":"This movie is NOT about Disco nor Studio 54! Do not be misled.It is mostly about 2 girls who happen to go to Studio 54 to dance and socialize period.

Run far, far away.","review":"Being a writer myself, I can appreciate the talkie movie. Your Friends and Neighbors is a perfect exampe of a talkie movie that works. The Last Days of Disco is not. The dialogue isn't very witty, the subject matter is boring, the characters lack any flare, and plot is merely a structure to hold together countless uninspired conversations. Watch Barcelona or Metropolitan, much better films.

Some minor but unoriginal insights.Slick production values. The scenes accurately recreate early 1980s Manhattan (when I worked there).But the dialogue and characters are so unbearably shallow, it's not worth wading through the film's nearly 2 hours for those few good moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Dialogue","review":"If you enjoy well-written, intelligent wit, then you'll love The Last Days of Disco. Full of sharp, enjoyable dialogue, The Last Days of Disco tells the story of three roommates and their relationships in and around the club scene of New York in the waning days of the disco era. As others have stated, Chloe Sevigny is stunning in the lead role. This definitely isn't for the Dumb and Dumber crowd, but if you enjoy having your mind tickled as well as your funnybone, then you'll enjoy the Last Days of Disco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoshi a cuddly toy","review":"I bought this for my grandson who lives in another State but it is what he wanted so I am hoping he liked it.

They do last longer than Epson's own cartridges, but beware: they clog the printhead frequently! I wasted lots of pricy color ink as well as black ink having to run the printhead cleaning operation every other day. As an occasional user, printing a few pages each day or two, I felt like I was burning more ink than I was printing. Also, the Rhinotek inks produce an ammonia-like smell on freshly printed pages. I've switched back to Epson black ink. The print is just as rich, clogs happen way less frequently now, and my pages don't smell foul.

I ended-up throwing my copy away, because the sexual content is just WAY too strong.

Great insight, passion, smart....wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incongruous and thought provoking","review":"My idea of an FBI agent is of a taciturn hero with both feet firmly planted on the ground. April Smith's Ana Grey is not the FBI agent that I imagined she would be or possibly as mature a person as she should be, but she is a compelling character and one I would like to see more of. The various subplots regarding Ana's family history, personal relationships, and the major case she is assigned to keep you going and in the end leave you satisfied and yet ... the tendrils of the story and the characters have a life of their own and go on in your imagination. Not every author can manage this. April Smith does it well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The One","review":"I panned one of April Smith's other novels \\"Be the One\\" as just an average read. I should have started with \\"North of Montana\\" instead. This hard-hitting novel is penned in a much crisper and more compelling narrative style. The storylines, the characters, the setting are much more realistic and blend together seamlessly. This is one terrific novel.Ambitious young FBI agent Ana Grey is assigned to a high-profile case involving an aging Hollywood mega-star and her prominent doctor who allegedly hooked her on prescription medication. Having to prove herself in this male dominated environment Grey has to navigate between her superiors' doubts, her own insecurities and sobering questions about her past.Excellent narrative, great dialogue, good plot and well-defined characters make \\"North of Montana\\" a highly, highly recommended read.

Narrative poems, for the most part, but more fluid than the narrative poems I usually run into, and more mysterious. One senses Eimers could hammer us bloody with her power and energy in these poems, yet there is a lightness of touch I admire. This author sets you gently into the middle of a black hole--scary--but then it's beautiful (sometimes sad) and when you walk out into the sunshine afterwards you feel exalted. Like Lucia Perillo, who she is somewhat similar to (but much more hauntingly visual than), I expect she'll soon be picked up by a large press and get the recognition she deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Helpful","review":"This has been very helpful with all the shrubs, vines, trees, etc I have around the house.

A three week wait to be disapointed I would rather view, maybe go home and think about it, have another look and convince myself that it is a book I would have in my reference library.

The picture shows even bright color throughout and it's not like that in person. I am disappointed with the appearance of this desk as compared with the picture. There were no directions for the chair in my box and you have to drill your own holes and get creative to put both the desk and chair together. Not a novice project."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality for the money","review":"This desk arrived in a very beat up box. Sure enough, when I opened it, the desk had a serious ding in the hardwood top and two of the drawers were busted. The ad states that this is a hardwood product, but that is misleading. All of the drawers are made with press wood, and the two that were broken split where the press wood was stapled together. Cheap! Also, the instructions are terribly simplistic and I had parts that were mislabeled. It took me twice as long as it should to put it together because the instructions were so bad. There is also a butterfly accessory that is supposed to be mounted on the back stop, but there was no hole pre-drilled for mounting it, nor was it even mentioned in the instructions. Finally, the pink color is not really pink as the picture shows. All in all, this desk is a poor value and should be priced about half what it is for what you get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I ordered this because I liked the colors and design in the pictures. However, it came with a missing back-support for the chair and the decoration fish. I ordered a replacement and that too was missing the chair piece.

I have pictures that I will upload once I figure out how.The packaging had styrofoam that was aching to crumble. Made a mess at my house entrance. I was sorely disappointed since I had great expectations, having liked the design and colors so much. I wish they would put in just a little more effort.

Sure it made alot at the box-office, but that doesn't mean it's a good movie. It means that dozens of zombies with no taste fled to the box office as soon as they seen the overly praising previews. Jack Black is the only saving grace in this movie, my mistake, NO ONE is the saving grace in this movie.

The script is laughably dumb and not cute at all, and the play on ethnicity (Oscar is black, the sharks Italian, Zykes Jewish [?]) borders on being disgusting. Well, if it had been cute and enjoyable like Pixar/Disney films these could have been overlooked and forgiven, but it simply falls flat and leaves a rotten after taste in the end. I was very disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been So Much Better!","review":"I have no problems with the fact that this film was obviously written for an adult audience with hopes that kids would enjoy the animation as well. Who says only kids enjoy a good animated/computer-generated movie? And excellent animation it is -- beautiful scenery!!! I just found the movie a bit dull.

It's probably better to rent Dreamworks DVDs from now on. That's to bad, because we enjoyed many animated movies by Dreamworks. It's an annoyance that bugs me more than it should -- but on the other side I pay for the DVD movie not for Dreamworks' commercials. They can make it easy to skip, or put it at the end.

The number of stereotypes as well as clichéd situations, trite lines, and idiotic storyline must have been the inspiration for Princess and the Frog (thankfully I heard the bad reviews and didn't waste my time watching that catastrophe.) There are smart, witty, kiddie movies. But I suppose there have to be train wrecks. DreamWorks should be embarrassed for drawing such gross racial lines and trying to profit on alienation. The moral of the story was amateur for even children.

Fish just don't look good humanized. It's not this film was big winner anyway. The thing I hate the most is a missy elliot fish and Christina Auguleria fish appear, what has happened to computer animation.

I understand that most of the people that are doing the voice-overs in it are Oscar-nominated actors and winners, and some people think that's enough for the movie to get going. WRONG!!I felt like this was a hyped-up version of Finding Nemo, though the soundtrack was a little better than the movie itself. Kids would like it, but they'd probably try to make comparisons between this movie and Finding Nemo, though the stories are different. Or at least that's what my little cousin did.

This is highly annoying - even more so on a DVD I payed good money for. Doubly annoying, one of the non-skippable trailers is even for the same movie as a non-skippable trailer on the Shrek2 DVD.

How to accpet your children for what they turn out to be and be happy about it.Voice acting and animation was good, thus the 2 stars. Most of the characters were lame, up to and including those 2 stupid jellyfishes. The Times Square layout of the reef and the hint of mafia in New York was also an underlying theme, which was almost Godfather-like in a comical sense.The plot was a typical Hollywood love story plot, poor fish has a girl, can't see she's in love with him, wants to become a celebrity, but turns out to be a lie, until proven wrong etc, etc, etc.Finally, this movie is purely for the innocent kids out there who want to marvel at the animation and a good laugh, and who still can't get enough of Finding Nemo.

It emphasizes an important value about being yourself and your parents loving you for who you are.

And you can learn how to dance like the characters on the Club Oscar Feature. (YEAH NOW I CAN DANCE LIKE M.C HAMMER). Also all the fish act ghetto.

The jokes never succeeded in making me laugh, the celebrity voices were distracting and very unnecessary, and the movie itself is tedious. And I mean TEDIOUS! I almost couldn't take it anymore. A Troll in Central Park had something more interesting than this, and that's really saying something. And oh boy, you'll be begging for all these characters to go away. They're as annoying and uninteresting as the ones you find in the ever-dreadful Disney Channel. I give credit for the film's decent 3D animation, though; that was the one that avoided me from completely hating this movie. But yeah, I'm sure the kids will love this. But when it comes to teenagers and adults, this will be a devastating disappointment.

Orginally seeing the adds for Shark Tale I had the hope that it would be \\"Finding Nemo\\" meets Shrek but, it wasn't... this a generic rip off of the craze that came from Nemo and added with a few cheesy lines.The kids I saw this with all hated it and the only good thing in this movie was seeing the cute Vegan Shark(who is hardly seen in the movie it focuses more on Will Smith's fish). The animation is just crummy not up up to the usual Dreamworks standards you see in the Shrek movies and the voice talents although good fail to save this movie!But, what do you expect from a movie that focuses on vegetarian sharks and fish? The storyline is predictable and over-dramtised at times... The worst bit of this movie were when the pop songs came up. All in all this not a movie I would waste my money on rent or buy Nemo or Shrek instead! And slay Shark Tale from your mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's just so much wrong","review":"I agree with those saying this is like a Rap Video set under the sea (in a fantasy world) and starring badly animated fish.The animation is pretty bad, especially after seeing Pixar films like 'Finding Nemo' or 'The Incredibles' where it's top notch.There's no story to speak of. It's all so forgettable. It's riddled with every stereotype and cliche you can think of.

I sat thru this boring, shallow story hoping it would get better and it just got worse.

Unfortunately - there are only so many Pixar releases and so I search for films and other content that is suitable and of a high standard. Shark Tale is neither of these. In fact our family movie afternoon turned into two napping adults and a child wandering off to his room to play. Since then - unlike any of the Pixar titles which get watched faithfully all the way through - Shark Tale is the DVD I can put on when I want my son to do something else - like go outside and play. If you want to drive your child away from the screen - buy this DVD. If you want to give your child an excellent DVD viewing experience - buy the Incredibles, the Toy Stories, the Brainy Baby DVDs - but DON'T buy them Shark Tale. Not even the cat wants to watch these fish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring for the whole family","review":"My definition of \\"good family film\\" is something that the entire family enjoys. \\"Shark Tale\\" fails miserably.

I give it a 4 star rating because for a cartoon, this film is both funny and entertaining. Even without the aid of celebrity voices, Shark Tale would still earn 4 stars in my book.

First of all, there isn't much Christianity in it, but I can handle that if it's a really well-turned and interesting story - which it isn't. It's flat, a little boring, and uneventful. The lead character is extremely vague and weak in his acting (not just in his actual character in the movie). All the way through the story, I was rooting against the protagonist...! There isn't much to make you sympathize with him, except for the fact that he went through a divorce, which you don't really get to experience with him, so all we see is this weak character with a highly sentimental attitude. The good parts in this movie are the people telling him to do exactly the opposite of what he wants to do, plus some good comments by his mentor about why God allows people to go through something like that. But, everything taken into consideration, if you want a Christian love story, watch Fireproof or No greater love instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to like this movie","review":"I saw the trailer for this movie about a year ago, maybe more. I was looking forward to it but when I watch it with my mother I was pretty let down.The Acting was good but the characters just weren't believable. The situations were a little too far fetched and the main character's behavior was just downright stalkerish. The female lead's character was enjoyable but seemed way too forward for it to seem real. I won't spoil it by going into detail but if you've seen the movie you know what I mean.The main focus of the movie is divorce and dealing with the pain. This is a pretty relevant topic but the movie gave no real answers for people dealing with the pain of divorce or separation. For a Christian movie to leave out something as vitals as this was a complete let down.In the end it isn't something that I would watch again or recommend, sadly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I ordered this DVD for my Dad's wife, who has wanted to get it since she first heard about it.

I'm not sure I'll remember it forever, but I think this story will stay in my memory banks for a long time. It's a love story so that angle is nothing new. The plot was unique, though, and the two love interests were two very attractive and very likeable people whom I had no trouble cheering for as they walked the circuitous route to discovering that they were in love. This story was a bit contrived, in my opinion, causing me to only rate it four stars. Things like booking an expensive airline ticket to see someone, without calling to ensure they are available bug me. Perhaps I'm too pragmatic to be incurably romantic. The message of the movie involved divorce recovery, a topic for which too many people have first hand experience and a need. This movie can help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only if your divorced or going through one...","review":"If your going through a divorce or divorced that's the only way you will sit through this movie.

While it allows numbers to be entered in scientific notation, it doesn't have a feature to show the result of a calulation in scientific notation. With a 10 digit display, it can be hard to figure out if 100000000 is 1 billion or 100 million. Lack of comma's to group digits into 3's also hurts. I ended up buying a CASIO FX-115MS, which does have the scientific notation and comma's.If the TI had the comma's and scientific notation, it would beat the CASIO hands down for ease of use, and also contruction. I also like the fact that it remembers prior calculations even after auto-powering down.

The TI-84II was something I've wanted for a long time and have seen in action, and it is very good, so I do give it as good as review as I can without trying it out.

It is about a lack of money, and it is about far more. It is also about the myth that if one works hard that one will not be poor. In fact, most persons who are poor do work hard. Most hard work is rewarded at a low level of pay because our system rewards the employer who pays at the lowest level that can be achieved.The author discusses the problem of Asthma in America caused primarily by the poor living in cities and in poor housing. He also discusses malnutrition in America.The more money we invest in our children, the lesser amount of money we will need to invest in prisons. More than that, if we will reduce the poverty of millions of children then we will have a much more wonderful society in which to live. Our society works in part like a chain-link fence. That is, the overall quality of our society is no better than the weakest link in our \\"chain-link fence\\" of security for our citizens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you think twice","review":"I requested this book from the library after seeing an episode of Nightline with Ted Koppel.This book really does make you stop and think about how different our lives really are in America.

Now, when I go to the fast food window or to a Kmart or Walmart, I realize that many of these workers are not getting paid well, and probably cannot even afford to shop at the stores they work in, or buy food at the fast food place either.I'm not the best writer, but please take a look at this book if you get the chance.

And in fact the term \`working' is improperly addendumed to the word \`poor' in this book. Many poor people, this book ignores them, are not working at all, they are simply sitting around.

Somehow they managed to project a full wall of sound, while still conveying the precision of each instrument (this held true particularly on their masterful first album). And what musicianship!

He is one of those few thriller writers who relies on good old fashioned WRITING. No cheap tricks, no serendipitous coincidences, no whiz-bang save-the-world with only seconds to go. No, Robert Wilson takes his time, develops his characters, unravels his complicated plot, leavens each page with great wordsmithing and, in so doing, presents the reader with a treasure. This book, however, is not perfect. There are so many characters that he thoughtfully provides a cast of characters at the end of the book. And the pacing of the novel bogs down right at the outset, but like a big train engine, the novel rolls down the tracks, gaining momentum that, by the end of the book, seems unstoppable. I liked this book because it was a good read and it didn't insult my intelligence."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing story","review":"After having been very disappointed with Robert Wilson's \\"A Small Death in Lisbon,\\" I really enjoyed reading \\"The Vanished Hands.\\" It is a psychological murder mystery, set in a sizzling hot Summer in Seville, Spain. The book is well written, with intriguing, mostly believable characters. Once you get into it, it is hard to put down. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush setting, great food, improbably entertaining","review":"Set again in Seville, featuring the late-blooming homicide detective Javier Falcon, this mystery novel covers most of the bases: art, the CIA, missing witnesses, the Russian Mafia, police corruption, a pedophile ring, a nun turned cop, a fancy suburb, not a few murders and lots of wonderful food. Improbably entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thrilling read that keeps you on your toes","review":"Great read. Large scale plot which makes it hard to guess what's coming next and who to watch out for. Lots of twists and turns and interweaving plot lines.Mostly set in Seville - you get a real sense of the city. Follows on really well from Blind Man of Seville. I've now read no 3 in the series and can't wait for no 4!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality that's as high as the body count","review":"I often feel that the higher the body count in a mystery, the lower the quality of writing. This book sure tosses that theory into the trashcan. It opens with what appears to be a horrific murder/suicide which may well be a double murder instead, especially with the discovery of a possible suicide note making allusions to 9/11. BTW, this is a misleading clue and I'll let the reader discover just why it is. Suffice to say, you'll learn something interesting because of the clue. I don't want to give away more of the story than I already have, but I especially recommend this to the seasoned mystery reader looking for a truly challenging crime story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The foolproof guide to wasting $19.95","review":"There is nothing in this book that will really help a guy to meet or keep a woman, unless he has been living in a cave for the past 50 years and has absolutely no common sense.

The world's top Egyptologist takes you to the most exciting temple in Egypt !!..... Ever since my first trip to Egypt in 1985, Abu Simbal has been my favorite place. The huge temples carved out of the mountainside, (which were moved when the Aswan High Dam was built), are incredable works of art and architecture...... This book aptly illustrates the beauty of the 60 - foot states of Rameses the Great, and his beloved wife, Nefertari...and Dr. Zahi Hawass brings to life the stories depicted in the carvings inside the temples...... There are also the photos of the 4 statues in the sanctuary of the larger temple, which are illuminated by the rising sun twice a year....... Dr. Hawass, the Director of the Egyptian Antiquities Department, brilliantly captures the wonder of this event in this book......

But as someone who bought SING FASTER entirely on their recommendations, may I warn any prospective buyers that this DVD falls somewhere between the level of back-stage \\"home-movies\\" and a one hour Reality Show consisting of stage-hands playing cards and watching TV during tech rehearsals of THE RING. If either of these things sounds \\"hilarious\\" to you [or worth $24!], go for it. But I would suggest renting it on Netflix before parting with your hard-earned dollars.

Now I have to open the printer, re-seat the cartridge, and let it clean itself, every time I print.

I was looking for information on fun things to do with kids in Italy. This book is more about travelling to fancy resorts and eating in fine restaurants while your kids tag along. I was turned off instantly when the book recommended bringing gameboys! The authors seemed more interested in shopping, sports cars and fine dining, than cultural or active pursuits tailored to families. The book is more of a hotel guide with average room prices of $300/night, and not a very good one at that. It is difficult to determine exactly where each recommended property is located.

I can't imagine anyone who might find this book useful in any way, unless you've got scads of cash and can't find a better way of spending it.

I returned the card and got a new one. Same result. This time, emails to tech support weren't answered. I was hoping for some kind of suggestion, or a patch or any help.

Her treatment in her central Virginia parishes by parishioners and others in authority and the inexplicable hands-off attiude of the Virginia bishop, offer one truly shocking and deeply disturbing view of the author's beloved Episcopal Church. An unusually gifted, kind, unassuming priest, with a virtually unique history (for an Episcopal priest at the time) of working in prisons (she was a teacher at Lorton Reformatory for two years), regularly visited prisoners, and with her husband gave concerts for prisoners in Washington, DC, and Alexandria, Virgina, at the same time preaching and teaching on a sophisticated intellectual level, Nancy James' story is inspiring.

However, as I went on reading the book, I find it frustrating and uninteresting. It's hard to write a book with a boring life (no offense, Mr. McCaws). But rather than diving into how the McCaws from not a nerd, a technologist, or futurist becomes successful, the author tries really hard (but unsuccessful) to make McCaws as a great visionary. If you look at the reference section in the book, you will see that most materials for this book came from newspaper. The author has to admit in his book that McCaws didn't spend much time to be interviewed either. Besides, some readers might find the book funny and silly in a technical point of view. Well, I have a feeling that the author doesn't have much insights on the wireless industry. I just read \\"AOL.COM\\" before reading this book.

For those who are already troubled by the Church's teachings, Kennedy's rhetorical flourish will seem insightful. For those who wish to think more deeply about the strengths and weaknesses of the Church's teachings, Kennedy offers little of substance. The Church needs to find a way to have an open and healing dialogue between those who accept the Church's teachings and those who do not. Unfortunately, Kennedy's book can only widen the gap between them... which is particularly unfortunate since the book's title suggests that the author recognizes how much we are in need of healing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge logical flaw","review":"This book is well written and holds the readers attention. In it, Kennedy presents a well argued and powerful case. Unfortunately, his argument is deeply flawed. For his thesis to make any sense at all one must assume that Catholic priests are more likely than is the general population to committ acts of sexual abuse.Where is the data? The data that does exist (see Phillip Jenkins of Penn State and Thomas Plante of Stanford U.) suggests exactly the opposite is the case. Despite all the media hoopla priests are, if anything, less likely than the general population to commit sexual abuse of minors. That being the case, how can sexual abuse be the result of the Church's teachings and practices?So, in the final analysis, Mr. Kennedy's book presents an interesting theory which has no objective data supporting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No illustrations","review":"This review is for the kindle edition.Unlike the other reviewer who had no working TOC, but had illustrations, my copy had a functional TOC and NO illustrations.

I was in a bookstore looking for another book, but ended up walking out with Wilberforce's enduring classic. I first encountered Wilberforce when reading a biography of the American abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison. Since that time I have had the opportunity to read the life story of the English Great Emancipator himself. Wilberforce may have been small and frail in physical stature but his moral stature is that of a giant. For decades, Wilberforce, an MP in the British Parliament, labored toward two great ends: 1. To abolish the slave trade and slavery itself within Great Britain. 2. To change the decadent and decaying moral culture of his homeland. Real Christianity was written toward goal #2. On reading Real Christianity it is easy to see why it remained an English bestseller for 50 years! Wilberforce's writing is like the man himself. Compassionate, logical, persuasive, determined, humorous, and fair-minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lower Body Workout!","review":"I would consider myself very active and fit - I run 15-20 miles a week and do P90x or Insanity daily - and I felt the burn!

However, by October 2012, the pump seized and the handle snapped off. It could be ween that the handle was a cheap casting (not a forging).Aside from getting set behind in work (after all, when a pump like this is purchased, it is because it is *needed*), I was generally ignored by Fill-Rite. When I called the company, Fill-Rite, they were not any help regarding warranty and indicated that I needed to find out who the distributor was (Although my purchase was from Amazon LLC, the Fill-Rite rep I spoke to said they did not consider Amazon a distributor.If you are looking for a pump, avoid this model.

I don't find the whoops and hollers distracting. Yes, it is dated, but I've yet to find a new routine that is truly low impact so I use it every week to give my joints a rest while still getting in the workout I need. Despite using it weekly for years, I'm still not bored with it. Because of the way the routine was choreographed, I can always find some way to challenge myself - picking knees up higher, kicking higher, bigger arm movements, using more floor space, etc. You can add wrist weights as you improve your fitness to get your heart rate up higher - just be careful with the arm movements if you do. You must place your arms where you want them rather than throwing them around or run the risk of injuring yourself.

It's an entirely different emotional journey than what one might experience as a child and it's easy to feel completely alone in it. This book provided reassurance, through the voices of hundreds of others, that what I was feeling was completely normal and gave me the courage to believe that I wouldn't be so utterly devastated forever.

If by \\"reproduction\\" they mean \\"crappy photocopied pictures that are really really dark and you can hardly tell what you're looking at\\", then yes, this is a reproduction. It literally looks like they went to Kinko's and photocopied the whole book, faxed it to someone, photocopied the fax, then bound it and put it up for sale.

It barely scratches the surface. The author refers to her \\"research\\" a couple of times in the text, however, it seems shallow. A true understanding and explination of the life and times of this controversial woman is seriously lacking. Not only did it lack analytical depth but it took a very biased (pro-Pompadour) approach. Therefore failing to convey the \\"Big Picture.\\" There was no flow to the verse and it seemed disorganized. The author herself must have known this because she makes reference to the difficulty of organizing the life of Pompadour into an easily followed timeline. The pictures chosen do not help to glimpse into the world of Pompadour. While the author describes many portraits of her there is only one or 2 pics of her. None of which the author stated was the best likeness of her.

Allan Vogel's performance is very warm and insightful. His pianist, Bryan Pezzone, performs no less sensitively. The recording is also rich and warm. These works are all a delight to listen to. The Saint-Saens and Poulenc sonatas express both the charm and wit of these two great French composers. The Britten is the most important work for solo oboe. The Schumann Romances are another masterpiece for oboe and piano. A must for any oboist or music lover! The closing piece, Obsession by Japanese composer Makoto Shinohara is very powerful.

However, recently I am unable to insert discs in the CD slots. I thought maybe a disc had gotten stuck inside, but the eject button just flashes and nothing comes out. The disc will go in half-way, then seems to hit something that prevents it going in all the way. I have looked on the Bose site to see if there is a troubleshooting area but all I find is a phone number to call. And we all know how much help that can be. Anyone else with this problem and a possible solution?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bose Multi CD Changer","review":"My experience is exactly similar to Brian O'Neil's.

I left empty-handed.Turns out the problem is just mine. When the CD Changer is attached to the Wave CD player the system will only stop playing the CDs when you push \\"STOP\\" on the remote! Otherwise the CD or CDs will play endlessly. Or I can disconnect the CD Changer from the main CD Player for those times I want to just play one CD and have it stop when it's done.I said to the tech on the phone and the salesperson in the store that $650.00 is a lot of money for a system that can't just play one, two or more CDs and stop when finished playing.I guess they specialize in superb sound with limited focus on other features. Maybe they feel that the sound is so good that you will want to hear it non-stop!So I will look for something less costly for the bedroom upstairs. I will wait for Bose to \\"fix\\" this \\"problem\\". It seems so basic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"We experienced exactly the same problem with the changer as described by others. Disc error flashes, discs are stuck in the unit and don't eject even with numerous resetting attempts. Upon contacting Bose we were told the same story - send it in for $75.00 repair plus shipping. When we mentioned that this seems to be a common defect judging by all the complaints on the net, the technician seemed to be \\"ignorant\\" of this fact - great acting job. This is not to say that he wasn't polite and is probably told not to admit that this unit has major problems.I love my bose radio with the one-slot CD changer, but advise everybody to stay away from the changer.

Yes, black and white. VHS. Good. I purchased the AmazonPrime offering. WHAT A SHOCK to learn that the film is a COLORIZED version! Not blaming the Seller. And I hate to give any Glenn Ford film less than 5 Stars. But AmazonPrime should designate when a film has been \\"altered\\" with colorization. It's horrible! So Black & White Purists BEWARE: If you order this film, double-check to make sure that you are getting \\"The Real Deal\\" -- a black and white western starring Glenn Ford (who doesn't really look so great with that orange face, courtesy of the kid-paint-box colorization technique)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Western ever made","review":"I can't believe anyone would rate this movie worth five seconds of their time!!!!

Almond's women have mature bodies, sexual needs, and great capacity.

But it's not gratuitous; these are stories that truly drill down into what drives desire, what we're all searching for, and the sometimes misguided ways we go about getting it.I highly recommend this book, especially to people who are tired of \\"careful' short stories that sacrifice passion to subtlety for its own sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Almond is America's answer to Nick Hornby, but My Life in Heavy Metal is not funny, or edgy, or even that interesting.

The collection promises stories of love and longing, and most of the stories do have that theme, yet I couldn't help think of the many, many collections of stories which have done a much better job at this theme.

Mick Fleetwood and John McVie make up one of the strongest rhythm sections in rock and Jeremy Spencer is a solid rhythm guitarist.

What a fantastic voice. The Strauss alone is reason enough to buy this CD. She has it all: power, beauty of tone and truly thoughtful singing. Why do we even bother with the laziness of Eaglen when we have a dramatic soprano like this around?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Voice","review":"I am prejudiced, let me say. I think Alessandra Marc has one of the most gorgeous voices I have ever heard. Some don't enjoy her mannerisms. I'm afraid I do. She does not appear on every selection, and there are the occasional disappointments (the breaths she must take in the climax of Helena's Awakening Scene, for example). The Barber is spine-tingling. Makes me want to hear her do Andromache's Farewell! If her style doesn't appeal, fine. She gives me more pleasure than any opera singer since my beloved Leonie Rysanek. A big, sumptuous voice! It would rate five stars except for the fact that the orchestra/choal episodes are fine, not great. And Marc is not totally comfortable in all the repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Diggity, What a treasure this is!","review":"Please trust me and buy this CD - Alessandra Marc, as another reviewer noted, blows the roof off this concert hall and gives us some of the most beautiful singing ever (I personally think she IS the most beautiful artist around, but to each his own). No matter what kind of voice you prefer, you are sure to find this album packed with emotion and glistening high notes and perfect artistry. Dude and/or dudette - buy this, listen carefully and attentively, and then you can thank me later. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too predicatable","review":"Quite simply, plot twists are fun. Most stories need them to be exciting. The plot twist of all the stories is that someone turns into another creature. You usually can figure out what they are going to turn into in the first page. Most authors in here use that as thei main plot twist and the results are tedious. There are some good stories in here, particularly towards the back of the book. If you have nothing else to read I would start reading from the back and give up about halfway through.

But, I must clear something up. All the reviews I've read for the Global Underground rave about how flawless the mixing is by the particular artist. Well, I hate to burst your bubble, but all of the global underground CD's are mixed by the same guy, in a studio, on a computer. The artist picks the tracklisting, and is the face on the cover of the cd...Thats it. These albums are NOT mixed live, and G.U. has never claimed them to be. But, besides that fact, they are great albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Mix","review":"NIck Warren has really nailed it this time.Starting the first disk off with the best in downtempo and IDM, like the incredible Ulrich Schnauss, and then moving into excellent breaks, while still keeping things mellow with ambient interludes ( the mix from burufunk's 'outsider' into Global Communication's '14:31' is absolute Genius...)The second CD keeps it simple with very solid, deep trance. Definitely good, but the first disc is the keeper...

A step by step of capture, edit, render would be nice. It tells you the general idea of how everything works (with no logical order) and you have to play around to eventually figure it out. I don't think it's possible to even see what the visual effect of a transition is without a long render time.I'm usually a very hands-on learner that doesn't require manuals. But this leaves you floundering, then the manual and help just give you bits and pieces to help you flounder just a little less until you eventually figure it out (maybe).Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie DV 4.0 with fire wire card","review":"Absolute junk.

The problem starts with the text font. Aspen does not clearly distinguish where a case ends and where an editor is writing. The editor's writing, the sections of cases are all written in ths same font, same spacing, and same margins, so that at a quick glance, you don't know if it's part of a case or editorial notes.Con Law is obviously a huge subject, and there are lots of cases, but there are too many cases saying the same thing in here. Editors should just pick one major case to stick in the casebook. Unfortunately, they end up sticking in about 3 or 4 where one would have been fine.The use of rhetorical questions in the notes at the end of some cases is also really annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much talent .............","review":"There is no doubt he is a very talented guitarist.

I'm not looking for pain in music. I look for pleasure mostly, but sometimes for anger or sadness or other emotions to help give me insight into my own. But pain? I've had enough of my own, I don't want more. Sometimes it is inescapable, but I'll never knowingly pursue it.I want music to be about resolution and moving on, not about wallowing in misery.

The other reviews sum it up just fine.But if you like ambient music (and some of the comments below prove that not everyone does) then by all means give the second, ambient disc a shot. These piano pieces are haunting, chilling, moody, dark and downright gorgeous. I play the vocal disc maybe once for every twenty times I play the ambient one.As others say here, it's the perfect music for a cold dark afternoon or evening; a wonderful soundtrack to a brooding mood. An absolute must-have, in my opinion. I'm a hard-core Enophile, but this is right up there with Eno's Ambient 2 (the Plateaux of Mirror), and that's saying something."},{"rating":"2","title":"second best Tosca","review":"I bought this cd yesterday and have listened to it about 6 times already. It was well worth the wait for another cd from them. I think Suzuki is there best offering to date. If your a fan of tosca, K & D, peace orchestra then you will really like this cd, if you are more inclined to be a fan of Tosca alone then you might go either way. The second cd is mostly piano. It flows like one long song of smoked out, chilled piano sessions. I think the second cd is cool on its own but would not recomend it if it was sold seperatly. The main cd has a good live vibe to it and sounds more like a band than previous cds. There is a good amount of vocal work by a variety of featured artists that really work well with the Tosca formula. There are a few songs that sound like they could have been written from the Suzuki sessions. I think anyone waiting this long for a Tosca cd will be pleased with the cd, despite the wait..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great songs - Poor production","review":"I have to say I am a big fan of almost everything put out by G-Stone. I have always been impressed by the studio's high standards and overall quality of production....except in this case. Tosca's latest release is marred by glitches in effects returns, occasional clicks, hiss and generally poor attention to detail. I must say I was quite surprised by the lack of care put into mastering this album, particlarly the second disk. The songs are terrific, but such messy production makes it very difficult for me to get into the groove. Of course, if you have little concern for quality and just want to play this album really loud at a party or club, you will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good trippy chill...","review":"Great CD.

He doesn't hesitate to report on the dark side of mathematicians' battles (both philosophical and personal) with one another.I recommend that one read a more conventional history of mathematics (such as Boyer, Kline or Gratton-Guinness) before attempting this controversial one.Be forewarned that Constance Reid, in her biography of Bell, points out errors in this book.

I suppose that if we could roll the clock back to 1999, you could read this book, start trading and you'd probably feel pretty talented.

I removed it and took it apart, and sure enough the switch was packed with saw dust. Imagine that, a router killed by saw dust! Amazing. I see that the Bosch website emphasizes that it \\"now has a dust proof switch\\". Brilliant. So, be warned that there may still be some units out there with the faulty switch. It's an easy and cheap fix, $15 for the part and shipping, but very frustrating to have to stop work in the middle of the job to fiddle with it, or worse, wait for parts to arrive.UPDATE: I purchased a new switch and received it yesterday.

On a scrap piece I even forced it to see if I could get it to bog down, and it just kept chugging along. My only complaint with this router is the same for all routers.

I thank him for writing this book and for doing all the research required to take it to a higher level. As the back cover states, \\" If you can't get Vladimir Nabakov, Virginia Wolfe, and Gabriel Garcia Marquez together, The Modern Library Writer's Workshop gives you the next best thing.\\" The quotes from great writers are inspiring. They bring the writers alive.Like notes from a great writing workshop, I'll continue to re-read this book. This is definitely one book I'll keep accessible on my desk.If you are interested in other books on writing, I suggest Natalie Goldberg's Writing down the Bones."},{"rating":"1","title":"pressed powder not so pressed","review":"Within 3 days the compact fell apart and crumbled, however the other pressed products that I carry in the same case are still together, and not completely crumbled, so I know it was not how I was carrying it, but that this product is not a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BRONZER!","review":"I've tried a few bronzers, and im not the biggest makeup junkie i really just try to go for a natural look...and this gives me the perfect glow, definitly recommend this color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bronzed","review":"This is a lovely bronzer from Nars.

Because this is the only recording available is not a good reason to give anything above a two. The poor quality of the recording and the generally poor quality of the preformance are often painfull to listen to.I consider myself a great fan of Sir Arthur Sullivan's music and have yet to hear a piece that I didn't like as long as it is preformed well and the sound quality is decent and this album falls short on both counts.Sadly many who listen to this cd will be listening to this opera for the first time and turned off from it for all the wrong reasons.If you wish to buy this cd to simply own all of Sullivans works on disk than buy it but if you wish to own it for listening enjoyment than save your pennies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good as a reference, but Not a programming guide","review":"While this book is a fairly good reference, it certainly is dreadful as a programming guide. Little things annoy throughout, such as the author constantly mentioning new topics only to cop-out and say \\"see Chapter X for more details\\". Some sections have this at the end of every paragraph, which makes is read like 'stereo instructions'. Also, while most programming books are quite dry, this one takes the cake for most 'sleep inducing'- it is a stream of information with no mention of possible uses or implementation. As an ASP/VBS developer I thought it would be easy to move from VBS to VB, but not with this book. Avoid if you are new to visual basic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Replay all the way","review":"I just love my Replay! No monthly service fee, but the coolest feature is the truly remote control -- myreplaytv.com. You can program your recorder from any computer with an internet connection!!! Plus Replay integrates programing from satellite sources with ant/cable sources. That means just one remote lets you choose all your channels without turning off the satellite and tuning the tv. I have a Tivo too. It's ok, but it doesn't record network (at least my model wouldn't). For me, it's REPLAY ALL THE WAY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry I had to give it one star","review":"The replay unit is Wonderful! However, I would never buy it again and will avoid all Panasonic products in the future. If the romote dies, you can no longer use the unit. There are no replacement remotes available and the company does not repair them. This ranks right up there with buying a new car because of a flat tire. JUST DON'T BUY THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TIVO vs REPLAY","review":"I have both units and the TIVO is much better. The TIVO remote is so much easier to use as well as the screens and navigation. I find the REPLAY remote far more complicated than necessary. Both units have the same record time but I tend to use the TIVO more often. Luckily I paid very little for the REPLAY so it's a good value for what I paid ($200 new). Even though I pay 9.95 a month for TIVO, I feel it's a better product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything by Dvorak, the king of melody,moves me!","review":"I am a great fan of Dvorak, and I especially like his Cello Concerto. Over time I had heard many of his Slavonik Dances,but I did not own a recording myself. I just love this recording with its rich tone and rhythm, and I especially like the Slavonic Dance #8. That one is not one of the more familiar ones, but one grows into it.

Thankfully, I bought her a second present as well, because these tamales turned out to be utterly underwhelming. They were bland and tasted mostly of corn meal. The only one that had a little taste to it was the mushroom one. If you get these, I recommend pouring on some hot sauce. The tamales were also quite small. I suppose I've never had true tamales before, but these were nothing like what I expected. They came frozen solid were squished flat. They were about 3.5\\" long and 0.5\\" thick. You would easily have to eat a whole package of them to feel full. Of course, that's not a problem, because they're all frozen into one giant block, resulting in your having to peel them off of one another unless you want to eat all six. The only good thing was they shipped on time and in a nicely packaged box with a large chunk of dry ice. I'm never ordering these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent blend of classical music and rock","review":"The Who music is one of the rock's most advanced and able to be presented in a symphonic way.

The orchestra overpowers Daltrey's vocals, while Daltrey sounds as if he is suffering from a sore throat, as his voice is invariable gruff on all the selections. Guest Linda Perry sings DR. JIMMY, and she doesn't have much talent as a vocalist. Townshend himself sings lead on WHO ARE YOU, and he's a credible singer, but unfortunately he has both the advantage and disadvantage of compatriot Daltrey attaching his own (famed) signature vocal behind it. Daltrey sings lead on all the other selections. On the other hand, if you don't want to be wasting your time and money, the DVD is something I highly recommend and have written a postive review for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced, But What You Gonna Do?","review":"I managed to lose my USB cable for my Olympus DS-2 and was shocked to pave to pay 21.99 for a replacement.

I found it to be engaging and thought provoking. The author reveals some of herself in this book in a \\"down to earth\\" way. I am thankful for her honesty and find it refreshing. Her interviews with hundreds of other women and their quotes speak to power of this topic. Those quotes are worth the price of the book alone. I could not put this book down. Not only did I enjoy reading this book (which we all want in the summer time); I don't feel guilty for reading it because I laughed while learning about myself and the painful topic of shame.

Really!","review":"I can't stand reading self-help books written by authors who \\"have it all figured out.\\" It's dishonest and depressing. This book is powerful because it's based on research (interviews with over 200 real women with real life problems) and written by a women who is honest about how difficult it is to really deal with shame. Her story about bringing dessert to her daughter's school is hysterical.

If you don't know another releases of Dezerter - this one is worth to start from it, because it's a good example of 80's/90's punk rock from Poland. Do you like Dead Kennedys or the Exploited ? Start listening to Dezerter ! If you know their older CD's - I strongly reccomand you to buy \\"Ile Procent Duszy\\" (it means \\"How Many Percent of Soul\\") - it is much better than \\"Kolaboracja II\\" and \\"Blasfemia\\". Generally they play faster, there's more energy in those songs. It's some kind of return to the way Dezerter used to play back in 80's and it's almost as good as \\"Underground Out Of Poland\\" - with \\"technically\\" better performance of sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it.","review":"Oh Lords of music, save us from Weapon of Choice. What these jag-offs have pinched off and served up to to you, the discerning music public, is some warmed over P-Funk, stolen JB riffs, lamo hip-hop and half-speed Fishbone, all slapped together with all the finesse of 1st year marching band practice. And the lyrics?! Dopey party chants, half-baked political/social mumbo jumbo, and just plain annoying vocals make one wish for the coming apocalypse. Given all of the talented, underrated bands fighting for stage time in Seattle and shelf space in the stores (Goodness, Critters Buggin', Modest Mouse, et. al.), the true music fan can only hope that these guys do us all a favor by choking on their own vomit and giving up the mic.

It took a little effort to put it together, but that is reasonable. I would give this cage more stars if the door fit better. It looks like the holes for the hinges were drilled just a little bit off, so the door hangs at a slight angle. It separates from the base by a very small amount - about a quarter inch at at bottom of the door on the latch side. That small amount is just enough to let crickets escape. I don't want crickets in my house, so I move the chameleon to a terrarium to feed him, and now that I think about it, it is just stupid to spend this much on a cage that doesn't completely keep the inhabitants inside. So I just took away another star. I'd advise the R-Zilla guys to drill their holes more carefully, and inspect their work before it ships out.Except for that little problem, it's a pretty nice cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"If I'd had the chance to flip through this in the bookstore, I never would have bought it.

Furthermore, an hour long TV program can be watched in about 45 minutes when you skip through the commercials. The only drawback to the unit is the lack of a fan. I found that it gets extremely hot when in my stereo cabinet, even with a few inches of space on all sides and top. By keeping it on top of the cabinet it runs MUCH cooler.

The war continues and no one sees it ending anytime soon.If you liked the first in this series, you'll definetly like this book.

Very well written and also very hard to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This is a very different book then the first no more boys at play no more silly princesses pacing around experiencing courtly love all the boys are men and everyone has come a long way from Crydee. The Riftwar has been raging for almost 6 years when the novel opens Tomas is now a great war leader scriting close to the edge of sanity. Pug is enslaved on the home planet of the Rift War aliens but his part in the story is not done yet.Overall-This half of the book is much stronger then the first symbolizing both how the characters have matured and how Feist has matured as an author. The only problem I have with the book is with most Feist books later on the climax is much too convenient and comes on too quickly. Still a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Sequel to the First Book","review":"I would have to say that Feist starts out great and only gets better and better the more books he writes.

On the day where all the 13 year old boys are chosen for a career by the head honcho's, Pug gets chosen by the magician. In the first half he has trouble with his magic, but in the second half he really kicks some ass and gets the girl.

Awesome.","review":"I loved this book from beginning till end. A friend pulled me on to this series and I thought Apprentice was OK, not great, but a decent read. But Magician really stepped it up for me. I liked how each character stood up in the book and could carry their own section and keep it memorable and wanting to read. This is somewhat unlike Jordan in his saga, but this is just my opinion I guess. The book does come off as showing everyone kind of hooking up, but I liked it. I thought one of the best chapters I have ever read was between Tomas and his \\"self\\" I should say, trying not to ruin it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feist's Best Book","review":"Pug a seemingly sub-average boy from the rusic duchy of Crydee.

The most exciting parts about the book are the battles and heated discussions included in it. At times, though, I found myself reading on only to get back to the parts about Milamber.

She reminds of my girlfriend. I respect the balanced nature of Pug the young magician. I am in awe of Tomas the holder of powers of two worlds.

Fiest is definatly one of the masters of fantasy. To read more of him, pick up the other three books in the Riftwar Saga, the trilogy from Kelewan, and his new books.

Now called Milamber, he learns of a great evil that is eager to destroy the world he now serves, and his distant home world Medkemia.One of the best novels I have read of this nature.

The cheap plastic collar is at best three threads deep and thus only barely screws onto the visual back or reducer. When one loosens the diagonal to rotate the eyepiece, it is very easy for the diagonal to completely fall off and drop to the ground along with your expensive and heavy eyepiece.

And when the author isn't sure of how the name came about, he presents several possible alternatives.As many of the stations are named for the neighborhoods that they serve, you learn a lot about the city as well as the transit system. Some of the narratives will surprise you. I always wondered, what kind of crazy name is \\"Tooting Bec\\"?

The questions are helpful because they helped me to focus on the important topics in biology. I also found the following to be great references.The Ultimate Study Guide for Biology: Key Review Questions and Answers with Explanations volume 1 and volume 2The questions in the last two study guides helped me to test myself for what I did or didn't know before taking my exams.

I think the battery is supposed to last 5-8hrs away from the car. The software is pretty versatile and it lets you do a lot. My biggest complaint is that it is very slow. I'll be typing in a name to help filter my destination choices, and if it is more than 5-10 miles away, it takes forever for it to show up. I end up not knowing if the destination (say McDonalds) doesn't exist nearby, or if I just spelled it wrong. Additionally when I pass up a turn I don't want to make, it goes into \\"Recalculating...\\". Then it finishes in time to tell me to turn right just as I'm driving through the intersection....\\"Recalculating...\\" again. I think she does it on purpose. This product would probably be fine for anyone who drives at half the speed limit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent out-of-box functionality, but..","review":"I bought the Quest 2 after researching all the Garmin products, plus the products from Magellan and Dell (Dell's PDA/GPS is not going to be continued).I was literally able to open the box and set up the unit on battery power. The maps are pre-loaded, so finding locations is a matter of setting state, city, and address. Everything has worked, mostly..The but part..the documentation is not as complete as I'd like it, and some things, like how to charge the internal battery (or if it can be charged), are nonexistant.I mapped a trip to my folks in Arkansas, and it did a lot of recalculating when I knew the shortest route and it didn't. And it had their house on the wrong side of the road.Locally, it had me turning onto streets that didn't exist.I will look for map updates (and hope they exist) in the future. I'm a month into ownership, and so far, I'm impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tooooooo Sloooooooow!","review":"Disappointed. It works great in the suburbs if there aren't a lot of streets close together. Way too slow calculating/recalculating in larger towns and cities. Also, my unit's antenna stopped working after a month. I bought an external antenna and it works fine, but I bought this unit for the compact size. I wish I bought something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product!","review":"I have used several Garmin GPS units in the past and was really undecided over the Quest II or the more expensive units. Once I received this unit it did all and more than what I was expecting.

Its slow to boot up, but thats the only draw back. When we were outside Plains Ga on a lonly dark road, we were amazed that the driveways we passed showed on the screen. We've taken it with us on many vacations and never had a problem. Its very acurate. The battery life is long. We've taken it on the Harley and stays charged for almost 8 hours. Its been dropped and the antenna broke off. I taped it back together (looks like crap) and the thing still works like a dream. My wife bought a Garmin Nuvi 650, and offered to get me one. No chance, the Quest is a sturdy acurate GPS and I won't give mine up. To own one is to appreciate it, If you have a car and a motorcycle, this is the GPS to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorcycle application","review":"I have used other hand held GPS units and this one works well if you don't mind a lot of button crunching to load a route. Using the CD and loading routes with your PC is much easier.I can see the screen well enough with the unit mounted on my bars just off of center to the left. The mount (sold seperately) is simple and holds the unit surprisingly secure. I used the find function for directions and found what I was looking for the first time. You have to take the map data with a grain of salt. I used the same function (find) and reviewed the listings in my home town and several of the establishments are no longer in business.For the price I am very pleased with this GPS."},{"rating":"2","title":"Garmin Quest II","review":"I have owned many handheld and car GPSs over the past 15 years, many Garmins and a few from other manufacturers. This one is the best. Handsdown. Very good battery life, and since it comes pre-loaded with all the roads in the USA there is no need to fuss with Garmin's very quirky (read difficult to load and get running) software. This one works great in your car with the lady telling you where to go and what to do, and it also works great as a hand held. I recommend it with no reservations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Well","review":"This works really well.

Yes it would turn on and off go through the set up and menu options. Have taken this unit on several trips each time with another person trying to get the unit to work with no luck. What did I find wrong!o Will not navigate and give voice instructions, will only say (satellites lost)o Will not give accurate location.o Unit is very slow.At this point I could go on and on but what would be the point, save your money and get the Zumo 550 or 660 wish I had!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"We returned this product. Amazon was great about refunding our money. Fisher-Price customer support was not so great. The belts on the booster were assembled incorrectly and they insisted that's the way they were supposed to be but the seat was not functional. The woman on the phone was rude and not helpful at all. Also, for a booster seat intended for use through the toddler years it isn't very big. My daughter isn't fat but she isn't a petite baby and she would only be able to use this booster for a few months. The tray was difficult to use. The toy was cute but not worth and extra 20 bucks. After returning this booster we bought a much better one from Safety First and we're very pleased with it.

I enjoyed it then as well as now.For those who look to purchase this, be forewarned of the poor presentation. It's a real heartbreaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly boring","review":"This is definately one of the most boring \\"thrillers\\" to ever be made. Nature runs amock from man's incessant tinkering with it, and a group of hikers are conveniantly cught in the middle. No gore, no surprises, no scares, just complete boredom. If you ever wondered what it would feel like to beat time to death slowly with a spiked club, see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eagles, coyotes, and bears...OH MY!","review":"I give the disc itself no stars. The distributors simply slapped Media Home Video's old transfer onto a disc with no chapter encoding or trailers or anything. Fooey. Also the film itself is not letterboxed, which is infuriating because it was shot in aspect ration 2:35:1, so you know what that means? People constantly talking to the edge of your television screen and painful moments where you watch an empty set while something is going on on the half of the screen image you can't see. The movie itself is an entertainingly silly drive-in \\"disaster thriller\\" about a group of hikers besieged by animals turned homicidal by the thinning of the ozone layer. A few of the animal attacks are actually quite nerve rattling while others are giggle inducing. Directer William Girdler fared better with his JAWS clone GRIZZLY (his previous film) and THE MANITOU (his next and, sadly, final film before his tragic death at age 30)."},{"rating":"1","title":"supernatural shlock-fest","review":"Leslie \\"Airplane!\\" Neilson plays forest ranger Steve Buckner, who winds up in a world of trouble in the mountains of the Sierras after a tear in the ozone layer starts messing with the minds of animals who live in high altitudes.

This album is simply spectacular. Not their best (BUY FORTRESS NOW) but one of their most complex.Here's a look at my favorite songs.First off, \\"Truth Is\\" is by far the best song they have ever done. Lyrically deep, musically propulsive. This is the best of Sister Hazel. Truth Is, I can't get enough of this song. Put on a pair of headphones and prepare to be blown away.\\"Beautiful High\\" is another of their great accomplishments on this album.\\"Where Do You Go\\" is a heartbreaking ode to the victims of Hurricane Katrina.\\"Tear by Tear\\" a heartfelt if perhaps forced ballad on sadness.\\"Anyway\\" is seriously kicked up and shows the musicianship of this band, which is unsurpassed. Ken Block's lyrics here are wonderfully unconventional."},{"rating":"2","title":"JVC 27D201","review":"Eric, you got a defective TV. This JVC is exceptional.

Meg's revelation about who she really was encourages the reader to really examine oneself and be totally honest about how you treat others and not base that upon what others think. I like how the author shot down self-righteousness and bigotry. We should never judge people before we get to know their true character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not one false step....","review":"I loved this book. Very sweet story dealing with the very honest emotions and insecurities that would come with trying to fill the shoes of a beloved deceased spouse. There was not one false step throughout the whole story. When the h or H had an issue, they talked about it. It wasn't a long string of misunderstandings. The characters were consistent in their actions, no one was TSTL. No contrived plot devices.Very well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WTH is a rep?","review":"Its a small thing. Just one word, but since its sprinkled throughout the story, it was very distracting. . I'm guessing it must be some kind of Nebraska slang meaning temporary employee on a ranch. I probably would have called them \\"temps\\". I kept filling in representatives, reprobates, and republicans. None seemed to fit well. Let's see. How about Ranch Employee Pending? OK, I'll use that in my head through the rest of the book. Other than that annoyance, this is a nice sweet story. I wanted to smack Meg for being so insensitive to Tye's feelings. Apparently, she was very pretty, since he adored her regardless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got egg on my face now","review":"I've read and enjoyed several of Cheryl St. John's historical romances, but must admit I never considered her a \\"keeper\\" before. Something was always just slightly \\"off\\" about the other stories (The Secondhand Wife, Tenderfoot Bride, Sweet Annie). I liked those characters, I liked their stories, but the essential emotional \\"memorability\\" that a really great romance has, just wasn't there for me.Well, I just read JOE'S WIFE, and I have to admit it - finally, the story, the characters; their emotions and motivations, all came together. The arranged marriage between Meg and Tye sloooowwly becomes something very special for them. This is an excellent Western historical romance with a very simple plot and a very sympathetic hero and heroine. I highly recommend it.

I like going around with other marines shootin the aliens haha. The enemies look tight to, some look scary as F haha. This game is pretty fun. Worth the buy?

Overall it is a good storyline and mixes things up enough to stay interresting. Dont be misled about the multiplayer aspect of the game. It blows! It's like a really bad rendition of Quake III arena and in fact uses some of the same maps but is horrible in comparison. Players move slower, the graphics look bad and it just doesnt have the fun feel that quake III arena did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty much DOOM 2.5","review":"Take this with a grain of salt because I'm only a few hours into the game, and I'm always tough on games.I paid about $12 for this game used and I feel a bit taken. The graphics and mood are almost exactly like DOOM 3, but all of the fun has been bled from the game. The Strogg are not creepy, so the dark moodiness of the game becomes more annoying than anything. The story simply doesn't exist. The cut scenes are horrendous (think N64 style in-game graphic cut scenes). Everyone has the same face and Forrest Gump haircut. The weapons are so generic it hurts. The sound and music seem like an afterthought. Finally, the frame rate drops during almost every action scene.All that said... wait, no. I have nothing positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doom 3.5","review":"In a nutshell, picture a not-so-scary version Doom 3 with an incredibly awful framerate, cheesy story-line and graphics on par with Doom 3 for the XBox 1. After seeing Call Of Duty and even PDZ on the 360 I was incredibly disappointed with the graphics on this one. If there are more than 2 enemies on the screen, the framrate slows to an incredibly choppy rate. The sky looks like a low-res jpeg wallpaper image. I'd expect this stuff on PS2 but not on a launch title for a triple-core processor system. It almost seems like this was developed for Xbox 1 and at the last minute shifted to the 360 to have another launch title. The AI is pretty dumb, they'll stand next to exploding barrels and do little to avoid your gunfire. Also, you can't melee attack or throw grenades. That is incredibly stupid. I like the Doom 3 engine so its not a total waste to me, but as a supposedly 'new' Xbox 360 game this is a total waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"No problems, solid fun.","review":"First, I've read reviews on a number of prominent Internet game review sites complaining about how poorly Quake 4 was adapted to the 360 but it's not true. The loading times are slightly longer than other games but there is no in-game action delay at all.Second, this game is awesome. It's the best FPS I've played on a console since Doom 3. The storyline picks up after Quake 2 and the action keeps going. This is a must for fans of the genre.One caution, there is an extreme amount of gore in some parts so this is definately not for younger players."},{"rating":"2","title":"super !!!!! excellent gameeeeeeeeeeeee !!!!!!!","review":"THIS IS A COMPLETE GAME,,,SOUND IS GOOD ,, THE STORY IS GOOD AND GRAPHICS ARE SIMPLY SUPERB.I AM VERY PICKY WITH GAMES AND VERY DEMANDING,,BUT THIS GAME HAS EVERYTHING I LOOK FOR..THE MONSTERS,GUNS,ENVIROMENT ARE SO IMPRESSIVE DESIGNED.,, WITHOUTH NO DOUBT I GIVE THIS GAME 50 STARS.........."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed.","review":"While the graphics are on par with Doom and the game play is entertaining, what could have been a solid FPS has been ruined by buggy code. The frame rates are a major problem in this game. When people compare it to a slideshow, it is not an over exaggeration as it does get that bad if you are near a couple of enemies. The game also suffers from freezing problems, mostly when loading a new map. This makes me feel like the game was rushed out the door without the needed time for testing and debugging. For $60, this is unacceptable. The bonus disc, which contains Quake II and features about the making of Quake IV, was a nice touch.If you are not a Quake addict and in dire need of a solid FPS, I would recommend Prey. Its graphics are on par with Doom and Quake, there are no freezing problems, and it is evolving FPS game play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly Rewarding Single Player FPS!!!","review":"I'm shocked, but Quake 4 offers a really nice, long story mode. The story is a mishmash of assorted sci-fi cliches, but does a wonderful job of immersing you in an oppressive environment. The graphics are (despite the haters true claims of some sporadic frame rate issues) beautiful, the weapon selection is fantastic, and the shocking twist half way through will leave your jaw agape. I rented it and am considering picking it up on the cheap. The online multiplayer is standard stuff, but it gets the job done. Really good game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woulda been AWESOME on the ps1","review":"I rented this game because I am a fan of fast paced, hard hitting FPS games that are easy to control and require realistic cover tactics and some strategy. I also like artistic graphics, and a balanced online platform with a variety of creative environments.Unfortunately, it fails on all of these counts. I will not waste any more words on this lame piece of trash as others have done it for me. Suffice it to say, I regret even renting this for a paltry four bucks.

Look no further than Quake 4. The repetative and boring gameplay is topped off by some truely ridiculous background graphics. If you've never played a FPS, are 12 years old, and are really into gore-for-gore's sake then by all means buy Quake 4 immediately. If you're looking for something worthy of your XBOX 360, skip it.Pros- The Contra Code throw-back was pretty clever. You don't get 30 lives, but you get all the uninspired guns the game has to offer.Cons- Aside from the game itself... nice job selling out to Microsoft and making the multi-player only available via XBOX LIVE. That's right, no option to play with your actual buddies on this hunk of crap. Only if you've given in to the evil that is online gaming can you face a human opponent.For all the reviews that liked this game?

But the Gernsheim 2nd string quartet in A minor is a very fine work indeed. Gernsheim was a friend of Brahms and his style certainly reflects his knowing the great master. I play violin and viola and upon hearing this recording I set out to find the music for the Gernsheim quartet - and was successful. I have played it twice (1st viollin once, viola the other time) with 2 different groups, both like it - the second group being professional musicians in the Orquesta Sinfonica de Yucatan. They, in particular, were very much won over by this dramatic work and are eager to play it again. The Manderling quartet play wonderfully on this recording, both the Gernsheim as well as the Brahms.

I tried the tape-to-DVD burn feature (looked simple) and somehow recorded a TV station instead. So I will have to re-read the instructions and try again.

It worked fine for another few months, and now I have an F03 code. Don't know what it is* and don't care; I've had it with this thing. I really need to get my VHS tapes converted over and then I can be finished with this whole fiasco.

Four out of the 5 have failed with the NO READ error and the common lens/hub cleaning process did nothing. The only fix per Panasonic support is to send it to their repair center for $130 flat repair (you pay to ship) with only a 90 day warranty!!!!!!!

Even brand new tapes recorded at SP jump all around. Tuner gives a very poor quality picture.The DVD section is very good. Manual covers a lot and is written at \\"power user\\" level.

I loved oblivion...in fact i might have given this game one higher star if the graphics weren't garbage.

What took me a while to understand is that most books of this type simply give many different options for how to solve a problem in the workshop without giving detailed specifics on any one choice. This book does the opposite - there are few \\"solutions\\" to choose from, but the ones that are offered give a great amount of detail so you can easily reproduce the same results in your own shop.So, for example if you don't already have an idea of what you want to do to solve your clamp storage problem, then I would say look in other places first to gather a lot of ideas and get a feel for what will work as a solution for you.

They were young when all his achievements happened and do not know the stories.Most of the history that was written was based on others peoples views of what happened and not factual i would say that this is not a biography this is a fable and as some of the stories are kinda what happened it was written to glorify Deadshot and not just to tell his history.

However, the book is written terribly and uninterestingly, by some French imbecile who couldn't write his way out of a medicine cabinet. In addition to that, the plot that he decided on was formulaic and uninteresting (they faced hardship and perservered, wow!! so original and so interesting!!), thus meriting a 1-star rating.In conclusion, don't read this horribly formulaic, boring, poorly-written, and ultimately overrated, piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Superb","review":"A very nicely written book.

I'm not a small guy and it holds me and my 10 inch memory foam queen mattress fine. I will say they should have veneered the platform the bed sits on. You can see the edge of the unfinished particle board if the sheets aren't hanging down. The manufacturer does paint the end of the board but not enough to hide the particle board.Remember this is a 150ish dollar platform bed so keep your expectations in line.

Holes are all in the wrong place so you WILL need to hammer/drill in your own holes or it will not be as intended(moulding wont fit, will look ridiculous ect.).However, the BIGGEST problem is that the moulding can NOT be affixed with nails. The material is too hard, and no amount of screwing or hammering will get it to fit.I have to get gorilla glue and try that in other words, or the moulding will not attach.Good for the price if not for the HORRIBLE setup."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS BED","review":"Ok, its a decent price and its stable. But their are Flaws. One of the boards arrived cracked, one corner was broken off (it was before it was shipped because the piece was not in the box. Also two of the platform boards were cut so that they were longer then the rest. Lastly, if you decide to buy this frame, the last bit of instructions are ridiculousness. In order to attach the moldings it tells you to left the frame up and screw them in from underneath. This frame weighs 115 pounds, plus if you tilt it one way or the other you may break the platform.

I didn't even put the trim on because I had trouble figuring out how they go on and the way it looked for how they go didn't even make sense. Also in the instructions the boards have labels but not even half of the boards had labels on them and the ones that did were hard to find and who uses front and back for terms to label which end of the bed is which makes no sense at all which I had it wrong and had to start from the begining again and turn everthing around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and not worth it","review":"Like a lot of the reviews that are on here states already, the box is long and bulky. Some pieces the holes don't line up, and some pieces were missing holes all together! I had to drill them myself.

If you're going to live at one location for at least 10 years I'd buy this, If your planning to move anytime soon, forget it I don't think it would be in one piece after the move."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insanely heavy so guaranteed to be damaged in transit","review":"The packaging was beat all up but was mostly in tact.

Go to rooms to go or another place."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad directions, holes not pre-drilled, difficult assembly","review":"I didnt believe the other reviews unfortunately when others mentioned the lack of pre-drilled holes, but its true. The entire top needs to be manually lined up with the base, which I can personally handle but why should I? The reason I bought this and not plywood and paint straight from Home Depot was so everything was measured and all I would have to do is screw it together. Instead I found myself drilling and trying to line up pieces as well as I could, even though the trim pieces around the top edge don't actually line up! The bottom also isnt quite the right size for my queen mattress (too wide but just the right length, awkward pieces of wood jutting out from each side of bed now). The package is way too heavy for anyone to carry- despite being 100 pounds its also over 6 feet tall, making moving this package without help or a hand truck nearly impossible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could review","review":"My son and I were very excited when we located this bed frame for his first apartment back in August.Since then we have paid for the frame but have as of today 10-22-12 have not received our delivery.

It has lots of space and pockets to carry items that you may need. The back pack straps are comfortable and make carrying it easy. I like the feature that permits you to carry it by the handle on the top of the case, and then set it down where it remains vertical on the floor. Then you don't have to lean over to pick it up. One aspect of it is just a bit annoying. You just can't open it and take the trumpet out quickly. It takes just a bit of time to open the velcro flap and unzip the side of the case. Overall a very good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Unit History","review":"Another superb publication by Fedorowicz, this one a translation of the unit histories of the 9th and 10th SS Panzer Divisions.

Highly recommended for those interested in German WWII history and/or tank warfare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry reading...","review":"This book, while detailed, is a very dry read.

All of the sections are extremely well written, using clear, descriptive language. Each section also contains an ample amount of charts, tables, and graphs. While these are not as colorful as other books from the United Nations, the use of color is extremely effective. Just a glance at a chart yields its contents, a good time-saving technique for a researcher or student. Finally, there are over a hundred pages of data tables in the back. These tables make it easy to compare countries. Like the articles themselves, the explanations are clear and interesting. Overall, this book is a wonderful reference tool and would easily supplement a course on the global environment."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not a Ceramic stone","review":"This is not a ceramic stone, it is aluminum oxide (with something) sandstone.

But not surprised by this inconsistency as the Microsoft Project 98 product itself has a bit of a \\"not all together\\" feeling to it, as if it were programmed by multiple teams in multiple countries--that didn't always talk together (ie. how many different ways can you implement the calendar controls folks? ). But for the price and features, you can't beat Project98 and this book will have you using it effectively. If you want to go beyond this, look for Tim Pyron's books on Project98.

For Hendrix fans, it is about time they finally get a complete official release of this show. But for first time buyers, don't let a fancy marketing campaign and nice packaging fool you. While this concert has some inspired moments and some brilliant guitar work, overall it is a very strained, sloppy, and uninspired performance by Hendrix.

I wear a large glove and ordered a large, and I had to use binder clips to pinch shut half of the finger caps because they were so big. It's like they were made for bear claws or something: my fingers slide right through the holes on the end. The straps that lead from the wrist to the caps are also cut at odd lengths, which means I'm going to have to completely alter this glove at a shoe repair shop, or somewhere else that has a sewing machine capable of punching through leather.The material is also much different than the picture would lead you to believe: It shows a smooth, polished leather, but what you get looks more like costume suede. It's also a light chestnut color, not the dark brown shown. All in all, I'm kind of disappointed with this glove.

Also, my fingers had a very hard time staying inside the compartments because they were not made to be well fit. Lastly, it is very VERY hard to control your fingers once inside the glove. The leather is so stiff and inflexible even after broken in. Personally, I prefer the feel of the arrows on my fingers when I'm shooting and this glove basically restricts that feeling. My bow set came with a cheap finger tab made of synthetic leather and some plastic that you can probably get for $2 and it works 100 times better than this glove.

I couldn't wait to finish it so that I could begin a new book that was on my shelf. This is probably the least liked John Saul book I have read to date, and I have read about 8 of his.

I long for the days when Saul based his stories out of New England and concentrated on the psyche of his characters. Black Lightning is confusing from start to finish.

This is a bad one to begin with as it makes the other two I have sitting here look rather unappealing.The ending, as many have said, is terrible. I was sitting there reading with about five pages of paper left and I couldn't help but thinking, there's no way this can finish off good.It really made no sense either. Without giving the plot too much away, the explanation of how things happened at the \\"moment of truth\\" was just too far-fetched and didn't add a thing to the story.There were no emotional connections to any of the characters except in the beginning of the book when you feel for Glen (Anne's husband) and Anne herself.

Try this: Anne Jeffers is at a prison to witness the electrocution of serial killer Richard Kraven.

But I also enjoy being surprised about where the plot takes me. Nothing irritates me more than being able to predict what happens with the story after reading 1/2 of the book. Unfortunately, this is what occurred with John Saul's Black Lightning. In addition, the book's plot moves very slow, and I felt almost forced to keep turning the pages. Definitely not a book that you feel you have to keep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother unless you're really bored.","review":"I don't know why I keep thinking John Saul will eventually write a good book. He is a mediocre author, and this is one of his less than mediocre books. Maybe he wrote a good one once that got him a really long contract with some unfortunate publishing company. I have yet to find it. I'm sure someone thinks he's brilliant, but anyone who reads Black Lightning looking for something twisted, mysterious, or horrifying should not bother with this book. It's just plain stupid. Don't bother with John Saul at all for that matter. I have read several of his and am tired of being disappointed.

I gave it to him as a Christmas gift December of 2009. I tried it out with my other children and it really didn't work. I could hear the sound of the metal spring moving through the air, but not my children's voices at all. The spring between the ear pieces is nothing more than a small version of a metal Slinky. We all know how fast those things get all tangled up. Sure enough, only days after I gave this to my 9 year old son, the spring is totally twisted and tangled and the Space Phone cannot be used at all. I feel like I wasted my $10.00. I think two soup cans and some string would have worked better unfortunately. I would not recommend this toy and I am extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Last Long","review":"This toy won't last long.

Minus: If it weren't for Bangs, Chuck Eddy the would be rock writer wouldn't exist. This guy is a great rock writer, that is when he actually sticks to that subject. Unfortunately, this guy goes off on more tangents than I care to mention, especially since quite frankly I don't care about his personal life but simply wanted to read about some great rock n' roll. This makes his book only partially satisfying. I'm sorry he's dead, but let's be honest, like Hendrix and Cobain his death has given him an untouchable mystique that makes him almost immune to criticism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Sorry, but this book totally sucks. The \\"angular\\" writing is nothing more than unbridled ramblings. Bangs often struggles to develop a singular, cohesive theme about a particular band other than writing about the band itself (kind of). The chapters read like every cliche music feature written post-Bangs in Rolling Stone, Spin, and various other rock mags. In a sense, you can't blame Bangs for being that influential, but still, for current-day readers, it's as if you've read his work a thousand times already. I really wanted to like this book, but there's just very little to get excited about. You're much better off reading a good blog about a particular band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was he serious?","review":"Interesting bathroom reading. But those of us who have grown up will see it for what it is. Glorified navel-gazing: \\"This music was IMPORTANT because I was around to see it.\\" The book serves as an interesting time capsule. Reading this, one can smell the weed, taste the day-old pizza, see the semen-stained poster of Kerouak on the wall, hear the inebriated Mr. Bangs talking to himself at 3 a.m. Hey, it's was just music. A bunch of kids banging their guitars around. I loved it and still love it. But my guess is anyone who really feels it is important that The Troggs receive their props hasn't made much of a life for himself in the decades since."},{"rating":"1","title":"the man who ruined rock?","review":"Lester Bangs is guilty of being one of the most pretentious and detrimental rock critics in the history of the gloriously varied musical genre. His narrow-minded opinion and self-impressed need to pose as a tastemaker frequently undermined the efforts of truly talented and generous musicians. Bangs, himself an inept hack of a writer and a shallow wader in the ocean of wisdom, could only understand and praise simplistic music. Why do I villify him? Simple - because he was a villain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bangs was an over-rated hack","review":"Lester Bangs is enormously over-rated. Perhaps among rock critics he was above average, but as a writer he was a hack. His style is one of the most annoying I've ever encountered. The funny thing is, I wrote just like Bangs when I was 14 -- and that's not bragging. Rather, it suggests that Bangs wrote like a whiny, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual, neurotic, self-satisfied, egotistical 14-year old who neve grew up. The style is a sort of uninhibited stream-of-consciousness which becomes tiring very quickly. Plus, it's not very funny.On the other hand, I did appreciate the historical aspect of some of the articles, particularly the perspective they provide on early punk. Ultimately, however, there is, as they say, as little point in reading about music as in tap-dancing about painting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff From Another Age","review":"I remember reading Lester's stuff as a teen back in the 70s. In those days it didn't get much better than Creem magazine when it came to rock and roll reviews. Much of his wit was wasted on me of course until I recently bought this book.Most of the bands he writes about aren't around anymore but that makes little difference. Bangs has as much love for language as he does for rock and Roll and it shows in his writing.More than once I burst out in howling laughter amazed at the guys witty way with words. Lester could really write.If nothing else Psycotic Reactions is a fine primer for those interested in Rock back when it really was a vital force in peoples lives. Bangs writes with a passion for the music one rarely comes across these days. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday party, cheesecake, jelly bean, boom!","review":"Although a fine collection of Bangs's work in its own right, 'Psychotic Reactions and Carburator Dung' is not as good an introduction to Lester's writing as the recently released 'Mainlines, Blood Feasts, and Bad Taste: A Lester Bangs Reader.\\" While 'Psychotic Reactions' editor Greil Marcus chooses to focus more on Bangs as a prose stylist and cough syrup-chugging wildman, 'Mainlines'editor John Morthland presents a more definitive overall sampling of Bangs's critic ideas and opinions. Nevertheless, there is plenty of Bangs's best here, including the title piece, \\"The White Noise Supremacists,\\" \\"A Reasonable Guide to Horrible Noise\\" and the entire fourth section of the book, which collects Lester musings on the life and career of Lou Reed."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Needs A Complete CD","review":"She needs to have a full CD to display her diverse talent.

It is not possible to read him without changing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Instead of inspiring me (as he has clearly done for many readers), Merton more often left me frowning and scratching my head. While this book contains some gems, I can understand how the reader from Florida saw it as \\"mumbo jumbo.\\" For starters, Merton is not exactly a skilled writer (he admits as much in his introduction). His writing is often frustratingly vague and disconnected. Moreover, his calls for strict adherence to Catholic dogma and for perfect Christians to become communists were a bit off-putting to this layperson. Perhaps at a different point in my life, I might find it wonderfully inspiring. But as an early guide in my contemplative journey, Merton was more of a stumbling block than a stepping stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"a limited view","review":"If you are interested in contemplation/meditation but not interested in God or Christ, this book has very little to offer, in spite of having been written by a major thinker.

I found the author to be hopelessly lost in a bunch of words which mean nothing. This is one of those \\"spiritual\\" books that are really the result of the author bewitching himself with the trappings of language. I think that Merton actually believes that he is saying something when all he is doing is using vaguely defined words and terms which can mean anything-or absolutely nothing (the more likely possibility). If you think that sitting in complete silence and solitude for hours on end is the way to learn something, get this book. If you think that that is the way to delude yourself and possibly go mad as a hatter, skip this one. Read one \\"mystical\\" treatise, and you have read them all.

I passionately kept this in the forefront of my mind while reading this book. You must read this book with your spirit; the more you try and get an experience out of this book the less you will recieve. After I read the first three chapters I was spiritually moved more so than any other book in my life, I had actually opened my heart and mind up to God (not just a bearded guy who shakes your hand when you die but the spirit of Christ) then I tried to read those first three chapters over again and reap the same rewards, and the harder I tried the less I recieved. After 3 months of reading everyday (with a dictionary of course) I finished the book in tears because I knew that God had mysteriously worked through Merton. You need nothing but an open mind and a dictionary to read this book. You do not need to have had a contemplative experience like some reviews have said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding a Way","review":"I am in recovery and this has been a valuable tool in expanding my ideas about God, his nature, and our connection with him and my fellow man. Have been a fan of his for 20 years and only truly started reading this deeply in the last year. Truly invaluable knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seeking a Deeper Faith","review":"Merton is one of the finest writers when it comes to the spiritual aspects of the Christian faith. He provides clarity that so often is missing. If you seek to better understand your faith, Merton offers a good place from which to launch the effort. You will be left with questions that prompt you to deepen the intensity of your faith journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting spiritual insights","review":"This book is riveting for anyone who desires a deeper relationship with God.Merton is very clear in how to best create a space for God in our daily living and experiences, ridding ourselves of greed, selfishness, hate, revenge, judgements, egotism, etc. At the same time, he is very frank in informing us that God alone makes His presence known, that it is all around us, already present. We have closed ourselves off from it and continue to turn away.This is not a book the reader can or should skim over; it calls readers to think, meditate and enter into contemplation.A marvelous book for those who are serious about their spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good down to earth summary of the subject","review":"The book, written by a small interdisciplinary team, has clearly benefitted from this cooperation. It provides an excellent overview of Inca astronomy as reported in Spanish documentary sources, which are put to the test by first-hand astronomical and archaeological observations. It also carefully examines some of the currently dominant yet more speculative approaches to the subject. Very much recommended.

I FEEL LIKE IT IS FALSE ADVERTISING. I am unlikely to purchase from this bookseller in the future.The book is somewhat interesting. Pretty well written. From a first person point of view. Just personal anecdotes about living in Vermont. But obviously published on a very low budget. Almost like hand-made, based on the exterior. Also a poor font.Kudos to the author if it was a first attempt at writing and publishing a book.

It is not a coffee table book, nor a novel that one cuddles as they caress a mug of hot cocoa. If you are a professional, a student, or if you work with the mentally ill population in any capacity..this book is a must. The codes are for insurance rating purposes. This same codong is used for all medical conditions... Hardly a bad thing! People want their insurance to pay! It may be regretable that a diagnosis is immediately required in order for healthcare professionals to receive payment. But this is true of all healthcare-- psychiatric or otherwise. This is not a book for the patient. Anyone who works in the mental health arena, knows that this is not a layman's guide to mental health disorders! Anyone who suggests that it can be used in \\"self-diagnosis\\" has little understanding of mental illness.

Long story short, all thumbs up, I got a $200 book for $15 and it excedeed my highest expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"ewe, gross!","review":"This manual disenfranchises all that is interesting about human nature. We professionals are all aware it was created for insurance coding, but it has somehow contaminated the less intelligent careerists in our ranks (which is just about all of us), who are susceptible to its suggestion, and we now find ourselves using this caricature tabloid like a map of the psyche itself. This manual is the cause and effect of an anti-intellectual strain of professionalism that has all but replaced scholarship and reflection. If this were the Bible, we would all be guilty of evangelical fundamentalism. When we consider the thousands of professionals (working on task forces and subcommitees) that produced this megillah, a principle from a neighboring behavioral discipline comes to mind, i.e. freedom and intelligence in individuals -- indeed consciousness itself -- is inversely proportional to the size of the group in which they participate. Psychology is all but officially a sham discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Psych student's best friend...","review":"This manual was excellent for helping the Behavioral Scientist, and Psych student.

I recommend this book only for those who understand the scientific method and those interested in pursuing graduate study of psychology or psychiatry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource for clinical diagnosing.","review":"As an early childhood clinical consultant, it is important with a diagnostic tool such as DSM IV, to not use as a guide to self-diagnose or to diagnose your child. It is also important to note that diagnosis is made using the behavioral characteristics and measurements of duration, frequency and severity of behaviour. Also, it is important to be able to understand dual-diagnosis children, and children who present same symptoms as AD(H)D, yet may actually be depressed, anxious, or even have Tourette's as a primary diagnosis.Work with your elementary school, or day care facility to examine the environmental changes you can make to accommodate a child's attention span. And remember, medication is a last resort. Consult your pediatricians, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a hoot, its like reading a book thats cluless about the human condition.","review":"I was going thru this manual and found it so subjective that it is way beyond sublimely incredulious, a sane person would laugh until his sides would ache, and if it is used as widely as promoted it becomes insidious as a methoid for labling people. I suspect the next volume (lets hope that does not happen) will list every thing as a disorder.

So unless you don't understand that jumping off cliffs is BAD, then you won't hear it very much. And, on a final note, if you don't want to have your kids exposed to ANY bad words, then get rid of all forms of communication, throw away the tv and electronics, books, board up the windows and doors, and don't let your child out of the house. If your child accidentally says a bad word, and then you go blame it on this game, then that is just messed up.

Good,bad with Dr. Eggman, or bad with tall dark and mysterious. Depending on with path you choose, you'll face a certain end boss. I found myself in the game running into the same boss like 3 times.

And in the end you get 10 different endings!!! so you have a great replay value.- Great graphics!Cons:- 2.player mode sucks a little bit.- You can use vehicles in some areas and they are not fun because they are slower than you and hard to drive.Overall: It is some kind of an RPG (i know it isn't) but it looks like one because you choose your path on each stage to get differents endings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shadow The Hedgehog GameCube","review":"This item was shipped according & was in good condition.

Would you like to feel like Sega shafted you in favour of casual gamers and GTA fans? Here's your game. A transparent, cynical, cold-hearted, rushed cash-grab, an inferior version of existing Sonic games with a blatantly tacked-on gun system to sell to the OMGLOLGUNZRCOOL crowd. Buy Sonic Rush instead; that's a Sonic game. I'm not offended by the language or the violence; I'm offended by the lack of respect this game shows to the Sonic franchise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow the Hedgehog","review":"Okay, first off, I am very pleased again with the condition of the CD. The seller took good care of it, to make sure the buyer would get his/her use and fair gaming out of it. Second, it works on the Wii. Only thing you need to play the game is a Gamecube controller AND memory card, otherwise, you will not get past a screen asking whether you want to play with/without a memory card.I am very pleased with the graphics, and also the gameplay. This game is by far, the BEST game I'e ever played in the Sonic Series.The most fun part of the game is probably getting to choose your destiny! I LOVE that. This is by far the most interesting, and interactive game I've ever played, especially since the Player chooses what happens to Shadow and his Destiny.~Shiruba Rose"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okaaaaaaaaay","review":"Well this was a disappointment . Shadow was supposed to be this awsome character but in this game he's like an evil overlord or something the story was terrible . Eggman dies in multiple endings ! and Shadow curses ! the only reason this gets 2 stars for fun is because the levels are okay and the sonic x voices are awsome . Shame on you sega."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid","review":"This game is so stupid! No Sonic related games (That I know of) has guns! Shadow cures all the time! How is this this E10 game!

I will say that language can be a bit much, but still a great game none the less. Lots of action keep me glued to the screen. Some of the down sides I say would be the occasional bad camera and bad gun aim. But the levels are not too hard, not too easy which makes it fun to play. However, to those with younger children, I do not recommend this, but I will say that those teens+ that are Shadow fans (like me) GET THE GAME!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sonic Game with Speed!!!","review":"The best of the Sonic adventures I've played!!

After the title track it is a long,slow,grooveless affair with Mr. Seal. Think of the tunes on the first 2 cds that you would delete...well this cd is that bunch of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seals finest work!","review":"This CD is far superior to his second (most popular) CD. This CD features better vocals, better songs, and is magnificantly produced. I love all of his work but after listening to this CD 1000 times it still is fresh for me. It is a masterpiece.\\"Colour\\", \\"When a man is wrong\\", are just incredible songs that touch on personal subjects in the artist. \\"Lost my Faith\\" is every bit as good as \\"kiss from a rose\\" and this reviewer thinks better.This reviewer loves all his work, and doesn't want to cast negative dispersions on his earlier CD's they are all brilliant and I get joy from each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature audiences only.","review":"I have long been a fan of Seal and his music. Many people with whom I speak have never heard his of music. To describe Seal's music is not the easiest of tasks. I find his music inspiring and motivating, and many times very emotional. His music has very deep meaning to the people who listen to it; therefore, I believe his music is for everyone in the world, although people who have more maturity will understand his lyrics with a greater perception of life and reality than others may.In a world full of music artists who create \\"catchy tunes\\" just so they can grab a moment of fame and mainstream popularity, Seal's music and originality strikes a special place deep within my soul. You may feel as if you're taking a big risk spending a few dollars for his albums, but I guarantee you his music will move you as few other modern artists' music can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"This album is a bit darker than some of his newer stuff, but i think it is fantastic. If you like Seal, you will like at least half of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Art Requires Patience!","review":"I wonder if one of the definitions of a \\"work of art\\" is something that doesn't immediately appeal to you, but grows on you over time, like a fungus. The power of these melodies begin to infiltrate your senses after a few listens and the effect is hypnotic. Even more moving than his previous release (if that is possible), this album has shown itself to be just as solid as his first two. Since four years have passed, it's just about time for Seal to work his magic once again, and for that I'll be waiting. Heartbreak never sounds so good as from the mouth of Seal!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of another chance!","review":"Oh, it's so good to see this neglected album get some love.I understand that a lot of people couldn't get into Human Being when it was released; after all, it's a very moody record, and there isn't much here that's \\"chart friendly\\" or danceable.But the depth of Seal's lyrics on this record, and the lush production make it IMO his best to date. \\"When a Man Is Wrong\\" and \\"Still Love Remains\\" are just astonishingly beautiful.Give it another chance!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Subdued and Intricate Moodpiece","review":"For those accostomed to Seal's previous 2 recordings, HUMAN BEING is a change of pace. This introspective collection of various musings and balladry presents itself as a sparse and stripped down musical documentation of the artist's spiritual excursion into the human experience. Deep and darkly ambient in places yet raw and vulnerable in others, this is not a recording designed for the musical mainstream but definitely for those seeking something to compliment their existing collection of \\"musical masterpieces\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally disappointing...","review":"I just don't like it!!! It always took 2 to 3 listens before I finally got the \\"hook\\" on Seal's cd's, but this one just doesn't seem to have one. Seal always had this incredible gift for taking the most depressing subject matter & putting a positive twist on it - but not in this case. I had to FORCE myself to listen to the entire cd both times I listened to it (in my desperate attempt to find SOMETHING I liked) - I just couldn't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste","review":"This album was not worth the wait or money. It really too bad because his first two albums were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEAL IS ONLY HUMAN, HE CAN TRY AGAIN.","review":"Seals 3rd effort \\"Human Being\\" is his worst attempt at continuing a tired formula. His best CD was his debut \\"Seal\\" with the likes of \\"Killer\\" and \\"Crazy\\", this CD has nothing to spare. It is utterly depressing with no rhythm or structure. Give this one a miss, and remember Seal we know you are only human, and that we all make mistakes, but this is your one and only chance to screw up."},{"rating":"1","title":"melodramatic, over-produced and corny","review":"where is the edge??? the fist cd took the listener to places that the 2nd only tried to do. the third cd is a complete mess. If seal needs to get in touch with his \\"sensitive side\\" i suggest he find a therapist, work through a couple of issues and come back to the studio with a vengance. this cd is like vanilla ice cream...bland, bland bland!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Four and a half years of waiting for this?","review":"This has to be Seal's most disappointing project to date. What has he been doing for 4 and 1/2 years? Caution, do not listen while driving or you will fall asleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I was such a BIG fan of Seal's last album, that I couldn't imagine anything less than a great album from Seal. But that's what I got... something less than great. A LOT less than great. This album bored me to tears. And it was depressing. I really tried to like it. Really, I did. I owed him that much, didn't I? But alas, I can't. It's a disappointing dud. There's not a single hummable melody. Completely forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Human Being.","review":"I will only say that this CD, especially track 10, \\"Still Love Remains\\" kept me from committing suicide just over a year ago. I would normally ramble on and on for eons about the lush arrangements and production of this release, but since this holds such a special place in my heart and in my life, I won't be so self indulgent this time. As a piece of pop/soul music, it's brilliant and effortless. As a reminder of the value and power of music and it's ability to heal the human spirit, it's essential. Thank You Seal, for saving my life. Crying through a devastating heartbreak has never been as cleansing as it was while I listened to your voice and slowly began healing from the inside. For that reason alone, this CD will forever \\"Remain...\\" in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointing comeback","review":"After a brilliant first album and an interesting but less exciting second opus, I was quite curious to see how Seal would pass the third album barrier. On the good side, there are two songs touched by grace (\\"human being\\" and \\"colour\\"), wich can be listened to for hours, with beautiful melodies, rich production and nice lyrics. On the bad side, the rest of the CD is a bit soporific. Nice ideas, gorgeous production but the magic is missing. Had he done at least five songs of the level of \\"human being\\"... but two are not enough. Still a good CD to relax..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort for a great artist","review":"I was hooked with his first release, and after his second release I was blown away by the lush multi-layered textures woven into a musical masterpiece. Sad to say, after listening to the third release several times I was left feeling as if something was missing or incomplete. There are several moments on the CD where I found hints of Seal's genius prying through this scape of fairly unmemorable tracks. Alas, none were enough to lift this latest effort out of mediocrity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul of a prophet in one so young","review":"Deep, reflective, introspective, moving. Love every track. Love every second of this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"Maybe I was looking forward to Seal's new album just a little too much. His first two albums are indeed classics. With Trevor Horn again as producer, and help from Wendy and Lisa and William Orbit (who helped out Madonna with Ray of Light), I expected a third classic. I even was excited after hearing the first single. I thought, this is going to be good. I'm sorry to say I was wrong. Like I said, I enjoyed the first single and track (Human Being), but as each track wore on, I grew nervous. Where was the magic? As the cd ended, I realized there was no magic - only boredom. Maybe next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"Very dreamy, soft, romantic album is his best yet. Although I like a lot of his stuff on the other two, Human Being is just filled with wonder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good background music, but not like his first two cd's","review":"I bought Human Being after having loved Seal's first two cd's. The opening track is excellent, but then it goes down hill from there. Many of the songs sound the same, and by the time it's over I actually feel a bit depressed by the music. There are no hits on here, in fact after listening to it many times, I can't remember any of the tunes.....LISTEN BEFORE YOU BUY!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best, but better than a lot of music out there!","review":"As always Seal enlightens and empowers. \\"When a Man is Wrong\\" is my favorite. How could you not be overcome by the orchestration? Not to mention the emotion it evokes. \\"No Easy Way\\" and \\"Lost My Faith\\" are my other favorites. Seal is in a class by himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle power...Epic.","review":"After listening to this cd over and over for days, I feel as if I owe Seal a debt of gratitude. I waited for this cd for a long time, and since it arrived, I have begun to listen to all other music in a slightly different way. Seal has touched a deep chord of spiritualism with this collection of music, and continual listening will only prove to unlock his lyricism and power even more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seal's Weakest Recording.","review":"What happened here? This album is very weak compared to the first two, \\"5 star\\" efforts. Listening to this album you get hints of the something good but its lost behind the so VERY weak production!These songs ARE good. But the recording sucks! As a practicing musician my self who has done many studio recordings, the best way i can describe my impression of this album is it sounds like a compilation of late night, 4-track, amateur demo recordings.Wheres the beef!? No strong guitar, no strong keys, and the rhythm section sounds like a dime store casio beat machine. Seals vocals are good, but he cant make up for the weak production and the \\"Mr Microphone\\" cheapyness.I Highly reccomend Seal's 1st album. It rocks and is by far the his best yet. The second album is great too....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you enjoy listen to grown men cry?","review":"Seal's last cd was great, but this one is a horror. Cheezy lyrics, meaningless music, what was he thinking? What an awful cd. Don't think of buying this unless you like hearing grown men wail and moan, how uttertly distasteful!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much formula","review":"this guy has talent and can sing.but this formula record is tired and boring to the \\"t\\".nothing new and exciting.hopefully his next record won't take near as long and will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Mediocre","review":"I have been a Seal fan since Seal (I) and I'm not impressed. The songs all sound like recycled and watered down versions of tracks from previous albums. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete nonsense","review":"Even though I am currently sitting next to his Royal Eminence Lord Seal (whilst having the calamitous misfortune to be making his forthcoming album), nevertheless I have no hesitation in dismissing Human Being as some of the most ineffectual artistic dribble it has ever been my misfortune to encounter.In all my years as an amateur \\"listener\\" and as a professional music maker I have never heard a work so steeped in the molasses of its own pitiful self-indulgence, emotional excess and narcissistic self-absorption.Indeed if he were not a little taller than I, I would merely swot him as if he were an aphid. Now I really must go because I have to have lunch with him and I haven't abused him for at least 10 minutes. leave us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvin Gaye Lives!","review":"Even without the killer music, this man's words alone would carry this CD. If you stop dancing long enough to listen to what's being said, you realize that this man with a God-given talent has something to say. \\"We're mere human beings. We die. It's destined.\\" Truer words were never spoken. Favorite tracks: State of Grace, When a Man is Wrong, Colours, Human Beings. There's a couple of club mixes on the CD, but it's all fairly mellow by today's standards. But truth be told, it's all good. I buy Seal sight-unseen and sound-unheard, and am never disappointed. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trevor Horn creates another masterpiece!","review":"Thank God for producers like Trevor Horn. Seal is one of those artists that I will buy it as soon as it drops even if I have not heard a single song. Human Being is everything I had hoped it would be. Thick ambient backgrounds over smooth vocals. For those of you lucky enough to have surround sound on your home stereos, THIS is the CD to pop in and let play from beginning to end. From the title track all the way to the very end this release is solid. Once again, Samuel Sealhenry and Trevor Horn have put together a CD so lush with intracate background ambience, you will have to listen to it about 500 times and then you STILL hear something new everytime. Pick it up. Play it. Live it. 4.75 stars cuz there is always room 4 improvement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool & captivating","review":"Someone else called it \\"A sadly overlooked gem\\" and I couldn't agree more. An album which some might call more of a Trevor Horn album with his trademark sweeping orchestral sound mixed with electronic beats he made famous with other acts like Yes and Frankie Goes To Hollywood. But here, Seal balances Trevor's production with the album's mix of power-waltz ballads (Just Like You Said), cool techno (Except From, which sounds like an excerpt from something), and soul-searching epics (Lost My Faith). I listened to this more than the other two albums combined. That's saying something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dented and not tasty","review":"The cans were dented and the strawberries were strange. This is my first time eating non-fresh strawberries at home. They are the grey pink color of the strawberries in the basket that have turned bad in patches. The taste is not a rotted taste. It tastes different. Not toxic tasting but new and unencouraging. I placed three strawberries on each waffle and my family ignored them. Unlike the other berries, this not pleasant to eat straight so I will use them mashed in chiffon cake. I am not optimistic.I made a chiffon cake with a can of strawberries and used the red liquid in the frosting. The result: flavorless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy Excuse for a Book","review":"I reread the book recently for an essay I have to write and I think the novel has no whatsoever merit to it at all. Johann Lee's youth is no excuse for his lack of literary talent. Mary Shelley wrote Frankenstein at the age of 18.The coming-of-age novel is an exercise of his vindication of what he has done and not done: it plays on sexual stereotypes and yet at the same time, it tries to exult the author's status to the pedestal.However, this is slightly better than Edmund Wee's The Narcissist, another Singaporean account of his gay life."},{"rating":"2","title":"I DREAM OF CHEESECAKE - AND WOKE UP TO ONE.","review":"This is a delectable, generous desert.

If you only have enough money to buy one DVD, this is it! There are several surprises you can find in the concert. Simon Phillips (drums) blends extremely well with the rest of the band. You won't notice Jeff Porcaro has gone. His style of playing gives the fans a new 'look' on the songs. He's simply energetic and very creative. You'll know what I mean when you watch the track \\"White Sister\\". Mike Pocaro (bass) forms a solid rhythm section with Phillips. He steals a lot of the spotlight from Steve Lukather. Bobby Kimball is as good as always, adding 'life' to the tracks. Steve Lukather (guitar) is fantastic. I'm so moved when he plays \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\". By the way the Toto version of \\"Bodhisattva\\" is as good as Steely Dan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best TOTO concert on DVD","review":"If you are a TOTO fan and don't have this. Your not a fan.

With Cat Power, though, I just feel like Ms. Marshall has a beautiful voice with nowhere to go. The lyrics in these songs are shallow and wanderlust, the music droning and dull, and the entire album is utterly and completely forgetable.I won't deny that Cat Power has a large and rabid following (indeed, I thoroughly expect this review to be flamed by said legion), however I just think there are better indie-rock choices on the market for my $14, and I really can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than You Are Free","review":"I really enjoyed listening to this new CD. It was very captivating and draws you in. Sounds ancient yet new; there is nothing that brings this on like Cat Power and this one does it in style. Listened to You Are Free after this one and, for me, I think the new CD is a better listen overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accessible yet, but still a Powerful Cat","review":"I love Cat Power for her raw, edgy, honest singing and musicianship. This album, compared to Moon Pix and You Are Free, is by far the most accessible. The songs seem to be more arranged than on her previous albums (i.e., not as free-form and loosely constructed; a little more controlled, owing to the ineherent structure derived from the blues). They are not as \\"out there\\" as the Moon Pix or You Are Free songs are, either. As a whole, the album moves sonorously from brooding dark guitars, vocals, and organ to foot-tapping southern roots. This is a wonderful blend of true grit Cat and good ole' southern blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO CHAN!","review":"Although the sound of The Greatest is a little different than prior albums (especially the first couple), it is a sound that goes absolutely great with Chan's voice. You'll find a funkier side of Ms. Marshall on several of the tracks, but Cat Power lovers need not worry about missing out on slower more melancholy songs, cause there are still a couple of those too. Wonderful wonderful album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature, Sultry Approach Wins Me Over","review":"The Greatest by Cat Power is a great place to get introduced to this original songwriter. Slowed down, acoustic, dreamily textured, these songs reflect the maturity of a songwriter at the top of her powers. Those who warm up to these slower acoustic songs will probably want to check out kindred spirits in the bands Beaumont, The Big Phony, The Clientele, Club 8, The Concretes, Hope Sandoval, Le Mans, The Monglfier Brothers, Ronderlin, and Simpatico."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped and boring","review":"I bought this on the basis of a magazine review.I am thoroughly underwhelmed.Not even seasoned Memphis pros could rescue this dreary, twee and indulgent project.Miss Chan, go back to your lo fi/alterna crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chan can do better than this.","review":"Incorporating more instruments is a good move even though I loved the sparse textures of the excellent You Are Free. The problem here is that she's singing her smoky voice through the kind of junk that Van Morrison sh_ts out these days (someone needs to tell him to stop coasting on his reputation and record some good MUSIC to go along with for a change, but I digress). The music on this collection does not do her justice - it is definitely NOT the cat's meow. It is lame, actually. There is one good song, \\"The Moon\\". Unfortunately, the album reverts back to whatever theme she was trying to evoke. I dreamt Hope Sandoval would step in and show her how it's done. Once again, the rock press gets it wrong. This is not a very good album. Here's hoping she tries using a band again to improved effect."},{"rating":"1","title":"golly she is kinda pretty!","review":"from some angles.from others, she looks like my little brother when he was really intoBlack Oak Arkansas.oh, the music! given the fact that Chan, poor thing, ison every zine cover in the world right now, it's hard tofocus on the songsmithery here. all right! let's listen!very very contrived--melody free, banal lyrics, superpretentiousinflections. not even \\"the moon,\\" the highly touted song here, hasmuch brightness, as it were.get some really solid indie rock: THE BLACK WATCH, YO LA TENGO,ROBYN HITCHCOCK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cat has labored, brought forth a hairball","review":"This was highly recommended.

Filmed in stark black and white, it feels at times like an impersonal newsreel archive of the terrifying violence and brutality perpetrated by the Japanese during their occupation of Nanking. The casualness of the often random terror inflicted by the Japanese is reflected in the detached stoicism/passiveness of the Japanese protagonist, who in the end finds himself unable to resolve the conflict between his military indoctrination and his empathy for the vanquished Chinese. Many of the combat scenes, although without special effects, are so well-enacted I found myself flinching involuntarily to dodge stray rounds. Eloquent and convincing cinematic corroboration of Sherman's remark that war is hell, doubly so when the invaders are racist supremacists."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is far from a historical fact.","review":"This is a propaganda movie having low degree that created a random historical fact by the Chinese Communist Party.

I have seen a great many films that were sad and disturbing, but this tops them all. The film is so disturbing and so ugly that it becomes pointlessly sadistic.

This game is mediocre overall.","review":"Considering its a COD game, its main focus is the war aspect of it and what is going on throughout the game as this aspect covers it. Anyway the online multiplayer is okay and is pretty much the main reason why anyone plays a COD game, the on-foot FPS controls are okay and u can't sprint in this game which is stupid. What is also stupid is the fact that the controls for the tank that u control is horrible. Also there really isn't much to this game as well as the fact that the fact that the infinite ammo cheat doesn't work at all.

It's easy to see why. Perfect Dark Zero was definitely NOT the killer application for this console. If any game is, it's Call of Duty 2. To start off, the graphics are the best on the system. Next, allways there is some type of excellent music playing, matching in perfectly with the situation. The weapons all just feel so right, and you even get to drive tanks. The multiplayer rocks too, with the awesome Axis v. Alles. Yes, just about everything in this game is brillant. Finest Hour wasn't made by Infinity Ward, which is why it didn't rock. You simply must get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting the good fight.","review":"This is arguably the best game ever. Capturing the essence and brutalness of war, Call of Duty 2 is the new best FPS around. In three campaigns, you take on the Germans and anything that moves. Yes, this game has everything, even the generic D-Day level. Definately, this is not Grandpa's World War 2. No, this is the time of heroics and intense fire fights. Besides, everyone knows that if you die, you respawn at the last checkpoint. But this game is definately more realistic, especially considering there is no preposterous health cannisters lying around or the ill-concieved \\"Destruction on Demand\\" in the Outfit.

They all said that the Call of Duty owned the genre head and shoulders above the competition.I own CoD2 and I can honestly say it is one of the best games I have played. Very glad I bought it. Best of all, I didn't get my XBOX360 until recently so I was able to get it used for under $20 bucks.The story / campaign mode for this game is just OUTSTANDING. Realism all over the place, from the locations to the equipment, to the sounds and uniforms. Had a blast playing this for HOURS on end! Really felt like I was in on the action, especially in some of the maps where you attack German bunkers.Overall, recommend this game to players looking for a fun game with lots of shoot 'em up excitement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best wwII shooter for the 360.","review":"Though the jaded gamer may pass over any game with the words wwII fps in it this is one you shouldn't miss out on.

I've played it non-stop with my two teenage sons for the last 3 days and we're still having a great time with it. Single player and multiplayer off-line are both very engaging. No experience with on-line yet.I will echo the comments from some others, however, in that while I am pleased with COD2, it should have been more. It's just a small step up from Halo on Xbox in terms of graphics and AI. For a next-gen platform and game I expected more.

They will use cover effectivly and will even try and get better postioning on you. It may seem like no big deal but game developers have been promising smart AI for years and never deleviring until now.I unfortunitly do not have the ability to play on Xbox Live so the muliplayer is very limited for me... what I have play is fantastic.

How many times can they redo WWII video games? There's no story line, unless you enjoy sham remakes of what really happened.

This game is my favorite game. The single player mission is amazing, especially on veteran, which I recommend playing first, because if you play on regular or hardened first, it will be hard to become accustumed to veteran. The online multiplayer is the greatest online experience I have ever had. Some complain that the maps only hold 8 people, but that makes it all the more fun in my opinion. This is also the game I'm best at, I play other games, but in this one, I rarely don't get first place on the Live game. And even when CoD3 comes out, I assure you, that I will still be playing this game because it was made by Infinity Ward, which we all know has made the best Call of Duty games. If you like War games, FPS games, any games at all, get this game, you will not regret it, though you should buy the GotY edition, because it comes with the extra map packs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"Ive never liked war games before until i bought this.

Next to Madden, GTA, Tecmo Bowl, Doom, and Mario Bros.Graphics are amazing...from the sand in the desert to the snow coming down in Russia. The sound also puts you in the game!! And the best part about it is this...once you beat it you'll want to go back and play it again.

Thirty-odd years on, the roles are reversed. It can be seen that the Stones created something lasting while Godard's contributions to this movie are cinematically amateurish and politically primitive. Unfortunately Godard wasn't enough of an artist to appreciate the material he had, and so he keeps cutting away from the Stones to add various undergraduate-level film tricks. The net result is increased appreciation for the professionalism and discipline of the boys -- well, of Jagger, Richards, Wyman and Watts (Brian Jones is a silent, stoned presence playing inaudible rhythm guitar) -- because it contrasts so strongly with the lack of professionalism and discipline in the film itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"***pathetic (NO sympathy!)","review":"Great song; ridiculous movie.I'm of this silly generation, yet it is not the silliness of half this movie which bothers me. (The movie mixes footage of the Rolling Stones recording \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\" with immature, amateur social \\"commentary\\".)It is the arrogance and the ignorance which flows from this film that bothers me, the fakery that richness and idleness birth. Silly me! When I was impressionable, I listened to these jesters and these jumping jack flashes rather than the wisdom of the west.Maybe this is why so many had so many objections to us in the 1970s; we were so objectionable.Continue to listen to the song.

I was looking for something along the lines of Let It Be, but this is all about one song only, and large sections are buried under seemingly random rambling by a male voice affecting a literary quality.Then there are the completely unrelated sections taking place out on the street and in a junkyard and elsewhere.If you're looking for absurdity mixed with psychedelia and 60s music, I'd recommend the Monkees' Head which is much more fun and also very interesting and thought-provoking."},{"rating":"1","title":"85% unwatchable","review":"The footage of the Stones' working sessions is great. I loved watching and listening to the metamorphosis of that great song. But Jean-Luc Godard's interspersed, incoherent \\"cultural revolution\\" playlets with the little pinball Love Grrl and the Black Panthers...I can't describe how utterly awful it is. There's something wrong with the fast-forward button on our dvd player remote, so I went to the tv and pressed the fast forward on the player to get through these parts after the first two bits. Needless to say, I ended up sitting in front of the player, a foot from the TV, so I wouldn't have to see any more of these parts.

I bought this DVD without knowing anything about the French director Jean-Luc Godard. The so called \\"pop politiacal cartoons\\" that the review on the back cover refers to as sheer genius, are moronic and actually painful to watch. These skits are all about socialism, black power, and revolution. Oh boy! The high minded symbolism of this movie just looks ridiculous to me. The skits in this movie are so un-professional that they appear to be made by Junior High School kids! And that is a slight to the kids! As far as the Stones rehersals, they are interesting, but slow. They develop only the one song. As great as that song is (one of my all time favorite Stones tunes) it's just not something to watch over and over again. Especially if you have to endure the rest of this horrible movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"a stone fan","review":"just got this, the stones are great, the rest sucks....I can't even make to the end, my wife just laughs at me every time I put it in to try to see the end. sorry it sucks........"},{"rating":"2","title":"All 5 stars are for The Stones...","review":"The great thing about digital technology is that you can butcher, reassemble and reanimate other people's abominations. If I were to re-cut this pitiful, tedious, self satisfied rant on something political, I'd fashion it into a short but thrilling peek into the Stone's laboratory as they meticulously construct one of rock's all time hugest monsters.

But the Director's crap with the incoherent babbling of some man, weird scenes with a bunch of Black Panthers was completely pointless in my opinion. I had to skip these segments quite a bit to get to the hidden jems in this movie.Again, I loved seeing the band develope the song, it was phenomenal to get that Insider's perspective, but the rest was crap. I was expecting something similar to The Who's Kids Are Alright, where they show scenes of them in the recording studio, with unadulterated footage, but Sympathy was something much different. This is worth renting to see the band, but I wouldn't suggest owning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so","review":"This movie is only good when the Stones are on (I love the song \\"Sympathy For the Devil\\").

My remote was working, and I used it a lot.I'm still looking for something really good by the Stones on DVD, VHS whatever and have yet to find it.

The most interesting aspect was not the explanation of what is known, but rather the clear lack of understanding about exactly how the Romans went about building these monumental works. The book discusses in some detail the two surviving Roman texts which address aqueducts. Much is also derived from archaeological analysis of those structures that are still standing. This is adequate but cannot fully explain how the engineers went about building them. The section on surveying in particular left me wondering if we were not missing some critical piece of information. This book can only provide the information we have about aqueducts, and cannot be faulted for the limited data we currently have. It presents that which we do know in an informative, entertaining manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greenleaf doesn't know as much as he thinks he does.","review":"This book is marred by some rather amazing lapses. For example, Greenleaf asserts that one's socks should match one's shoes when in fact they should match one's trousers; that single-breasted suits are more traditional than double-breasted ones when in fact the opposite is true; that a four-in-hand tie knot is a half Windsor; that a half Windsor tie knot is a full Windsor; and that a full Windsor tie knot is a double Windsor.

The original sticker said it was good up to 1.5\\" branches, this ad says it'll eat 2.5\\" limbs, but that was not my experience. I've never cut anything harder than oak or pine, and never anything thicker than an inch. But now the blade is bent, and it won't get through half-inch limbs without a fight. I assume there is harder steel on other products. I'll find out this summer.FWIW, while the blade was straight, these loppers made quick work of some green branches that were less than an inch thick, and the handles took all the abuse I dished out. The second star is for that reason. The non-blade parts of this thing have held up nicely. They're also 5 years old, and only now have a little rust on them.Apart from the bent blade, these are good loppers.But the blade is pretty much the clutch component, seriously. So I won't buy these again, I'll try a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for most cutting jobs but not best for everything.","review":"I have had an anvil looper for a long time. The anvil looper has a gear mechanism that increases the leverage. It easily cut up to 2-inch branches with one slice. But the blade finally became dull and I could not find a replacement so I decided it was time to buy a new one. I had a difficult time deciding between an anvil or bypass looper. I decided on the bypass because it has 2 ?-inch cutting capacity and long 32-inch handles for leverage. They should have said 2 ?-inch capacity if you can cut it because you can't cut through a 2 or 2 ?-inch tree branch without attacking it several times from various angles. That makes cutting vary difficult. On smaller stuff it cuts great but then the long handles become awkward.It is a good cutting tool for brush and small branches but next time, when I must buy another one, it will be an anvil."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor blade quality, great customer service","review":"After an hour of testing the cutter on 1\\" branches, the blade edges were bent/dull.

It is true that a lot of artistic licence has been taken, so if you care about the real facts, read The Judgement of Paris (excellent book). However, there are some hilarious lines, Alan Rickman is fabulous, and the scene of the tasting itself is a must for anyone that cares about wine.

All of those characteristics pulled together made it extremely enjoyable. I think that if you are a wine fan and enjoyed the movie Sideways for the wine parts you will enjoy this more than the average movie watcher. If you have no interest or not much in wine it doesn't mean that you won't enjoy the movie, it may just be somewhat less entertaining.I think that you should get a good bottle of wine out of the cellar or wine rack and sit down to a wonderful movie about wine, life, and the struggle it takes to fulfill your dreams.

This movie is not the book. It's a wholesale fabrication of the story with a really annoying love story with a superflous wet t-shirt scene. Not crediting the actual winemakers is a huge gaffe (Mike Grgich actually made the white wine, and the grapes were bought in from Sonoma, not grown in Napa.) And the big tasting being held in a wreck of a building? No freaking way in heck!!!That said, I will watch Alan Rickman in anything. Watching him sniff, swirl, sip and spit is pure pleasure. Bill Pullman is great in this, if a little one note (it's the writing, not him), and Freddy Garcia is very good. The cinematography is wonderful, particularly when they swoop over Napa.

The book really is head and shoulders better than the film which portrays only one wine and the associated people who brought that wine to Paris. The film also has very flimsy romantic subplot which is the usual modus operandi of hollywood to spice up the movie. I recommend reading the book and forgetting the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you would expect","review":"If you are not that interested in wine or learning anything about the '76 tasting, then you'll probably enjoy this movie. It's a very superficial 'feel-good' story of a father & son & hot intern. Even as such, you never get to know or care about the characters very much.I get that this isn't supposed to be an educational documentary but a few more details would have been nice. For instance - why was the Napa wine better? What are the high-level differences in winemaking style between France & US? What happened at the red wine tasting? Was the tasting really held in a run-down building with no roof?I really wanted to see this movie and really wanted to like this movie. I am very interested in wine & viticulture and any film that promotes and feeds this interest, I have to see.

They spent a little too much time on the son's love life but the movie was good overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Alan Rickman can't save this movie","review":"Alan Rickman is the only good thing about this movie. It is otherwise filled with bad acting, stilted dialogue, bad wigs, and filmed 85% of the time between the hours of 5-7 pm during the sun setting to make everything look better than it actually was. The true story is remarkable, but this filmmaker's vision dumbed it down to a cliche. Even Alan Rickman can't save this movie, it even makes him look bad. It so bad, that I even bother to spend some time to tell Amazon readers how bad it is. This is not a documentary, but the film makers fantasy of what California, and the wine county might be like. It is so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"beautifully shot, terrible writing","review":"This movie had wonderful potential but every line made me cringe... forced character developement, layers of cliches -- but really enjoyed the scenery."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO Disappointing","review":"Having just read the Judgement of Paris & planning our annual trip to Napa , this movie was terrible. Yes, it was a good cast & incredible views of Napa, especially the movie opening. It was too Hollywood & in no way conveyed the collaboration taking place in the valley to put Napa on the map. We have been seriously learning about wine the past few years & are in no way experts (yet). However, when they finally got to the tasting competition & it was OUTSIDE? I can't believe a serious competition that includes your sense of smell would take place outdoors? Again, beautifully filmed, but so disappointing if you seriously want to know the story of the significance of the 1976 Paris Tasting. We had such high expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows....","review":"They took a great story, and killed it.Instead of being a story about the rise and recognition of the US wine industry and the people behind it, it becomes a tale of a burnout son, a hussy intern, and a lot of bad acting.I paid to see it in the theater, and then watched it again (for free) on a flight. Both times made me cringe.How does a wine movie kill the romance of wine? Just watch Bottle Shock."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, this is terrible","review":"Uncertain (but showy nevertheless) direction, half-baked script, characters that generate zero warmth and an unbelievable narrative await you with this rancid DVD. After 10 minutes, I said to my wife, \\"We have a directing problem here.\\" She said, \\"No, we have an everything problem.\\"Randall Miller may be the most inept director I've seen in some time. He has absolutely no idea what to do with the camera and an editing sytle that borders on psychotic. Chris Pine evokes absolute revulsion in his characterization of Bo. (Did he really show up at the Paris contest in the same t-shirt he wore in Napa? Help me.)The character Sam decides to sleep with Gustavo and then Bo for what reason again? Huh? The Napa growers decide to send layabout Bo the bum to Paris to represent them. What? Bo and his father have repeated violent boxing matches for exactly what reason?Enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Can't Believe These Reviews!","review":"Although I'm not a movie buff, I know a good one when I see it. This was about the worst I've seen in a long time. Amateur acting and writing. Bottle Shock could've been a great picture based on the story line, so it was very disappointing. I am reviewing this movie only to add a little balance to the others I see here - it's shocking to me that it is rated so high. It doesn't even begin to compare to Sideways!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Packaging Issues","review":"The Movie was great, but I have issues with the packaging. Fox has been too aggressive with their security strip on the top of the package to the point of excess while cost reducing the plastic box. The consequence of this is that the box can now be damaged when one tries to remove the strip when opening the package. Fox should not make the consumer have to deal with this problem.Fox must also be using a third rate manufacturer to produce the discs as they come with coffee stains on them and often have problems playing on players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bottle Shock","review":"This is a nice relaxing film to watch with an exciting punch towards the end. It's a movie you can watch over and over again. The views of California are absolutely beautiful. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One the best food/wine movies out there!","review":"My wife and I collect food and wine movies and we found \\"Bottle Shock\\" to be one of the best we've added to our collection in recent years. An aging Alan Rickman gives a great droll performance as the out of place English wine expert. The father son conflict between Bill Pullman and Chris Pine is well played out. Another nice touch in the film is it captures the ambience of Northern California as it used to be and foreshadows well what it has become. All in all, well worth a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly Surprised!","review":"I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie...I watched it only because AR is in it and he usually delivers an excellent performance regardless of the script. I must say I was not disappointed. The \\"younger\\" characters seemed a little distracting from the story line at times, and I wonder if they really needed them as much as they were in there (that's why I didn't give it 5 stars). Over all this is an excellent movie! I especially enjoyed the humor in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"If you are a \\"wino\\" like me, you will appreciate this movie about how the wine industry got started in Napa.

This documentary must receive a five star review. To personally forgive people and groups who have harmed you heals one personally, but more importantly, promotes a culture of forgiveness that helps heal the entire world. Although I have not known horror as Ms. Kor has done, I also have experienced the sweet saving grace of forgiveness in my life, and experienced its blessed benefits. This documentary is a 100 percent success, and Ms. Kor's work is completely on the side of the angels. I encourage everyone imprisoned by bitterness to see this documentary and find the joy and hope of forgiveness that Ms. Kor has found."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long Documentary About A Hypocrite","review":"\\"Forgiving Dr Mengele\\" is an unnecessary long documentary about a Holocaust survivor's tragic experience under the hands of Dr Mengele in the Auschwitz concentration camp. You will be filled with remorse until the moment she meets with Palestinians (unless you're prejudice towards Palestinians or ignorant about the Palestinian-Israeli issue). While she was meeting with Palestinians who were telling their tragic stories under the Jewish immigrants (Israelis) rule after they took over Palestine, the Holocaust survivor's reaction and demeanor towards them was surprisingly cold, which was appalling considering that she was a victim of the Holocaust. This documentary is a demonstration of how people can attempt to gain sympathy from others by telling their tragic stories of others oppressing them, yet have no sympathy when they are part of a group who is oppressing innocent people for their own personal gain. It shows that history won't teach some people a lesson."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real tree of life","review":"WOW! This is an excellent and superbly organized presentation of the phylogenetic relationships of 'all' organisms. Cross-referencing is simple with common name and Latin name indices. Shading, drawings and color are used effectively to highlight relationships. An inserted summary is so useful that it is worth the price alone. No biologist (cellular, organismic or whatever) should be without this book --- and it is amazingly inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, very personal","review":"Golders Green, a northern Jewish suburb, is where Badfinger used to live, a place where Ham could record his little songs on a Revox tape. Some of the songs the guy wrote are amazing. He was defiently one of the best songwriters to come out of Britain. His material on Badfinger's \\"Straight up\\" and \\"Wish you were here\\" are 100% superb. Perfect pop songs. \\"Golders Green\\" is a really good album, it shows Ham's songwrting and performance talents. \\"Dawn\\" is a beutiful Psych ballad,\\"Makes me feel so good\\" could have been easily 'The first Power Pop anthem' if was released at that time. The rest is quite the same, Very Mccartney in total, similar to Mcca's early solo albums, sometimes even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"What might have been","review":"There's that mixture of joy and sadness again, last heard in Bryan McLean's madly-inspired home demos (Ifyoubelievein). This batch of almost-theres and not-quites works wonderfully as a melancholic souvenir of Ham's could-have-been-brilliant career, which was tragically cut short by his suicide. This second collection of private tapes is a trip to a better musical place --- for both Badfinger obsessives and pop lovers who never really cared about the group or its wonderful guitarist/writer. A listen to such beautiful works-in-progress as Dawn, Where Will You Be and Makes Me Feel Good (two versions of which bookend the disc) should convert even skeptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost as good as 7PA","review":"The second offering from Badfinger's leader, whom sadly is no longer with us. These demos really show how great Pete's writing was. Without You's demo is one of two that he made (The other is available with the OOP first issue of Matovina's book). Although the overdubs are clearer than on 7PA cos they were recorded on an ADAT machine, while the 7PA overdubs were taped on an 8 track reel to reel, which is why I gave it a 4 plus I think it shouldve had more completed songs, plus he's singing about his willy ('Why Pete?', i ask)! (Goodbye John Frost and Hurry On Father were edited to make them longer, if you didnt know). But overall, this is almost as good as 7PA, just barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes Me Feel So Good","review":"How can one express the absolute angst about the loss of Pete Ham without wanting to finish off those who took away his dersire to live?These tracks are rejects for Badfinger releases (except for 3 tracks on this disc that did make it, Midnight Caller, Without You and Shine On). No doubt rejected in favor of lesser tracks by the least talented songwriters in a democratic band, it shows Pete Ham could have and should have done a solo deal.This album kicks *** in the kindest of ways.Buy it, buy it, buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't make this your first Mu-ziq buy!!!","review":"If you REALLY want to listen to Mu-ziq's best stuff, check out Tango'n'Vectif and Bluff Limbo.

Being a Mu-ziq fan I gave these guys a fair shake. Indeed these tracks have all the smooth under-melodies and hard break beat cuts as their pedigree main album brothers. But somehow they do not possesss the legerdemain of the Mu-ziq name. Maybe if they had been secretly held over into the next CD they could have blended in and stood their ground. I agree that they were not added to the main CD as this would have diluted it's intensity. Track #7 \\"Abmoit\\" does grab your interest with a unique stylistic presentation. Even the CD cover shows daddy turning his back on these feeble bastards.

It is teaching my youngest (7 yrs.) how electronic equipment works, and it gives her a sense of creativity and power to be able to record and shoot her own videos and pictures of the things she considers photo-worthy. If the photo doesn't come out, she simply deletes it. It's teaching her about electronic memory and storage and only having so much memory available before she has to choose whether to save or delete items, etc. It's also teaching her about how to take good photos and videos, which she is learning quickly. Matter of fact, we discovered she took the only video of my niece's wedding on her V-Cam and everyone was amazed at what she was able to capture with this toy. For the price, it is a great value and we are very pleased with it. I am a little worried about the durability because it is lightweight plastic, but she has dropped it on the hardwood floor, etc. but it has not broken yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun","review":"I bought (4) cameras - one each for my niece & nephews for XMas.

The video quality is extremely poor, and any kid who has seen (and used) his parents' video camera or digital camera will be very, very disappointed in the frankly lousy quality of the video off this thing. No flash, VERY dark jerky images. I'd say for the money, kick in another $50 and buy your kid a \\"real\\" digital camera or a used \\"real\\" videocamera, if you want to encourage this kind of activity.

He was SOOO disappointed because he had saved up his birthday money for this toy, that I took it back and got him a REAL camera.Obviously it's for kids, but if they have ever seen your video camera or digital camera, they will be disappointed in the quality of the images and the non-function of the camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality, not worth the price","review":"I bought the Vcam for my 9 year old niece because she loves to play with our digital camera. When it was delivered I tried it out first and I am so glad I did. While the camera was cute, the quality seemed very cheap, the buttons were difficult to push, and I was unable to take any pictures! I returned it and for about $30 more bought an inexpensive \\"real\\" digital camera. A child who is old enough for this camera will probably be better of with an adult camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Well, I bought two of these for my two boys 9 and 11 and they just dont seem to use them. I can see why. It will only shoot video for a few seconds and thats it! Apparently you have to purchase a memory card and I just cant see doing that. I would rather let them use my cam corder. If we invest another 50.00 for each child to have some fun with it, I just dont see the point. Should have worked properly without the SD memory card.

Then there is the separate swing set toy where you can have 2 dolls swinging. It all appears fairly sturdy and my 4 year old has carried it around with her and played with it quite a bit. The little plastic pieces and outfits that come with it are pure nuisance items to me, I must pick them up ten times a day and eventually I throw them out, but the kids think they are tons of fun.

As an intermediate level, I found this workout too easy and was disappointed to find myself not a bit sore the next day. I've even tried it several more times to make sure I wasn't doing the moves incorrectly or not putting in enough effort. Overall, it's probably designed for beginners just starting to workout, which would be a great ab workout in that case.

From standing to lying on the floor. It's really easy to follow and for a person getting back into the routine of working out again I definitey feel the burn in my abs. Two things to complain about is the length and the instructor cues. It's only 30 mins. I believe to get a better workout it should have been stretched to at least 45 mins. The instructor is good at times on her cues but then starts to slack off and assumes everyone knows how to do the Mambo for se.

I've read almost all the wrestling books and this one rates among the worst. Dusty lives in a dream world. He takes credit for everything yet blame for nothing. He claims if hogan wasn't around, he was all set to be the biggest draw in wrestling. His hatred for hogan runs throughout the book. He thinks since he came up with \\"the great american bash\\" that vince should pay him around 200,000$ in royalties . He goes on to say how he was the first to drive a truck into a stadium and drink beer, not austin. According to dusty, he's done it all.

Episodes are as repetitive and numbing as the dogfights they describe. Either the flyer got up behind the foe, fired, and watched the enemy go down, or the enemy got behind the American, who nevertheless escaped (since these aces survived to tell their story). The most interesting tale, and the longest, deals with a downed pilot escaping through enemy lines into Normandy after D-Day. Also interesting is the service records of aces after WWII. The structure and style of this book, keyed to reporting action only, make it seem heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unassuming rock with a country twang...","review":"Sparkle is the second solo release by Angie Heaton, former drummer for bad girl rockers Corndolly ( Mud ).

This toy was the biggest disappointment last Christmas. It never has worked and the customer service line is closed when you call (during their stated business hours). The picture is horrible. The videos are over priced for what they are and GOOD LUCK trying to transfer anything to the device. I'm a gadget fan and have worked with a variety of devices but this one never should have gone to market.

When you're in the car or outside and it's sunny, you can't see the screen.6. It froze on me several times, and after a few weeks stopped working. It may have been the batteries, or rough handeling during shipping, but I'm not so sure.I guess I'm not suprised by it's quality, considering it costs so little, but still, I do NOT thinks its worth the money.

The \\"intimate\\" picture portrayed gives a thin image of his artist friends. Moreover this picture is one of, somewhat desperate, people seeking to be significant as artists, but coming off more like hangers-on.

The first ones are good, and the last minute of the last episode is in full color, but the rest is very disappointing. The \\"commentary\\" for Episode 19 is just 2 chicks jabbering about nothing to do with the episode.

The story, the premise, the characters, etc., were all great. The last 6 were OK, but there were several disappointments in the last 6. First off, it took 2 1/2 episodes to defeat one antagonist/beast. Granted, it was a \\"superbeing\\", but extending the fight over 2 1/2 episodes was too long, and detracted from the storyline. The last episode had a cancelled show/series feel to it. There were plenty of story elements that could be used if the series had another season. Were the show's producers counting on another season in order to resolve these loose story elements?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Claymore Review","review":"Claymores are half-human creatures that use giant swords when hunting the blood-thirsty yoma, monstrous fiends that seek out and devour the visceral meat of human innards. As one might imagine, this is a very bloody anime, and definitely not suited for children under the age of 17. In addition to all the gory glory, all claymores are female thus, considering the MA-TV rating, a fair amount of partial nudity and occasional revealing of breasts and buttocks is present. In short, this is not a kids cartoon show... IT IS VERY ADULT!!! Parents be warned. However, if none of the above bothers you, the story and style of the anime more than make up for its unnecessary desire to flood your TV screen with nudity and gore. Another plus is the show's ardent lack of strong language, this was a big surprise as the show beautifully captures each character's emotions in dire situations. A big thumbs up on the writing.For more info and complete review:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Okay so this anime has always and always has been my favorite!

Funimation is only offering the 5.1 audio in English, as they do in many of their other releases. It seems funimation has little regard for those who prefer the original language. It's not like it would have been a huge added expense to keep the Japanese in the conversion process, and then add the dub after5. This is why I will often buy some funimation titles in the aftermarket, as Funimation seems no regard for the fan base that loves anime and appreciates the original language. I asked once about this practice and funimation replied, that to provide this service to the original language fans would be a disservice to the other fans.

I call the souffle 'face crack' because I am addicted to it. I used the moisturizer as part of my morning routine, after applying the souffle. Unfortunately, this product did not work well for me. I'm not sure what ingredients my skin objected to, but I developed an odd red rash on my temple and upper lip. I didn't want to attribute the skin problems to this moisturizer, but after I stopped using it and went back to my usual face cream, my rash disappeared. Again, because I didn't want to give up on the product, I tried it for a couple of days and my skin became irritated and reddened. I even used it without the souffle (which has 12% AHA) and it still caused a rash.
