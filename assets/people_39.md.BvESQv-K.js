The albums flows well and is a very enjoyable listen for many occasions. 'Silver Sun' is also a strong track which brings a bit of a 'Beetles' feel to it.I highly recommend this album for those that like ambient music and indie (hard to use this word with them) with a bit of a post-rock feel.Favorite Tracks: Track 03, Track 04, Track 06, Track 09"},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent from start to finish!","review":"I was awe-struck the first time I heard this album.

However, it's hard to deny that at times the songs didn't get lost and a bit flattened out by the production so that they'd blend a bit too much into one another.This time, the production is much lighter and the band is able to shine a bit more. South are able to create a beautiful wall of sound and it gives the album a feeling of being drenched in a sort of hopeful melancholy.The album has a bit harder-edged sound. It's just enough to punctuate certain moments and let the songs really shine.

There is little to no excitement throughout 'With The Tides'. The sad, rainy day mood never changes during the album, making each of the similar sounding tracks seem even more so.On many tracks, such as 'Colours In Waves' 'Loosen Your Hold' and 'Same Old Story', the band layers the vocals many times over to create an unpleasing 'ghost trio' vocal. The opener, 'Motiveless Crime' is the closest you'll get to a completely intriguing piece.None of the songs are bad, but at the same time, you know you could listening to something much better.And finally, the vast majority of the album's liner notes are nearly impossible to read due to the fonts being written by the band's pet chicken."},{"rating":"2","title":"many more than expected and perfect sizes","review":"There are over 20 stickers in this package.

If I want reality, I'll watch CNN. For that reason, while I know child abuse exists & think it needs to be acknowledged to end it, I don't really want to watch someone hurt children (& animals). Maybe part of the reason I had such a problem with this movie was the fact that everyone talks about what a great children's movie this is.

The father when he was getting drunk he was playing a Hank Williams record. He abused the boy several times. Then the oldest boy was hesitated to tell his mother. They made a radio flyer airplane. The father got arrested for almost killing the boy the first time. He changed for a week but he got drunk again. At the end of the film the mother finally found out what he was doing to the boy and told the police. She kept asking the oldest boy Where is his brother at?"},{"rating":"1","title":"1.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A relentlessly manipulative movie that leaves no stone unturned in its attempt to make the audience cry/cheer/whatever, Radio Flyer is not only shameless but ridiculous (we're supposed to be happy at an ending where little Bobby is all alone and isolated from his family) and blessed with awful special effects--please stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I just saw this movie yesterday and absolutely loved it! It was extremely moving and I'd recommend it to anyone. The ending is hard to understand but I suggest reading other reviews to figure out the meaning behind it.

Very moving."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most touching movies I have ever seen.","review":"When This movie first came out I was seven years old. I saw it becasue I had a huge crush on Elijah Wood. When I watched it for the first time I found myself completly mezmorized by the movie. That rarley happens when you are seven years old. I was a very imaginitive child and I did alot of things like what those two boys did. And at seven years old I tuned in with the rest of the adult audience hating \\"the king\\". I saw it then, i loved it and I love it to this day. Wonderful performances by the whole cast. Especialy the two young boys. I strongly suggest this movie to anyone who has not seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Flyer","review":"This is a very emotional book (to me) and it has a great lesson, that the \\"older children\\" must always look after the younger ones even though it is not their responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful, I can see something","review":"Loved Loved Loved could not wait to see it again.Now I can see it any time I'm looking for somethinggood to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD","review":"This item was a gift so I did not view the video but assume it was fine.

This is true, and was why I bought this book, having felt somewhat abandonned by the health profession immediately after giving birth.Unfortunately this book was not what I hoped. It falls into the \\"Wise Woman\\" style of pseudo-science, and myself, I much prefer something with statistics and hard facts on what exactly is happening to my body. I had access to plenty of that sort of information during pregnancy - but can't find it now.About the only part of this book I appreciated was the personal stories.

We managed to get it installed and it worked great...for about 3 days. It occassionally locked up while playing a CD. I mean REALLY locked up - to the point where it had to be turned off and back on again.

Well it certainly wasn't worth the wait. Unlike Steven Saylor's excellent Roma Sub Rosa mystery series, I find the work by John Maddox Roberts to be flat. The author doesn't delve into any of the characters very well, and he has a tendency to reference literally hundreds of characters that add little value to the story and only confuses the reader. The actual story, that is \\"the conspiracy\\", doesn't really form until the second half of the book and, well, it's not all that thrilling.Bottom line: I think my SPQR adventure ends with this book. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two for two in terms of excellent writing","review":"This is of course the second of the ten in the series and I enjoyed it very much.

I had purchased a few of the SPQR series years ago but never got around to reading them [why ?]. I also must start a series with the first novel. So I purchased SPQR I and II [repurchased ?]. The books have completely lived up to my hope and expectation for this genre. The author smoothly blends history, mystery and humor all in one concise package. I'm now on vol III and am probably stuck for buying all XIII volumes [so far].

The song selection is of poor choice. It seems that they just threw something together at the last minute. The songs are mostly traditional gospel but even those are not as up to par as the earlier CD. It is no where near as inspirational as 1998 CD nor did it stir my soul like the 1999 CD.

For at least three years I looked forward to this CD set. Now, I'm certain that I won't purchase the 2003 CD (or any future WOW CDs) on the merits of any previous compilations. What happened?Perhaps it's time another label emerged and pulled together a truly quality effort. While the songs are all excellent, they don't represent the artists' work in 2002. Or perhaps I have this wrong...maybe this is just a compilation of previous work that is just RELEASED in 2002.Not at all what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fun","review":"Great silent movie! The DVD is EXCELLENT quality. I wasn't sure if it was correct projection speed when I ordered it, but it turned out to be - and what a movie! The orchestral score is perfect. All the characters are developed nicely and this was a great role for the leading actor; memorable screen presence. The movie wouldn't be nearly as good without Louise Brooks, but I was hoping for more screen time from her.This is a great movie from the Roaring Twenties with a lighthearted plot that is effective and fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed and consequently disappointing","review":"A potentially interesting and highly important book which was spoiled for me by Miller's insistence that autism is caused by cruel and unloving parents (a view contradicted by exhaustive research). This flaw seemed to cast doubt on the rest of the book, as Miller would seem to be contradicting her own principles by ignoring the testimony of high-functioning people with autism themselves who have spoken out vociferously against this view and by treating the traumatic and pointless method of \\"holding therapy\\" as a miracle cure.Society badly needs to wake up to the issue of child abuse (emotional as well as physical), but this cause is hindered not helped by claiming as a product of abuse one of the disorders which has been most conclusively shown to be neurological."},{"rating":"1","title":"Howgwash","review":"While I applaud her commitment to exposing Child Abuse and am intrigued by her style of writing, I am horrified that she is so extremist in her views. Alice is obviously well-read and well-educated but some of her assumptions completely miss the mark. She basically made me feel that I am a child abuser. I have never raised a hand to my child. But that does not seem good enough to her. And do not even get me started on her section on Autism! She opens up a can of worms there and never closes it, instead choosing to put her opinion out there and then never defend or back up her claims.I do think there is some valuable information in this book but no one should take this too seriously. It reads like a work of fiction. The subject matter is heavy and heart-breaking but because of her all-or-nothing approach I found myself tuning out early in the book. Please read it, but get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo mejor! (The best!)","review":"I love a good cup of coffee.

It's bound to be light years ahead of the crap most young bucks are trying to pass off as mic skills today. This may be the perfect compilation to get in touch with rap's roots.

That is where it stops. It DOES NOT keep coffee hot for 8 hours, actually the coffee starts cooling down immediately, even after pre-filling with hot water.I am terribly disappointed in OGGI products, and doubt that it truly is a thermal caraft. It appears to be just the medal casing with no liner.I would NOT recommend this to anyone else, unless you want lukewarm cold or hot liquids.At the cost of this product, I hope the store will take it back as I feel it was pricey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly buggy","review":"I use this between my iMac and a Linux desktop.

I'm not sure if others do this, but I store the charcoal chimney inside the grill when not in use, and the cover keeps everything nice and dry. I was a little worried that the wind would knock the cover off, but that hasn't happened yet.

Cracking","review":"My Weber grill came with this cover and a brace in the back of the grill that nicely holds the lid. The Weber cover does not fit this grill unless I disassemble the brace in the back - we are talking screws and bolts. With stretching and effort you can get the cover over half of the grill but that's it. It seems a cover should fit the grill without disassembly. This cover also shows cracking and bubbling on the inner layer of material. No, I didn't try to put it on while the grill was hot. I am looking for a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wind got it","review":"It doesn't look like it, but as other reviewers have noted, high wind (around 50 mph) will cause this cover to disappear. It flew off once, it didn't go far, I thought it was a fluke. The second time, it was gone for good. I experimented with the cheaper cover, it also flew off, never to be found. If Weber ever comes up with a more secure design, maybe I'll try that, for now the grill is uncovered (with the lid bungeed down)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Premium Kettle Cover","review":"This is nice!

Our family has enjoyed watching Sponge Bob on Nickelodeon for the past year, and so it was natural to buy such a silly and lighthearted toy. But, when we got it home we were unfortunately harassed by this toy saying, \\"Oh, now I hate you.\\" It is too bad that those in charge at Nickelodeon are so very uncreative, and lame, to make such a negative phrase come out of what should be a fun and silly toy.Nickelodeon failed tremendously, we returned our Eye Poppin SpongeBob. If we want to hear about hate we'll watch a documentary on Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps restore your hormones and give balance","review":"I have to say that I had a very different experience than the last reviewer. I was diagnosed with food allergies years ago. In the process, I also found out that I had a severe candida (yeast) overgrowth in my gut. For 16 weeks, I was on a very detoxifying diet. Due to this diet, and the fact that I have always had a screwed up cycle, I found out that my cortisol levels were messed up thus affecting progesterone production. The first thing my OB said was birth control pills and I refuse to pump my body full of synthetic hormones. So I visited a nautropathic doc who prescribed Fem Rebalance. After a month, instead of having cycles all over the place (14 days, 21 days, 18 days, 23 days, etc), my cycle was 28 days, my skin started clearing up, my sex drive (previously non existent) came back, the flow was much better. I have now been on this for 2 months and I am amazed how this is slowly returning my body to balance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this product","review":"I prefer all natural remedies so I thought this product would be a good buy. After ONE dosage it made me feel weird and sort of ill so I figured I would be able to return it, as all vitamin shops usually accept returns. I would not have wasted my money on this if I knew it would make me ill and the seller would not take it back, the supplements belong in the garbage.

Their advice \\"check eBay and see if someone has a used base station for sale, or buy another 4000 series and I would then have two handsets.\\" Yeah right.... 13 months after that I guess they give the same advice? Then I would have 3 handsets with only $450 invested. STAY AWAY FROM SIEMENS !!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS PHONE!","review":"I had purchased this phone 1 1/2 year ago and then all of the sudden one day, they didn't work. We could get no dial tone. I called the customer service number which instructed me to do a few things ( take batteries out, unplug the main unit, etc) and nothing worked. She then concluded that the base was broken and because it was greater than one year I'd have to purchase another one for $120! I spent over $300 because We had 4 phones total and it stops working after a year!I recently bought the V-tech phone and love it so far! The quality is much better and has nicer features. I like how the name of the person calling and the number appear at the same time unlike the Siemens phone.Siemens customer serivce was not helpful and their products are not worth the money you spend for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great phone","review":"I just got this and it is a very nice phone, light weight, and comfortable to handle. Per another person's comment, the base does have a page feature, it is a small button under the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty call log feature","review":"The call log feature of this phone worked unpredictably. Sometimes, calls from a particular number would be logged, while other times, calls from the same caller would fail to appear in the log. Siemens recommended that I replace the base unit, which I did. This failed to correct the problem. They recommended replacing the base unit again. Instead, I just returned the whole phone system. In addition to the call log problems, the phone also often made an unusual clicking noise during telephone conversations.Amazon[.com] was extremely helpful throughout this whole process and I give Amazon[.com] five stars for their customer service. Unfortunately, I wish I could say the same for the Siemens phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyingly complicated","review":"Don't like the phone. It's so short that if I have the earpiece over my ear, the mouthpiece is so far from my mouth callers have trouble hearing me. It's not any clearer than my 900MHz Panasonic, nor is the range any better.Don't like the answering machine either. The buttons and display are so tiny I have to study the phone in good lighting to see what I want to do. I miss the old push-a-big-button style of answering machine where the messages can be heard as you wander around the room. The weak electronic voice sound on this unit forces me to stay within a foot of the phone, hitting replay with annoying regularity.This is not a convenient appliance, nor is its use intuitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops Calls and Connects Poorly","review":"If you are on the phone more than 20 minutes at some point the phone will start beeping and you will be disconnected for no reason.

JUNK."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you hear me now?","review":"I have these phones sitting in a box waiting for me to get around to selling them to someone on eBay. I feel a little bit guilty about that because they were so useless in my home. Granted we have an old stone house with thick walls, but the Uniden cordless phones I got to replace these work fine.When I called the company to see what to do about the ceaseless popping, buzzing and dropped signals they advised that the phone was not for distance but for security so I should talk in the same room as the base stand. Silly really. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised!","review":"If you're looking for a 4 phone system, do not buy the 4015! It only supports 3 handsets total. You have to buy the 4010 or the 4200 series if you want 4 phones. Siemens does a terrible job of communicating this. Some places in the manual say 3, some say 4, and the website even says 6. When I pointed this out to customer support, they didn't seem to care. Also, in my house the extention handsets had terrible clicking static, rendering them useless. I had high hopes for this product, but had to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Had this phone for about 2 years now and it has been nothing but trouble.

It's answering machine is not real intuitive and the speaker is underpowered if any background noise in the room while you try to play messages (we went back to voicemail). Reception in and around our house is just so-so as well. Our other 2.4 gig phone is a similarly priced Panasonic and reception is better, hands down. Bottom line, people can have different experiences with the same phone for whatever reasons, but I find it curious the price seems to be dropping quickly for this unit and a rebate still applies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy these phones!","review":"These phones are awful. I purchased one 2415 and three 2400 for my house, and it has been a terrible disaster. Phones sound ALL the time with interference.Siemens has a card inside that says: \\"do not return to the store, call Siemens for assistance\\". My units have been replaced twice, and now that I want my money back, neither Amazon or Siemens will do it. They blame alarm systems, DSL cable modems, anything.

I shipped the handset off to them and received a new one. The exact problem existed. I called back Siemens and they told me it must be a bad base. I needed to send them the bill for proof of purchase (apparently the policy had changed between the original troubleshooting) and they would make arrangements to have the base replaced. I am frustrated that their original troubleshooting didn't point to the base. It would have saved me a lot of time and bother. Now I hope I can find the original bill or I'm out of 100 bucks.

Of course, that would be easy enough for even the stupidest reader to realize IF she posted nutritional info for each recipe, but that's something she NEVER does.

As usual, there are weird combinations, few pictures of the completed meals, little nutritional information, and a confusing layout.For Ray,getting health means going \\"low-carb.\\" Plenty of meat,such as in the \\"no-sagna\\",and limited pasta,most of it wheat (yuck!) There is an overload of cheese and meat. One can feel one's arteries clog simply by reading the recipes.

For one reason or another, none of these recipes appeal to me. Each one had a different reason I wouldn't make it: more meat per serving than I like, large amounts of cheese, too many calories or too much saturated fat. (I've never said I wasn't picky.) If the Atkin's diet works for you this book might be just the ticket. I might try another Rachael Ray cookbook but I would read it before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"cooking with 30 minute meals","review":"I like Rachael Ray's shows, but some times the ingredients in her recipes are hard to find at the local grocery.

It's the best I have seen on radio in general and trunking in particular. An unexpected bonus was the free software that is available as a download from the internet. I don't think it will make it to the bookshelf--I'll just keep in on my desk! It is sure to be a frequently-used reference.

It was in the list view when querying Amazon, but when I received the product it turns out it doesn't fit. I noticed (after the fact) that the model number for 8125 isn't listed in the description, but again, it was a first hit when searching. Due to the shipping costs almost equaling the product price, it wasn't worth the aggravation of shipping back to the supplier. Buyers need to completely scrutinize items when searching/ordering off of Amazon. I'd gather that customers often get stuck with useless products due to this inherent flaw when ordering; meaning items are search hits but have no applicability to the purchaser's criteria."},{"rating":"1","title":"QUITE SOME EFFORT; BUT NEED SOME WORK","review":"John Wright and team put up a brave effort here. However, some of the statistical data they tendered are too old. Again, this is not the type of almanac to purchase if your quest for information is with a global outlook. This book brims with excellent U.S. coverage, but that is all! It gave poor coverage to most other countries. Intending almanac buyers whose interests include versatile global data should not rely on it. Look for something that touched the four corners of the world.

And as for Miyu herself, she's a regular hottie with a cool background. Her grimk reaper inspired servant Lava just about steals the show however.Now, although I heard the next dvd's (which I plan to buy asap) were done ok, this one has all kinds of flaws. They omit the opening/closing music on 2 of the 3 episodes (although its not that great anyway). There are NO chapter breaks, just three tracks, one per episode. There are NO extras. The subtitling omits onscreen japanese words and song lyrics. But these flaws on the part of the dvd are overshadowed by suprisingly cool content.

The DVD has three episodes on it the first being ...THE FANG KNOWS..In this episode Miyu must find out who or what is murding people had the school she has just enrolled in....episode 2 AT THE NEXT STATION...advances the plot a bit as Miyu makes friends and must dicover who is kidnapping beautiful women riding the subway...THE FOREST CALLS...Miyu's guardian Lava steps up and must deal with a magical mask which controls the one who wears it...All in all VPM is a great series and I cannot wait for the next dvd in the series. I will post my review of that one as soon as it is released. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Miyu turned commercial","review":"I loathed this rendition of this beautiful series. This is a waste of time and money, the art is lazy and sloppy, the characters are totally lost in the awful dialogue.

I bought all of them and could barely sit through these. Read the mangas and watch the original 4 episode OAV.

This particular crash was so absurd as to turn off any interest I might have had in this book at the outset. The author presents that all the instruments fail. Instruments do not all fail at once - they are powered in different ways so that they cannot - and there is redundancy so that pilots are not completely left to the mercy of fate. \\"We're going in,\\" the pilot says, as though the lack of instruments causes the plane to take a nosedive. The pilot can see nothing in the clouds, but does not feel the need to gain altitude to prevent collision with terrain. Certainly, small planes can and do crash in bad weather, but the scene might have been written so that a reader with knowledge of flying would not be insulted.Two Alone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist to the \\"stranded\\" story line.","review":"I really loved this book.

Try writing the same style book as a white author calling most blacks racist, and watch Sharpton and the NAACP flip their lid.Almost lost in all of the racism is the fact the stories do not deliver.

It's not your typical d'n'b, and it's a little more chill, compared to most d'n'b. This particular mix is not as easily digestible and takes time to get into but it will definitely grow on you. There are some huge tracks on this mix. The Peter K remixes of 'Contact' and 'Trefusis Point' are far and away the best for me. 'What a Woman' is great, and has a great little organ solo on it.

You held it down and the gate is open."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD!","review":"\\"Between My Thighs\\" was well written. However, it left a lot to bedesired.

The story line was over the top and all over the place. I didn't connect with Raquel - I found her to be naive and immature. I know this is a work of fiction but it was hard to visualize a psychologist or any educated woman getting caught up in the events that occured, and there were plenty of them. Plus there were so many men it was hard to keep them all straight, especially since most of their names began with the letter D.

This book could have been so much more. I would not recommend this book as a must read to anyone. None of the comments I read from the customer reviews were true.

I wanted to learn more about Dr. Howard and was drawn in by the events. Initially, the author was good at capturing my attention. However, as the book progressed, the main character regressed. She went from a poised professional to a common street person. It's like a different author took over at some point and started writing about a totally different character. There were too many changes to be real and parts of Dr. Howard's personality were unceremoniously revealed without any context or basis for it in the book. Then, the story just ends; like the author was tired and just stopped writing.

But why did she have to try to fake us out and make us think this was a Noire book? From the \\"have you evers\\" to the urban erotic tale, it is all somebody else's stuff. Naija could have done this on her own without borrowing from Noire because she is definitely not her by a long shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why is it hating when you're telling the truth?","review":"I read the reviews AFTER reading this book and I lot of them I agree with. Between My Thighs was an okay read. It wasn't earthmoving but it was in no way a bad read. But the problem comes in that not only was it stated as an urban erotic tale when we all know only one author uses that tag and invented it, but it also borrowed the whole Have You Ever series right out of the other person's books! Now that is not opinion, that is fact. Just read them both and look at the publication dates to see who wrote that first.

Before or since, there is no accordionist that even comes close to the mastery of the instrument as does Iry. Lawrence Walker and Aldus Roger were both very good accordion players but they fall indescribably short of the genius of Iry.

My major problem with these shoes is the bottoms of the shoes have lots of dull little rubber spikes on them, so they pick up dirt, mud, and just about anything that you step in so that you have to pry it out with a stick in order to remove it. If you only use them on concrete, they would be a good shoe, i suppose, but for anything else, it's to much of a hassle unless you dont mind mud all over the floor.

Volumes I and II contained more popular Italo hits, while this volume contains more obscure (but just as good) titles.The only reason I did not rate at 5 stars is that, as an avid Italo collector, these titles qualify as \\"less popular\\", and possibly second tier Italo (which is in no way a bad thing). There are many truly obscure italo hits that never seem to make it onto a compilation CD, and are much better than some of these titles.I have purchased many Italo compilations and they all seem to pick from the same pool of songs. Usually, the \\"Volume 1\\" has the popular hits (boring), \\"Volume 2\\" has the favorite hits from hardcore fans (boring), and \\"Volume 3\\" has mostly the leftovers.

When all will be said and done, U2 will have \\"With Or Without You\\", \\"Where The Streets Have No Name\\", \\"Angel of Harlem\\" and \\"One\\" to their name while Trent Reznor will have...never mind.And in whose book is \\"Let It Be\\" only as good as Rancid's \\"Indestructible\\"?

Both Baker's long tenure and strong personality had resulted in most fans thinking of him as the only Doctor, rather than the 4th. The producers, taking a rather risky move, decided to cast an actor that was the exact opposite of Baker's interpretation. Years later, many are still debating whether or not this was a good idea.The \\"Handbook\\" series provide a detailed behind the scenes view of the Doctor Who show, including many insights into the development of the characters, and the difficulties faced.

However, many (most) of the songs are cut-off for interviews with the people working with him on the project. I'd rather hear the music -- keep the interviews separate, put them in the \\"Features\\" section -- this is my only reason for giving this 4 stars instead of an unqualified 5 stars.

The material was what is to be expected from a $50 halloween costume- you want nice you have to pay a lot more. There were two problems. The first and main problem is Plus size women tend to be well endowed. The costume fit everywhere but the bosom area. The only plus size women the costume would have fit would have to be absolutely flat chested, as I am sure the model probably was. Even taped down I could have never fit my ample chest into this thing. And if you were taller than 5' 5\\" the costume would be too short. The additional curves of a plus size drew it up some.

I've been searching for other information to defend these books from other Christians who haven't actually read the books for themselves and are just shooting off comments about the worst parts of the books. Looking for God in Harry Potter brings up extremely obscure names and reasons for names in Rowling's books and most of it is at the very least an extreme stretch. E.g. John Granger mentions that Harry's surname Potter is because of the fact that God is referred to as a potter by Paul.

The simple reason that Harry Potter has similarities with Christianity is that both are based on very old myths and folk tales, and that's about it. Not everything that has to do with good and evil is comparable to the bible. Next someone will be writing a book explaining how The Chronicles of Riddick is an anology for Lutheranism.And yet, this book isn't bad because it's about Christianity, it's bad because it's dull and not overly insighful. Someone had too much time on their hands, and wanted to cash in on the Harry Potter moola-train.

They have a couple of good actors in there too. To me the movie was just all over the place, (this was worst than a soap opera. DMX was the narrator, he was not an actor in this movie and you only see him talking a couple of times throughout the movie. It is like one of the reviewers said, almost like a home movie.

You hit the ball and it just goes.... no sounds, no commentary, only the repitiveness of the dull crowd. In Triple Play, you hit a home run and you know it. The crowd knows it also and you get the warm fuzzies all over. As for the competition, it was incredibly easy. I think i lost one time when i was the minnesota twins playing against the cooperstown legends.

I never played Hardcore Revolution, but if War Zone is as similar as it is, I'd probably be asking for the same game again. Though they did raise the bars discriptor(part of ESRB program) wise. Animated Violence has turned into Animated Blood(with lots of it). Mild Language has turned into Strong Language(from the last time I played, it could be the crowd). And Suggestive Themes into Mature Sexual Themes. Quite hard starting. There is I think 60 wrestlers. I didn't see any graphical changes either.Oh, even though ESRB overrates games all the time, this one seemed to be worthy of Mature anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS GAME!","review":"This game stinksIcan'teven do a grapple Move and when I Do It is Stupid.DO NOT BUY THIS GAME IT IS VERY HARD AND IT IS A WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this game is terrible in the fun factor","review":"this game is really bad because of the controling.the controling of this game is very bad because the controling of attitude is tha same as this and the controling in attitude is bad because you have to press multiple buttons to do one move. and there is also not that much game methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Flynn wins again...and it's even more fun...","review":"McGrory continues the winning saga of Jack Flynn. The book is longer than the first in the series and perhaps a bit better. The plot avoids some of the aburdist elements of the first. The book is paced well and Flynn remains a charmer. It was nice to see how he has grown in life. I was surprised to see that the FBI love interest from the first book was not even mentioned here. What happened to her? Elizabeth Riggs is far better character, but still...I was glad my favorite fictional golden retriever Baker was back. It was great to meet Hank Sweeney too. McGrory's work is at times light and funny--Flynn is a great alter ego. The bigger mystery is still a bit nutty and unrealistic, but fascinating all the rest. I'll be back for my third Flynn book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"NICE","review":"I found this album in a used CD bin for 3.50. My first impression of it was \\"interesting\\". After listening a few more times I discovered a fun, unique, and well-worth any money, diamond in the ruff. If you'd like to step off the beaten path and rock to something much more engauging than say- Lincoln Park, buy this one. This band does not take themselves too seriously, consequently they produce some great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated gem!","review":"\\"Word of Mouth\\" is a great album (the last great Kinks album, in fact) that for some reason is consistently overlooked in favor of the Kinks' other Arista efforts. Sure, there are a couple of throwaways here (\\"Too Hot,\\" \\"Massive Reductions\\"), but the highlights more than make up for them. \\"Do It Again,\\" \\"Good Day,\\" and \\"Summer's Gone\\" are some of Ray's very best '80s compositions, and \\"Living on a Thin Line\\" is, in this Kinks fanatic's opinion, the best song Dave Davies ever wrote.The album gels together wonderfully, and it has an upbeat, summery mood in stark contrast to the hyper-bleakness of \\"State of Confusion\\" and \\"Give the People What They Want.\\" If you are new to the Kinks' '80s output and have been scared away from \\"Word of Mouth\\" by bad word of mouth, I'd urge you to give it a chance. It's one of the most underrated albums in the Kinks kanon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"My son received this you when he turned 5 and he is almost 7 and has only used it to hear the woman's voice announce the time.

The toy worked for 1 week and then only the red on/off light would stay lit up but it wouldn't talk or do any of the functions. We made sure the batteries were good too so it wasn't an issue with them. Way too expensive to be spending money on a toy that doesn't last. Go with the lower cost options or use colorful workbooks and save yourself the hassle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"I purchased this item with the intent to teach my child how to tell time, needless to say the talking part was unclear so you could not understand some of the things it says and also, it was telling us the wrong time.

I have \\"The Magic of BoneyM\\" CD(amazon didn't list all the songs in that CD), and liked the collection in that CD than this one. But this collection should complete(almost) the BoneyM songs. Some of the songs are edited(Calendar Song, for eg.), and in my personal opinion, they should not.All in all, a BoneyM's fan will not be disappointed with this collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good collection, BUT...","review":"...you should FIRST get \\"The Legendary Modern Recordings 1948-1954\\".

It doesn't have every important track by him, but it's the best that's available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have YOU ever met the Boogie Man?","review":"Listen to this long enough, and it'll just whet your appetite. Now in his mid-'80's, John Lee Hooker has recorded some of the most original electric blues in the history of the genre. Any time you hear that one chord droning away and that shoes tapping the floor, you know you're hearing the Boogie Man. Everything he's done since then seems to revolve around the sides in this collection. Throughout modern history, several other bands have tried to record Hooker and wind up sounding like cheeseballs. From \\"Teachin' The Boogie\\" to \\"I'm In The Mood\\", this two-disc set blows away any other Hooker \\"best of\\". If you can afford it, accept no substitutes! Long live the Boogie Man!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Patently a good one","review":"I like all of Andrew Greeley's novels, yet \\"arguably\\" as Blackie Ryan would say, this is my favorite one to date. It is \\"patently\\" a well-crafted tale, to use Blackie's other favorite adverb. I was truly surprised when he found the solution to another closed-room mystery, his specialty. This is a gentler, kinder book than many of his earlier offerings. Blackie has softened over the years, and has a detached and fuller understanding of the passions of youth.Set in Paris, and poking fun at many typically French characters and attitudes, Greeley's book will make you smile and keep you wondering until the last pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fr Greeley does it again.","review":"Blackie is back and travels to France. In this latest book of the Blackie Ryan mysteries, Fr Greeley has Blackie and Cardinal Cronin travel to Paris and have to find a missing priest and uses this vehicle to convey a parable of love and devotion. This mystery will keep you guessing and the characters, new and familiar, will endear themselves to you.This book is a very enjoyable way to spend an afternoon but the topics will stay with you for weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition Rating Only","review":"I will not speak to the content of the book, which I believe is wonderful, and I leave that to other reviewers. My review is only relative to the Kindle edition of this book.The Kindle edition is barely readable. When the book was converted to the Kindle format, someone did not proof read the conversion. There are typos throughout the book - which are sometimes very distracting and you have to try and figure out what the sentence actually should say.While I love the book, I would recommend that you wait until Amazon (or the publisher) corrects the typos in the Kindle edition. I have taken the opportunity to notify Amazon of the many typos and have requested that they be corrected. I certainly hope they will be soon.

So why the two-star review? The annoying habits of one Keith Jarrett.The man makes noises that distract and detract from the performance. Imagine a Warner Brothers cartoon bee humming and buzzing through his nose for the whole concert - That's Jarrett. I'll be the first to admit that I found (find?) Glenn Gould's humming on all of his recordings more than a little charming. But Gould was always subtle, and in key - something that Jarrett cannot manage.I do agree with the other reviewers regarding the positive qualities. I do, however question their hearing (or systems) if they are not distracted by Jarrett's noise-making. it's as if one were invited to watch a master chef at work, only to see him pick his nose during the food's preparation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you put garlic on a banana split??????","review":"I am still in awe of what I just witnessed on this DVD. Here is an extremely talented jazz pianist playing his butt off [he rises from the stool regularly] :) ..only to poison his performance and talent with awful grunts, yelps, and moanings that in no way add any value whatsoever. It just baffles me that Keith developed this horrible habit alongside fantastic piano chops! Did he think he needed some sort of gimmick to be noticed? You'd think someone somewhere along the way would have coached him...\\"Hey Keith, you gotta drop that whining during your tunes...you'll lose a lot of fans if you keep that up!\\" I even wonder how the other fine musicians on this DVD feel about being associated with him. They play like they don't even notice it, but I'll bet they hate it like I do. Despite the great sound and efforts by the trio don't buy this DVD if you expect the typical jazz experience you find on other DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Anthology of Forgotten Talent---","review":"Particularly in this day of manufactured charisma on television, great public speaking has become a lost art--look at what we are using for President right now! This set will serve as a reminder of what we used to enjoy, particularly on the political scene. Certainly, a Franklin Roosevelt or a John Kennedy only comes once in a great moon and this is an opportunity to remember what we have had, and lost. I have had this set for several years and my only regret is that it isn't longer; I suppose for practicality's sake the entire texts of the speeches couldn't be included. Sound quality is remarkable, particularly for the old pre-electric recordings. It will probably be a surprise to many to actually hear the pre-FDR Presidents speak; again, they were not homogenized in the manner popular now.This is a great 'starter' set for those who enjoy the spoken word for its own sake."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Only thing we know for sure, is fear itself","review":"I like it.

Manet uses a lot of very vivid colors including black in his painting and some of the images especially Olympia comes out so dark it is almost all black. Too bad, I so looked forward to this movie. The information was fairly ok though. I will look at it again anyway. For good Manet images go to Rosamund Bernier Impressionists series on four videos, especially the one entitled Modern Art and Modern Manners. These videos are all available used or new on Amazon or Barnes and Noble.

The only thing that I thought was missing are cups - except for the four mugs, which I thought was strange. I am a little disappointed with the quality.

Pretty much absent.Last season we got lots of Ava, Winona, complications and nuanced writing. There was the matriarch Mountain Mama Mobster and the Savvy OrphanGirl...and a few other great supporting woman. This season there are NO woman. Winona and Ava have had as much screen time as thetwo teenagers who flashed the trucker and performed sexual favors for drugs in the latest episode I watched...Bring out the Guns.I can't even bother watching the rest. I have never, ever, written a review on Amazon before but I am so disappointed at the nose divein this season. The lead actresses must be pissed. I gave it two stars only for my boys Raylan and Boyd, but you need more than two stars to make a show.Come on fellers, set the bar higher. Oh well, maybe next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Show plays great- if you can get past malfunctioning menus","review":"Received Justified Third Season all appeared well upon delivery.

I have returned 3 copies - so far. All are defective & the menu is un-cooperative. All I can do is press play - arrows, etc., do not work & much of the text on the menu isn't viewable. My friend experienced the same thing with this blu ray.I wasn't that thrilled with this season either - as many have mentioned - extremely violent, not as funny as previous seasons & less likable characters.Will never buy another TV series in blu ray from any company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome show but you can buy it cheaper thru","review":"I NEVER miss this show! It is AWESOME and is the best thing on TV. The only complaint I have is that I found it cheaper at Walmart yesterday. I called Amazon and asked if they could just credit my cc account with the difference and they said no. Really? Soooo I am not opening it up and will be returning it to Amazon (and they can pay the postage) and refuse the order. Then I'll just walk down to Walmart and get it for $24.96 ! But !!!

I was glad to see however that Tim Olyphant, was back with this series. If you like cool this is your man. Well written and well acted. Great stories lines!

Paying the 1.99 per episode for the 2 shows we can't get for free and we can't live without online - both here at Amazon - are totally worth it. AND far far cheaper than a cable subscription. Between Amazon and netflix, we're not missing a thing we would have missed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed but hopeful","review":"Let me start by saying Justified is my favorite show on TV. I was disapointed in the season premiere because it feel into the category of every other cop show on tv by being mostly set in bigger cities. TO me the thing that seperated Justified was that added element and rural feel to the show sort of like Walker Texas Ranger had at one time. I mean how many city cop shows are on today. I loved season 2 more than season 1 because the focus on the Bennetts gave that season something different that no other show has. It just seems to me that the writers are focusing more on Frankfort and LExington and not on Harlan and E ky or at least that is the feel i got from the 1st episode. Hope i AM wrong but i will be watching either way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon lock up","review":"I wanted to purchase Justified season 3 and purchased the on line video and not the disc, Amazon instructions are easy to change if purchasing disc but impossible and you are locked out to cancel the order if you want to cancel the on line video, and no help from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"questionable","review":"I enjoyed the third season as it ran on television.

This may be the thing for you.Based on a short story by Elmore Leonard and set in Kentucky, Rayland Givens is a U.S. Marshal unlike most in this day and age. More like a transplanted lawman from the old west, Rayland struggles with childhood-friends-turned-criminals and his own personal life in a show that is both smart and funny. It's easy to get caught-up and concerned for the characters, as they feel SO real. And, as in real life, not everything gets a tidy, happy ending.I suggest this show highly to any fan of westerns, Timothy Olyphant, or drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for the Performer Grill","review":"BEWARE - Amazon lists this cover with the Weber Performer grill.

You should at least know SOME programming so if you ever done BASIC, Logo, JavaScript, Pascal, PHP, Perl or anything very simple this book will help you tremendously. Any introduction of any other programming book will start you of with the whole spiel of what programming is and how to do something simple but not this book, it starts off kind of hard but then explains things to you very logically and funny. It is very well written and you will remember things with it. So if you're a Java student and your textbook is too hard or whatever, choose this and you'll be on your way in no time. If you want a good introduction on programming in general, start with another book and then go into this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look at the cover....would you take this book seriously?","review":"Do yourself a favor, don't buy this book. This book is discombobulated. Takes you everywhere except into detail on what you're actually doing. I've gone through a chapter, looked back and gone \\"What did I just learn? Absolutely nothing. Am I stupid? Let me re-read that chapter again.\\" Rinse. Cycle. Repeat. After the first 6 chapters of this, I finally gave up. Too many jokes. Forced humor. Not enough substance. If I wanted to laugh, I'd go to a comedy club. I want to learn. Be serious. Scribbles in the margins messing up the source code. Book sucks. And that \\"Sink A DotCom\\" game? Biggest waste of a chapter. After that I just closed the book, and threw it into the garbage.If you like TV, buy this book.

Events, Listeners, Initialization...And this book omits the most important parts, but talks about MIDI for pages and pages ? Really ? MIDI ?And the book repeats itself a lot. The same text block is printed twice on the same page, and again after 3 pages..Lion images, yeah cool. The book itself: BO-RING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much emphasis on \\"fun\\" examples were lacking in detail","review":"I found this book to be lacking in examples to the point of being nearly useless as a reference item due to all the \\"fun\\" inserted ad nauseum. It seemed like this book was written for people over 50 who know next to nothing about computers or programming. This book is well written overall but the target audience is clearly not the serious student. Get this book to learn Java basics casually but if you are in a college class this is not your book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got me through college!","review":"I had to take Java three times to pass. The third time I got this book. It was such a huge help. I hated programming to begin with and Java only made it worse.

Just a first step","review":"This book is very very basic.If you don't know ANY object oriented programming (C++ etc.) or have no access to any instructor AND have failed to learn anything from standard resources like the Java tutorial on Sun ... this may be a decent place to start and gain some confidence. If u know C++ or any other such language ... u are better off starting with the Java tutorials on Sun and then buying a decent book on Java.The other issue with the book is ... every aspect of java is covered in one or two scenarios that makes your feel confident ... but the material on each topic is so high level that I doubt if you can go beyond that example armed with this knowledge.In any case ... you will need a second book on Java ... so why buy this?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ways to learn JAVA","review":"This book was written in an entertaining way using various tools (jokes, pictures, surprises, quizes, games, etc) keeping the reader's mind engage in learning difficult concepts.This is in accordance of the Head First's learning principles which are:1.

My students love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is from O'Reilly?","review":"This book is not up to this publisher's high standards.

From the introduction it seems like I'm part of their target audience. If that's the case, they fail miserably.The first five chapters of this book were pretty clear, but I found chapter 6 confusing and frustrating. For example, on page 139 there is a class. Cool. I want to type in the class and see it work. But it doesn't work. Something about setLocationCells being passed and int, but expecting a String. Or is that a <String>? Is there a difference? I have no idea. I thought strings were declared with []. Next, they present a \\"Sharpen Your Pencil\\" exercise on page 146 - no answers. ARGH! Now I'm stuck, frustrated, overwhelmed, and lost.I found a lot of the puzzles/brain teasers at the ends of the chapters too difficult. The author's website is not at all helpful either - it would be great if they had a message board where people could post questions and help each other out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Book","review":"I've worked for over 5 years with Java now, but I still found this book a fantastic read.

I wish I had this book back in my intro Computer Science classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book to learn Java","review":"Head First Java is a great book to learn Java. The book has a very interesting teaching concept that make the material stick in your brain. I would recommend beginners to try and type in every sample codes and exercises in the book.

On the bad side, the book has some typos with the sample codes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much unhelpful text","review":"This was the class textbook for a data structures course I took that was taught in Java. If you have a lot of time on your hands, the book could be an OK overview of Java, but it requires too much reading to get the point across.

I have taught myself HTML, and Visual Basic. I am also a hands on learner. If I see a bit of code I want to type it and see how it works. Try to mess with it and get a better idea of what is going on. If this is your style don't bother with this book. There is nothing logical about it. It jumps all over the place. The code samples are incomplete at best. Changes are made with just a wave of the hand. I have spent more time trouble shooting code errors (not from typing, but from incorect or incomplete examples)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if you are looking for a cartoon","review":"I have done some Java programming but was a bit rusty and figured a overview type book would be nice.

I found it worthless and will likely not look at any other Head First series books, the format just fails for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"All over the place","review":"I really did not care for this book. I felt it was too scattered, not at all the way my brain works. Also, I don't care for books that give non-real world examples. This book uses the object of dog and methods such as bark, they could have just as well come up with real world examples of problems. You might like it, but I suggest you find a copy at the library or book store and read through a chapter first to be sure it is up with your style of learning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for People who have NEVER programmed an OO program","review":"While I loved Head First Design Patterns, this book was a disappointment. From all the reviews and my experience with the HFDP book, I had high expectations.If you have ever written an OO program then this book is not for you.I know all the reviews are glowing about how fun it presents material--and it is fun--but the substance of the JAVA training is weak at best. There are many other better Java books.Move on to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a text book","review":"Hard to make learning Java fun but they do try. It is a fairly easy read with lots of pictures and alternative ways of getting the same point accross. Not a reference book on Java, it will teach you Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginners!","review":"This book is for beginners but it assumes that you know the basics about computer programming, I mean, it won't teach you what is a program, what is code or those very basics things. If you have programmed in C, C++ or C# then this books could be slow for you but still useful but if you don't know about those languages or Object Oriented Programming then this book is great to learn OOP and JAVA, really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for a beginner","review":"The casual style of all of the Head First books is great. What a nice change from the usually dry material. That being said, there are times when I would have preferred they just get to the point and dispense with the cuteness. Don't let that scare you away however. You will still learn from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ton of fun...","review":"I have the Head First Design Patterns book and love it. This is every bit the equal on the Java side (I have the 2nd Edition which covers Java 5.0). The fact that so many people have reviewed the book says it all. I like the casual, playful format, dialog and visuals.Beyond the addition of the new Java 5.0 features (and dropping of some outdated features of earlier versions) it is still the same innovative \\"Head First\\" format. If you are learning Java or want to become more familiar with Java 5.0, I can guarantee you will not find a more enjoyable book to learn from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book for begginers?","review":"Head first Java is great book, no one can say it isn't.

Perhaps it's just the way I learn but I didn't find the conceptual stuff a problem, it was integrating all the things together and see it all presented in working order that I was finding myself frustrated with figuring out at times. I'd rather be shown everything from the ground up than given little short cuts here and there and then just expected to know where they all fit together when shown little snippets of code."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book for serious programmers starting in Java","review":"I have done quite a bit of programming in assembler, C, and Visual Basic. I needed to learn Java. This book goes out of its way to make itself look like it's not a serious book, but don't let the outrageous pictures fool you. This book will teach you Java. The authors do a good job of presenting concepts at a measured rate. More importantly, they present a balanced picture of Java. They include the philosophy of Java, best use practices, syntax, and sample programs all at once. I am amazed at how easy they have made it to understand what Java is from the ground-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent refresher for people who have been out of touch with Java","review":"This book absolutely served its purpose for me. I bought it because I had learnt java a long time ago and wanted to brush up on it. It's for anyone who is familiar with basic programming-oriented things like \\"what is a float/byte,\\" but who actually wants to LEARN JAVA. So, it doesn't waste time explaining these basics (which all programming books annoyingly do) but explains all the overarching concepts in a simple and easy-to-understand, yet detailed kind of way.Frankly, this book cleared up doubts I had from many of my Java textbooks from college. So, I would absolutely recommend this!And I would also recommend it for beginners. It's not hard to google \\"what is a byte,\\" but it is hard to understand bigger concepts in Java!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"awesome book easy to follow.

Lost interest in Java because of it...

I am a professional working on a master's in software engineering. I do not want or need fluff. I want to get into the nuts and bolts quickly. This book is useless in this regard. I also find the presentation of the material insulting. Serious programmers/engineers should look to Java How To Program by Deitel as an authority. Head First java may be interesting and useful to the young, those who need to be entertained to learn, or have zero to minimal exposure to Java/Programming. I will not be purchasing another title in the Head First Series. If you need this text for class, you are better served by Deitel and/or web searches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fluff","review":"About 65% of the material is useless fluff. Authors try to be funny and silly.I'm not an expert programmer. I took a few programming courses (C++) in college. It doesn't provide a good reference either.If you prefer technical books to be to the point this book isn't for you. If you've tried other Java books and it didn't help I guess this one will not hurt.It does have the information you need if you're willing to dig for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful","review":"If you have previous expereince in OOP, skip this title. It drags through concepts you all ready know. You'd be better off buying a Java reference book. My two cents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hold it! Not suitable for beginners.","review":"This book is for beginning Java programmers, NOT beginning programmers. Big difference. I wish the book description had said this rather than read it in the book after buyng it. And if you do not know how to set a PATH statement so that your computer can find the javac.exe in the BIN directory of your J2SDK, then you are going to be lost before you get to page 1. All this is assumed knowledge by the authors.I put this book back on my bookshelf to be revisted after I complete the SAMS Learn Java in 24 hours book. (Oh, I do know how to set PATH statements from my previous experience using DOS. You should learn how to do this also.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head First Java 2nd Edition Review","review":"I am using this book as part of a graduate-level beginning Java course. This book is both a fun and easy read, guiding you through the fundamentals of the language at a pace you don't even realize until you're done with a chapter. I have taken Java before, so it made the book even easier for me than it would be for most newbies, but it's still highly accessible for anyone with a basic programming background. I like doing puzzles, so the challenges they put at the end of each chapter, and within the chapters, were awesome! One tip: read the Intro section of the book--it lets you understand the approach the book takes a lot better, including that you can enjoy the experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for new programmers learning Object Orientated","review":"The good:+large text with many examples+starts from the very basics and foundations/fundamentals of Object-Orientated (OO) programming practices instead of just focusing on syntax+varied exercises to reinforce concepts+fairly inexpensiveThe less good:- sloppy/skimpy index; hard to use as a reference book- some of the \\"fun\\" elements get in the way of finding information fast (especially if you're already accustomed to dry programming books)- could be thinner by cutting out some graphics- no CDOverall:=worth your while if you're new to OO programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coverage","review":"Great coverage of the Java language with concrete examples. Note that some of the content and examples require Java 5.0 (a problem for those who haven't updated to the latest version). Great for newcomers to Java. Some content was lacking (deeper concentration on Threads). Altogether, great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for philosophy, poor for actual programming","review":"This is a book that I really wanted to like. I actually do think the humor is pretty cute and engaging. I have a better understanding of what OOP means thanks to this book. But for actual programming in java? Nope. This book skips over the basics that everyone needs to know just to get a simple program to work in order to focus on the deep concepts and fun things like MIDI beatboxes that you will never get to work.Now, it's not as if I don't know the difference between a for loop and a while loop. I know how to do them in C++, Python and Pascal thanks to books by Gaddis and Savitch. It's just that I have no clue how to implement these basic things *in Java.*Now, the book says that you should have 'some' programming experience and I do. No, you really do need to have a lot of programming experience in Java before this will be of any use. But I think such a person will be looking for a more in depth book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for learning java!","review":"I've been studying java for almost a year. I have a background in procedual languages like COBOL, but am relatively new to object oriented programming. I had worked my way through a couple of other Java books, but I didn't really 'get' OOP until I read this book.The examples are clear and the illustrations effectively teach the concepts. The code examples are short enough that you don't have to wade through pages of code to find the one new thing being taught, and long enough to teach the concept.I'd reccommend this book to anyone who wants to learn java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Starting Java Book","review":"Not only does this book give a beginner a comprehensive tutorial in Java, it also highlights Object Oriented Concepts that are essential to good Java programming. I would have given this book a five star rating, if it wasn't for bad editing (errors in examples, etc.) But, at least, there are less errors than the first edition. This is the first book on learning Java that I have been able to actually sit down and make my way through. Rather than use the basic Java compiler, I would recommend using the Eclipse product (download free at www.eclipse.org) since that is the new emerging standard in Java (and other lanugages) programming. Learning Eclipse while you are learning Java would only help."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent...Almost as good as the Hype","review":"This book is almost as good as the hype. It's perfect for learning Java, especially if you have a bit of a programming background. Java for Dummies is better if you have NO programming or Java experience. If you've taken an entry level college programming course, this book is perfect. Some of the examples I still think got a little convoluted, but only a few. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Book for the Experienced","review":"I'm an experienced programmer that had to learn Java in a hurry. I picked up this book thinking that it would give me a general introduction which I could then fill in as needed by reading parts of a reference book (Java in a Nutshell). After 40 pages, I realized that this was a BIG mistake. This book is way-too-beginner oriented. I found its presentation style petty and irritating. Fortunately a colleague told me about Bruce Eckel's Thinking in Java. This is a much better book that treats its reader like an adult!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I honestly hate this book","review":"Perhaps if you're a total beginner to programming and probably more so you're under 15 you'll like this book. For me I just hate it, I know this is one of those reviews that is just the out lier to the negative but I would honestly warn people away from this book despite the copious amounts of good reviews on here. Basically I enjoy a book that is straight to the point and condensed. Also I enjoy a book that gives correct terminology and sticks to using it. This book spends pages to explain basic concepts and wastes large amounts of page space on pictures and cartoons so you end up just flipping through multiples pages just searching around for the useful information. In one night of light reading and scanning I've already moved to page 173 and every new page just annoys me more."},{"rating":"2","title":"0","review":"(+1) Book came in preserved state, almost as if I have bought it in a shop myself.(-1) I have other remark, I was billed for additional expenses (almost 10E) when book arrived at my house.*Thumbs up* && keep up the good work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Head First Java is ok","review":"This product is pretty good; however, it's content to length ratio is a little low. You have to read a whole lot to get much, and that's a slight nuisance.Still, it seems to be one of the best books out there for learning Java, and I'm glad I bought it, and I would suggest it to others who are learning Java."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for learning Java","review":"I've read plenty of Java books, or at least tried to, and this one seems to break it down the easiest. I like the examples given and the stories that relate in order to explain how everything workds. There's plenty of things to do in this book that help tie everything together. My only gripe is that sometimes they'll throw examples at you that you really can't understand, and often times I felt lost. Overall though this book is better than any I've read in regards to Java."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"This book didn't work for me.

Still, worth a look!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book Out There","review":"I can honestly say that having been in Mongolia a few months now this has been the most helpful to study. I would have given it a 5 had the fact you can't get the audio accompaniment anywhere. Hearing how the words are said would make this even better. I also know having lived here some words aren't actually pronounced the way they suggest but that's a failure of every other book I've tried.I love the fact words are mixed and not based on topics. The grammar rules pronunciation is packed at the beginning so you see it over and over again as you progress. Everyone learns differently but for me this was the most helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kinks go MTV","review":"This was the album that brought The Kinks back into the spotlight after many years of laboring in the wilderness. And rightly so. There are many great songs on this CD, including the two excellent singles \\"Come Dancing\\" and \\"Don't Forget to Dance,\\" whose videos landed the band in front of a new generation on MTV. Fortunately, the band didn't compromise in order to achieve greater popularity. They just came up with one of their best albums. A vital addition to any Kinks fan's collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I can't credibly speak for the Kinks' early output, but regardless, this is one great album. I have waited for a long time to find it on CD, since my cassette has basically died. This CD and \\"Give The People What They Want\\" are to me the apex of the latter stage of the Kinks' career. The title track is one of my favorite songs ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"State of Bliss","review":"Well...not quite. This album was written when Ray was breaking up with Chrissie Hynde (of The Pretenders.

The other tracks are pure noise, including Noise, the final track. This group is one of the many rock groups of recent years that uses volume and distortion as a substitute for quality. Please, guys, turn off the Fuzz Sound, or distortion, or whatever you call it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Kinks reinvent themselves yet again on fine album","review":"During the 70's the Kinks stumbled badly. With Sleepwalker and Misfits they seemed to be finding their way by reinventing themselves as an arena rock band. Ray Davies' songwriting didn't change much, just the volume and energy level.With State Of COnfusion the band catches their breath yet again and produces an album full of power and pathos. After this, with the exception of an occasional single, it was all downhill with the band producing increasingly spotty albums and dwindling sales as a result.This charm has style, charm and rocks out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Dancing!","review":"I was lucky enough to see the Kinks in my youth. They still had great energy back in '83, and I began collecting after seeing them. They continued to score chart hits, with \\"Come Dancing\\" from this album playing a huge role in the soundtrack of this year. I love Ray and Dave, and I have been lucky enough to see each of them solo, as well. Compiling the collection in CD format now, it is great fun to have the packaging include additional tracks and some great writing in each newly created book of liner notes that will help to retrace their history. If you love to learn more about your heroes, like me, then you will want to supplement your vinyl collection with all of the reissues of the Kinks albums to benefit from all of the material gathered in these liner notes. One can learn a lot while enjoying a fresh, clean listening experience. Ray sure knows how to take his listeners into his stories. \\"Come Dancing!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"everything you hear and say, Just another cliche....","review":"The Kings brand of rock has always been a simple a formula. A few guitar chords and a driving beat behind some of the best working class lyrics in popular music. I remember when this came out and having seen them on the tour. They blew me away and for years were the best live act I'd seen.The album is worth the price for the song Cliches of the World(B Movie), a dreary tale of the mundane life we sometimes lead.It does sound a bit dated, but was not like a lot of the musicthat came out of the '80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have if over 55","review":"This product is a must-have if you cannot read small print.

I did find that this one appeared to be DOA out of the box. But, after opening & shutting the viewer to turn on & off the light, the light began to come on. After several times of doing this, the light appears to be coming on all the time.It is small, but for taking it someplace & reading things like a menu in a dark corner of a restaurant, this is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and convenient.","review":"This is very nice.

The plastic is sharp & isn't that easy to carry in your bag without stabbing yourself on it, but without the plastic box, the magnifier would get very scratched. I may discard the plastic box, but keep the magnifier in something soft, like a small sock. Otherwise, the magnifier works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faulty switch?","review":"Purchased one of these about 6 months ago for my legally blind, 88 year old father who lives in a retirement community. Worked like a charm for reading dinner menus, dials on the washer and dryer, etc. BUT he gave it back to me a week ago, saying the batteries needed replacement. Bought precisely the same batteries that were in it, but as soon as the battery cover is replaced, the light comes on and stays on. I cannot get the light to turn off. This leads me to believe the switch is faulty as no fiddling changes this situation. Now I'm back to Square One, looking for another portable lighted magnifying glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Magnification not 3X","review":"Great magnifier in all aspects and loved it except it does not magnify 3X. I compared it to a large 3X magnifier glass I have and this product looks more like a 2x. I kept it to use at my desk but bought a Carson through Amazon for traveling. It is a 3X glass in my test and works great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Small Print Reader","review":"I purchased this after reading many reviews on Amazon as well as other sites. As I get older, it is becoming somewhat difficult to read small print product model numbers as well as serial numbers. This is perfect for that. I also use it in dark resturants to read menus. It is small enough for me to put it mr pants pocket when I don't need it.The field of undistorted magnification is pretty small but is good enough for my purpose. I also purchased one for my wife as well as my son-in-law. Both of them concur with my statements. The LED light is bright enough that in many cases I did not need the magnification to read the menu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective LED Light","review":"Upon receiving one of these I discovered the light flickers and it is extremely dim!

I was trying to avoid using hand moisturizers with oil in them, since they can interfere with the polish adhering to your nails. So I bought Acquarella Moisturizer to complete my nail care set. I used it for about a day, but the skin around my nails kept getting drier and started peeling. I think that scrubbing to remove the Acquarella Conditioner had dried out the skin around my nails, and the moisturizer was not helping at all. It was a waste of money. Instead I am going to get some jojoba oil to use along with the Acquarella nail polish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just get a bottle of aloe vera gel","review":"This isnt really anything special. Its just a gel with aloe and PCA, and I have had just as good results from either aloe vera gel, PCA spray, or safflower oil.

It's oil free, fragrance free and sinks in well which I appreciate because I detest the tacky feeling + scent left by most conventional lotions.I'm looking forward to using this in conjunction w/ Acquarella's nail conditioner. The nail conditioner is a good product. It lasts longer than conventional nail polish on my nails + has a lovely sheen.BTW, the product photo doesn't accurately reflect the actual product color.

This is it folks.Interweave Press has a history of fantastic books, and this one lives up to that history.It's spiral bound in a hard cover so it will lie flat while you're working,and it's laid out logically for the absolute beginner in bead embroidery. The first chapter covers tools, the second is about beads, the third chapter explains the different types of bead embroidery, it goes on to stitches and projects. There are gorgeous and inspiring examples throughout the book, and the illustrations of technique are easily understandable.Bead embroidery doesn't have to be scary, it's a fun technique that's able to do things woven beads won't do.

No. I only heard the music on CD. When watching this dancing, I feel as if I was watching \\"Terminate 2\\" with all figures spoke Shakespeare's language...The one star is for all the dancers.

The casual reader shouldn't, but still the range of interest is fairly wide. I recommend it to anyone interested in the foundations of the United States, 18th century science and medicine, Presbyterianism, academia, or to anyone more specifically interested in the Philadelphia circle. Because it's a text book, designed not only to prove its point but for reference, the author's opinions are mightily defended, and it can be hard going. Do make the effort, though. One quoted source sneers [of the works of William Cullen] \\"They do not smell of the lamp, and will not long outlive the day.\\" This book smells strongly of the lamp, and its midnight oil, and is worth every bit of the reader's.

At a couple of dollars more, maybe; but at a 400% premium?!? -- another $16 for something you'll spill coffee on and have to replace? Buy five $4 mousepads instead.

We have done an abysmal job of welcoming them in the truest sense of the spirit of welcome. We have asked them to forget their rich backgrounds to the degree, as the Parks so movingly report, that they deny it themselves. We require them to commit almost a form of spiritual genocide merely to be a part of what is this culture. This moving story should be required reading and we should be unable to successfully complete a high school education in the absence of a clear sense of honor and deep respect for the experiences that people such as the Parks bring to us.

This happens at each point where the large headings appear at the \\"beginning\\" of chapters.I am close to giving up and expect Kindle to give me a credit for this book.

(I saw the string of one star reviews for Ruben's single that match many of your names.)I went out and bought a copy of Clay's single and gave it a listen. I've always thought of him as a superb singer, but I just preferred Ruben much more. I think Clay recorded the right songs for his debut single. He has a great rendidition of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" that is sure to establish him in the music industry. \\"This is the Night\\" is a beautiful, orginal song that fits Clay's voice perfectly.

Clay doesn't need a background choir. His voice is magnificent by itself. A classic Simon and Garfunkel song with a new twist is reinvented by Clay. \\"This is the Night\\" shows Clay's true range and capabilities as an artist. Though the lyrics are a bit maudlin, Clay overcomes that setback by making up for it with his crystal clear, soothing voice that doesn't fade out halfway through a note, crack on a high octave, or mumble words. Fans of all ages can appreciate this real American Idol with great morals and an even greater voice. A must-have. October 14 is NOT soon enough for everyone, Clay! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is the Best!","review":"I love this CD. I can't wait for his full album. Clay has such a beautiful voice and range. Clay's morals and principles are very refreshing. I have not bought a CD in many years, but do not regret buying this one. The Adult Contemporary radio station in my city has not chosen to play Clay's songs. Too bad for the radio station, the station has missed out on a golden opportunity to add listeners as I know that I would have started listening to that station to hear Clay's songs.

Now ask yourself if it wasn't for the controversy over him loosing the AI to Ruben would you go buy it. I doubt it, his performance is par at best. He ruined a Simon and Garfunkel classic.

Not only is Aiken intoleraby pretentious and insincere in his performances, his ennunciation remains overemphasized and he still has trouble getting out his s's. And -- in case you people forgot -- Ruben won. Clay shouldn't be getting spoon fed these singles. And why, by the way, aren't these singles original? Nobody wants to see a newcomer to the music scene emerge with a cover. Whereas Kelly Clarkson has demonstrated staying power, both Aiken and Studdard are still competing. They will be always linked together and their careers are marred by their equality. They should have taken second and third places where they belonged and Kimberley Locke should be powerhousing the recording studio."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN....If I wanted a Broadway single, I would have gotten","review":"The Hairspray cast album.

I've always been one to root for the underdog, and in this case, I knew it would make a difference. There is a reason that Clay's single has sold out Ruben's (not that Ruben is bad, because he isn't. He's very talented.) It's just that Ruben does not have the powerhouse voice that Clay has. For those who think they have to sculpt Clay's voice in the studio for hours upon hours, just for your information...it took only a few takes for him to record this entire single. He's THAT good.

Unfortunately, the chorus in \\"Bridge\\" seems to nearly drown out his beautiful voice at times, and the instrumental arrangements for that same song are too over-the-top and distracting. I would rather have heard Clay perform this classic a cappella! \\"This Is the Night\\" is better produced, and gives Clay a chance to shine. It's a dramatic love song that well suits him. All I can say now is bring on a full-length CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The voice of an angel","review":"Firstly, Cranky reviewer...have you heard Clay's singles or are you just saying you dislike him because your jealous of him? He has a beautiful voice that is so unique! I love listening to him! It does not matter if he was not the american idol, he has GREAT TALENT and that is all that matters right now! The boy can sing...have you heard the notes he hit in both songs? Terrific! In my opinion, he is the best thing that could have ever came out of American Idol! Clay's two songs are absolutely amazing and trust me everyone, you have never heard anything like this! Enjoy listening to it because I sure did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"superb","review":"I am a Clay Aiken fan from day one...I didn't think it was possible for his voice to sound any better...but the CD is excellent. He just keeps improving. Looking forward to alot more CDs from Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's number one","review":"\\"This is the Night\\" is one of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. I love it! People who buy this CD will not be dissapointed. Clay's voice is amazing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come to England, Clay!","review":"I first heard Clay sing on the wildcard show on \\"American Idol\\" and fell in love with his voice immediately. I couldn't vote for Clay (being from England!) but watched every show until he was robbed in the final. His voice is truly stunning and is showcased fully on these two incredible songs. I cannot wait for his album.If only our idols were as good as this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable Vocals!","review":"Clay's voice is so pure and smooth. His vocals are gorgeous to listen to and that is what makes this CD a great one. The song choices are perfect and he is one of those performers that you never get bored of. He is truly an amazing singer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice","review":"What can i say about this guy? He has a perfect voice that can probably cut any style of music. Ok lets start off with the first track of the single, \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\"... I would have preferred a recorded version from the final show. It had alot more power to it. This version is to over produced with some unwanted instrumentation for my taste. I was very annoyed with the heavy choir cutting into Clays awesome voice. He does not need help filling the air. Trust me. The second track \\"This Is The Night\\" on the other hand is excellent. Showcasing Clay's extremely passionate and powerful vocals. I hope RCA And Clive Davis know what they have on their hands. If they produce Clay the right way and really take their time with him... sky's the limit. RCA... Do the right thing. You have an unforgettable treasure about to blossom.Corey G."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is my American Idol...","review":"...Now my comments:1. Bridge Over Troubled Water- I think that his recording of this isn't quite as strong as the emotion of the live performance. It sounds like he wasn't permitted to record it to perfection. A very good performance, but I liked his live performance better.... his voice is drowned out by the chorus at times.2. This is the Night- This is actually better than his performance on the finale. His vocals are clean, the lyrics and music are very pop-oriented. I think this is the stronger of the two recordings.Overall, I really hope that Clay chooses the more difficult path of recording music in the style of Josh Groban- live music, great heartfelt lyrics, allowing for free range of vocals and focus on the incredible instrument that his voice is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge Over Troubled Water / This is The Night","review":"Clay Aiken's single Bridge Over Trouble Water / This is The Night proves what beautiful vocal range he has.

YOUR OFFICIALLY A SUPERSTAR!","review":"Clay Aiken hands down is one of the greatest singer's ever to hit our world. We should all be thankful that he is sharing his talents with us.

CLAY HAS A VOICE THAT OPENS THE DOOR TO YOUR SOUL. I JUST KEEP PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER. ALSO, FOR THE CHOIR DISLIKERS, I THINK IT'S PERFECT. IT ADS TO THE SPIRITUAL DEEPNESS OF THE SONG. CLAY SOARS THROUGH YOUR HEART AND SOUL LIKE CUPIDS ARROW. AFTER THE FIRST NOTE FROM HIS VOICE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH IT. AS FOR THE RADIO NOT GIVING HIM AIRTIME, WHO NEEDS RADIO WHEN YOU CAN JUST BUY ALL HIS MUSIC AND TURN THE RADIO OFF!!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken will go Farther than He Ever Imagined!","review":"Man...this boy can SING. I have been a fan since day 1 of AI2, when he auditioned. I was blown away immediately. This CD just confirms why his single has done so amazingly well and why his yet-to-be-named, yet-to-be-released full-length CD is #1 here. His voice is crisp, clean, and one of the best I have heard in my 32 years of life. This CD single is impressive to say the least and proves why Clay Aiken really SHOULD have won the competition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge/titn","review":"Clay was my favorite Idol contestant since day one. His voice is so powerful and moving and his ability to attempt something different periodically only increased his artistry. The songs on this single are excellant. Bridge is so fun to listen to with the choir backing him up. It is almost as if the song were written for him and not even touched some 30-40 years ago. This is the Night is just so wonderful. The melody is so soothing and the lyrics are so beautiful that you cannot help but be swept away. I cannot wait until Clay's first full-length album is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't get much better...","review":"This CD is truly amazing and I would recommend it to everyone! I have followed Clay throughout the American Idol process and was so impressed by his angelic voice. Bridge over Troubled Water is not a song I would normally like but Clay definately made it his own and This is the Night is just as beautiful! Everytime I listen to this CD I get chills from the amazing range and power Clay has, a quality that is truly unique. It's definately worth the $4 it costs, and much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's Headed For The Top","review":"I have been awaiting the album ever since they announced they would both be releasing singles.

Ever since i recieved my CD i have been listening on repeat. GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Star is Born","review":"When he came on the AI set in Atlanta, I thought - not another geeky nonsinger. He opened up his mouth and my jaw dropped! I have not felt this way about a singer since Paul McCartney.'This is the Night' is the perfect first song for Clay. Schmaltzy and lovely with enough emotion to get your heart going. This young man has a voice to die for.As for 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' - I love it! I love gospel singers and I really like the choir. Clay's low notes are wonderful and he should sing in that octive more often.All hail the birth of a new STAR!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This guy has the best voice!","review":"I was amazed when I first heard Clay sing \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" I never thought that song could be redone and sound good. Believe it or not, Clay's vocal range and strong voice pulls him through for that song. As for \\"This Is the Night\\", I could see it being played at a wedding reception. What a great song! This is the single that will make Clay a star. It's a pop song that is just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's Powerful Voice","review":"The only thing that should be different on this CD-SINGLE is that 'This Is The Night' should have stayed as track one. It is a great song and showcases clay's range and power of his voice. The radio stations will usually play track 1 on a CD-Single because that is supposed to be the main single. I am trying right now to have the radio stations play 'This Is The Night' hoping that this will give both songs air play. Even though I have this CD-SINGLE, I still want to hear it on the radio. I still give the CD-SINGLE 5 stars because it is not clay's fault that they switched the order of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Singles Ever!","review":"This single was great! I can't help but listen to it over and over again! Clay Aiken is so awesome! He has one of the best voices I have ever heard in my life!

In this day and time when the music is loud and the lyrics leave a lot to be desired, I welcome this young man with open arms and heart. His voice curls my toes and I could listen to him sing all day long. I was a bit disappointed in BOTW as I feel the orchastra and the choir were too loud. TITN is absolutely awesome. This 59 year old is waiting with baited breath for the release of his album. Clay, you are going to be one of the greatest legends in music history. God has big plans for you. Never change no matter what anyone says about your music. You have been blessed by God with an amazing gift. Use it to its full potential and to His glory.I and a million others are clayfans forever.God Bless you.Joy in Naples"},{"rating":"2","title":"CAN'T MISS WITH CLAY","review":"An amazing single! Clays unique and beautiful voice is a pleasure to hear. Although I aws FLOORED by his performance of \\"Bridge over trouble waters\\" on the show, I think the chorus is too loud and just too much on the recording! We don't get to hear Clays smooth,clear voice as much as I would like, and he deserves. But \\"This is the Night\\" is Clay- all the way, shows his unbelievable range, his personality and perfect pitch. Great single, worth EVERY penny you pay!!

Bridge over Troubled Water is one of my favorite songs - didn't think anyone could do it better than Simon & Garfunkle - I am proud to say I was wrong.

Am counting the days until his full CD is relaeased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditch the choir!!","review":"Clay's golden voice is wonderfully showcased with these songs. I can't wait to see what he does on his upcoming album! My only reason for giving a 4 star rating is the hideous sound of the choir on \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" If I never hear them again, it will be far too soon. Clay, however, is absolutely brilliant, in both of his passionate performances. My advice to this rising young star with a bright future ahead of him--ditch the choir!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"This CD is spectacular...it shows why Clay should have won the American Idol title.

But overall Clay's single is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best!","review":"For those of you who have not heard this new artist, his voice is absolutely fabulous. His Bridge over Troubled Waters is a powerful rendition. This is the Night is a beautiful original song. Clay Aiken sings this song with perfection and his gorgeous voice shines!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"One would think that Clay's music wouldn't be as enjoyable without seeing him perform it live, but this is AMAZING. They took the two songs down a couple of keys, and it gives his voice this great tone to it, and really emphasizes his great voice. A very different sound from the show, much more polished, yet with a little roughness to his voice that makes it sound much better. I would reccommend this to anyone who is a loyal Clay fan, enjoys Idol, or simply appreciates great beat mixes, back-ups, and lead vocals. My new favorite single!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken","review":"Clay Aiken has a wonderful voice. He reminds me of a youngFrank Sinatra. He is so cute and such a nice person.

Clay's voice is like an angel and his power and range takes my breath away everytime. The choir may have been a little too loud in \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" which Clay seriously did not need. His voice is amazing on its own. All in all, this single was not a disappointment at all and I am definatley looking forward to buying Clay's first album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Songs, Wonderful Singer","review":"Clay Aiken definately made his mark with these singles. Bridge Over Troubled Water is everything a cover should be, bringing the classic into a more contemporary arrangement, while still retaining what made the song lovely. His voice shines from every low verse to the soaring chorus...and that last note is magnificent. At first I considered the choir too loud, but I've grown more accustomed to it, and I think they are a magnificent support/backup, and really, there is no way to drown out that Voice.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed This is the Night. It's a sappy song, with trite lyrics, but...somehow it works. In Clay Aiken's hands the ballad shines and moves me. I couldn't imagine it in the hands of another singer. With this song, Clay soars. I am in constant awe of that voice, and I await the coming album with baited breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay was Robbed from his American Idol Title","review":"I love this CD, Clay is on his way to becoming a superstar.

This CD just touches the surface of his talent but it is still better than what most singers put out today! His voice is a true marvel. It is so amazing that he doesn't even need music. He could sing acappella and it would blow everyone away. I would recommend this CD to anyone regardless of their musical tastes. He is that good. He was the best on AI and he should have won. Based on how good he is on this CD, he will outsell all the other AI contestants.

No matter what Clay sings its dynamic and powerful. Can't wait till I can pre-order his full length CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensational Showstoppers","review":"These two songs were both showstoppers on Americn Idol2, as sung by the most dynamic new talent in recent memory, Clay Aiken. His voice transforms the old Simon & Garfunkel classic, Bridge Over Troubled Water into a modern, heartfelt, gospel hymn. The original This Is the Night suits Clay's dramatic style and fabulous voice perfectly. Treasure this first recording by our next great singer, Clay Aiken."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money","review":"Don't waste your money. Clay is alright for show tunes, but I couldn't bare to sit through a whole CD of his singing. He tries too hard. There's no natural talent involved. I can't understand why he has a single out and I shudder to think he is working on an entire CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too sappy","review":"Clay has a beautiful voice that truly belongs on the stage. Trying to make him into a pop star is a complete waste of time. On this CD single, he just sounds sappy and smarmy. I think he belongs in an arena where his voice is showcased, not in a recording studio. He's no Josh Groban!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only For The Most Rabid Of Fans","review":"I have to admit, I was never a Clay fan. I was all about Trenyce all season. However, Clay's talent was undeniable. However, this CD is truly a poor showing. The cover of Bridge Over Troubled Water is just not nearly as good as the original. This Is The Night is annoying and uninspiring. If you're the type of person who'd buy Clay's used gum, then go ahead. For the casual fan, I can't recommend this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"This cd was not worth the money. I thought clay sounded awful, and his version of the songs wretched. He was much better on the show.Ruben on the other hand, his cd was excellent! I loved it, and I think it seemed more the work of a professional, than Clay's ameutuer renditions. On this battle, as on the show, Ruben has soared in quality. If you want to spend your money wisely, Ruben is the choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay Is Nothing Special","review":"The voters got it right hun when they voted Ruben as the American Idol.

Clay is nothing special huns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fit for the modern scene","review":"yes Clay aiken does have an impressive voice but lets all face it. he will never ever make it onto mainstream radio. his voice is 100% set for the stage and he will make it extremely far on broadway. yes, that right, i said BROADWAY not BILLBOARD. its an ok song but i doubt ill here it on the radio while in such places as NYC or LA which pretty much decide what is played through out the rest of the country."},{"rating":"1","title":"So tacky it's funny !","review":"I don't mean to sling mud at the All-American \\"A-sexual dyed eyebrow singer\\", however, the production of this single is overdone, overproduced and most importantly over sung.The track \\"BRIDGE\\" sounds as a bad Christian remake of the classic SIMON & GARFUNKLE song.The beauty that made SIMON & GARFUNKLE's BRIDGE win numerous GRAMMY AWARDS for this song was their simplistic vocal presentation to powerful lyrics they composed.AIKEN needing yet again to \\"showcase\\" his vocal pipes neglects most importantly to respect the nature of the song. Possibly he is undergoing yet another transformation...this time into the new MARIAH (let's do every note on the scale) CARREY.This has got to be the tackiest yet funniest single released during the past decade and probably will be listed by most music critics as the worst unnecessary remake of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Do a Simple Reality Check","review":"Clay is certainly a competent singer. However, let's put this entire thing in perspective. Listen to Elvis' cover of \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" from The Essential 70's Masters Set disc 3.

Clay is simply average in comparision."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL AND BORING","review":"Ever Since i saw clay on american idol, i wasn't impressed. This CD dosen't make me anymore impressed.

Gets very tiresome. I think people are giving him indeserved hype because he is such a super nerd. And today nerds are cool. I wish he would use a deeper voice like his first audition. That was impressive. This certainly is not.I do think Ruben is better. I also think Trenyce was the beauty, voice and stage performer who could have really flew up the charts. I think that Julia Demato has an incredible beautiful voice and the look that could have took her places. Though she fell short on stage. Listen top her on the American Idol II CD. Breathtaking.I won't buy Clay's new CD. I don't think I could listen to it more than once. He is no Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay is a flash in the pan. Ruben has staying power.","review":"Unfortunately, this guy does not do the classic Bridge justice. Way too much brass is laden on what should be an elegantly simple song. And the original song is sappy and juvenile. The real talent lies with Clay's competitor for sales, Ruben Studdard. Ruben is the artist from AI with flawless talent, mature style, and crossover appeal.

But his fakery and cliche hooks and \\"emotionalistic\\" pandering to the lowest denominators of taste are almost offensive.But worse than that is the utter simplistic and sophomoric instrumental backing. Such sappy arrangments! Such terrible, cliche-ridden wooden detritus! It's like the music was scored by a really bad evangelical Church band.yuck.This person deserves no career. But on the other hand, I have to give him credit as an artist - he's obviously a really good con-artist, and he';s sucking up money left and right, and jusdging by the rave reviews this schlock artist gets, he's conned a lot of people. But then, sadly, it seems that most people are only interested in the most base and banal of arts.So credit to you Clay - you aren't an artist in terms of sniging, but you are true artist of marketing and the game of the con!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken is #1","review":"This CD is awesome.

I hope the love stays between him and ruben."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Clay Aiken!!!!!","review":"Clay is wonderful and this C.D. is also wonderful. His voice just takes you to another place. I also believe the choir drowns him out on Bride Over Troubled Waters. He doesn't need very much back-up. I hope on his album coming out this fall, they lay back on that.If the phone lines had been able to handle the tremendous volume of incoming calls....I believe that we would have a different American Idol right now. I called for 4 hours and only gotthrough 3 times, as did about 10 other people I know, not to mention those I don't know. None the less....I think the salesare speaking for themselves on who the \\"true\\" American Idol is."},{"rating":"2","title":"He has the talent and the looks","review":"not only is clay a adorable and gorgeous but he has a voice that lights up the sky. when i first heard his voice i got more than i expected. he proved his talent is never ending. i'm waiting impatiently for his album."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT!!!","review":"Simply stated, Clay is brilliant. His voice is incredible. It is so refreshing to hear an artist like Clay in the current rap/hip-hop dominated market. There is absolutely nothing wrong with pop music, and these songs are gems. I can't wait to buy Clay's full length CD out in September. Go Clay!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay rocks!!!!","review":"This cd is soooo cool. Plus we all know that Clay is the REAL american idol!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I mean ruben is good, but Clay is so much better.1) Bridge Over Troubled Water- This is really good, better than on the show. It's also the full song with and extra verse in it.2) This Is The Night- I garuntee you will melt when u hear this song! It's totally awsome!!!!!IF YOU DONT HAVE THIS CD BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good voice--bad recording","review":"Clay has a wonderful voice--unfortunately. the producers of the recording did a terrible job of mixing. The orchestra and background singers are so loud that that his voice, muffled to begin with,is hard to hear. It is obvious that they wanted it on the market \\"asap\\" regardless of the qualiyy it deserved."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS HAS GOT TO BE THE WORST CD SINGLE EVER.

PLEASE DO NOT WAITE YOU TIME AND MONEY ON THIS TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is beyond American Idol","review":"I would give this single 5 stars, but like almost everyone else, I found that the choir should have been toned down. I'm not for axing them entirely. I was looking forward to hearing them with him. It gives the song some really interesting Soul Groove. New music genre perhaps? Since Simon had such a hard time wondering what to do to market him. Eventually it's going to occur to them, that they have to do nothing. We feel it, we want more of that feeling, and I say. Bring it on. There's just no stopping him. IT's beyond AI2. It's beyond Clay, even. He walks in his own light, how would he know what he's doing to the Collective. He's getting us to forget any lines of separation and just feel the power of our own souls. And we're agreeing with that. No questions as to why or what we stand for, or how old we are. Magic,pure magic. Keep it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lordy..what can i say? =)","review":"Clay is just amazing.

Although there were much better songs he could have recorded, I love This is the Night. I am eagerly awaiting his full CD and already have tickets to see the tour here in NY. I do not think that the producers of this CD put as much time into it as they may have for Rueben..then of course, Rueben needed it! Good luck Clay!

I am DYING for this boy's debut album. It's amazing, like I said before. He can sing anything, and this single showcases it beautifully. BOTW will make you melt. TITN is perfect for a wedding or honeymoon. He does wonderfully on both songs.....But, FYI...If all you've heard are his live performances on American Idol, let me let you, this is going to sound soooo strange without the screaming fans in the backround!! I know it took me awhile, but both songs definetly sound better recorded in studio version."},{"rating":"2","title":"clay, clay, clay","review":"clay is definitely a gift from above. his talent is extraordinary and truthfully i haven't been touched by a singer like he has. his redition of BOTW and TITN are both wonderful, but his vocals were somewhat drowned by the gospel choir in bridge. not his fault, it was a faulty productio i believe. i would have loved just to hear his heavenly voice.i must also add that listening to his other songs w/c he has performed on AI also gives me the chills. his christian songs have touched my heart and soul that it makes me cry. clay is a joy to listen to and has touched my heart. may this blessed and extraordinary boy/man go very very far and continue to inspire people w/ his talent and musiuc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Clay Aiken has proven that he has the voice to become a star. He might not be the next Justin Timberlake or Ricky Martin, he does have a sound of his own. He voice is as strong as any other male artist out there today. He will be successful. Bridge Over Troubled Water gives me chills each time I hear it. It is my favorite song when I was growing up."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"Both songs are amazing!

My only question is where are to videos for these songs!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken Rocks","review":"Clay's powerful voice always sends chills down my spine. What can I say that hasn't already been said?The only complaint I have is the chorus..if they would have just toned it down a notch. They almost drowned out Clay's beautiful voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is a Natural","review":"Clay has such a natural voice. The music industry has long needed his talent. The first time I heard him sing on American Idol during the Wild Card show, I was hooked and couldn't wait to hear him during his next performance. He was my choice for American Idol and I know he will have a rewarding and successfull career."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME","review":"Clay Aiken has the most beautiful voice. I'm hearing impaired and sometimes I don't even bother to listen to music, but when I know its Clay I will turn up the volume and tell everyone to shut up. His voice brings tears to my eyes, and feeling to my soul. That's what I call a great singer. I think Clay will go a long way and will be remembered for many many years to come. GO CLAY, don't look back. Don't stop. Go to the sky's limit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAYMAZING!!","review":"Listen to Clay sing one time and you will be hooked for life. He is nothing short of amazing...or in Clay speak...Claymazing! His range is unreal. His vocal tone soothes the soul. You will get tears listening to this man sing. He is already a superstar, an American Idol, the kind of entertainer, the kind of human being, that the world has been starving for. Congratulations to a good soul who is getting what he deserves. You will never regret buying this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surreal!","review":"Clay's \\"debut\\" CD is wonderful...They may not be the \\"best\\" songs but his voice is amazing and would be amazing even if it was a cover of Eensy Weensy Spider....I don't understand how he didn't win....His is the most wonderful voice I've heard in a quite awhile, and this CD proves he has what it takes. Don't buy a copy. Buy two copies because you will undoubtedly wear a copy out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken- The True American Idol","review":"This single is classic! Clay's remarkable singing has won the hearts of America and will certainly win the hearts of millions across the globe. He blends great poise and music intellect with these two songs.If you like Elton John, then you'll LOVE Clay Aiken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the feeling go?","review":"Clay Aiken is a mildly talented young person. I was never really a fan of his, though I enjoyed \\"This Is The Night\\" a little bit. His voice sounds good on that one. However (there's always a however), in my opinion \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" was a VERY bad decision. Please take a moment to listen to the original Simon & Garfunkel version on the song. Note the gentleness, yet subtle power of it. It was a soft, emotional, powerful, career-defining, tearjerker ballad. Now please listen to Clay's version. The cheesy chorus, the cheesy trumpet, and then Clay. They basically took a fantastic song and sucked all the emotion out of it. It leaves me cold. I am sorely disappointed that it is getting as much airplay as it is. The two stars is because he does not have a bad voice. I strongly reccommend that you buy Simon and Garfunkel's classic album \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" in addition to, if not instead of, this hyped-up disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am in LOVE with this new voice in the music world!","review":"My young children already know the words to the songs on this CD because I play it so much! My only criticism of this CD is not for Clay, but for the people who have the background choir singing too loud on Bridge Over Troubled Waters. Please fix this for the album because Clay's voice is so pure and needs to be heard better over the background vocals! His live version from American Idol was much better because you could hear his wonderful voice better. Can't wait for more music from Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should you buy this CD??","review":"When I bought this CD, I found the first track \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" to be slightly disappointing. The choir accompaniment is MUCH too strong, overpowering even Clay's strong voice. It softens the sound of the song far too much, making it sound almost like Clay is one of the choir. The second track, \\"This Is The Night\\" is soooooo much better! Not only is it a beautiful, moving song, but the accompaniment is perfect and Clay's voice absolutely shines. BUY IT IF: you love Clay DON'T BUY IT IF: you dislike Clay. Pretty simple, huh? It's not a must-have for most people, but for anyone who watched American Idol or just plain loves beautiful singing voices, it's a given."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE 'REAL' AMERICAN IDOL","review":"If this is any indication of what is to come, we all know that Clay Aiken is the rightful 'title' holder to American Idol. The two samplings here are just whetting one's appetite for the full CD coming later this summer. This humble, southern, true \\"GIFT OF GOD\\" now belongs to the world. \\"Bridge\\" and \\"Night\\" are just two reasons why Clay Aiken is the real \\"American Idol\\"!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay: Model of an American Idol","review":"He may have not received the illustrious title of the show's namesake, but he clearly has left an impression upon American pop music culture.What make's Clay Aiken so special?He has the ability to captivate and entertain an audience of all ages, a gift that very few musicians can claim. His passion for music and performance are evident every time he takes the stage. This 2 track CD is the perfect way to whet the appetite of all Clay Aiken fans. My only regret on this current CD is that it only has 2 songs. Hearing Clay's voice again on the radio recently was like waking up and smiling. I am very much looking forward to the full CD release on October 14th!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing voice","review":"Clay has an amazing voice. I think anything he would choose to sing would be fantastic. Based on the pre-sales of his full CD, for which no one knows what the songs will be, a whole lot of other people feel the same way. I will buy any CD Clay puts out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aiken for Clay","review":"Well as a diehard Clay Aiken fan i was destined to buy this but it was WAYYY better then expected!Glad I bought it...you should too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great things in the future","review":"Clearly the American Idol producers and RCA were anxious to get this CD out quickly while the iron was hot, but the production of BOTW suffered somewhat, coming off as karoke choir-like, and overpowering Clay's voice. Not Clay's fault, though, so no stars deducted here. TITN is beautiful and should have been the main track. Aiken is an amazing talent and, as people who followed the AI competiion know, what's not to love about this guy with a big voice and even bigger heart? The CD proves his potential is great and it's a keeper. I hope it's a sign of good things to come. Let's pray Clay gets the positive guidance he deserves and good songs to showcase his voice. Hope he makes some money in the future, too, because I'm sure he's pocketing only pennies on this release."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovin it","review":"Clay is the idol. He sings with his heart and I enjoy his interviews. He is full of excitement and a love for people and music. His CD will reach the top. It is wonderful. Buy it today-- it's a great choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable Talent","review":"I'm stating the obvious to anyone who knows and has studied music for many years, but Clay's voice is a true gem, a rare find. I think the song selection is wonderful for his voice and I'm so glad that there are two new songs, not a repeat of what was already on the American Idol 2 CD. Technically Clay is perfect, but beyond that, the emotion and depth his voice exudes on this CD, in both songs, is phenomenal. It is very difficult to redo a hit song, but Clay makes Bridge Over Troubled Water his own, amazing! This is the Night is a song perfect for Clay's status as a popstar.I would really like to hear Clay do a cover of Flying Without Wings. It was a hit for the Irish boy band Westlife and Clay's voice is much more suited to the strong clear vocals necessary to do it justice than Ruben's is -- his cover of it sounds weak compared to Westlife's -- who took it to #1 in the UK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay,.....wonderful","review":"Clay has come through. I loved this CD and would recommend it to anyone.I love that i can understand every word he says when he sings. and his pitch is near perfect all the time. he will only get better with age and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING VOICE!!!!","review":"THIS GUY HAS TO BE GOING PLACES. HE IS TERRIFIC. HE HAD TO BE THE WINNER OF THE AMERICAN IDOL, THERE IS NO WAY THAT RUBIN BEAT HIM. NO WAY!!!!. HE IS TOO GOOD. HIS RECORD HAS BEEN NUMBER 1 AND 5 STAR SINCE IT APPREARED ON AMAZON. HIS VOICE IS BEAUTIFUL. HIS SINGING IS FLAWLESS. HE IS THE REAL WINNER AND HE IS GOING TO BE BIG, WATCH OUT FOR CLAY AIKEN. THE AMAZING THING ABOUT HIM IS THAT HE APPEALS TO ALL AGES MEN AND WOMEN.

GOOD LUCK TO HIM..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is the whole package!","review":"His voice is amazing, his humility infectious, his look of innocence a refreshing breath of air, and his ability to not take life too seriously a lesson for all. You just got to love him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Debut","review":"Both of these singles will not disappoint. If you were a fan of the American Idols show (of which I am a late-comer) you will understand the mania and hype surrounding this rising young star. If you enjoy listening to a stimulating and energetic interpretation of songwriting in the year 2003 then you will also be extremely pleased with this CD. (And this review comes from a die-hard John Lennon fan - just ask my 3 boys and they will tell you.) I have been told that I am obsessed with Clay Aiken and I guess that is true. He is a truly entertaining and down-to-earth individual, and listeners will be rewarded- I guarantee. I have already pre-ordered his full length CD which won't be released until mid August. I cannot wait to hear what else Clay has to offer !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST.","review":"Clay Aiken proved on this Single, that he deserved to win American Idol. Between the sales rank, and the amazing voice, it's clear. \\"Bridge over troubled water\\" was a terrific re-make, with vocals that leave you in awe. \\"This is the night\\", which will be Aiken's first single, is also a terrific song. I can imagine it being played at weddings because it is so pretty. I definetly reccommend this CD for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything i'd hoped it would be....","review":"This single is one of the best CDs that i own.... Clay has such an incredible voice, i just cant get enough of it. Bridge Over Troubled Waters is one of my faves... i thought the choir was a little too much though....... still sounded great. This Is The Night ... wow.... i looooooooooooooove this song and i love singing this song... he sings it sooooo well.. i play it over and over again . I cannot wait for Clay Aiken's full length cd to arrive in stores... i'm sure it'll make me more of a fan than i already am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is amazing and will be around forever. . .","review":"Clay has the most amazing voice I have ever heard. He is a incredible singer with staying power. When I went to the American Idol tour last night Clay sang \\"This is the Night\\" and I was almost moved to tears because it was so beautiful. Although he did not sing \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\", I, of course, have heard it tons of times and it is still as amazing as the first time I heard it. Mostly it's the way Clay belts out the word \\"mind\\" at the end of the song. It just gives me goosbumps. He is one of the most talented singers I have ever heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is a class act!!!","review":"BOTW is amazing! Clay did a fantastic job and really blew the top off that song, although the choir background may be a bit too much at times. Still great though. My fave is This is The Night! It's a beautiful, powerful song, and with a voice like Clay behind it, well it is a real masterpiece!!! No wonder Clay has been #1 on Amazon presales for 3 solid weeks!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Night 5 STARS!","review":"This is a great song. The words are perfict for todays generation.

This cd is the best that I have heard in a long time. Clay has such a beautiful voice and has more talent in his pinkie than most performers have in their whole body. Buy this cd and I promise that you won't regret it. He is the real American Idol!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay gets 5 stars - the music 3 stars","review":"This man has the voice of a angel. There is a purity and strength to his singing that I cannot recall in any other performer in recent memory. I wonder, however, who had the final say on song selection. This Is The Night is a servicable ballad with a good hook, but hardly memorable. And I swear Elvis did the exact same overproduced arrangement of Bridge Over Troubled Water. RCA, you better step up to the plate and do right by this young man. I hope the album displays more creativity and imagination than his first single."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"I didn't watch any of the first or second seasons of AI...I thought it was hokey (and I was a tad bit jealous). Kelly's voice is gorgeous and she deserved to win. However, how did Clay ever miss that first time around? His voice is so beautiful, and he has a heart and soul to match. I would like to hear more of him and less of the gospel choir in \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water,\\" and of course I will buy his whole album once it comes out, but Clay is just amazing. As a girl, I love him. As a musician, I stand in awe. Buy it. Love it. Embrace it. Become one with it. Ruben was good....Clay is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just like any other broadway singer","review":"I dont know what all the hype is about but he is just like a zillion broadway singers out there. Nothing special and I wish I didn't buy the CD because the music is BOOOOORRRRRRRING!!!!!!!!!!.One can go to any broadway show and there will be another CLAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Comes Through","review":"American Idol season two runner-up Clay Aiken comes through on his first release \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water/This Is The Night\\".\\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is a nice cover of the Simon & Garfunkle classic. Nice being the key word. Clay has a nice soft voice, but it lacks the haunting appeal of Garfunkle's version. It would have been nice if it was done with some soul, but that is also not present. He tries to make it sound soulful, but that sounds forced and reduces some of the songs appeal. Take a listen to the choir in the backround too, in my opinion they seem more like a college chorus than a group of professionals.\\"This Is The Night\\" is a nice pop song. Clay uses his real voice to power through this one. Full of big notes and powerful swoops, it is the clear winner of the two songs. Well done. Lyrics are a little sappy, but I like sap.Not bad, could have been better, but that is true for almost every song. Clive Davis has a good piece of clay to mold, no pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the words of Simon","review":"HORRIBLE!! I can see if you are 12 and under what the appeal might be, however this is not a CD I would recommend! It lacks orginality and Class. Mr. Aikens voice is not even powerful enough to be heard over the chior. I think America better rethink this one. (TWO THUMBS DOWN)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's All The Power??","review":"I seriously cannot understand why everyone is going all gaga over him. His voice is mediocore at best and since when does shouting make your voice powerful? Whitney Houston has a powerful voice, not Clay. And no, he's not even good enough for Broadway. You need VIRBRATO for Broadway, which he has none of. Get Whitney's latest CD instead. Now that's POWER in your voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Simply awful. Acceptable voice, but delivery is void of depth, texture, and any emotional connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Sorry, I feel this cd was way overdown, with background music, etc. Was a total waste of money. Heard all this hype on Clay but found out just a bunch of ppl who have no idea what real music is.If this is just a sampling of what his entire album will be I will spend my money elsewhere.I would be embarassed to call myself a fan if this and his performances on AI2 are what you are going by. Yes he is a kidn hearted soul, but please STAY OUT of the recording studio.Truthfully I wouldn't even give this one star, maybe a negative 5 if that were allowed, I surely want my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"Clay was pretty much right on during thecompetition. He sang very well. But the CD isn'tall that. After reading all thegreat reviews for him, I expected better.Makes me wonder the motive behind all the high recommendationsfor buying his CD. Well, I bought it and I was a bit disappointed.He tries to sound too soulful instead of justbeing himself. The music drowns him out tooand it just doesn't seem to come together.It's a bit too much to listen to over andover again, especially after a long day of work.I purchased Ruben's CD first and I was extremelysatisfied. A-1 First class all the wayand the quality and sound is superb! Ruben soundsas if he's been singing professionally for a longtime. You would never know that he is juststarting out. Buy Ruben's CD instead. You won'tbe dissappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs a little more work","review":"Clay has an ok voice, but it has no style. It is difficult to listen do to its blandness. This is the night is a bit better than Bridge over Troubled Waters, which I have heard others sing much better. I think his voice needs a little more work. He has a broadway kind of style that does not easily fit into the pop world. He needs more strengh and force when he sings. These songs are kind of stiff He doesn't make them flow very easily. Maybe with time he can bring his voice to a point that it can be considered an instrument playing not just tuning up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This album isn't at all what the reviewssay that it is. I am totally disappointed and a bitupset. Makes me wonder what the motive is behindsuch very high recommendations for it. Claysings okay, but just because one canhit high notes and has a long wind doesn'tmake him a great singer. He's okay, butthis was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a guitar and write your own song","review":"Bruce Springsteen. Bob Dylan. Neil Young. Paul Simon. John Lennon. Bob Marley. These are artists and musicians who labored to become real stars. A real \\"reality-based\\" show would watch \\"real\\" musicians do their thing to earn a contract. American Idol \\"musicians\\" cheapen the classics and trivialize the true difficulty it takes to become a musician."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!? Has everyone lost their hearing?!?!","review":"I thought he would sound better on the cd, but I could not find any improvement....I guess some people like that sound.This single is all it takes to know why Ruben is an American Idol and Clay is not!Not only does he lack charisma and personality he does not look like an American Idol...what is going on with his hair? Please don't waste your money on this CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased!!","review":"This single is not even worth buying. Clay's voice is too Broadway and the songs are boring. I honestly cannot see these songs being #1 on pop stations. He brings no excitement to these songs like Kelly Clarkson does; therefore, I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waayyyy Overrated!","review":"Bought Clay's CD because of all the wonderfulreviews posted here. What a BIG disappointment!I am not happy with it. It's just okay, but notnearly as great as the reviews posted here are saying.The on Bridge, the music drowns him out and it's reallynot something I could listen to over andover again. Clay should be on broadwayor something. Don't know where he fits inexactly, but broadway would be nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real American Idol","review":"I loved this CD. What a talent!

I have 2 copies of this single and let me tell you im counting the days for the album to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm baffled!","review":"To the people who actually bought this: Is there something lacking in the original version of this classic Simon and Garfunkel song that compelled you to actually want to listen to the latest American Karoake Idol winner sing it?? Could you possibly have spent your money on a band or artist who is actually talented enough to write and produce their own, unique music, or do you really have to let the hype machine do its job on you again and again and again?? (Or wait - do you think maybe Clay wrote this song himself???)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the same","review":"This CD lacks the emotion and power that pushed Clay to the top of AI. While the guy surely has loads of talent, his power and personal reach to the fan wasn't there in the CD. If you listen to the live version of \\"Bridges\\", you can hear why it blew away the entire place.....the CD lacks that feeling and power...same with \\"This is the Night\\" I'm no pro but, my advice to Clay would be....stick with what gotcha there! Still, great guy, great voice, buy the CD and keep him going.....he will get it down pat with time and maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice I Fell In Love With","review":"Clay's voice still comes through loud and strong. I really like This Is The Night better than Bridge Over Troubled Water. Too much of the choir singing for my taste....He needs more of a popular music sound for the album.rican Idol finals. Clay has that \\"X\\" factor that has been written about so much. One cannot define it...it's just 'there'. He captured our hearts during American Idol and he will continue to capture America and beyond with the beauty and spirit of his voice. From young to old...from every taste in music; Clay has bridged the gap between generations. Parents need not fear their children \`idolizing' Clay. We are, indeed, watching the birth of a star.

Bridge over Troubled Water was an intense remake of the original with more than 10x the power of Simon and Garfunkels hit. This CD is totally outstanding, it is out of this world and CLay has one of the BEST voices I've ever heard, trust me Ive heard and judged a lot. I am still in awe that he didnt win the whole thing by a mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars PLUS 95 More Stars for Clay Aiken","review":"Wow! This is the greatest singer of all time! Don't let the Powers That Be, fool you into thinking that he was the second place winner of AI2. His voice is unique and amazingly beautiful. You can listen to him over and over and never get bored."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken-The Voice!","review":"Listening to Clay Aiken, one would have to wonder how this guy could not win a talent competition. He is better than the winner, Ruben Studdard, by far. Some dismiss his beautiful voice as \\"broadway\\" because it is powerful and he sings with amazing range and depth. I don't see the problem there. Many of the best known singers, in the past and today, are remembered for thier powerful voices. Nobody is going to care about Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, or 50 Cent ten years in the future. They are novelty acts. Clay Aiken is the real thing.He sings Bridge Over Troubled Water with such depth and emotion. It's even better than Simon and Garfunkel's version. He just has the ability to take a song and turn it into a Clay Aiken song.This is the Night is sung with such a soaring passion. One can't help but get sucked into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Poor Pruduction","review":"why do they rush these poor guys songs out and then release them with those terrible overpowering background vocal. something that was a low point of American Idol tv show is now a low point of there cds!

I could barely hear Clay over the choir...I have NO idea what the recording engineers were thinking here..the whole cd sounds as if they put it out as soon as possible just to cash in on the idolmania..I hope they take a bit more time, get better writers and producers for his album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's singles are awsome","review":"Clay's voice is really clear during the whole CD.

However, \\"This is the Night\\" gives me goosebumps. This young man has a beautiful voice. Because I was a avid viewer of American Idol, I can picture him singing this song. Clay is truly the American Idol and when his CD is released later this summer, it will rocket to #1 in sales. \\"This is the Night\\" has a great beat and the more I hear it the more I love it. I'm already signing it without the CD playing!! I LOVE THIS GUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a wonderful voice..","review":"I went out and bought Clays CD. His voice is so soothng and beautiful.

I purchased this CD and I listen to it constantly in the car. My daughter gets upset with me when I turn it off after playing for an hour straight. :P Clay has an amazing voice and a personality to boot. His rendition of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is AMAZING and the new single, \\"This is the Night\\" is so wonderful. I would recommend this single to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional Voice","review":"Best voice to come along in a long time. Great CD and I look forward to buying more of his work. If you haven't heard him sing and you are looking for a new artist with an exceptional voice and range I would recommend Clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"I listen to it all day every day","review":"I think this CD is awesome! The fact that I can hear Clay every day is just wonderful and it makes my day that much better when I get to hear him sing. However, I have also downloaded all his live performance songs onto a CD and I must say I appreciate his live performances of these two songs better than the CD. Only because the music on the CD is a little too loud and hides his phenomenal voice. But, other than that, its wonderful and I can't wait for his debut album to come out August 19. I voted for him 35 times on the last night and was soo upset that he didn't win the American Idol title. But, those days are over now because he's winning on music charts way beyond Ruben and thats all that matters! Go Clay! You're truly my idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 'Real' American Idol","review":"Clay is the \\"REAL\\" American Idol and proves it here.

Clay Aiken is an entertainer for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken's Bridge Over Troubled Water","review":"What sets Clay Aiken's apart from every other singer today is his range and particularly the lower register of his voice. This song showcases both and the emotion he gives the lyrics is outstanding --- no one in pop music today can come close. Highly recommend this cd, as well as it's flip side This Is the Night!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is the best","review":"I have also listened to Clay's 2 unreleased cd's which are awesome as well.

I can't wait to get the full CD when it is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This is the kind of single you can listen to over and over again and suprisingly not get sick of it. His voice is got that sort of \\"old fashion\\" style - not saying that it's only for oldies listeners, but it's great to hear someone who can actually sing unlike the extremely untalented and dull singers we have today. (exp: britney spears, justin Timberlake, J-lo...ect.)\\"This is the Night\\" will become an all-time classic (or at least it should...) and \\"Bridge over troubled waters\\" is possibly the best rendition I've heard recorded. Even as over half of america voted Ruben, I'm still keeping with this guy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful voice did Simon and Garfunfel proud","review":"This cd single is wonderful Bridge over Troubled water is one of my favorite songs and Clay did a wonderful version of it.

These songs are UPLIFTING, and appeal to all age groups. Without a doubt, this is one CD that will make you feel good. :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay was Robbed!","review":"With all due respect to Ruben Studdard, who is a very good singer himself, Clay was the American Idol.When Clay sings he lifts his voice right up to the rafters! He can sing any song... he is a versatile singer with a \\"bigger than life\\" voice.This single is excellent. Clay's rendition of \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is unbelievable. He sings the dust off that tune! His second song \\"This is the Night\\" is also very good. I know the judges on American Idol didn't really like it... but my wife and I both thought it was great.Buy this single and find out why Clay should have won."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's the Best! However...","review":"I couldn't wait to buy this CD. I wanted to hear \\"This is the Night\\" again, I loved it so much on the Idol show. I thought Clay nailed it, especially the powerful refrain. To my surprise, the judges HATED the song, even though they liked Clay's singing. Even an article on my MSN homepage trashed the song, calling it \\"god-awful\\". I don't understand it. I LOVE the song! Anyway, I must say I was the tiniest bit disappointed with the CD. Neither song is as exciting or powerful as on the show. Of course, part of the reason for that is that I also like WATCHING Clay so much. He's so adorable - watching him is so much fun. The \\"Night\\" song lets Clay's voice come through better than \\"Bridge\\" on the CD,where I thought the choir was a little too prominent (just let Clay sing!). I still like the CD very much, and I will never tire of Clay's voice. So, buy it, Clay fans, and support your Clay! He's one of a kind. I can't wait for a full album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken CD","review":"I was very satisfied with the whole thing (product, shipping time, the whole ball-of-wax & also the way Amazon handled everything. The CD was really for my Daughter & it arrived in great condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be a five except for...","review":"Clay is gifted with such a special voice. This is the Night is wonderful, but his voice is overpowered by the music and backup vocals on Bridge Over Troubled Water. Hopefully on the full album they will let his voice be the main focus, as it should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm just average music lover","review":"I'm just average music lover and I don't buy a lot music CDs. But I like Clay's voice and singing so much since he first time showed up. I'll buy whatever his music CD in the coming years. I think his magic, pure voice is a truely gift from GOD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm a huge Clay fan, but his producers really let him down on these songs. Clay sings \\"Bridge over Troubled Water\\" here way too low and tentatively; the chorus is even more annoying than it was on the television show. The song has none of the impact that it had sung live. It was probably a mistake to substitute it at the last minute. This Is the Night is better, but the arrangement is pure karoke. I hope his handlers do better by his album, although I fear more of the same from a rushed production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yelling or singing?","review":"If you like to hear someone sing at the top of their lungs, then by all means purchase this CD. I think he tries too hard. I would prefer to hear him relax more when he sings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon and Garfunkel: The Musical","review":"We had ABBA, The Who, BIlly Joel, and now... Simon and Garfunkel comes to the stage!This version is as hard to listen to as Sam Harris' version. Clay's career will last as long as his predecessor, Rick Astley. But at least Rick's singing doesn't sound like it should be on Broadway."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is madness","review":"Clay's voice is obviously very good. This is, however, the worst, most unforgivable desecration of a great song I have ever heard. The arrangement is terrible. Horn charts? Gospel choir background vocals? All of this done with this sing-song delivery and a tempo that makes the whole thing feel like a jingle. Who were these producers and musicians? Is it possible to disbar and musician? It sure as hell should be. They've turned a beautiful, melancholy classic that gives you goosebumps as it ultimately crescendos and made it sound like karaoke--albeit with a great singer with much potential. To co-opt some of Simon's melodrama, this may be the worst song I have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Waste of Your Hard Earned Money","review":"\\"This Is The Night\\" is the lamest song in the history of american music, and Aiken's screeching will only add to your pain.

This CD only proves that the best is yet to come with his full length CD!! Clay is the \\"American Idol\\" for good reason.....talent upon talent, with humility and goodness thrown in! \\"Bridge\\" is fantastic and the ending packs a wallop. \\"This is the Night\\" is equally great! You will not be disappointed with this CD! The only negative reviews here are from Clay haters whose opinion doesn't weigh heavily. If you don't like Clay then don't buy this CD. If you like him, you'll love this CD!! Anyway it would merit 500 stars if they were allowed!Congratulations on winning American Idol Clay!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I expected it to be","review":"I felt that Clay's voice in the \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" song was mostly overwhelmed by the accompanying choir and was not able to stand out. I had to strain to hear his voice whenever they sang with him. Otherwise, he's pretty okay. Didn't like the \\"This Is The Night\\" song. Perhaps the producers should've picked another... Clay had sung other songs better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay needs to give it up!!","review":"I watched American Idol 2 and have to say that the talent was much better than last seasons. That being said I think Clay Aiken should have finished 3rd in my eyes behind Kimberly Locke and Ruben. Clay has too much of a theater voice that gets really anoying after a while. I will say I was impressed at first that his voice came out of his frame but I dont think I will be buying any Clay Albums in the future. His music just doesnt appeal to me at all. I really do hope that ruben steps it up for his album and would definately love to hear a Kim Locke album as well! As for Clay.. his music just sounds [bad]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm just not a fan of Clay's style of singing. Boring to me. won't be buying the album, Waiting for Rubens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me","review":"One word: NO. These two songs that Clay sings are not good at all. His voice just doesn't fit. He's too broadway. I'm glad he didn't win the idol's competition, Ruben deserves it more. Save yourself some money and don't buy this CD, download it."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"This cd [is bad]. The \\"choir\\" is so loud you cant hear clay. Maybe thats for the best tho. Cover him up."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great Career, but not a great CD","review":"Ok - I put aside my bias toward this years winner ( Ruben IS my preference ) and listened to Clay's offering. I came away with the same feeling; the correct person won the competition. While it's a given that Clay has a great voice, his \\"over the top\\" renditions don't give me the \\"warm and fuzzies\\". BOTW suffers even more from the heavy-handedness of the production than Ruben's FWW. And I heartily agree with Randy Jackson; This Is The Night should not have been released. Clay should lobby for new writers and producers. He deserves better,"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry!!!","review":"i just do not like it. the best part is the high note at the end. that is is. Well nice try clay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid, horrid remake","review":"What else is there to say? One would at least think that a queen like Aiken would have chosen to camp up his image and release a cover of a really fun song like Amber's \\"Sexual\\" or maybe Donna Summer's \\"Love To Love You, Baby.\\" Instead she chooses to release a song that is namely recognizable from weddings and funerals. I really hope these American \\"Idols\\" are just a passing phase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares about Clay? Throw this single away!","review":"It makes sense why Clay Aiken would not win American Idol but it doesn't make sense how he would sell more than Ruben. Does Clay have range? NO. Is Clay worthy of having a recording contract? NO! I'll admit that he does have an alright voice but it is NOT a voice that I want to hear on the radio. I might have to tune the world out so I won't have to worry about hearing his horrible music. Do NOT waiste your money on this single. A smarter choice would be to buy Kelly Clarkson's CD or Ruben's single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks True Talent","review":"Clay's voice lacks what great voices have. The singing quality is average and should have a neutral effect on musically-tuned ears. Clay sounds more like a good karaoke singer than a star. I am not surprised that he did not win American Idol's first prize. I would not recommend this record to anyone because it lacks everything a true musician would expect to hear, that is true talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This guy is just not a great singer. Beyond that, looking at him makes me ill. I can't understand how this geek has mass appeal, and was happy when he lost to Ruben, who has a better voice and more presence.God help us if I have to see this Archie-comic look-alike in the future. The fashion makeover isn't fooling me. It's just that religious fervor common-denominator nice white boy thing that I guess appeals to the average american. Never been happier that I live in Boston instead of wherever it is that someone like this finds broad appeal.Why should I expect more when my fellow citizens stand behind our crass President who says \\"Bring it On\\" when asked about the continued violence in Iraq?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, average manufactured pop","review":"Don't buy this expecting anything other than elevator music with a vocal track. It is pure manufactured bubble gum pop, and Clay's voice is on the low end of average. It gets old in a hurry. They obviously have to sculpt it extensively in the studio to attempt to pull the full dynamics from the vocals and in my opinion, they went too far. America voted, and Clay was picked second best for a reason. His voice and music just don't stand up to the test."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this a zero if I could","review":"This single is really [weak]! Clay's voice is mediocre at best and his cover of 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' is insulting to Simon and Garfunkle. I'll be very happy when Clay's fifteen minutes are over. Ruben has a much better voice, I strongly advise you to buy his single instead!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack. Oversing much, Clay?","review":"Apart from teenyboppers and old ladies, I can't see who this could possibly appeal to. He oversings every single note, which is superduper on Broadway, but not on the charts. I am baffled why this is outselling Ruben's single. He sings with emotion and exudes charm. Clay? Not so much. Oversinging and over-emphasizing every note of every song does not equal emotion.And why, why, why did he sing this classic? No one will ever eclipse the Simon and Garfunkel original or the remake by Johnny Cash on his latest.I hope Clay disappears from the charts and reappears on Broadway. That's where he belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aiken leaves you aching...","review":"It really is rediculous what people consider great music in todays society. I tuned in to the first two seasons of \\"American Idol\\" and all I can say is, its a good thing that Kelly Clarkson wasn't part of the second season. Kelly is much better than Clay or Reuben. She has a better voice and can perform a much wider variety of music as well. \\"This is the Night\\" is absolutely awful and no one could ever out do the original version of \\"Bridge of Troubled Water\\" by Simon and Garfunkel. If you want to buy a great CD, go get Kelly Clarkson's \\"Thankful\\", Norah Jones' \\"Come Away with Me\\" or Celine Dion's \\"One Heart. Don't waste your money on Clay Aiken!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FIRST SINGLE NOT HIS BEST","review":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS CD. THE SONG SELECTIONS ARE WAY OFF. ALTHOUGH I FEEL THAT CLAY HAS AN AMAZING TALENT, WHOEVER PICKED THESE SONGS FOR HIM DID NOT DO HIM ANY JUSTICE.

I PRAY THAT HIS DEBUT CD WILL BE MUCH BETTER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge Over Troubled Water","review":"After listening to Clay's and Ruben's cd's, I am convinced that Clay is really the American Idol. I loved both Clay and Ruben during the competition but am convinced after purchasing both cd's that Clay's is definitely the superior of the two voices. I am happy for both Ruben and Clay and wish both of these singers the best of success. No one could be better deserving than these quality young men. I will continue to purchase Clay's music and expect to see him performing in Las Vegas for sure some day soon!! Peggy Odum of TN"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE CLAY AIKEN","review":"I love Clay. I wanted him to win so badly. I bought his Cd the day it came out. He is much better then Ruben, and he is beating Ruben out on the charts!(Clay is #1 and Ruben is number 2.) Clay is the best. I can't wait till his whole Cd comes out so I can buy a copy. I hope to go to the American Idol tour when it comes to my town so I can hear Clay's beautiul voice live and in person. If you haven't figured it out by now, I am a huge Clay Aiken fan, so you should buy his CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken-That Voice","review":"Right out of the gate...that voice, with all it's power and glory, makes you believe! From the stunning,gospel-inspired Bridge Over Troubled Water to the Top 40's This is the Night, Clay Aiken shows you the range and beauty of that Voice! The more I listen to This is the Night, the more inspired I am by Clay's classic sounds, new to this generation, and depth of emotion.

I love you Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"This is a great CD and I highly recommend it! I didn't think it was possible, but when Clay hits the final note in \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" I get the chills just like I did the night of the Finals. Although I initially wasn't as impressed with \\"This Is The Night\\" when he sang it on the show, the song grows on you and has turned out to be my favorite. Both songs reveal the awesome range of his voice, but in \\"This Is The Night\\" he is not overpowered by the choir.

Clay didn't need the loud backup gospel singers; however, his singing was beautiful on \\"Bridge\\" and on \\"This is the Night\\". He was absolutely FABULOUS at the Miss America Pageant!! I've been following him on TV this week and his appearances have been great. I like his new album very much; now, I would love to see him do an album of ballads with which we are familiar... and it would be awesome if he would consider doing an album of Neil Sadaka music... Clive Davis should not cater only to teenagers... we are not the music \\"downloaders\\", we are the CD buyers... Think about it, RCA! If he records it, we will buy it - and RCA will make money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great singles!","review":"This is a great first single release for Clay. If you watched him on American Idol 2 then you know what you're getting as both songs were performed on the next-to-last show of the season. They kept the choir in on the first song, which is nice, but Clay's last note doesn't have quite the same impact as seeing him nail it live under all the pressure. Still a great song, though. I think 'This Is The Night' is a GREAT song, too -- I'm not sure why Randy and Paula said they hated it on the show. It's a very romantic ballad that still touches me whenever I hear it."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLAY IS THE GREATEST SINGER EVER","review":"I THINK CLAY IS THE BEST SINGER EVER I AM 62 AND HAVE NOT BOUGHT A CD EVER.

He is the American Idol in my eyes, whether he has the title or not. And this CD is PROOF of that.

I can honestly say that I think his career will be an excellent one!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay can really bring it!","review":"When I first heard Clay sing 'This is the Night' on American Idol, I loved the song! Which is incredible because the lyrics are cliched. And I usually despise cliches. But Clay just adds his own magic to the song with his unique voice and his inspiring delivery.'Bridge over Troubled Water': I was startled when he sang this song gospel-style. I really, really loved the quiet Simon & Garfunkel version. But having heard Clay's version a few more times, I find myself actually coming to love how Clay sings it.This CD is a definite must-buy - the first Single from a young man who has already inspired millions. I believe that ten years from now, you will remember that you were among the first to recognise the birth of major star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay is awesome","review":"Clay sings awesome.

I love his new CD single and I can't wait for what comes next from this talented man. The diversity, range, and specifically the power of his voice is amazing. Every time I hear those last few notes of \\"Bridge...\\" I get chills.\\"The Night\\", his other single, is even better. I disagree with those who say the song was a risk that probably cost him the AI title. Instead of singing a \\"safe song\\" he took a risk on a \\"sappy love song\\" and pulled it off. At minimum it is a testament to his singing ability and the confidence he has in his talent, at max it becomes a big hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't stop listening to it","review":"I listen to both Bridge Over Troubled Water and This is the Night over and over again. The same songs play over and over in my car, and they are the songs I listen to before I fall asleep. Clay, I can't wait for your full length CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanted Clay to win...","review":"and this album is proof to why he should have. I don't have a problem with his voice, the reason I gave it 4 stars is because \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" is too 'produced'. They opted for more choir and less Clay and he's overwhelmed. I like the gospal version of \\"Bridge\\" but they should have let Clay take the spotlight.\\"This is the Night\\" on the other hand is all Clay and an excellent showcase for his talent and vocal skill. He does need some training and some more time singing professionaly, but I would love to have him sing \\"This is the Night\\" at my committment ceremony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Singer For All Ages","review":"I find it amazing that Clay has captivated, my 13 year old niece and 10 year old nephew, myself at 41, and my 71 year old mother, as well as my 51 year old sister and several co-workers in their 20's and 30's.The lyrics to \\"This is the Nite\\" are refreshing and the melody hooks you. I don't usually like remakes of old songs, but I hae to make an exception for \\"Bridge Over Troubled Waters\\". What a wonderful version that doesn't take away from the original while bringing the song back alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay has the voice of an angel!!","review":"Clay Aiken has a voice that is timeless and will sell million of cd's in the years to come. I can't believe that for such a young man he has got such maturity and depth to his music. He will be on the Top of the Billboard in no time. I loved Simon & Garfunkel;s \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water\\" but this is just as good as the original, if not better. And \\"This is The Night\\" has such beautiful words and music to it. I can't wait for his full-length CD to come out this fall!!! He is truly the American Idol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Clay Aiken CD","review":"Both songs on this CD are excellent!

I definitely recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $$$","review":"I was very pleased to get Clay Aiken's cd today and I was not one bit disappointed with it. Clay has such a wonderful voice that touches your soul. Both songs are very well done, although I echo that the choir could have been toned down just a bit. Clay is great and I can't wait to get his new cd in October."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I absolutly love Clay Aiken.He is byfar the most talented person in the singing industry.His voice is so pure and so powerful.....one of the best I've heard in my lifetime.I mean the power...the range I just melt every time I hear him.This CD is sooooo awsome!!!if you don't have a copy...get one!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Voice","review":"Clay Aiken is the first to make me swoon in years. His beautiful voice singing any song puts him in the same league as Neil Diamond, Frank Sinatra and Lionel Richie. I eagerly await the release of the next CD of Clay's. When Clay hits the high notes, I get goose bumps. I haven't even mentioned, yet, that I also consider him a \\"10\\" in the looks category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't drown out Clay's voice!","review":"Clay is great . . . and HE deserves five stars. The single is worth having, but it's dreadfully over-produced with loud choruses drowning out Clay's voice (not that easy to do!) in the Bridge cut and booming bass doing the damage during his haunting performance of 'This is the night' . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay had done much better on TV!","review":"I love Clay's singing. His performance of Sugar Pie, Grease, Build me up buttercup, etc., on AI are so captivating, and I love to listen to those clips.Somehow, I feel the songs on the CD are rushed, and very imperfect. Clay had done better during the AI competition. I completely hate the choir in BOTW, they are so distractive and unpleasant.I have the feeling that the recording company is cheating and taking advantage of the fans.However, if you are a loyal Claymate, you should still buy it, but I am personally waiting for better songs in his CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!! Never disappointed in Clay's voice!","review":"Wow! Clay's voice is awesome! He never disappoints. I agree with the remarks about the choir being somewhat overbearing at times on BOTW -- but as has been said, that was no fault of Clay's. Hopefully it will be on the album which comes out in August or September... and they will correct the sound and allow Clay to to be heard as he was the night of the final competition.This is the Night will be a classic as it well should be. It is beautiful! Way to go Clay! I would encourage you to buy the CD and buy one for a friend so they can be blessed as well! :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Night/Bridge Over Troubled Water","review":"This CD is really good!! The choir could be a little lower on BOTW but if you adjust the bass a little it is great!! I would recommend this CD to anyone who wants to own the first single of the next big star!! Also keep watching for his full album in September!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever!","review":"Oh my God, Clay's album completely blew me out of the water! His voice is phenomenal! Every note is exactly on pitch... I ABSOLUTELY LOVE BOTH OF THESE SONGS! I only wish Clay's CD included his rendition of \\"Open Arms\\", \\"On the Wings of Love\\", \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", and \\"Build Me Up Buttercup.\\" Those are a few of my personal favorites.I was completely floored that he didn't win American Idol. No offense to Ruben, I really like him and think he has a great voice, but Clay was just so much better. I tried calling in to vote for him for 2 HOURS! My entire family was rooting for him. Clay has one of the best voices I've ever heard...EVER! Also, I'm going to be first in line when his next album comes out. He'll always be my American Idol, even if Ruben does officially have the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Media Bias???","review":"What a talent this young man is! His single has broken all records and he is getting no air play? Now why is that? The public has spoken and yet most stations refuse to play either Clay or Ruben...! I think people need to start calling their favorite stations and demanding to hear this refreshing talent. Again, why is he not being played?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Many emotions!","review":"When I listen to the two songs on Clay Aiken's new single I find myself smiling and crying at the same time. What a powerful voice. We love you Clay!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but still can't quite do Clay justice","review":"I'm as big a Clay fan as anyone, but I was just a tad disappointed with his first single. My complaints lie mostly with \\"Bridge Over Troubled Water.\\" The background choir really does overpower his beautiful voice, and the emotion he sang with during the live performance of this song does not carry through on the recording. However, this doesn't keep me from feeling that Clay is the best singer I've heard in a long time, and I listen to this CD every chance I get! \\"This is the Night\\" sounds amazing and I still get chills no matter how many times I listen to it. But I actually think his BEST song so far is \\"On the Wings of Love,\\" on the American Idol soundtrack. All you true Clay fans need to pick that one up too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This One, He has a Great Voice","review":"What a great voice! The chorus in Bridge Over Troubled Water is too loud...it drounds out his awsome voice. I can't wait until his full CD comes out. I think we have a big star here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken is the DEFINITELY the WINNER !!","review":"Heard him singing for the first time gave me the chill. His voice is unique and powerful.This CD is truly an outstanding single cd from a very unique artist.Can't wait for his first full album to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolultely powerful and mindblowing!!!","review":"Woohoo! I just got Clay's cd today and I have to say, the songs are so WONDERFUL! My favorite is \\"This is the Night\\". Clay's voice is just so powerful, moving, dramatic and sweet! You'll just be caught in Clay's powerful spell! Bridge Over Troubled Water is cool too! I have to say, that I cannot wait for his debut album. I am DEFINITELY buying it when it comes out this summer! I don't think I'll ever be bored of Clay's voice ~_~ Clay is my number 1 idol, forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Amazing","review":"These singles are both amazing. Clay is so talented and I love his voice so much. I will definitely buy a couple more of these for gifts and to save. This is a great buy and I would recommend this to everybody!!!!! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay Aiken is refreshing","review":"I preordered Clay's CD from Amazon and I am so glad I did so. It is wonderful to hear such a clear and powerful voice. Hopefully we will hear much from this new young talent. I live in the northern part of Alabama and stores were sold out of this CD by Tuesday night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joey","review":"I just spoke with Don Boy (as I call him) on his cell. I'm Joey Scribner and I own \\"GRINS & GIGGLES COMEDY\\" www.grinsandgiggles.netDon is one of the funniest comic on the circuit and he told me that he had a chapter in there about me. He said he was going to send me a copy but he was laughing to hard to embellish about what he wrote. I would venture to say that it's true because as being a fellow professional comic some really crazy crazy stuff happens out there....WOO HOO! I asked him if he wrote about his \\"MIDGET\\" experience in Decatur Illinois and he said \\"no I left that out\\"..(amagin that)...Now that I hear he wrote a whole chapter about me I just have to say that I would never do anything like that (yea right) heeeeeeeelol....I'm honestly scared to get my copy. But Don is a very funny and talented man.....And really I'm looking forward to reading his book! I just know it's gonna be a riot!

I was filled with laughs and tears, as Tjernagel travels the world performing stand-up comedy gigs while sharing his life on the road as a traveling comedian. He introduces us to various people and cities, and in detail explains their different cultures and his likes/dislikes of their particular cultures.This book is a must for the adult with a good sense of humor or someone who needs a lift... Two thumbs up, Very funny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album!","review":"I bought this album on the recommendation of a friend and was not disappointed.

It was difficult to read because the towns were printed in very small print with little coordination of print size to size of town. Generally the city map inserts were good. The map legend or reference referred only to the city inserts so there was no description of roads, train routes, tunnels, hiking tracks etc. I prefer the Kiwi Pathfinder map series or the Wises maps."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Woman Standing Still","review":"If this book is fiction, then the lead character, Sara, seems oblivious to self and takes no responsibility for the role that she plays in the outcome of her life. Her narcissistic and borderline personality disorder wreaks havoc in her world like a tornado in a Kansas trailer park. It appears that the reader is to believe that she has grown in some way during her \\"Woman's Walk\\", but I saw no evidence of it at all. A better title might have been a \\"Woman Standing Still\\". It seems as though this book is supposed to have a feminist bent; however, it appears to this reader that if it were to be read by more than the few reviewers listed, it might set feminism back more than 2000 years of organized religion ever could do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spiritual Journey","review":"Sherry's flowing writing describes a woman's heroic evolution that shouts and sings of the ways and means of character development with which most women can identify. Each phase of her heroine's journey is beautifully and movingly painted on her own artistic canvas, inviting the reader to participate in her intimate,propelling rituals. This is spiritual food for seekers of insightful and uplifting nourishment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another cart game?","review":"This may look like anyother racing game, but its not.

And you should buy this book!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-argued, practical, wise","review":"Smith makes an excellent case for a more nuanced, well-rounded understanding of conversion than the traditional punctiliar view. Bringing together biblical and theological analysis, plus extensive experience in ministry, he argues that conversion can take a long time. There is rarely a magical one-time decision that changes everything in a person's life from being totally oriented toward sin to being fully devoted to Christ. Embracing Smith's view can have profound implications on our ministry philosophy, particularly in blurring the traditional categories of evangelism and discipleship.I disagree with some of his denominational biases (CMA), and I am skeptical of his assertion that a rebellious period is almost necessary for adolescents raised in Christian homes. However, this assertion where he pushes me to reconsider my assumptions make his work all the more valuable. Highly recommended. Don't just read these reviews; read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Accompaniment a big disappointment - not the BEST","review":"For those looking for a good collection of Ryoko Moriyama's gutsy folk hits of the early 1970's, this CD will probably be a big disappointment. The folk/guitar/light background has been replaced, even in her first hit, Kono hiroi nohara ippai, with a poor orchestrial accompaniment, that saps the songs of their charm. Moriyama's voice is as clean, strong, and crisp as ever, and may appeal to anyone looking for a collection of easy listening, but the CD is ruined for anyone nostalgic for the Moriyama's hits as they originally appeared.She was one of my favorite artists in the great college folk and pops era, and she is still going strong, but this is simply not \\"The Best.\\" Check out some other Moriyama collections like the \\"Tears\\" (Namida) album rather than being swayed by this 2 CD, 37 song slog. Perhaps some of the later songs on the CDs are OK. I don't know. I stopped after the seventh song on the first disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I really liked the look of this product with it's nice roomy pockets but when I removed it from the package, it reeked!

But when Weather Report took their insane virtuosity to Japan, all the nay-sayers were soon getting a large hepling of crow. The intensity of these tracks is incredible! The opening medley is worth the CD price alone.

They made some of the greatest music and art of the century, that's one reason that it's an interesting story. It's an interesting example of black and white people working together to create something powerful, too. The label's demise is a sad story but a thought provoking one - was it attributable to irresponsible management? Or institutional racism? Or both?The fact that Rob Bowman knows his material and has investigated it thoroughly is evident by the flattering quotes on the book's back cover, by people such as Al Bell, Isaac Hayes, Mavis Staples, and Booker T. Jones, among others.Having set a high standard with his liner notes to the \\"Complete Stax/Volt Singles\\" box sets, Mr. Bowman writes this book and tells us even more detail on this important, infinitely creative and beautiful phenomenon.

Living in the high desert, it's not uncommon for anywhere that has ANY source of water and warm, moving flesh to be inundated. We bought a trap that smells like a rotting carcass that is kept about 50 feet from the barn, and it does work, but these fly strips have been AMAZING. We hang them in the eaves of the roof in each horse's area and they fill up pretty quickly. We've noticed a marked difference in the number of flies -- it's probably about a quarter of what it was before the strips. They're not pretty and they're pretty archaic, but I love the fact that we're not poisoning the area our horses are living in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugly does the job!","review":"I was at my wit's end with the spontaneous fly \\"situation\\" that has developed in my place. As a) I live indoors; and b) I have pets, I wanted a solution that was non-toxic and non-horrifically-stinky. I found the answer with these Victor fly ribbons, which even come packaged with a thumbtack for you to use to fasten them to the ceiling.The fly ribbons are ugly as sin--more so when dotted with flies--but they really do work well.

LOL!","review":"I actually don't think it gets any better than this!Ruben shines on both of these songs. Flying WithoutWings used to be my favorite. I use to play it overand over again it was ssssoooooo beautiful! But then...I listened to Super Star and it's been playing ever since. LOL!Wonderful talent! Beautiful voice. I can't wait untilthe album. Ruben deserved to win. Buy his CD,you won't be disappointed. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad cover version of flying without wings","review":"Westlife's version is so much better...they could write him a new song instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly, a disappointment","review":"Ruben charmed me on American Idol with his wide grin and southern charm. However, his talent always left me feeling...passive. I liked Ruben but I never liked his singing.With the release of his cd single, I can only say that my feelings have been sadly proven. I wanted him to release a great single; I wanted him to amaze me. But he never does. Instead, I'm left with that same passive feeling. I just don't care. I'm hearing the song but I'm not listening.Perhaps Ruben's ability will improve with the release of his actual cd. But, until then, I'm still waiting to feel something."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THIS BEFORE YOU BUY","review":"I have nothing against Ruben but if you are interested in this single because you like the song DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION as talented as this guy is he did a [poor job] job with Westlife's song and if you'd like to hear how this song was MEANT to be sung purchase the Westlife version and hear for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bland","review":"This CD is a little bland for my taste, especially after all the Ruuuuben hype. Ruben's voice is 'nice' but that's all and I was particularly surprised by the song choices. I thought that they would chose songs a bit more compelling to try and generate some excitement. Flying is more like a children's lullaby. Perhaps that's where Ruben's niche will be in the end. I understand he is going to be singing in some children's movie and I would certainly recommend him as a children's entertainer. I notice Ruben is having a hard time hanging onto a spot in the top 20 here and having heard the CD it is understandable. Rating would be: zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an American Idol","review":"Poor Ruben; winning American Idol must have been the biggest day of his life. Now that man of little words is having the biggest flop since Justin Guarini. Though he is number two on the charts shouldn't we expect more of our American Idol? His album is boring. Both songs are sung the same, they just changed the words around. Please don't make a whole album like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good version at all","review":"The star is only because Ruben as a good voice. but the arrangement is bad an boring, if you realy want to enjoy this song (flying with out wings) you should look for the original version by the irish band WESTLIFE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow i thought better!","review":"I'm sorry but i'm the Simon Cowell here! It is horrible i'm not impressed all! His version of Flying without wings is bad compared to WEstlife's version. Buy Clays cd instead you'll be impressed! I liked Ruben until now. He got very boring after the second time i listened to it. America has bad judgment for choosing an American Idol! I'm 4 CLAY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben: overrated; Clay: underrated","review":"This single is highly overrated. Both singers posses talent and showed it on AI, however, I don't believe this single is worth getting. If you voted for Ruben and still remain a fan, I would just wait for his album coming in (I believe) August. Clay Aiken's cd is more worth your money; he has a larger voice range and a great tone of voice. I think it's perfectly right for him to be ahead of Ruben (that shows that it dosn't matter who won the show since it was basicly a contest of who's fans could push the \\"redial\\" button the fastest...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre tracks","review":"Ruben Studdard has a very average, mediocre voice. Comparing the two American Idol singles, Clay's single is worth your time while Ruben's is just average. As I was listening to \\"Flying WIthout Wings,\\" I realized that Ruben's voice is quite raspy, hoarse, and scratchy instead of being clear and refined. I was quite disappointed overall with this purcharse and would recommend that you buy Clay's single instead of this one because at least Clay's voice is more powerful, stronger than Ruben's."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BOTHER BUYING THIS CD","review":"I'm very disappointed with this boring CD.

Aiken's single is much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR EMOTION!","review":"Flying Without Wings should be full of emotion. Ruben tries to swing through based only on his smooth voice. His rendition of this song leads me to believe that the American Idol producers were afraid to let him and Clay sing the same songs for fear that Clay would give far superior performances of the songs. Can you imagine Clay singing this song?? Would have suited his voice much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"he is the American Idol","review":"I think Ruben has a beautiful smooth voice. This rendition of Superstar is a little slow for me, but oh so smoooth.I like Flying without Wings very well, too.Somehow, I get bored while listening and can hardly wait for the songs to be over. There's not that much passion.I love Ruben and his smooth voice, but we need to hear a little energy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Original Velvet Teddy Bear","review":"A poor man's Luther Vandross, or Keith Washington.

Was disappointed. Love the song, but not the way it was sung. Tried playing it on two different players, didn't sound any better. I am a Ruben and Clay fan.

Buy Aiken's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben \\"The next big Star\\"","review":"Ruben exemplifies grace & talent. As he sings he brings about a smile & shiver. As I've watched him, he's grown more powerful & still maintained his grace. He is a wonderful talented singer with a warm & gracious disposition. There couldn't have been a better pick as the American IDOL than Mr. Ruben Studdard.

And no point in buying the single if you have already purchased the AI2 CD.....the same song is on there. Flying without Wings was just dreadful on the show. So I wanted to give it a second chance and listen to it on the CD. It is still a dreary and slow song. Why do they insist on arranging his songs so very very slow. Once I think he hits a higher note in the song. Save your money and hope eventually they will give him something to sing with some life to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...","review":"I found that this single was extremely boring. Ruben sings with no emotion, and that's a big turn off for me. Clay's single is amazing. Buy that one instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"I picked up a copy at the local Walgreens since it was real cheap. I wanted to see what the big deal was, and I really don't get it. Reuben Studdard does not seem to distinctive or original to me. Fly Without Wings is a strange song with annoying lyrics. It has lyrics like \\"I'm flying without wings, cuz I'm your special thing\\". Studdard does them no favors either. Superstar, formerly sung by Luther Vandross, is drab and boring sung by Studdard. Do yourself a favor and buy the Luther Vandross version instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth and Silky! A must have.","review":"The vocals on this rendition of Superstar are absolutelyflawless.

Well I LOVE HIM!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Just Horrible","review":"While Ruben can sing some, he just didn't show me on this Cd what he showed on the show live.

Thank you. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Flying Without Wings","review":"The first time I heard 'Flying Without Wings', I could feel my soul taking flight.

This man is very talented! Flying Without Wings is a beautiful song and Ruben sings it with such grace. He will go far and I can't wait for his CD to come out.To the person who wrote: \\"Tragic! Just Simply Tragic\\"Maybe you should go back to the old saying \\"if you have nothing good to say, then don't say anything\\".There have been a lot of remakes of many many songs over the years. For you to come on here and diss this man like you did, is a sin. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. The people in the contest of American Idol were forced to choose songs that were already out there. He chose this one and I think he did a superb job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of boring and blah.....","review":"Ruben *IS* a velvet teddy bear, cute, cuddley, and sweet,but that will not help in sell more CD's. These songs just drag on and on! He did a better job when he sang them loud. I would download them off of Kazaa before going out of your way to acutally by the CD. I listened to a friend's copy and I am so GLAD I did not buy it. Ruben will sell more CD'S if he wakes up a little. The best thing I EVER heard him sing was \\"Sweet Home Alabama\\"...at least he sounded alive during that one. He has a great voice, but not much pizzazz!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is OK good enough?","review":"I loved both Clay and Ruben (and Kimberly Locke) all through AI. This CD is a disappointment. I know Ruben can sing but the way they had him sing was boring. Do yourself a favor and get Clay's CD and wait for Ruben's album. Hopefully Ruben will flex his creative muscles and not let producers overpower him again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slowwwwwwwwww","review":"Love Ruben, but VERY disappointed in his single. Superstar was so slow, I found it difficult to get through the entire song. Whoever \\"helped\\" him with the rendition did him a terrible disservice.Wings was so-so good.I hope the album picks up the pace (and his talent). I could never listen to 12-15 songs on one cd if they are anything like this single.The single gets two stars just for Ruben being Ruben.....it would have gotten zero stars had it been anyone else singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not impressed","review":"I'm not against Ruben, but I didn't find his c.d. very enjoyable.....if you only buy one of the two AI singles (and that's all you really need) I would buy Clay's instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little bland","review":"Ruben Studdard certainly has a very pleasant voice, but both of these songs are a little bland for me. Flying just doesn't move me at all. As far as Superstar goes, having owned the Carpenter's haunting rendition this sounded more like a lullaby. Just no excitment here, which is too bad for a first effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not memorable enough... sadly","review":"Sigh... I was disappointed in this single, as soon as I got done listening to it once, I tossed it into my drawer full of old long forgotten cds. I had no desire to listen to it over and over again. Ruben has a nice voice but so do many male R&B singers who are now long forgotten or are not distinguishable among the ever growing crop of R&B singers. Please do not let him fall into this group!! I hope his full-length album will have some great writing and melodies and take full advantage of what he has to offer, otherwise, in the future, we will not see him in the music scene. Please don't hold back!! I hope I get to hear him with Tamyra or Kim Locke - my two favorites - because that could be a HIT!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simon says, \\"This is dreadful\\"","review":"Yes Ruben Studdard has a good voice like his rival Clay Aiken.

His voice is remarkably soothing. He is sincere and compassionate about singing and it shows in his performances and through his emotions on stage.

There is a reason why Clay Aiken went to No.1 and Ruben didn't, and Ruben is already out of the Top Ten at No.18 Singles and Clay is still sitting pretty in the Top Ten after 4 weeks.I am curious to see what happens when both these artists albums are released on the same week. I think Clay is definitely going to chart higher, as the single. Ruben is very talented but I feel Clay is the real American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarassing","review":"This whole pop/american idol malarky is a joke.

Clay was embarrassingly bad, to put it as kindly as possible, while Ruben shined, as always.Then, I listened to both Ruben & Clay's cds, and now I fully understand what Simon meant when he praised Ruben as having a \\"great\\" recording voice. Wow, was Simon ever right about that. \\"Flying Without Wings\\" is even better than during the show, and \\"Superstar\\" is Ruben's most passionate version of this song yet.Thanks Ruben, for once again giving me goose bumps!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've listened to both American Idol cds, and came away disappointed with Ruben's. His voice is still scratchy and he oversings notes he can't sustain. The entire time I listen to his music, I can just see his headwagging and pointing his finger and it is very distracting. I found my mind wandering when I listen to his music. Perhaps if better songs were chosen for him? At any rate, this cd did not \\"fly\\" with me, wings or no wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole Ruben","review":"Ruben has a great voice but my 2 problems are 1, he only sings slow songs.

Luther and Peabo are a bit more polished, though. Ruben does sound smooth and will be bound to improve with time. I just REALLY REALLY hate the song \\"Flying Without Wings\\". It drones on and on and gets stuck in your head and drives you nuts. Superstar is much better and at least it is on the single. I just think I will be sick if I hear \\"Flying Wings\\" another time....blech!

People of all ages, gender and nationalities will appreciate the quality of this song. You can feel the energy, the soul, pouring from Ruben while singing this song. His version of \\"Flying Without Wings\\" touches your soul; it makes you Feel Good! Ruben is the new Barry White and more! I recommend this song to anyone that appreciate R&B, gospel, inspirational, soul, and just plain great singing. No wonder he was nominated for a Grammy. I believe next time around, he will win."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Ruben Studdard is my American Idol. His silky, sexy voice moves my soul.

Ruben never made it that far.When Ruben sings it makes you feel like hes going to have a stroke right then and there.

Indeed, Ruben demonstrates the kind of 60's and 70's soul/r&b that isn't seen very often anymore in young artists. I love soul, r&b, and hip-hop, but Ruben, along with Clay, have yet to record anything modern or edgy. This is the key to competing on the mainstream pop charts. Both of these songs, along with Clay's, are performed very well and are good enough (for now at least). But the hype over these singles won't last much longer. Their next material will have to be more modern and edgy. Huge fans will probably disagree, but this is the truth. Ruben has the potential to be one of the best, but these songs, and others like them, won't cut it in the long run. Like I said, a superbly talented guy (but his songs are definitely going to have a short self life)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Ruben, hate the song!","review":"I love Ruben and I will certainly buy his forthcoming album, because of his vocal talents. He has rightfully won the American Idol title.However, \\"Flying Without Wings\\" is a poor choice for a single. The record company should have released \\"Kiss And Say Goodbye\\" instead.Another thing that the record company should have done is to improve on the arrangement of Superstar - too slow, too boring. Ruben was brilliant doing Superstar on American Idol, but so-so on CD doing the same song. The fault lies totally in the production."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed!","review":"I really thought this was going to be a lot better. It's not the same when you can't see Ruben.

Ruben's \\"Flying Without Wings\\" is a good song, but he sounds like he's exhausted and about to fall asleep while singing it. Not the emotion that he had live. I don't even know what to say about \\"Superstar\\". Why it is so slow and drawn out I'll never know. I can't listen to that anymore. I hate to say this, but Clay's CD is so much better.

Ruben Studdard is a nice concept, but the talent is pretty standard. If you are going to buy Superstar, please buy the Luther Vandross version. Ruben's version is slow and dull. I felt like banging my head against the wall a dozen times. I think I almost fell into a coma. Ruben also covers Westlife's Flying Without Wings. It was pretty stupid the first time around, but Westlife made it work. This is a pop song. Ruben Studdard's got a standard R&B voice. It's nothing special. There are R&B stars with more conviction in their voices. Ruben Studdard seems to be stuck in a rut, since both songs sound very similar. I know they aren't supposed to. It's nice background music. If you suffer from insomnia, this is the cd for you. I'm sure grandmothers everywhere will appreciate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"IDOL???","review":"Does he have talent? Yes he sure does.

I've never really liked any versions of this song though.Flying Without Wings isn't horrible but it's still not the kind of song that Ruben could really work with and make him own. I'm really disappointed in J Records and their handling of Ruben.

What a shame AND a sham that so many people \\"vote\\" their own skin color, rather than talent. Ruben seems to be a nice enough guy, but a nice guy does not a talent make.

Plain and simple he lost the spark that made ruben so great. Maybe its because he forgot 205. How knows. If i were you i would get clays single. THAT it great!

Its a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you think this is good....","review":"I've heard \\"Superstar\\" and it's not Rubben's best performance. I agree to some listners that they should have choosen \\"A Whole New World\\" instead. that song brought Rubben...Superstar didn't.As for \\"Flying Without Wings\\"...I was VERY disapointed. Maybe's cuase i'm a Westlife fan and their rendition of FWW is much better, or maybe cause i'm ticked that Simon gave Rubben the song only to have him totally ruined a Westlife Classic (which entered the chart at #1 position by the way). Westlife could have made it big here with FWW but to the States, it's Rubben's song. If you like \\"Flying Without Wings\\" on Rubben's single, you should really check out Westlife's version. It would definately bring tears to your eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"America's GOLDEN IDOL has feet of clay","review":"Extremely disappointing!!! The trouble with releasing covers is that they have to be at least as good as, if not better than the originals. This is not the case with either of these songs. Superstar is painfully slow and over embroidered (a la Mariah Carey). I liked Westlife's Wings, but this is a bloated version with no sense of direction or climax.I don't dislike Ruben's voice, but I think it is a shame that they have released two of his weakest performances as his first single rather than two of his strongest - A Whole New World & How Do You Mend A Broken Heart?It is fascinating to follow the aftermath of the TV show. Clay and Ruben both have potential, and the world is watching, but if the recent media appetite and their respective singles are a true indication of what is to follow, I predict that Clay will be a SUPERSTAR and Ruben will be a shooting star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not fun.","review":"I seriously just wasn't a fan. I mean, I'm a Clay-girl all the way, but I KNEW from like a week before the show ended that Ruben was going to win. To spite that, I actully just bought the Clay CD. But, My friend is a Ruben girl and we traded CD's for a few days, and I was sorely dissapointed. I mean, Ruben has never been the best out there, but I was expecting much more than this CD served-up. If I were you, I'd just save my money to get the Clay CD instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that great","review":"I like the soulful sound of Reuben's voice, but he stays in the same range, and sounds like he's singing in the shower or something.

FLYING WITHOUT WINGS is an original tune, and it sounds pretty good. The tone of the song is somewhat gospel-tinged, which really suits Ruben's rich voice. SUPERSTAR is a better song - essentially a remake of Luther Vandross' remake of the Carpenters song. On both songs, Ruben sounds terrific, although his voice is a touch raspy (no doubt he was overtaxed from all the singing they made him do). Unfortunately, the production sounds like it was a bit thrown together. The background music sounds too much like a cheap tinkly piano, and it really lets Ruben down. Big thumbs up for Ruben and I'm looking forward to his full-length CD. Let's just hope that he gets better producers next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"I'm sure he's pretty good to some people, but I just don't feel it as I do with Clay.

When I listened to Rubens all I did was feel depressed.

This CD is just too boring. I'm going to sell it.I also bought Clay's CD. His voice is just too awesome! The only problem with Clay's CD is that there is too much background vocals and instrumentals that drown out his voice. Regardless of the background noise, Clay's CD is a keeper! Ruben's CD might actually have been better with the background noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"To compare to Luther or Barry is an insult. . .","review":"Ruben is no Luther and he is no Barry and never will be. Flying without wings is a horrible tune at best (although I would have hated it with anyone singing it, who writes this stuff?). But to hear him butcher a beautiful Carpenter's song is about as bad as you can get. The biggest problem with Ruben is that all of his songs sound EXACTLY THE SAME!!! I don't know why it's taking so long for his full length album to come out considering he could sing one track and they could just copy it twelve times and put different names on them. Buy this CD if you are an insomniac."},{"rating":"1","title":"meh...","review":"this CD was not the best, but it wasn't horrible either, but f i had a hance to buy it or not buy it, i wouldn't buy it, but clay's is awesome, i recommend that one instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"As expected","review":"After watching American Idol this CD is about what I expected.

He smiled through all of his performances(which was pretty strange when he was singing about breakups). As talent goes, he's painfully ordinary and unoriginal. I made the mistake of listening to Superstar after a long day at work. About a minute and a half into it, I fell soundly asleep. I just can't listen to Ruben's voice for long periods of time. His voice put me into some kind of hypnotic trance. Later on, I zoned out to Flying Without Wings. Ruben Studdard has a pleasant voice, I suppose, for the Mary Harts of the world. He was good on American Idol because he smiled a lot. I do not recommend buying an entire CD worth of Luther Lite ballads. What worked on American Idol does not work here. What's so great about Ruben Studdard? I guess you'll just have to ask Mary Hart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whaaaaaaaaaat?","review":"This CD is OK. That's all. I don't see what the big deal with Ruben is. I mean He's good and he has a nice voice but I honestly don't see why he was so above all of the other contestants especially after listening to this CD. I mean I think personally that Trenyce would have been better or even either of the Kimberlys for the title of American idol after listening to this CD. First Superstar: How many times can the word Baby be in one song? Next Flying without wings: I personally don't think this is bad but it sound somewhat forced and not so smooth. all in all I think Clay's CD is 1,000,000x better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Be Giving this CD to the Thrift Store","review":"I bought this CD after hearing all the hoopla over American Idol 2 and the controversy regarding Ruben winning over Clay. After listening to this CD, I believe he was targeted to win, no matter what the public thought, especially with the phone system being messed up on the final night. His voice is pleasant but is no match-up to Clay, who sounds like an angel. I will be giving Ruben's CD to my local thrift store because I can't imagine listening to it again.

Like many artists, coaching and time will help Reuben refine hissinging skills and develop techniques that enhance his overall performance. He will find and cultivate his own style, with time and assistance.

Ruben is a nice guy; he has a warm smile; he sings okay; but, this CD is not worth 5 stars, and the songs are not wonderful or amazing.Flying without wings is okay.Superstar is awful.I am being honest here.

Ruben needs to try harder with his music. Clay should've been the American Idol because from what I heard, when viewers tried to call in to vote for Clay, they were automatically connected to the phone lines for Ruben and their votes counted for him. How unfair is that? And even though Clay didn't win, he's still the more favorite choice out of the two. His songs sound a whole lot better than this junk.Hopefully, Ruben will try much harder when it comes to recording his CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I still think Clay should have won but...","review":"Being born in the north and raised in the south I have grown to love all kinds of music. I admittedly did not watch the first season of American Idol (with no regrets)but tuned into the second season because my friend informed me that it had much more talent then the first season. I quickly grew to love two singers (who both got in the top 12), Clay and Carmen. I was so pleased to see Clay continue to move on and disappointed when Carmen was kicked off. I never really liked Ruben as he seemed like a very fake person who won because Simon hinted that he thought Clay was gay (which I don't believe). Anyway, having listened to both of the single CD's I believe that there is only one good song on both of the CD's...that is This is the Night by Clay Aiken. Save your money...they both aren't worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Clay's Single Instead, or a Luther Vandross Album","review":"Ruben's voice just does not cut it. It seems as though he tries to imitate Luther Vandross, and it does not come across as even near the level of Vandross' voice. Superstar is already on the other American Idol album, and Flying Without Wings, the way Ruben sings it, is just mediocre... there is no point in buying this single. Clay Aiken's single, on the other hand, is excellent. Ruben got the better written song, Flying Without Wings, as opposed to This Is The Night, but Clay has so much more talent than Ruben, that he can pull it off. If you are looking for an R and B voice like Ruben's, you are better off with a Luther Vandross album. But if you are looking for a real quality voice, purchase Clay's single."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying.....","review":"Ruben is an okay singer but I just don't think he has what it takes to be the American Idol. I wouldn't waste your money on this CD. In my opinion Clay sings much better. Clay has a much better Vocal Range and blows Ruben away with his Cd. I would suggest buying Clay's CD. His single is Awesome. Clay is my American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better on TV than CD","review":"Ruben is slow and tedious on this CD. It's a relief when each song is finally over. He often sings flat, and deviates from the melody WAY too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money - Get Westlife and Clay's CDs Instead","review":"Sadly, the voice just doesn't stand up without the visual image of Ruben smiling on stage. Sadly, for Ruben it also means radio play could be limited as well. I'm not sure why they chose Westlife's song for Ruben.Listening to Clays' This is the Night, then Westlife's version of Flying Without Wings and then Ruben's version - the lack of magnetism in Rubens voice becomes abundently clear.I'm really bummed, but Ruben just doesn't stack up without the visual aides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful.....","review":"Being from Alabama I so wanted to like this CD, but it is just dreadful. I wish Ruben well, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"FWW decent, but a let down; superstar provides a good nap.","review":"I was extremely let down with Ruben's CD. Being a fan of both Ruben and Clay I was expecting great things from both of them when their singles released. That being said, Clay not only lived up to my expectations he surpassed them. Ruben, however, did not.While FWW is a good song, the recorded version lacks something that the live version had. It's not a bad song, I just feel it could have been better.Superstar should have been left of the CD entirely. Not only is it horrible, it's boring. If I manage to listen to it more than once all the way through I can almost guarantee you that I'll be fast asleep by the end of it.I hope to see better things out of Ruben, so far Ruben has just proved that Clay should have been the American Idol."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roooben deserves better","review":"I want to start out by saying that I like Ruben and I wanted to like this single. I think he has a lovely voice, and he's usually very enjoyable to listen to. However, whoever decided on these two songs for his debut single needs their head examined. \\"Flying Without Wings\\" is an insipid ballad that was bad enough when Westlife recorded it, but does not do Ruben's voice justice at all. \\"Superstar\\" is much better, but it's already available on the American Idol 2 love songs album, so why bother to buy the single? Clay Aiken (the runner up to Ruben on American Idol, for anyone who's been living under a rock) has two songs on his single only currently available on that single, whose bright idea was it to put only one new song on Ruben's single? My recommendation is to skip this single and buy the American Idol love songs album instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes It Obvious...","review":"Not a spectacular disc. Superstar... he's sung that so many times it's lost all significance. And Flying Without Wings... good, but not great. Ruben's release is OKAY, but when you compare it to Clay Aiken's... there really is no comparison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Butchered Flying Without Wings","review":"I liked Ruben Studdard on American Idol 2. That is, I liked him until he butchered a beautful ballad. Flying Without Wings USED to be a beautiful song, but Ruben has made it horrible. I find it disgraceful that they would allow Ruben not only to record this song, but to release it as his first single in North America, without ONCE MENTIONING a very important fact. THIS SONG IS A COVER!!!!!! and a horrible one at that. Ruben is going to make this, to borrow a term from Simon, dreadful version popular in the United States when the group who originally recorded it, Westlife will never even be mentioned as the original group to sing the song.And that, is a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know it just isn't me...","review":"Ruben's voice does nothing for me personally. I know a lot of people are a big fan of his voice, but it really is hit or miss with him. I find his voice dull & boring, and this \\"Flying without Wings\\" song is very difficult to listen to without drifting off and either putting in a new CD, or changing the radio dial.I'm not going to get into the whole \\"Clay should have won\\" thing, because he didn't. Ruben is the American Idol, and the Idol should have put out a better first single than this. It's very poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAGIC! Just simply tragic.","review":"I'm moaning as I type this! Karen Carpenter would be rolling over in her grave if she heard Reuben's remake of her and Richard's haunting classic \\"Superstar.\\" I won't even get into the irony of it having been remade by a morbidly obese man as this song was originally released just as Carpenter was beginning her descent into the throws of anorexia nervosa.

Well the day has come! Ruben and Clay's singles are out and I bet you all are wondering how they will sound blaring from your radio. Well here is the scoop. Ruben's song sounds great! Really, you can't tell that he hasn't been doing this music stuff professionally since the day he first asked for a double decker cheeseburger. I admit that I wasn't impressed with this song on the finally show-- thought is was boring and lacked originality. Well the song still isn't the best if you asked me but Ruben gives it a great delivery in this studio recording! Go buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this is THE American Idol","review":"This single is all it takes to know that winner or not...Ruben is not an American Idol.Not only does he lack charisma, personality, and any energy at all...but his singing voice is so limited. He has a range of about 7 notes, sings off key 50% of the time, and is so monotone and boring it is painful to listen to this CD.The American people have done this young man an injustice to make him have any hope of becoming a success as a singer. Flying Without Wings is too long as it is and when you have to endure the way Ruben drags it out, it can be torture. Please don't waste your money on this CD. Buy the American Idol Season 2 Love Songs CD and hear the voices of those who should have stayed longer than Ruben."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok","review":"I was a little disappointed with this CD.

Nothing new. He will not last long."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice guy, but no dice","review":"Reubans singing is good, even above average but not enough to win over Clay Aikin in the American idol contest. The voting methods are highly suspect. And the numbers of cds purchased by customers tells the true story. Unfortunately Reuban is one dimentional, and his music is so soothing that it puts me to sleep. Clay on the other hand has a huge range of voice and it is inspirational and exciting. I like Reuban but if we want to be honest here then let me tell you this cd is a bit of a yawner I'm sorry to say. I guess it's a matter of personal choice. But the lions share of the talent, truthfully is in Clays court. The truth hurts sometimes but Reuban has nothing to be ashamed of. He is a talent in his own right. This doesn't take away from that. If he were my son I would be extremely proud of him and his accomplishments.God speed Reuban."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ruben IS the Velvet Teddybear!","review":"His voice is awesome and he is just adorable when he smiles.

He's my big TEDDYBEAR!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good song, better voice","review":"Ruben is a wonderful singer and well deserving of first place on \\"American Idol\\". Though I'm not into gospel or spiritual music, I caught on to this track. However, I think he may sing better and more spiritually if he wrote his own songs. Though, \\"Flying Without Wings\\" showcases that to a high level. With Ruben, I think Simon Powell met his match!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, great singing, great melody...DUMB SONG!","review":"Ruben Studdard sound promising as a young R&B singer and the music for this song sounds good. The problem is, the song is dumb sounding. It sounds as it's trying to be poetic \\"I'm Flying Without Wings\\" as to say flying off of a high or imspiration but it just does not work. When you are flying without wings you are either floating for hurtling in the air.Again Studdard sounds great and hopelully will bring better stuff in the future. After all look at Kelly Clarkson with Miss Independent. Both \\"In A Moment Like This\\" and \\"Before Your Love\\" stunk.Now as for Clay Aiken....never heard anything by him. I still hear to many \\"oldies but goodies\\" on the radio and on everyones music systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay and Ruben fan","review":"I think Ruben's cd is great - very easy to listen to and sing along with.

I hope to hear better when he releases his full CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Ruben isn't anything special on this cd. It seemed like he just didn't care when he was singing. There was no passion or heart into it. Clay's cd is MUCH better than Ruben's."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge DISAPPOINTMENT. Superstar is too SLOOOOW.","review":"Superstar sounds so boring and is just too slow. I really love this song from the Carpenters but Ruben cannot sing this song. He sounds like he has to make an effort to sing ANY song & it just sounds FLAT to me. Flying Without Wings was a disappointment also. He DID sound a little better on the show when he sang it live, but even then, he sounds like he is singing from his throat and not his diaphram. Ruben has nothing on Smokey and Luther and he needs to go off on his own without TRYING to sound like someone else, because he just doesn't have it. I recommend CLAY'S CD INSTEAD of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LA music fan","review":"Ruben has a beautifully mellow voice; however, I was very disappointed in this single. It sorely lacks originality and lacks the punch I was expecting from a cd for the winner of an American Idol. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring.","review":"I take issue with one reviewer who opined that \\"mainstream America\\" can't stand the fact that a black male was crowned The American Idol, and therefore America won't buy his records. The truth is that Reuben is boring and gets mired down in turning single words into phrases with five or ten syllables, taking them up and down his vocal register and, in the process, completely kills the passion and melody of a song.America has heard this Reubenesque style before, only with more class. There's Barry White and Luther Vandross and Peabo Bryson. The vocal stylings of Reuben Studdard are nothing new. Reuben is a puppet who \\"reinvents\\" songs by OVERSINGING them.He will quickly fade into a pile of \\"has beens\\". Don't waste your money, unless you like your music done painfully slow, painfully over-produced, and painfully over-sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong one won.","review":"After listening to Flying Without Wings, it is very obvious that the wrong one won! Ruben certainly does have talent - but does not have the kind of voice that will hold up over time. He sounds more like a Vegas lounge act in this rendition."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT talent, not a great CD unfortunately","review":"I really love Ruben but personally these songs just don't do it for me. I hate to say it but I think his version of Superstar is boring, slow, and tired. There's just no magic in it, there's a lack of that certain something special to make it stand out. I thought so when I first heard this song on the AI2 CD and I still think it. Ruben has a great voice, this song just doesn't showcase it the way it should be.As for Flying Without Wings it's an okay song. I think it's definitely better than Superstar but it's also not the best song choice for Ruben. There were so many songs Ruben sang on the show that he just knocked out of the park and sadly these two songs just don't compare. I really hope that next time they give him something meatier that he can sink his chops into!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent singer- horrible song","review":"Ruben Studdard is a fine singer and his voice will fit in nicely within the generic catalog of R&B output. I received his single as a gift and I can't get past the silly lyrics, \\"I'm flying without wings, 'cause you're my special thing (or THANG)..I'm flying without wings.\\" Blech.Superstar was a wonderful Karen Carpenter song and it was done once again by Luther Vandross(whose recording I own)...so where does Ruben Studdard fit in? A shadow of Luther. I guess I just don't see the need for another Luther-sounding recording of this song. Very strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"While Ruben does have an undeniably good voice, his performances of these songs are a bit bland. The original versions of both songs (Flying Without Wings was originally a Westlife song) were more soulful than his renditions here. The American Idol judges cheated Ruben out of a chance to improve himself by refusing to offer the same criticsm to Ruben that other contestants on the show received. Ruben, unfortunately, never had a chance to improve himself from week to week."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be flying w/o wings, but he'll need lots of jet fuel!","review":"I don't think Ruben is a bad singer, but he sounds just like Luther Vandross. Both songs on this CD seem flat without any soul. I wanted to like Ruben's CD, but have to admit that it is Clay's CD that shows more uniqueness and feeling. Of the two, I recommend buying Clay's. I expect to see Clay with his own variety show, and Ruben stopping by occasionally as a pop-in guest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruben's new Single","review":"All the big hype over this guy.....I had to buy it.

He never leaves his comfort zone and doesn't have the vocal stamina hold the notes so they pack a punch. It's not horrible...I would not change the station if I heard these songs on the radio, but they are not songs that I would request or suggest others buy.

I avoided this series due to how off the beaten path it seemed and I am glad I did. Not because it is bad, but because its so different. It takes a while for you to get into the story but the story is at times so all over the place. This is why I do not recomend it for some one whoe is not a seasoned Moorcock reader.But that is only one perspective of course.

If you never rummaged through used book stores, then you would have never read all Moorcock has to offer. In 'Dancers' you get a comedy that reads like a sit-com on LSD. As previously stated, the prose flows with wit and adds entertaining jabs at English arrogance and religious fanatics. The colorful cast of characters are kept very true thoughout the three stories.

Truly masterful writing and an ability to move and delight place Moorcock in the ranks of great sci-fi writers who transcend the genre, like Neal Stephenson and Orson Scott Card.

It's kind of annoying.* The on/off button, located on the opposite side of where the bulbs are, is \\"buggy.\\" Sometimes I have to press three times in order for the light to turn on.* Not sure how long the batteries will last but I can see replacing the batteries getting to be annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless device","review":"Its simply useless.

So far I've used it nearly every night for about 1.5 months and the little battery is still working fine. It came with 2 spares though, and we purchased an extra package of batteries so I'm good. Although I've read other reviews about the light switch going out, this hasn't happened with mine.

It has two LED lights, the neck is flexible, it stays on the book/Kindle well, and has a nice colour. Those are the good things about this product. Unfortunately, the LED lights only shine for half an inch. You basically have to put it ON the page to light under it, but then it covers the text. It is in essence useless.

So to make sure everything is evened off in the wash, nephew #1 gets the weak spring and nephew #2 gets the near-dead battery. with shipping, i paid just over $8 for both of these to be delivered to my door, so i wasn't going waste my time with repackaging and shipping off back to amazon.

After researching several types I decided on the LightWedge. It is light and flexible, but also seems to be very sturdy. The coverage area of the light is very good for the Kindle, although I have yet to find the perfect angle that illuminates the very bottom of pages as well as it covers the top.

For the price, this is a decent book light. It comes with two sets of batteries which is good since the batteries in the store cost more than the light. I find it works best if I clamp it at the top and tilt the head sideways. If you shine it directly on the e-reader, you get a glare from the LED bulbs. I wish it lit the entire screen a little better, but reviewers of other types of book lights (even more expensive ones) complain about the same problem. It is directed enough that is doesn't bother the driver in the car if you are reading on a trip. The clamp makes ugly marks on my cover , but I just moved it to the back cover so that it doesn't really matter. It folds up small and is a bargain compared to the book lights in the stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"This thing lasted about two days, and I'm being generous.

The package contains two sets of batteries, which is nice. Quality seems to be great for the price. Happy with my purchase. Don't see a reason to spend more on a reading light."},{"rating":"1","title":"The push button switch is low quality","review":"I've been on the quest for a good book light for a very long time. Usually they start off OK, but dim considerably after just a few hours of use and also have dark spots in the corners of the page. This light does NOT have that problem. It is very bright, it easily illuminates two full pages of a large hardcover novel with no dark spots. It's easy to read by. I love the flexible neck and the big clip that can fasten over multiple pages and holds like a champ. The problem is the switch. It is a push button that does not work reliably. Sometimes you have to push the button ten times to turn it on or off, the other night I spent a half an hour fiddling with the stupid thing before I finally got a screw driver and removed the battery. Of course, by the time I did that, I was no longer relaxed enough to sleep. This book light would be perfect if the switch worked. I'm really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dim","review":"Nice flexibility with the bendy neck, but changing the battery didn't make it any brighter.

Fortunately, only spent a couple of bucks on it...."},{"rating":"1","title":"flawed","review":"This book light is hard to position correctly if you are reclining reading - the light does not distribute evenly. Also it is temperamental about turning on and off- sometimes the button on top does not depress correctly and it takes multiple tries to get it to turn on or off.

Don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky","review":"I was really hoping that this item wasn't going to be so bulky, but it is. It's really only useful on hardcover books. You could use it as a clip on work light I suppose, but there are better options for that. I gave it to a friend who only buys hardcovers and he likes it a lot, but I read mostly paperbacks. In the end, I took a small and cheap LED keychain light, and fastened it to a small paper clamp to create a super bright and light reading lamp. The fact that it's leaps and bounds ahead of this light, and the fact that it cost about a buck total, I find quite humorous."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book light I've had!","review":"I purchased 2 of these book lights for a road trip from PA to FL; one for me and one for my 4 year old daughter. I've had numerous book lights and have hated most of them. This one is awesome. It holds on to anything, the head doesn't sag and the light is perfect.

It gives me plenty of light to read, without lighting the whole room and distrubing my husband while he sleeps. We have replaced the batteries once since Christmas at a cost of $4 which seems reasonble considering that we are now nearly 5 months later and I use it for a couple of hours every night. About 1/3 the price of a new light - but with many lights, the batteries are not replaceable, so I don't consider this cost excessive. We have tried several book lights and this is by far, the best that we have purchased.

These I found to be bigger and and fit more snugly in my ear (If it helps, they are blue...Walgreens sells them, but each box has less than what one of the boxes in this pair has..)The Hearos are small and they hide inside your ear (which can be a plus depending on how you use them)--being skin colored makes them almost unnoticeable unless your up close.I recommend these to anyone with noisy neighbors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"They look and feel cheep but they totally do the job.

Derleth merely took a few sentences from Lovecraft's writing journal (\\"The Common Book\\") and made stories out of them, claiming collaboration. He used the same ideas over and over again, which is why these short stories begin to humorously resemble on another after awhile (come on, how many stories can you end with a massive run on sentence in italics?). Guy inherits house, guy finds old books, guy goes nuts. Derleth never really understood Lovecraft's appeal. Interesting only if you've read most of Lovecraft's work, and Derleth has done much better mythos pastisches: check out Carroll and Graf's \\"Mask of Cthulhu\\" and \\"Trail of Cthulhu\\", both of which have Derleth's byline instead of a hoax!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible.","review":"The only reason I gave it 2 stars and not once was because there were a few moments that genuinely intrigued me scared me, but other than that, these stories are utter drivel.

The rest is written by August Derleth, Lovecraft's friend and one of those who made the master's work famous after his untimely death. Derleth is, however, not a bad writer, but can in no way be compared with the original. Most of the stories deal with the things we already know; old, infamous mansions in isolated townships, warlock ancestors, witchcraft and unnameable things in basements and attics.

Secondly, though these are clearly not quite up to the caliber of \\"real\\" Lovecraft stories, they are very enjoyable-certainly for someone who has all of the Lovecraft stuff. And last but not least, though his name is not printed as largely as Lovecraft's, it very clearly says, \\"and August Derleth\\" on the cover of the book. I'd say if you're a Lovecraft fan who has everything, this book is a fine addition to your collection. Sure, it would have been nice to have had S.T.

Sound exciting? Anyway, the \\"crowd\\" is there to see \\"Space Patrol\\", a silly movie about time travel starring Bob Clarke and Ann Robinson. We are taken back and forth between the movie and the audience watching it. This is dull to the point of agony! I kept hoping the alien monster would slaughter everyone involved!

The \\"touchscreen\\" controls might sound sleek, but it takes just one touch of the screen in the wrong place to unknowingly turn the alarm on or off. Imagine how irritating this is when discovered upon oversleeping on a workday; even more so when the opposite occurs on a weekend, and you find yourself jolted awake at an ungodly hour. And unlike traditional electric alarm clocks, there is no easy way to see that the alarm is on or off; it's visible in LCD letters, but it doesn't stand out like that familiar red dot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"So I bought it for the hype of being able to use a touch screen, but the novelty wears off real quick. It does not have a snooze button, in order to set the time you need to to through the hours and min by contently pressing the + or - button, a major pain.

We removed/reinserted the tape as the manual suggested, but that didn't help. It started out that the tracking would not hold after about 3 hours, then 2 hours, now 1 hour.

These are the same disks that worked fine on my original unit until the crash that is, and they all work fine on my Marantz 6400.

Some people are complaining about the snooze button being small. It's also right in the middle.. I don't like the snooze button, personally. If I am going to wake up, then go back to sleep, why not just set the alarm for a later time? The wake cancel button, for me, keeps me from having to remember to turn it back on at night.I didn't need a manual, because, on my model, it basically has the directions printed on the case.

Which means that someone like myself, who works a rotating schedule, must always remember to reset the alarm to a later time or else wake up at the crack of dawn on their day off.

Other than that, it is a perfect little clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the gradual awake alarm, everything else stinks.","review":"I bought this unit to replace my old one that was just...well....old. I love the gradual awake feature. This means I won't wake up the neighbors like my monster loud old one did. There are a few drawbacks to this unit. First, the numbers are so bright it lights up the entire room at night. There is no dimming feature on this unit. Secondly it is hard to tune a radio station, and when you do, it has to be adjusted the next day. Thirdly the volume adjustment goes from high to low to off. There was no way for me to play music low enough for me to fall asleep.And finally some bright engineer put the on/off button next to the snooze button. So if you reach up to hit the snooze in the morning, and accidentally hit the on/off button, you are screwed.

Finding a movie like \\"Bad Santa\\" is like finding a hen's teeth. The cast is absolutely superb. That's what happened when you put an alcoholic robber, a dwarf with a mail bride from Thailand, a chief security for the Mall that wants a cut from the robbery, a Mall manager that's afraid to be sued for being political incorrect, a bartender that has fetish for Santa, a boy that's indifferent to everything other than his Santa together. It's a movie that undoubtedly would become a cult-movie and something that would be enjoyed by someone who opts for the alternative from the \\"feel good\\" Christmas movie and a movie that would have you laughed your heads off. Be prepared to have a clean underwear ready just in case if you pee yourself! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Ticket Buyer","review":"I was not offended at all by this movie, I do not relate Santa to religion anyway. What I was offended by, is Billy Thornton's terrible acting job. Yes, he makes a believable drunk, yet he still gives a dry performance. I still admire the man, even if he, for whatever reason, decided to star in this stinker.There are several laughs here though, mostly at the expense of a short person (I don't think saying midget is politically correct)..Good for brain numbing, mindless entertainment..and nice to see the dedication at the end of the film to the late John Ritter, who plays a role in the film.

It was bad enough!!!!","review":"1st of all I rented this movie as it was supposed to be this hysterical comedy. This movie appeals only to people who like DARK COMEDIES. I chuckled about 4x during the movie. It was so depressing, boring, stupid, and just plain unfunny. And even though I like crude humor, the jokes weren't that funny. What a disapointment! Bernie Mac plays a straight man, so if you like his humor you'll be dissapointed yet again w/ this movie. If you like movies like Brazil, After hours, and war of the roses, you probably will like it, but if you want a sidespiltting, well written funny movie this one COMPLETLY misses the mark.

In addition to his particular style of twisted humor Bernie Mac only adds to the fun. Did I mention that John Ritter was in this as well? And the short guy...don't remember his name but, believe me, Thornton's sidekick in the movie also does an amazingly funny job.

As others have pointed out, many of the greatest scenes were omitted! No monologue, no beach bar, no kid training to fight......It was a major disappointment.If you love Bad Santa, do not purchase the Director's Cut. Your favorites scenes are likely missing.

Every 2 or 3 minutes has the word God d%$m or f*#k in it. Whats worse is that it is mostly around or directed towards kids. The producer or writers have stooped to a new low. People talk about pushing the envelope, but what they want to say is opening your wallets. This movie is proof that People will do anything for money.I dont know how much that fat kid was paid, but his parents should be given a ticket for allowing him to be in those foul language scenes.

STAY AWAY from this movie....","review":"Some people are offended by nudity, needless sexual scenes, violence, and profanity in movies. i am NOT one of those people. i do feel that needless sexual scenes are stupid and pointless, but i'm not offended by it. Bad Santa is not a good comedy. It is not a good drama. It is not a good romance. It's pretty much not a good anything. The commercials for this movie were quite funny. The movie, however, isn't. You'd think the idea of a santa gone bad would be hilarious, but all this movie does it take Thornton's character, and have him constantly, drink, wet his pants, get laid, act mean to kids, etc. Parts of it are mildy humorous, but overall, it's just dumb. Maybe you shouldn't consider my review, because i was so unimpressed by the movie that i turned it off around 3/4 of the way through. If you don't believe my, try it out. Maybe you'll like it more than i did."},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointing, or just plain sad","review":"My husband and I really wanted to see this movie after watching all the previews on tv.

This could have been a histerical movie, key words could have been. I found the blatant vulgarity to be completely unfunny.

I'm a big fan of B.B. Thornton and Bernie Mac - and John Ritter stole the show with his few scenes and lines - but I wondered how these fine actors really felt about the embarrassing script. I mean, I can appreciate humorous vulgarity and over-the-top potty humor as much as the next guy - or girl - but this was WAY over-the-top. I was especially uncomfortable with all the language in front of the kid. Having said that, it did have a few truly funny moments and a good message at the end, but having to put up with the disgusting parts wasn't worth it. I walked away feeling sick and depressed.

It failed. Miserably. Instead of being a dark comedy about America's most abused holiday it became an experiment in actor reliance. John Ritter pulled off a Class A straight man to Mac's well played obscene humor. Thorton played drunk, disgusting, and self-loathing better than I've seen in a long time. Even the poor fat, booger-dripping kid was well portrayed. The problem lye in the fact that none of these elements fit together in any cohesive fashion. Then to end everything was all happy. Sure Thorton got it in the end, but he learned his lesson and made nicey nice with everyone.

Bad Santa is bad because he robs department stores after casing them as Santa, all of which are shown to be managed by inept, balding men (implying, of course, that they therefore deserve to be robbed and hence, Bad Santa's just getting there first). Oh, he drinks and swears and likes women, but he's a puppy dog compared to most ne'er-do-wells in films and literature. He's the bad boy with a heart of gold and if it sounds pretty cliché, that's because it is. No surprises here.

There's too much unnecessary cussing in this movie. It's terrible!I wished the movie would have made a turn at the end and Billy becoming like a caring and christmas loving guy. But no, the film is based on violence and cuss words. There's bad acting, the plot is terrible and the jokes are flat.Wait till this one screens on tv, anything else would be wasted money!!

Bennifer created a pretty laughable film with his Reindeer Games, and this is yet another holiday stinker. It's really too bad that the poster and title both have santa in them because this means way too many children are going to see this.

All the actors, especially Billy Bob Thornton, do a great job in their roles, and Bernie Mac and John Ritter also shine in their roles as employees of the mall that 'Bad Santa' is going to rob from.

There are a few moments of fun, but it's mainly just vulgar, with most of the humor based on Santa cussing his head off at anyone crazy enough to try to talk to him. The first couple of times it's a bit amusing. After that, it's just tedious. The bartender with the Santa fetish is much the same. The first time they are shown having sex & she's crying out, \\"F*** me, Santa!!\\" over & over, it's a little funny. The second time, it's just sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Surprisingly Good Film","review":"I never really thought Bad Santa would be a film that I would enjoy, but what a surprise it was.

There really was nothing redeeming about this flick and that's what makes it so special. Willie was a rotten guy surrounded by rotten people none of whom deserve much sympathy.

First let me say this. Some people complained in their reviews about the language. They obviously failed to notice the R rating and were some how shocked that it wasn't a kiddie movie. At any rate, the language didn't bother me. It contains excessive profanity, but it just didn't impact me one way or another. The first 15 minutes of the South Park movie had more swearing in it. Anyway, this movie was just simply not funny. I never saw it in the theaters but it was getting such rave reviews and the cover contains a quote from Jeffrey Lyons of NBC calling it the funniest movie of the year. Obviously it was a bad year for movies. The movie is simply awful.

I admit the film was funny, but it also had quite a dramatic element, which puts it in the dark comedy category for me. The poor little boy in this movie even had a sad sad life.

For some strange reason the director decided to make a \\"director's cut\\" that is a neutered version of \\"badder santa\\".I bought it yesterday when it came out and the internal dialogue from Billy Bob in the first scene was missing. The celebration in the bar after the first mall \\"heist\\", where Billy Bob proclaims he's giving up drinking, was missing. The next scene where Billy Bob was stealing drinks from the bar on the beach and fights with the bartender was missing.That was enough for me. I immediately shut it off and Best Buy agreed to let me swap it for \\"Badder Santa\\" due to the false impression of a \\"longer and fuller\\" cut than it's predecessor, as is the industry standard.I was duped.

In other words, they figured a foulmouthed, drunk Santa with urinary incontinence who hates children, has sex with women that have Santa fetishes and also happens to be a thief was enough to fill two hours of film time. Nope. When you see Santa drunk and vomiting in an alley the first time, it's so jarring and unusual that, yes, it's (kind of) funny, but after two hours of the same joke with selfish, mean-spirited characters you don't like?

I had to watch parts of it over and over (the boxing scene, for one) because I was laughing so hard I was crying. People who know me are astounded that I liked it - I'm not normally a fan of the kind of humor that relies on constant repetition of the \\"f\\" word - but in this case, everything about the movie just works.Lauren Graham, familiar from The Gilmore Girls, plays a bad girl with a thing for Santas. Billy Bob is his usual down at the mouth guy who can't catch a break, and John Ritter, may he rest in peace, is hilarious as the mall manager who can't quite believe what's happening. Tony Cox, as the brains behind the Santa, is feisty and funny, and the bit where Bernie Mac demands half of the profits from the Santa scheme is priceless.Don't let the kids see it though - it's definitely an adult movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Santa indeed","review":"I have not seen \\"Badder Santa,\\" but did see \\"Bad Santa\\" in the theater. If you're one to mock everything Christmas, this is the film for you. Billy Bob Thorton is as disgusting and perverted as dress-up department store Santas come. He staggers into work dead drunk and scares the kids away with his breath, all the while muttering obscenities and, at one point, urinating through his Santa outfit. With every scene I thought that Mr. Bad Santa couldn't get much worse than this, but he did, and I laughed all the way through.

It didn't offend me for a second. It's just that this movie isn't that funny. I think the fat kid was the movies saving grace. He was a good actor, and watching Willie beat the $#!^ out of the ids who gave him a black eye is both hysterical, yet sickeningly, heartwarming. I nearly cried watching Willie crawl towards the fat kids house, clutching a pink elephant ( what the kid wanted) after being shot 3 times. It was just so incredible, to watch such a disgusting excuse for humanity use his last seeds of life, just to make a kid happy. I smiled when the kid but dumbassery behind him, and kicked that S.O.B. in the nuts.Other than this, (...)the film is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you have seen the original Bad Santa DON'T buy this.

In a downward spiral of alcohol and excess he ends up as he should. His only redeeming act was to was to start to show human caring toward a lost and lonely boy.Perhaps it would have helped if I were really drunk when viewed so then everything seems funny.

It was so bad I didn't even want it in my DVD collection so I through it in the trash. My only advise for this one is rent it before you buy it or wait a year or two and get it from a discount store bargain bin for six bucks, (it's not even worth that!)

So the guy says f*** to little kids Ha? Ha? Every joke must have gotten repeated atleast twice and they weren't funny the first time.If you think this movie is funny you obviously haven't seen Old School, Zoolander, Wayne's World, Team America: World Police, The Girl Next Door, and Harold & Kumar Go to White Castle.

I was never much on Christmas, I could really care less if Christmas even came. So what, I'm a Grinch, I know! I'm not into all them movies like Miracle on 34th Street or It's A Wonderful Life. Finally a movie that puts these movies in their place!

The movie co-stars the late John Ritter and Bernie Mac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vulgar,Foul, Rude and Wonderful","review":"Billy Bob Thorton is absolutely fantastic in this role. He has brilliantly portrayed a man who has hit bottom and kept falling. Every other word out of his mouth is an expletive. If there was any real justice in the world, he would have been nominated for an academy award. One can honestly state that this film is spectacularly and universally offensive. I loved every minute. I have rarely laughed so much and so hard at any other comedy.But what redeems this film is Thorton's character's struggle with his deeply suppressed feelings of compassion and the desire to behave honorably. That, combined with the brilliant performances by Bernie Williams ( a personal favorite ) the late, and much lamented John Ritter, the lovely Lauren Graham, Tony Cox and the always hilarious Cloris Leachman, make this film a real gem.Still, let there be no misunderstanding, this is an adult comedy. If you don't find that off putting, buy this DVD, and enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Foul Mouthed, Crude and Offensive....I loved it!","review":"Billy Bob Thornton stars as a scummy mall Santa who just does the job to stake malls that he wants to rob. He hates kids and he pretty much hates everyone else around him. He had a bad child-hood so he takes it out on everyone. When he's not Santa at the mall he's out drinking and looking for women to sack up with. Hell sometimes he even does the Santa job drunk, he doesn't care. It's interesting that script puts him with this clueless fat kid who stalks him. Their scense together can be surprisingly sweet at times even if Thornton's foul language doesn't give you enough time to think \\"aww\\". This movie is no way for everyone but if you like dark humor and lots of cursing then Bad Santa is for you. It's an anti-Christmas movie that is better than most actual Christmas movies.

But the wit and sarcasm of Thornton and his \\"little friend\\" in the movie deserves severe accolade. Not to say the film doesn't have its share of cheap laughs, but there are plenty of smarter jokes to keep it fresh.

Not so. I thought the humor would be funny in a dark way. Not so. It was just disapointing all around, mainly because of a bad script (which have characters who are all weird, and not a funny weird)... and oddly unpleasant, because of all the profanity and Santa screwing around (DEFINITELY NOT a film to show with small kids present).

Perhaps this could work out to be a nice comedy but the flood of cruelty and vulgarisms makes this a bad movie in my opinion. It is not saved by the performance of BB Thornton and Bernie Mac.

The next day I could not reproduce the problem. However, every 2-3 months the problem returns for a few days and then stops.

It moves in both axis at the same time better than anything but the Pro Thrustmaster stick they made briefly that didn't last (and wouldn't re-center) I tested sticks for TM back in the 90's and I have owned or used almost everyone of them on the market and this stick is SOLID and performs well for years.

The FOX PRO 2 SHOCK is no exception. For under $30 you get a force feedback joystick that doesn't shake your joystick so much that it causes you to crash! The handle is extremely comfortable and the buttons easy to use and program. There are only two downfalls. 1. 7 programmable buttons. In most games you need at least eight to twelve. 2. The drivers that ship with the CD ROM don't work with WIN XP. They cause your system to reboot, over and over again.

It installs on Windows XP without having to use drivers or intallation CD's, which often are a problem.

Usually he will look at toys while we shop and then put them back after a few minutes. Not this one. It made it all the way through the store and then he asked if \\"it could go home with us\\". He hasn't stopped playing with it since then. He already knows his letters, but he loves playing the game and matching up the letters. I would give it 5 stars, but the \\"mouse\\" doesn't do much besides make it repeat and the mouse game is pretty much impossible to win...I can't do it. But overall it is good for letter recognition.

I suppose if that is the definition of \\"indy\\" then, yes, this is a great indy film, completely full of itself, so full that the actors are directed to stare blankly at the camera at times and just let the viewer try to figure out what is going on. Ultimately it does become clear that the film has a lot to do with pedophilia (a great actor - Cieran Hinds - given almost nothing to do except THINK about his past actions) and dysfunction (what a waste of Ally Sheedy's talent to give her a cameo as a deranged narcissist and then forget about her). It was a waste of time, money, and most especially talent. I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the actors kept me believing that it would get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This had to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

We are not especially JayJay fans, but I was really pleased with the content of this book. It has some really neat stuff to learn about in it...not just the ABC's and 123's. Its content includes many science themes like Animals,Dinosaurs, Planets and Solar system, Landforms, Seasons and weather, as well as simply learning what goes on in the Day and Nightime or what to wear for different weather. The main story focuses on a butterfly named Breezy that is flying south. I was pleased with the different content that it provided, it was a nice change from the typical abc's. You don't have to be a JayJay fan to enjoy this one, but Science is the main theme here so if you are looking for abc's and 123's...you wont find that.

Who doesn't love outstanding dance music, especially done by as wide a gamut of perfomers as this? (Well, in fariness, it isn't strictly Italo...a litle eurobeat, some synthpop, among others...but close enough for government work.) This is music in its purest form, done solely for the purpose music was created for, to get people on the floor and *dance* like there's no tomorrow! Perfectly encapsulated, BTW, in the very first track, Disco Maniacs (by far my favorite).These are rarities, of course, so it's a bit on the expensive side, but take it from me, this is a case where it's worth it.

Most of it is very funny, particularly Charles's first encounter with David Bowie. The ending freaked me out though.

Nevertheless, the writing is brilliant and the pacing is perfect. Also, I found the historical information about Nelson fascinating. Perfect book: entertaining and informative. I will definitely seek out other books by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Depressing Read","review":"If you are suffering from some of life's tribulations at the moment, I suggest that you do not read this book. It is unrelentingly depressing. In following Cleasby and his inexorable slide from mere hero worship of Horatio Nelson to obsession and finally clinical madness, the reader is led down a very dark path indeed. If one word could be used to sum up this novel it would be: DISTURBING. The ending certainly shocked me, but on relection I realised that it shouldn't have. What happens is simply inevitable.Without a doubt Unsworth is an excellent writer. This was my first experience of him and, despite my view of this novel, his obvious talents as an author make me want to read more of his work. However, the bleakness of \\"Losing Nelson\\" made it impossible for me to enjoy and is my reasoning for giving it a two star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"not comfortable and old fashioned style","review":"This pants look like made for the 80th fashion.

Think of it as an upside-down Tetris, but with many more ingredients to it: you have to burst bubbles above you by shooting more bubbles of the same color, until you reach three bubbles of the same color side-by-side. If you're good enough, you can rip out entire blocks of bubbles with a few moves. It's already very fun to play solo, but even more fun to bring in friends and do a two-player challenge. I have to say this game and Bomber Man are starting to make me a bit of an addict to puzzle games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Chapter in the Series.","review":"I love Bust a Move. I always have and I always will. This installment has awesome, crisp graphics and goofy, super-deformed type characters. It also has a long quest mode which lets you travel through levels named after tarot cards (there is a confusing story which describes why you are doing this.) No 3-D stuff or cinemas though; they kept the 2-d, framey Neo-Geoesque \\"animation\\" in place. But who cares, the game is still awesome. The chain reactions and the ability to bounce off the ceiling are awesome additions. The stupid pulley balancing boards are annoying, the physics make no sense (ie. you add a ball to one side and sometime it goes up? ) and they aren't fun. But fortunately only a few boards are like that. It is still the best puzzle game around (though Tetris is very close). Buy this game, it's cheap and worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terry Fator is great!","review":"What a unique act! I think that Jeff Dunham is better on the comedy end, but Terry Fator is better on the amazing impersonations. They are both great. On America's Got Talent, his acts were more Rated-G, but on this video it's more like Rated-PG, with some sexual innuendo. It's fine by me, but if you saw him on America's Got Talent, you may have the impression that the DVD is all rated G and suitable for your small children. It is not, however. This act was recorded live in Vegas and contains more adult-oriented material (which Terry Fator himself did not write, but had a comedy writer). I get the feeling that Fator's comedy writer is a little more raunchy than Fator himself. It's still fairly clean, though, no dirty language. Just not a kid's gig.When will these comedy writers learn that you don't have to be raunchy to entertain????

Done in much the same style as Tony Richardson's previous film TOM JONES. This viewer prefers JOSEPH ANDREWS as a more satisfying film experience. The adaptation from book to movie works better. The performances from all the classic British actors are priceless. The dialogue, filming, editing, costumes and locations are perfectly brought to life. Special mention has to go to Ann-Margret for her performance as Lady Booby. You won't see a more controlled, flawless, hilarious performance in any other film. She is striking to watch. Not only in her beauty, but in the delivery of her lines. Her accent is totally convincing. When has an actress made eating asparagus look soooooooo enticing! JOSEPH ANDREWS is definitely one of the forgotten gems from the 70's. Mixed-up identities and bawdiness at it's best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A secret gem!","review":"Henry Fielding wrote Joseph Andrews before Tom Jones and in my opinion this is the better novel to screen adaptation.The real surprise here is Ann-Margret's stunning performance. Here she's up against some of the most established and accomplished English character actors - Sir Michael Hordern, Sir John Gielgud, Beryl Reid, Jim Dale and Peter Firth, not only does she hold her own, she steals every scene she's in.Ann-Margret as Lady Booby is genuinly funny dressed as a cherry glazed tart with the most persuasive English accent I've heard in years. The interplay between Lady Booby and her hand maiden Slipslop (played brilliantly by the late Beryl Reid) is hilarious. With a stellar cast and bawdy humour to boot, I can't think of a better way of spending a night in front of the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cracking comedy.","review":"A marvellous adaptation of the Feilding novel, with a interesting and varied cast. It is very bawdy, highly sexual and much in the style of a Shakespeare's \\"Twelth Night\\" for the confusion and naughtiness that emits from mistaken identity.A good version of the story but do follow the age guidelines as it features a lot of adult content and a fairly long scene of full frontal male nudity, in spite of the age of the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable garbage","review":"Let's not kid ourselves. This book was written by Eugenia Riley, not Fabio. If you want to learn anything about the Comanche or the tensions between whites and Native Americans, you'd do a lot better looking for it somewhere other than in the pages of a romance novel. Anyone who reads this sort of literature regularly knows the repetitive formula followed: man and woman meet, are attracted to each other but some obstacle keeps them apart. Lots of sexual tension develops, culminating in some erotic encounter. That's exactly what happens in this book. All this nonsesnse about feminism and racial identity are just window dressing. This is a book that most people are now throwing away. Really, what do you expect from a book that is selling for a PENNY? Do yourself a favor and read something better. It shouldn't be hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story of Korean adoption rings true","review":"As the parent of a boy adopted from Korea, I find this story follows ours quite closely.

I was curious to see if this book had some great answers. I feel like she touched on some interesting thoughts and ideas, but should have expounded on them. I felt she trying hard to prove a couple of things: 1. that she was very educated - some of the words she used were unnecessary, especially for teenagers who she seemed to be especially speaking to 2. That she came a long way in her own quest to find out about what God says about waiting - great, but call it that.

It never happens. It's a little objectionable to get this book from an author who admits she slept her way through college and much of grad school and has been married a grand total of 3 and a half months. She just gives us the old Pauline fear of sex in a new guise. Her world-view is basically pre-modern and pre-scientific: I agree that sex is ethically clearly meant for marriage, but she wakes up all the old neurosis-inducing crap about the evils of masturbation, immodest clothing, etc, etc. For a scholar of religion, she knows shockingly little about the Bible: she reads Genesis as literal and doesn't know the difference between letters written by St. Paul and those written in his name.

To say the least, this is not.I can't actually give an opinion on the assembled product. Mine arrived with missing parts; but even if it had arrived with all the parts, I'm not sure I would have been able to decipher the exploded assembly that they gave: AS THE ONLY INSTRUCTIONS FOR ASSEMBLY.

The bulk of the charafe is the metal black portion which is intended to keep your drink at the temperature you want for up to 8 hours. I tested it and it did indeed last 7 or 8 hours, which is longer than a similar Charafe I bought online that was non-Oggi manufactured.Overall, I still highly recommend.

I thought it was a good buy with additional Memory Stick (MS). I found out it was really a waste becuase I cannot run/read a text book from MS with an application such as Reader in internal system. I had to transfer everthing (all data: a whole textbook)from MS to internal; then, it runs. So, my point is \\"Don't get fooled with Memory Expandable.\\" What is the point of getting a memory stick which you cannot run the programs from? All you can play is with 'internal free space, 7 MB.'I called twice to get help from 1-877-760-7669, but nothing helps. It blames on low memory space.Believe me! Most of us using this product areundergrads, grads and professional students. We need more memory space (without a memory stick)..I regret that I bought it. Now I am in search of a Palm pilot........other than SONY after 2 years frustration with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"While this clié is an adorable little PDA, I was forced to return it after only three days.

The backlight was feeble. The \\"high resolution\\" display was a curse in disguise, as the default font that has characters built from lines one pixel wide made for characters so skinny that they were extremely difficult to read. Also disappointing were the weight and thickness of the unit (heavy and thick).

How to leave the table a winner. Don't read this book unless you want to win. Forget the pie in the sky other gambling writers tell you about their system. John lays it all out in a easy to read manner. A book you'll read over and over again. Great to read just before a trip to the tables."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Advanced!","review":"I have read this book several times. I have tested all of the systems in the book at great length and all have had the same results. All of the sytems and methods outlined in the book are, in the long run, losers. The best thing that can be accomplished (and not by all the systems) is that you learn how to manage your money and to leave the table if you should have a short term win.

The book, however, is his best--a must for any novice gambler. Before reading it and following his advice, I was a $200 per month loser. Since then, I've won $600 in one and one-half years. You might not like his ideas, but you must be crazy not to follow his lead on establishing narrow win goals and ABSOLUTE loss limits. My sessions have not been as \\"exciting\\" for me since--but I have no regrets. Buy the book, read the book, follow his advice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Money Management Great - Placing Money ???","review":"John Patrick does \\"not\\" believe in using the \\"come\\" option and then establishing a point. He believes that you have to wait one extra time to work the table. What he did'nt mention is that the VIG is higher on placing the bet. The 6 for instance will give you 6/5 on true odds and 7/6 on place betting. By using the come option, and then having the money move to the number, you can then establish \\"true\\" odds. By all means do take all the full odds on the come out and keep away from the sucker bets. His idea of money management is excellent. If you follow his idea of trying to leave as a winner, your success rate will increase. Except for the way he plays, I would recommend the book for his ideas on money management."},{"rating":"1","title":"So dated - It's hard to read.","review":"I am relatively new to craps.

Patrick's main thesis is that you can't win unless you take money off the table (regress). Profound! He then fills his book with example after redundant example of how to do this. Beyond that, much of what he states is just plain wrong. For example, he argues that conceding the house a small vig on more likely numbers (i.e., place betting the 6 or 8) is better than getting true odds on other less likely (roll-out) numbers.

I was glad to finally have a chance to see some of her work. For someone with such a big reputation, the cakes were very disappointing. Most of the novelty-type cakes were fairly amateurish, and all the wedding cakes have the same basic design, iced smooth and smothered with gumpaste flowers. Seems like piping is definately not her skill. I expected much better quality in the flowers for someone so well known and who commands such high prices! I know many other cake artists whose flowers are much more realistic. Also, the directions were very vague and sometimes inconsistent. This is definately more of a coffee-table type picture book than a serious cake decorating book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it!","review":"I have been a cake designer for only a few years and have many books and recipes. The recipes and instructions in this book are amazing. The cakes are rated for difficutly and the first one I tried turned out great. She gives wonderful directions for the Italian Meringue Buttercream which can sometimes be difficult to make. All of the cake recipes I have tried are perfect. She gives a good variety of different types of cakes so that you have a lot of different examples to get ideas from. She has basic tiered cakes, including the very popular gift box type cakes. She also has round cakes, and many other sculpted cakes. There are also a lot of other pictures of cakes scattered throughout the book for inspiration. She gives great directions for making gum paste flowers and marzipan fruit. If I had to pick just one cake book to keep in my collection, this would be the one, hand down. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sylvia Weinstock's cakes","review":"I was given a copy of the book as a gift from a friend in the States.

Instruction is either absolutely basic or so poorly illustrated you can't figure it out. All four recipes I tried were failures, though I am a baker of some experience. Dry cakes without flavor, and fillings so rich they were unpalatable. Any of Colette Peters' books are far better for decorating ideas and recipes, and Scott Clark Wooley's \\"Cakes by Design\\" has far superior instructions for gumpaste flowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"All about the sugar frosting","review":"This book is the same as many Wedding Cake books I find, in that it is all about the frosting -- outdated, sugary, unimaginative flavors on novelty cakes that don't have much to say for themselves except sweet, sweet sweet.

Obviously it is not million-dollar production - no early 1980's metal was (not even Mettalica's \\"Kill 'em all\\"). And it may be difficult for people to appreciate now, but at the time it was released it was an incredibly bold and assertive vision, and it truly gives an idea of the types of music that eventually formed what we now recognize as pure and classic thrash metal.

It wasn't perfect, but the ugliness and raw side of their heavy metal, in a way, opened the gate to death metal and also the second wave of black metal.

None of her recipes have ever disappointed me. I especially love this book and the 365 meal ideas. I love her for actually trying to make fans more creative cooks by giving a Master Recipe and then several spin-offs. In the preface, she actually says she wants us, her fans, to be more creative and learn more about which flavors compliment each other. Because of this and the fact that I have the pickiest eater as a husband, she's a goddess to me. Her pretzel chicken (#267 I think) is a fabulous example of being creative - who hasn't breaded chicken before? Who hasn't added this spice and that season to change the flavors? All of us. But who ever thought to use crushed pretzels as our bread crumbs? Not me for sure.

I understand the need to make a quick and tasty meal when many of today's men and women are short on time, but resorting to using store bought chicken stock or pre-grated cheese in a bag? Just because you make it in the comfort of your own home doesn't make the meal home-cooked when most of the ingredients come pre-pocessed in a box or can.

I'm a fan of Rachael's show, so I have a general idea of how her cooking works. That makes it easier to enjoy the book.It's almost become my go-to book when I'm looking for something new to make. My husband is something of a picky eater, and there are some ingredients he's turned his nose up at, but overall, we've liked the recipes, and the book makes it easy to substitute if there's something you don't like.The only thing I'm not fond of with this book is the way the alternate recipes are handled. You have to go back through the ingredient list and instructions to make sure you're not leaving anything out because the alternate recipes are only an add/drop list, along with which instructions should be changed. It would be easier if the entire recipe was printed again, but I think they didn't do it that way because it would take up too much space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, not great","review":"I bought this cookbook with no prior knowledge of Rachel Ray or her other cookbooks. The idea of 365 30-minute meals is appealing, but unfortunately, many of the recipes included take far more than 30 minutes if you include prep time. This is a useful cookbook for families as the yields are fairly large and it covers a variety of flavors. However, the flavors aren't always great; they are often combined in unappetizing mixtures that just don't work. The method of substituting ingredients to change up a dish is not terribly useful either. Most often, you will have to change half the recipe to get a new dish. The worst part, though, is the lack of a useful index. It's extremely difficult to find your way around the book. Just try looking for a \\"chicken\\" dish. If you don't know the title, chances are you won't find it fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I got this cookbook for christmas last year because I enjoy watching Rachel Ray's cooking show on TV.

I used to really like to watch her TV show but now I would switch the channel when it is on. Her earliest shows were more down-to-earth and fun to watch. Now she comes across as having an over-inflated head and she is too overly dramatic. I guess it happens when one is over-hyped. I currently enjoy watching How To Boil Water. It's fun and the recipes are simple and great to eat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SUCKS","review":"Unless you live next door to a Whole Foods market DO NOT buy this book! I only have about 30% of the ingredients on any given recipe in my pantry. Save the money on both and go out to eat."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrific door stop.","review":"this woman has nothing to back up the hype. her foods are nothing more than decent, at best, and usually far from \\"healthful\\". this book is seriously one of the least inspiring things i have ever received- and i will gladly list it on ebay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachael Ray 365: No Repeats-No Boredom","review":"As a working mother of 3 boys I loved the idea of not having to plan meals, so I gave this book a try. Turns out most of the meals are kid-friendly and easy to make. And when your kids are whining about how they don't like what's for dinner, this is a lifesaver.The best part is, after a day at work and then driving the kids around, all of these meals take under 30 minutes to prepare. And since there is an entire year's worth I don't have to worry about repeating myself. The ingredient lists make it easy to power shop when I get to the store. No more inconvenient last minute stops to pick up a missing item.All in all, I'm pleased with the quality and the quantity of the recipes. Who knew planning and cooking meals could be so easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was VERY disappointed in this book. Not only were the meals bland but the cooking instructions were not well written.... I can't even begin to say how disappointed I was and still am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...Amazing Chicken","review":"Oh Man! My sister and I made #46 last night and it was the best stuffed chicken i've ever had. Granted we had to do a little searching for the Taragon, Garlic & herb cheese and Proscuitto but it was well worth it. Since we live in an apartment complex the smell of great cooking permeated the hallways and everyone could smell how amazing this was. We picked it b/c the title sounded so appealing and we were surprised to see how easy it was to make. You just had to pound the chicken, roll it up once you've stuffed it and brown on all sides. Then you deglaze the pan and make your white wine sauce. It literaly took less than 30 minutes. We can't wait to try another recipe. Oh and i love how the cookbook is organized. It makes finding recipes so easy.I definitely recommend this book, you'll never eat the same thing twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really","review":"We prepared Brads sirloin buyers, while cooking the meat fell all over the grill, why if Rachel has made million didnt the recipe have eggs in it to prevent burgers from falling apart ?

It's like she just ran out of good ideas, but needed to create a book to fulfill her 2005 requirement. I will be donating this to the local library. I suggest that you borrow this from a friend or library before investing in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"30 minutes? No way.","review":"The meals are delicious and have been a nice difference.

I have tried several of the recipes and all were \\"yummy\\" as Rachael would say. I only paid $13.50 for the book at Amazon (on sale) and it is worth every penny. It would be a great addition to your cook book collection. Good work Rachael!I would also like to say that buying from Amazon was very easy. They set the \\"standard\\" for internet shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not all it cracked up to be","review":"I bought into the whole Rachel Ray craze and bought this book thinking the recipes would be easy and tastey and wonderful. Not so much. The vast majority of the recipes that I made my husband suffer through were fairly intricate and involved lots of ingredients. When you're both students, your part-time salaries aren't really equipped for this. Every time I tried a new recipe, dinner ended up taking at least 45 minutes longer than expected, and to be honest, it didn't taste all that great. I never thought I'd say this, but there are way too many flavors involved! I'm all about a savory dinner experience, but I'd rather savor one or two flavors well-combined than 5 or 6 that battle for your attention on your tongue. I can't wait to get rid of this book. I can definitely say I am NOT a fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Ray strikes again.........","review":"I didn't buy this cookbook for me but for my daughter as a stocking stuffer.

I have two other Rachel Ray cookbooks so figure I have enough..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Variety","review":"I have never seen Rachael Ray's TV show, but found that the recipes are pretty easy and we have been able to modify to taste. They general take 30 minutes PLUS prep time though - so they generally take 45 min to an hour for me to prepare."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much, not enough","review":"I was disappointed in this cookbook. The organization, based on \\"Master Recipes,\\" is too disjointed. There are too many recipes based on ground meat, too much chorizo, too much cumin, too much reliance on fresh herbs (which most people don't have \\"on hand,\\") too many asian-inspired dishes, too many dishes mixing sweet and savory, ie. raisin and caper sauce, I'm still trying to wrap my mind around that! Too many dishes using chicken tenders or skinless boneless chicken breasts. This cookbook only prooves my previously-held theory, that quick cooking pretty much requires expensive ingredients."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Calorie Counters","review":"I bought up this book based on the hype and I was immediately disappointed that there wasn't any nutritional breakdown per serving for the recipes. I have no idea how many calories, fat, fiber, etc. are in each recipe - something important to me since I am just about always watching my weight.In skimming through the book, she uses a lot of higher fat ingredients than I usually use which also turned me off. For a 365 day recipe book, there were very few vegetarian or fish dinners. On the plus side - she had some interesting recipes that I'll probably try, even if I have to modify to a lower fat version, but for the most part, I think this book will gather dust on my bookshelf. Sorry Rachael Ray fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's all the Ray fuss about?","review":"Honestly I can't understand what all the fuss is about Rachel Ray. Her recipes are not unique - i've found similar ones just doing a search on the internet, her writing lacks luster, and her cookbooks just don't make me want to come back again to try something else. If I were to buy another cookbook I would go with one by Nigella Lawson. Her recipes are genius but not too difficult, her writing alone is worth buying the book for, and everything I've tried in her books has worked beautifully. She's a much better bet for a good cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"This book has some really simple, delicious recipes.But most of the ones we tried just weren't that good. Another downside is that many recipes require rather esoteric ingredients that we wound up buying, use a little bit of, then throwing away when they went bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"She's 4 out of 5 - literally","review":"I've made 5 meals out of this book in the month since I received it. Four were excellent. They delivered in taste, timeliness, and appeal to the discerning diners that make up my family of picky eaters. It took slightly longer than 30 minutes to make each meal, but that extra ten minutes was usually spent prepping and chopping herbs etc. I know Ms. Ray gives the tip of pre-prepping these things right out of the grocery bag, but I'm not that organized yet!There was one meal that did not taste good - the honey nut chicken. This could be because it was the day we all caught the flu, or it could be that the honey nut corn flake crumbs didn't make a great coating, or both.All in all, I am looking forward to making more of her recipes and am quite relieved to have this book to break up the monotony of pre-packaged quick fix-its that never taste quite as good as the picture looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I like this book. I think the recipes turn out wonderful, and why not put out many books? Obviously she loves cooking and sharing her recipies with everyone.Her recipies are healthy, and that's an important contribution in and of itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"High Fat Cookbook","review":"I was given this Rachel Ray's cookbook as a Christmas gift and I am not impressed at all. Rachel Ray is not a chef. I found the recipes in this book, high in fat and without taste. My copy has been donated to Good Will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"At least twenty ingredients for each recipe! I bought this for my wife as she is not a big cook. I was looking for a simple cook book which this was not. The recipes might be good but I'm not sure we will ever get around to them. This book is the enthuses of is title! guess you need to be able to... grab all ingredients in you arms and bring them to your countertop as, she does on TV. No instructions on how on who to perfect the juggling act."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've always enjoyed watching Rachael Ray and placed her new book on my Christmas list. I keep looking at it and still cannot find anything that inspires me to head for the kitchen and I do enjoy cooking. It's too bad and had high hopes for this cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Her Show - Hate Her Book","review":"Just because you like her perky little TV show does't mean you'll like her book. The recipes are Okay BUT there are very few illustrations of the food. I'm more interested in seeing the food than simply reading page after page of recipes. This book is not easy to follow and without pictures you have no idea what you are cooking. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Go To Cookbook","review":"This is the best of Rachael Ray cookbooks. I appreciate the fact that recipes are easy and simplistic. Also they aren't time-consuming and can turn a novice into a excellent cook. However I do wish that the recipes were illustrated more so you can visually see the final results. But other than that it is an excellent cookbook for adults and kids alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally unrealistic","review":"I am an experienced cook with a family to feed. I have a large collection of cookbooks and thought this one sounded so promising. It soooo isn't!- First of all - the recipes are not organized in any way. You have to read through each recipe to find something.- Second - There are no pictures of the food.- Third - and most important to me - I couldn't find one recipe that I could cook without driving to a large supermarket 40 miles away for ingredients like: Mexican beer, chipotle powder, chorizo, portobello mushrooms, fresh herbs, fresh mint leaves, smoked gouda, sheep's milk cheese - well, you get the idea. There was not one single recipice in the entire book for which I could get the ingredients in my small-town grocery store!- Fourth - If you value your waist-line and your cholesterol level - this is not your book. Nearly every recipe calls for butter, cheese, cream or red meat - and usually lots of it!- There's just nothing right about this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought the Kindle version","review":"Typically I'm a fan of Rachael Ray. I wanted to cook my way through a year and I thought this would be perfect. The main thing I didn't like about the Kindle version was that it didn't show pictures. I really like to know what my food is supposed to look like. I also didn't care for the fact that while it clearly says \\"No Repeats\\" on the front there were so many recipes that only required you to change a meat or another simple ingredient. If you don't mind not seeing pictures or having similar meals then I would recommend this to you. Everybody has different tastes and this just wasn't for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you can't decide what to fix for dinner...","review":"this book is awesome. Although I don't care for Rachel Ray in person (something about her voice and the whole EVOO thing) she is a great cook. This book has so many ideas for so many types of settings; from cook-and-go to formal sit-down dinners. There is something for everyone. No frills, just good solid recipes and lots of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless repetitive recipes w/ same ingredients","review":"Although I love her TV show, I was unimpressed with this recipe book and quite disappointed. Most of the recipes have very similar ingredients; hot pepper, cheese and garlic. They are not \\"quick and easy\\" as I was expecting and after skimming the book, I found only 1 recipe I was willing to try. If you are looking for simple quick recipes, this in NOT the book you want. Being my son has a severe milk allergy, I cannot use most of these recipes due to the vast amount of cheese required and I am afraid eliminating the cheese will compromise the intended flavor of the dishes."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to slowly poison your family over 365 days","review":"This book is full of plagiarized and poorly reproduced recipes from Betty Croker, and let me tell you this chick is no Betty. Betty was hot..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhealthy unappetizing recipes","review":"If you want to have a heart attack by the age of 40, use this book. Almost all the recipes are filled with high-fat, high-sodium artery cloggers like cheese, bacon, hamburgers, and hotdogs. She'll try and tell you that her recipes are \\"healthful\\" but don't believe her.I do love cheese, I admit it, but I try and use it sparingly, whereas her meals are centered around cheese and fat. Furthermore, they just don't taste good! You can eat this slop at any mall food court."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just what I was looking for.","review":"It was just what I was looking for. The only thing that could make it better would be to have a DVD of her making all the recipes. Even better would be to have a picture of every recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dust collector on the bookshelf","review":"I like watching Rachel Ray on TV. I like her energy and creativity. Unfortunately, the book is awful. Seems like she put 30 min of thoughts into this books. There is no order, it takes just about 30 min to find right recipe. There is not pictures whatsoever, only piled up recipes. Hard to choose any recipe without seeing final product. This book is worthless. Anyone who wants free copy, contact me, I will be glad to get rid of mine which is new and never been used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Rachael, but wish she had less spice in recipes","review":"I love the variety and I can handle the spicey recipes, but my husband has acid reflux issues so I was hoping to find other simple recipes with less of a \\"kick\\" to them that I could make. She is good and it is full of variety."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quick dinners","review":"This is a great book however there are some recipes that I would definitely not make because I don't like salmon and some ingredients are just too spicy. I like this book but I would have preferred more traditional american or italian recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachel Ray 365:No Repeats--A Year of Deliciously Diffirent Dinners","review":"Great cookbook with easy and quick recipes for all tastes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rachel Ray 365: No Repeats","review":"I did NOT like this cookbook and I cook all the time!!!!! The ingredient list for each recipe is very long and often includes items that you can't find in every grocery store - like arugula, gruyere cheese (which was like $20 for a chunk), etc. In addition, the recipes do not take 30 minutes or less, they usually take almost 2x the time. If I was Rachel Ray and had someone to clean, chop, organize everything for me, then maybe I could do these recipes in 30 minutes or less. Finally, the finished recipes are okay - maybe a 6 or 7 out of 10, but not incredible. So my final review is that for the time, effort, and expense involved in these recipes, it's not worth it. I wish I could return this cookbook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical","review":"To me this book isn't practical. Many of the ingredients are not in local grocery stores and the recipes aren't that quick and easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, Rachel...","review":"I bought this book with great anticipation; however, after making several recipes, I am very dissapointed. Many dishes I've tried have absolutely NO FLAVOR at all. If you like dinners from the 1950's, you may like this; but for experienced cooks with sophisticated palates, this is not worth buying. The fact that there are 170 of these used books for sale should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed!!!! .... So few Photos!!!","review":"Very disappointed!!!!!!!!!!!!!! When I cook, I want to see a photograph of the food along with the recipe. This book, had 365 recipes, but about 10 photos .... I will be regifting this ... to someone that I will never see again!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New Rachel Ray fan!","review":"I have watched her shows every now and then, finally decided to give this book a try. First off, I am amazed at the number of recipes in this book. Unbelievable variety for all occasions. I cannot even image how she must have spent to much time trying these and putting them down in the book. Highly recommended for all who love to cook!"},{"rating":"1","title":"30 minutes?","review":"I was really disappointed by this book. I like Rachael Ray and her 30 minute meals cooking show. Although on her show even I feel like a lot of her meals are shortened by pre prepared ingredients (pre cut, washed ready to go). It isn't that her food doesn't taste good but I want something that truly takes as little time as possible, as little cleanup and is inexpensive to purchase the ingredients. If you open this book you will quickly see that just the list of ingredients needed for each recipe is daunting to say the least. I love to cook and its one thing I can honestly say I'm really good at but I can come up with faster recipes that are just as good, with half the ingredient and no I do not use pre made ingredients and rarely pre prepared stuff except for things like already shredded cheese. I also really dislike the lack of pictures as well. It's fun and more appealing to see what you are going to cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummo","review":"I love this book. I get sick of making the same foods again and again and this helps break the monotiny of everyday cooking. She has some fantastic recipes here and I enjoyed making the ones I've made so far. This will keep me interested for weeks on end (not 365 days though - cause I do enjoy eating out at times). If you are bored with the way you do things in the kitchen now, get this and it will change your way of thinking and cooking - and you'll get some positive feedback from family and friends. This is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated - unrealistic","review":"I like Rachael Ray on TV so I bought this book to add some pizazz to our dinners. Well, they're too exotic, too ingredient ladened to get me cookin'. And to top it off, the first (one & only) recipe I tried had you toast some hazelnuts & then doesn't tell you where to use them! Incomplete directions. I would NOT buy this book again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great title, mediocre recipes","review":"Lured by the promise of so many meals, I bought this book, which is, I admit, nicely produced though weak on real substance. Some good or very good recipes, but many others that are so familiar you don't need to write them down or others that no one would really cook. In the end I simply selected 7-8 recipes to ty.

The recipes are not located in easy to find sections, such as burgers, salads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This is a cookbook for novice chefs, and those who are not used to cooking dinner on a regular basis. It has some good ideas, but most I have had to modify. If you are experienced at all in the kitchen, you will recognize that there are no creative or new ideas here, just take offs on the usual dinner ideas. In addition, there are too many ingredients for such simple recipes. There are many other cookbooks out right now with simple and more sophisticated easy menu ideas. I have donated my copy of this book to good will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delish","review":"The book is great...already familiar with her stuff...Half the battle is having the necessary ingredients on hand...her recipes are pretty basic...I look forward to trying some new stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a typical family recipe book","review":"This book is not for your everyday family. The recipes often require costly ingrediants that most families can not afford. Great book for special occassions, however the 365 days a year would significantly increase your grocery bill well above the average families budget. Swordfish isn't always found at your local grocery store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rachael Ray 365","review":"Also consider MY MOTHER'S COOKBOOK, a fascinating, delightful and beautifully presented 456 page master cookbook. Truly a work of art.

Intriguing, spellbinding and just plain scrumptious, this cookbook is a 'must have.' Often given as a gift (with great feedback). Creates high interest among my club members and friends.

Here is a list of what I liked and disliked about the book:Likes:1. Variery of recipes (although I do wish it had a few more vegetarian options).2. Everything I have made so far (10 recipes or so) tasted GREAT.Dislikes:1. My biggest diappointment is that the recipes are far from healthy. Every recipe I tried included A LOT of butter, and chicken or fish was always to be breaded. I am definitely not a healthy food snob, but there were several instances where I thought the recipe would have been just as good without 6 Tbsp of butter (and I did alter the recipes myself to make them healthier).2. All of the recipes I have tried so far have taken longer than 30 minutes (ranging from 40 to 60 or so), although I have to admit that I am not a very fast cook.3. The book would have been ideal as a spiral-bound publication. Since there are 365 recipes, the book is very thick and impossible to keep open while you are cooking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new unless you don't cook at all.","review":"Another throw it together and call it a recipe book from the diva of out-of- the-can cuisine. Simple, fast and tasty can also be healthy, fresh and easy. None of her recipes are. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected from Rachael Ray","review":"I was disappointed in the types of recipes in this book. Most of the recipes are for foods that are a lot more spicy than I like. These are easy to prepare foods, but I saw litttle that appealed to me. There are a lot of dishes that use ingredients like salsa, tacos, and cilantro - definitely not favorites in this house. In the whole book I found no more than five or six recipes I plan to try. I love Rachael and hope to find another of her cookbooks that may have foods that appeal more to my palate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety","review":"My wife and I like to cook, and Rachael Ray is easy to follow, doesn't require a culinary degree, and recipes are simple & taste great.Food, music, movies, cars, etc. are a matter of personal preference...you like what you like, and it may not be what others care for - but what matters is what you like.

I bought it originally to make hand felted flowers for my hats like the lily on the front cover. Alot of the projects I couldn't imagine anyone wearing (unless they say their child made it in kindergarten for Mother's Day like the mustard coloured, felted stone necklace - yaba daba doo!). Alot of the projects centre on having a glass lampwork bead on one end of a felt rope and then copying that bead on the other end in felted wool - it just looks stupid to me. The photos of other people's projects at the end have a couple of good ideas but that's about it. If making big, chunky lariats and necklaces with seed beads scattered over them is your thing then go for it - but quite honestly the clash of textures and scale just don't sit well with my eye."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design,","review":"The doll is awsome because she talks to your child and responses to her but the mouth on our doll started peeling off after the first day we had her because of the feeding her.and she keeps saying please same my name amanda.

Jeffrey Dooley, a noted countertenor whose repertoire includes the works of Handel and Purcell, composers whose music responds to countertenors with excellent effect, renders a performance here that sounds like it was recorded inside a box, resulting in a high-pitched echo that hurt my ears and made it difficult to follow the lyrics of the songs. I gave this recording two stars because the instrumentals are quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, It Does Not Work","review":"It is actually kind of shocking. It sounds like a parody of an operatic singer.

These movies are insulting to anyone who knows the real truth. Should anyone ever make a movie that ACCURATELY depicts the real story of the Matamoros Cult Killings, it would be far scarier than ANY so called horror movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously? Voodoo?","review":"Ok, the members of the Matamoros cult did not practice voodoo, or any Afro-Caribbean religion. This point was made several times by the media after the trial, including in an article in US News & World Report. What the cult did practice was a made up religion heavily influenced by fictional horror movies about what the media perceives as voodoo, so way to perpetuate the cycle there, Schulze.\\"The power of voodoo is the power to live without conscious, totally beyond the bounds of normal human sanity\\"? Seriously? It sounds like something a teenager sitting around a campfire with a flashlight under his face would say.Also, Cauldron of Blood? Great title. Way to sensationalize a horrible tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great eclectic collection","review":"For fans of the best song ever, this has some fantastic recordings of Richard Berry's classic three-chord song. This also includes a version done by Richard Berry himself, which is not the original recording (as the other reviewer has posted) but rather a carefully crafted re-recording, attempting to sound as close to the original as possible. This was due to a dispute between Mr. Berry and the owner of the original recording. Having heard both, the differences are minimal however, and Rhino did an excellent job of capturing the original sound and feel.There are some really rockin' versions of the song (I really like the Sonics') and just a bit of novelty, particularly the \\"Hallelouie Chorus.\\" OK, it's a little funny, but loses its charm on the 4th or 5th listen.Make sure to look up volume 2 of Louie Louie, another excellent compendium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maximum Louie Louie!","review":"One sign of a great song is that it can be successfully performed by different performers in wildly divergent styles. This collection demonstrates that Louie Louie is one such song. Take what I think are the three best versions on this collection: the Sonics, the Sandpipers, and Black Flag. First, the Sonics version is pure, rough garage rock, which sounds as fresh now as it did in 1967, when the song first appeared on the album The Sonics Boom. Next, the beautiful a capella version by the Sandpipers -- in Spanish! -- makes the song sound like a lullabye. Finally, the song sounds amazing as hard core punk by Black Flag. These versions alone make this collection worth owning, but all the others are great as well.If Louie Louie is one of your favorite songs, OR if you consider yourself a music fan, you should pick this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ultimate rip-off, no wonder it's out-of-print","review":"It's unusual for Rhino to offer such a meager amount of music. At 23:46 it's the worst value I've ever seen. Also, the liner notes trace the history of Louie, Louie but never mention any of the versions on the CD--no recording dates or anything.\\"Love That Louie\\" has 24 songs and is still in-print. It also includes much better versions of the song such as that done by Toots & The Maytals and The Raiders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst CD ever","review":"Limp Bizkit is the worst band ever, and this is their worst CD to date. I HATE Limp Bizkit. Their music is SO ANNOYING! Fred Durst has the most irratating voice I've ever heard. He doesn't sing any of the lyrics, all he can do is grunt into the microphone like some deranged ape! No talent whatsoever. Sorry LIMP BIZKIT fans, it takes more than baggy wigger clothes and downtuned guitars to make a good song. It takes a little thing called MUSICAL TALENT. Limp Bizkit has none of that.

Tell me this Fred, why is cherry pie randomly thrown into one of your songs? Is it symbolic of my angst? Also I have noticed you use \\"fairies\\" sooo much. Please guys don't buy this, it is horrible, they couldn't even come up with enough material for a full CD and yet they are selling it for the same price as a full CD.

This is no different, with basically every track being excellent!!! My favorites are the Truth, the Propaganda, and the Story. Even my least favorite song on the CD is awesome!!! My least favorite is the Surrender, but one thing that is cool about it is guess who is playing the guitar in it. You guessed it Fred Durst!!! This CD is great with every song being about as cool as the last one!!!! Every song on this CD rocks and has something special to offer. The only reason people don't like this is because it is by Limp Bizkit and it has for some reason (I don't get) become cool to hate them.

When my friend told me it was Limp Bizkit, I was shocked for many reasons. 1) I couldn't even recognize Fred's voice on the album (I am a bizkit fan) 2) it sounded like a knock off of Rage Against the Machine 3) it was only half an album and 4) it sounded absolutley nothing like Bizkit.

Horrible..","review":"Ok.. I've actually listened to this album and I have to ask.. what were they thinking? Limp Bizkit was never politically active and coming from them anything that might seem remotely in that direction would seem like an action that only was made based on which way the wind was blowing.I'll have to say that I loved \\"3 dollar bill\\" and that was their high time. Some of significant other was ok, but they started trying hard to be cool rather than doing what they were good at, which WAS music. After hearing this, being a fan of the older material.. I'll have to say the painful truth that I hear local rock shows that sound more in tune and more together than Limp Bizkit does. This is God Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sorry, not what i expected!!!","review":"yep, listed to this cd and was very disappointed...i was hoping more on the lines of 3db, but i was wrong...the vocals are more like a mellow R.A.T.M meets a dictionary...the lyrics and choice of words suck...maybe if fred added some screaming to it, i would enjoy it better...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really not what it use to be","review":"I was really disappointed by these 7 songs.

The music sounds like RATM's, save the Morello solos, and Durst seems to do a sub-par impression of De La Rocha, both in voice sound and lyrics (like I said, sub-par).

Nope, they've come up with more terrible material, and yes, I actually listened to the material. It make me vomit in rage. 7 songs. 7 worthless songs starting with the word \\"The\\".

Great hooks, a lot of melody and while Fred is not the greatest singer, I thought he was very good on Results may vary. So when I heard Wes was back and a new cd was coming out I was psyched. What a huge dissapointment!! I'm actually glad the torture only lasted a half hour. While their were some cool riffs, the melodies were completely gone and Fred was only doing what I call his \\"yodel rap\\" and poorly. If this is how they hope to last in the music scene today, say goodbye. It reminds me of how lousy it was to hear St. Anger after waiting so long for a new Metallica.

He needs to rap a lot less and keep his voice toned down. Also his lyrics are garbage. That being said, Wes really has some good riffs on this album. \\"The Truth\\" sounds like Wes is channeling Tom Morello and I can't help thinking while I hear that song that it would be so awesome with Zach from RATM on vocals. The bass and drum work is fine and it seems the DJ has been pushed to the background more which is wrong. Incubus had it right on \\"Make Yourself\\" the DJ is a great tool for adding background bits and some things that cant be done on instruments, but he should never be a focal point. \\"Propaganda\\" is another good RATM type ripoff track. Wes really does a good job on this song of keeping it funky, but heavy.This cd would be a 3-4 star affair if they had different vocals with different lyrics. Dump Fred, find De La Rocha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavier EP","review":"Let it be said that this album does not qualify as a full-length release...with 7 tracks totalling a mere 29:44, this is really more of an EP, but shows a heavier side of LB not really seen since their debut, 'Three Dollar Bill Y'All'...taken as an EP, this album does boast some strong songs, 'The Truth' is a furious rocker with the music and Fred's vocals greatly channelling Rage Against The Machine...but that being said, Wes's return does seem to have been for the better musically, as this is some of the strongest material the group has ever written, and the songs showcased here bodes well for future releases"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unquestionable Garbage","review":"Please don't make the same mistake i did and waiste your money on this cd.

Fred couldn't write good lyrics if his life depended on it. I used to be a huge fan before Faith even came out and i though Limp had a lot of potential. Unfortunately it is never going to happen again. I read other peoples reviews on here before purchasing and heard comparisons to tool, 311 and rage.

Everything ablout this ablum is a joke, the riffs, the beats, and especially Freds, angsty, whiny and annoying vocals are the worst in recent music history. Another thing about this album is it's more or less a total rip off Rage (who suck as well). Everything about it, the lyrics, music (no solos, something Rage had), and even the cover art.In the end it comes down to this, Nu Metal/Rap Rock is dead, and has been for four years now.

I lost most of my respect for Limp Bizkit when Fred Durst became a rapper. This album sealed the deal. I picked it up just out of curiosity, and i've never been more disapointed by a cd. Look for this one in the used bin at CD Warehouse.

And forever will be !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money On This One!","review":"What a bunch of crap! Limp Bizkit is a talented band, hindered by Fred Durst's lack of vocal ability. This group is a sinking ship, with Fred Durst as their anchor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sellout","review":"I liked \\"Chocolate Starfish..\\" which was in fact a very good record worth listening and it did succeed well too. But since then God know what happened to LB. In Unquestionable Truth (pt.1) Fred's singing and 'rapping' not only sucks but his voice got more whiney. The lyrics are dumber then any other mainstream hiphop crap that's played on the mainstream and despite sucky efforts in the name of 'music' it somehow sells millions of copies thanks to the retarded audience population.If you really like music then listen to some heavier stuff. Even if you find the vocals of a metal/hardcore band difficult to understand, read the lyrics which are at least meaningful and something you can relate to.Limb Bizkit's days are over. It's time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"FRED DURST......GET OUT OF HERE!!!","review":"I have never been a limp bizkit fan and i never will be. I heard that Fred Durst had became a much better singer & writer. Mayeb that's true but he's still not good enough to make a half-decent album. The reviews on this album said he'd become mature and i think he is very VERY immature. The song titles even have you tricked like it's gonna be an interesting album but no, the songs are all stupid except Surrender is only slightly interesting. This is one of the worst bands i have ever heard and i'm sorry for ever supporting them. They suck worse than any other album i have ever hear and i'm not joking. Fred Durst is a terrible singer and his songs seem like they were written by an angry 3rd grader."},{"rating":"2","title":"gotten it back","review":"well, with there first 3 albums, they put limp bizkit ont he charts, readying up there fans, making honest music. but then, the worst happened, results may vary came into the picture, and totally made them into the most hated band of all time.but then they put out htis piece of work. they added guitar solos and catcy rifts. they made it hard and heavy. the bizkit empire came around. they are back, heavier then ever.now, the title song, the truth, is awesome. they added a huge solo int he begining of the song. they made it heavy. they put there 4 most best songs on the front of the cd then gradullay decreased fromt here.i like this album, but am displeased about its lengh and the 1 minit song.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful","review":"What a waste of cash. I do not hate Limp Bizkit, I used to be fan. I was out buying the new NIN cd and saw this and thought that they might go back to the tried and true sound, but the cd sounds half-(...). At least their old stuff was good old angry, stupid rock. What the hell is this junk suppossed to be? Kind of makes you wonder if their contract included just one more album. What a waste of a cd. I just hope that there will not be a part 2. It's one thing to waste money on a steaming pile of (...), but it at least better be the full pile of (...) and not part one of more (...). Do not buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it ain't as bad as you think","review":"seriously. bash on fred's vocals all you want. actually i will. the vocals/lyrics are the only reason this gets four stars instead of five. the music is absof*ckinglutely amazing. wes, sam, and john all get back to their \\"three dollar bill y'all$\\" roots and bash out some truly rocking rhythms. the heaviest songs are \\"the truth\\" and \\"the story\\". i think the cd could've done without \\"the key\\", but it's got a good beat to it, so i dig it. also after building up so much energy, a soft track like \\"the surrender\\" kinda deflates the disc. but 5 out of the 7 tracks rock harder than anything they've done before (with the exception of a couple songs off of \\"three dollar bill y'all$\\"). i told myself that with wes back in the band, it was gonna be something to get. and this is. go buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply put, it SUCKS!!!","review":"I didn't even know they released another album until it popped up on my launch cast station on yahoo. I feel like I've been let down. I mean, the last few LP's they have released have been hot!!! It seems like they fumbled the ball on the 2 yard line with this one. The beats are whack and I found myself getting bored listening to it.

This is actually a very good CD.Raw,gritty,kinda reminds me of old RATM,someone made this comment as well.Great buy for the money.Welcome back Wes,some heavy,angry riffs on here.I think this band is moving in the right direction.Whether this cd sells platinum,gold or 50,000 copies,I think it is good strong material from Limp Bizkit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Strong Effort....","review":"Indeed, this cd is a pleasant surprise. This album is only 29 minutes long, but as another reviewer suggested, Durst is best in small doses.As for the band, they definitely benefit from the return of Wes Borland. In fact, I believe this album contains some of Limps strongest guitar hooks to date (if you don't believe me, check out \\"The Truth\\").As for the vocals, Fred Durst definitely steals a page from Zach's (Rage Against the Machine) book. Although, I like Fred's approach because he doesn't whine about the oppressive government system and then suggest oppressive communist-socialism as the answer like Zach does.In conclusion, check this EP out. I think you'll be surprised at how much you'll like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bizkit's finest?","review":"I don't normally give any album 5 stars - but I felt so strongly about this album, I felt it deserved this score. I have been a casual fan of Limp bizkit, and would rate their stuff before this as average/in the boundary of excellent. But they have perfected their formula this time, and I love their new, darker, sound. Thanks to a change in directiona nd Wes' return, Limp Bizkit is finally back on the rails again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY.","review":"This album is about as good as passing a kidney stone the size of a basketball.

I thought I was a new Limp Bizkit fan. I loved every song on the CD. Fred Durst sang well and the melodies were extremely creative and addicting. The guitar was amazing and the unique time changes really amazed me. As a newly found Limp fan, I bought this new EP at first sight. Well, I totally wasted my money. I can't even begin to describe how dissapointed I am in this latest release. Wes Borland is back with the band and his riffs sound so choppy and disorganized. No more melodic tones, no more singing. Fred Durst just raps his way through all the crazy out of place guitar. It sounds like they have this Rage Against the Machine influence, and it's so out of place for Limp. This album stinks...soooo bad. I'm either selling it to a used CD store, burning it, or trashing it...just as long as I don't have to listen to it or see it again. I'm officially an ex-Limp fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Effort","review":"This was supposed to be the album of retribution for this band. Wes is back, Fred says they have a better sense of direction, and what we get are seven songs that all sound mangled and jumbled. Fred's lack of abilities as a lyricist are reflected even more in this. The guitar of Wes is an improvement over 'Results May Vary,' but it is nowhere near good enough to make this a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy this album!!","review":"After listening to this album, I woundered if it took more than a day to write. The last 5 Limp Bizkit albums have been good rock/rap records with quailty music and great musical ideas. This new album is nothing but mindless dribble. The cover art, and the idea of the first track, are total rip-offs of Green Days's success of \\"American Idiot.\\" I mean Fred has never voiced a politcial view until now.. come on bad, get your on ideas.. instead of your ripping off your peers. And the music of the rest of the album sounds like a bad Rage Against the Machine cover-band trying to write their own music. I say pass on this one and wiat for the next album, which by record sales, will show the band to go back to the orginal formula, which worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Click No On this Review","review":"I hate doing this because i have loved Limp Bizkit for so long. Their old CDs like Significant Other and Chocolate Starfish were as good as it gets, fans. If you haven't heard this CD and you are convinced that it will be good so you plan on clicking no on this review....don't. You will regret it as soon as you hear this CD. There is one good song but even that isn't very good. The song titles make it sound so strange and cool at the same time but they are really worthless. The lyrics are very (and i mean very) bad.Fred Durst used to be so much better at singing, rapping and writing but it is so bad on here that i could barely stand through it. I listened to all 29 minutes of it though just so i knew the \\"unquestionable truth\\" about this CD. That is, the lyrics seem like they were written by someone who is very immature. If you are a real Limp Bizkit fan you'll get this but just beware for the worst songs you'll hear in your life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Euthanize this stale Bizkit","review":"Here are the facts:1. Rap-rock died about 4 years ago2. $12.99 for a 30 minute record? This is an over-priced EP.3. Wes is back! But wait, he's ripping off Tom Morello's riffs!4. Fred is now preaching to us on politics and religion?5. Still has yet to top 100,00 copies sold. Not even thedie hards care anymore.6. No video, no single, no tour, etc. WTF?7. Fred is still the worst rapper/singer in recorded history.These guys are about 5 years past their expiration date.The time to throw in the towel came a long time ago, Fred. Stop embarassing yourself and the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"not fooling anyone","review":"It's nice that all those 15 year olds that Fred Durst used to target six years ago are all grown up.

Terrible, terrible, terrible. Fred Durst flexes like a Rage member without the vocabulary. When will he learn that he just can't write lyrics. This is revolution Urban Outfitter-style, yet not cool enough to get played in one of their stores. Painful to listen to. Forgotten in a week. He should have just stuck to what he knew - repetition of references to himself, his band (\\"we're Limp Bizkit\\") and oh yes---the nookie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Unquestionable truth is unquestionably awful.","review":"This album is so bad and this band is truly dreadful, and this album goes on my list of the worst albums of the year, I Thought every single song is terrible and to compare this piece of junk to Nine inch nails is ridiculous.There's nothing even good about this album, just nothing.and fred durst is just like 50 Cent a big fat joke.Give It up Limp Bizkit and the rest of the whole entire nu metal/rap metal/rap rock scene, you'll time is over.Limp Bizkit and this album is so bad, they make bon jovi look like shakespeareA Big Thumbs Down for me on this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA","review":"Does this man understand that he is THE worst musician mainstream music has seen to date? He can't even TRY to do hardcore right. I never heard any breakdowns, pretty much the most simple aspect of hardcore. Limp Bizkit and Fred Durst, suck now and always have. All of the songs sound the same, and there is no intricacy to any of his music in the least bit. Yet I see various comparisons to Rage Against The Machine and Nine Inch Nails, two bands who are actually genius. It is pathetic that any record company would even give this guy a contract. It is obvious that he either can't make real music, or he can't stand losing all of his pre-pubecent fans and going to some sort of real genre. either way, he isn't making as much money as he used to. This is a pathetic excuse for a cd and an band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Limp Bizkit Finds Themselves With surprising energy","review":"If your a Limp bizkit fan then you probably can tell that the unquestionable truth part one is a completley different album compared to three dollar bill y'all and significant other and... well... just about anything most of us has ever herd before. The CD has only seven tracks on it, but man there works of art. Fred Durst has completely grown up since his days of the nookie and my generation. not that I didn't like those days, but change never hurt nobody. This CD is a great break from the Rap that seams to have overrun the media and radio. The Best Song on the whole album is definitly The Truth. 8.5 stars out of 10. however you look at it, this isnt the end of Limp Bizkit. Whether y'all like it or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"What on earth happened?!","review":"I'll tell you what happened! Wes Borland decided to rejoin the band, they kick the other guy out and they churn out whatever rubbish they could in as little time as possible. After the slight drop in quality of 'Results May Vary', Limp Bizkit could have gone up or down really. Sadly, I think we've heared it all and this album seems to be the flop for the bad boys. Take this review as a warning - if you must hear this album, borrow it from someone whos already made the mistake of buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gid Rid of Durst!","review":"After listening to this so-called album I have figured out what needs to happen, the guys in Limp Bizkit need to kick Durst out of his own band. Either that or pull an Alter Bridge and leave Durst and find a real metal vocalist. Musically this cd rocks harder than any of the other crap they've released, but it's RUINED by Durst's whiney rap vocals.With a good singer this band would be killer, but with Durst it sounds really pathetic.Will give props to \\"The Truth\\", even Durst couldn't ruin this smokin' track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp Bizkit is over","review":"This cd was released with no promotion (none that Ive seen) and its been out for almost a month. This is should tell Limp that fans are over there music, getting Wes back doesnt mean anything. Durst is now a joke, and if he gets a reailty serious-well that'll never happen. Just like the second part to this cd shouldnt happen. But then again, who would know considering no one knew this album was released."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DEFINATE SKIPPER!!!!!","review":"LIMP BIZKIT have gone Limp!

Sill others are percussion driven like Little Liza Jane and Meet De Boys On The Battlefront. And of course there are plenty of great brass and keyboard arrangements to keep any jazz fan happy.Whereas many of these artists were not legends in the annals of music history, their contributions to this disc are certainly very good.

Like all Charles Dickens' novels it features some great, memorable characters. The setting of the industrial city of Coketown is vividly described as a miserable, polluted town. There are some strong themes of class struggles between the working men in the factories and the harsh upper classes who seek to exploit them. Nearly all of the upper class characters are depicted in a negative light while the real heroes of the story are from the working class. As always, Dickens finds an entertaining way to shine a bright light on the social problems of Victorian-era England. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it. However, if you are choosing your first introduction to Charles Dickens, then you should pick one of his better-known novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic book!","review":"Awesome book and exactly as described.

Are we not concerned about those with rigid beliefs that defy understanding and who reject any attempt to reason? That would be the characters of Gradgrind and Bounderby. Do we not sympathize with workers subjected to inhumane conditions, miners, factory workers, particularly in foreign countries? That would be the workers in Coketown, Dickens' fictional setting for this novel. Labor vs. management, education as facts forced into children, love thwarted, parents who misunderstand children, people who spy on others, people stuck in their unfortunate circumstances, bad marriages, these are all interesting themes explored in this book, one of Dickens shorter novels. Give it a chance beyond the first 20 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"I had never listened to Kate Rusby but I knew that this album had been very favorably received.

So much retread grist from the mill about Elvis; very atypical portrait filled with more tales from the toilet and drug induced dimentia.

A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic story!","review":"Nash's research, which spanned six years (not eight, asone misinformed reviewer here says, but he was wrong about a LOT of things), is deep and extensive, and certainly goes far beyond tabloid sensibility. She gives very little space to Presley's digestive troubles,and only in the sense that his manager should have been acutely aware of his physical decline and helped restore him to health. THE COLONEL has been widely praised, even by members of Parker's family both in America and in Holland.

His portfolios speak volumes about his expertise as they are all massively red and hidden from public view.

However, while it was stil under warranty, it started printing purple instead of red, and then a little later no black ink was being printed at all. Well, turns out the problem was the \\"printer head\\". Notice that the printer uses printer head model BC-21e and compare it's price to the printer itself. Conclusion: this printer is worth about ...(at the time of this review). Hopefully some company will read this and make a generic printer head of Canon printers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great For Printing Text -","review":"Although I don't suggest it for photos, or graphics. I went from the old canon 240 to the canon 2100 when the old one gave up on me. I was told by sales that this printer would not be the best photo printer - but that they would turn out better.When I tried to print photos they came out almost as bad as the 240. Thinking I had probably messed up, I took it back and made the tech guy try it - needless to say, I left the printer at the store.-! If your trying to print nothing but text, this printer is fast, and will get the job done. I noticed it printed text fast and it looked ok. Just don't do logo's, photos, and small graphics... :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Print heads fail very quickly!","review":"The BJC 2100 uses an ink cartridge (part BC-21e) which contains the print heads, and also holds the ink tanks. According to Canon's web site, the BC-21e is supposed to last for 4000 pages, or 20 ink tank replacements. Before you buy this printer, do yourself a favor, and see user comments for the BC-21e replacement cartridge. Mine failed after about 250 pages and while it was only on the 2nd ink tank! Several others report replacing between 3-5 tanks. The cost is about $50, which approximately equals the purchase price with the mail-in rebate! Have had no trouble with Epson printers, but would not buy another Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great printer for the price","review":"I am a college student and I have a laptop computer. I wanted an inexpensive printer but had good quality. Since I write many papers I needed one that had cheap cartridges that lasted fairly long. For around $50 with the rebate it is truly worth it. I have a HP inkjet printer at home and the difference in quality is negligible. I noticed the negative reviews by others but this isn't a laser printer and what do they expect for $50? The color quality isn't that bad either. Compared to HP printers the refill for the black cartridge is around $9-10. You can even find them cheaper on the Internet or if you buy several bundled together."},{"rating":"1","title":"BJC-2100 dies young","review":"I bought a Canon BJC-2100. For a while, it worked well. On my recommendation, my sister and my next-door neighbor also bought one each.All three printers died within four months--a 100% failure rate. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BJC-21xx, and the Print Head problem.","review":"First off, the 21xx series, of which I own the 2100 and 2130 are excellent printers for the money. The 2100 replaced my old BJC-600E, and the 2130 is now serving our downstairs computers.Now to the reason I rate it 4 stars instead of five, and the fix for that problem.The print ink dries up and clogs the print head, and you have to clean it. Fortunately, it isn't really that hard.Take about 2 cups of very warm to hot water (not boiling hot, but hot) and put it into a bowl.Drop the print head in, swish it around a few times, and let it sit for a while to allow the hot water to dissolve the dried on ink in the print head.You may have to do this a few times to get rid of all of the dried on ink (you'll see colors bleeding out of the intakes), but it DOES work, and has kept my printers in good condition (no streaks, prints all colors w/o clogs) for the last two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"This was a great buy. I received the printer and it wouldn't print. I called Canon. They said I need to replace the ink cartridges.

Unfortunately, that didn't last long...First, the quality suddenly went down hill...not that it was that great to start!

I have had nothing but trouble with this printer, and have owned it for approx 2 years. When I first got the printer, it was great, worked for about 3 months. Then had to replace the black ink. I have gone through 5 black ink cartridges,and one colored cartridge. and I do not do alot of printing. The jets are constantly clogged. I have replaced the entire electronic cartridge 3 times now. I now cannot get black ink to come out, and the colored, is a bit to be desired. I have contactedCanon, with absolutely no luck, their customer service is a bit to be desired. I'm sending this printer into outer space, and am now looking for a new one. I find these customer reviews very helpful in making my decisions, and have narrowed my selection down, due to these customer reviews. I recommend this printer to nobody, unless you want to use it as a plant container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't be any worse","review":"I'll never buy another Canon printer again. I recieved this useless pile of junk as a wedding gift. It refused to print. At all. No test sheets, nothing.So I PAID to call their inane tech support to fix THEIR problem. Spent an hour on the phone. The result? I get a \\"factory refurbished\\" printer in exchange for my new one. As I expected, the factory refurbished unit failed shortly after the 90 day warranty expired. At least I didn't pay for this piece of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon BJC-2100 is a bad buy.","review":"I would definately not purchase this printer again if I had the choice. It broke within one month of the inadequate 90 day warranty expiring. Furthermore, Canon makes no pretenses of producing a quality product. Their personnel were less than sympathetic or helpful. Canon's technical assistance line is about as expensive as a 1-900 number. They DO charge you buy the minute to talk to people who barely have a high school education. Overall, a VERY bad experience with a company which is churning out inferior goods. There is a reason Canon sells their equipment so cheap!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Printers- Bad Service","review":"I have a BJC-3000 that has worked fine for 6 months and out of the blue has started jamming. I have had similar problems with the other BJC models.I called Canon and they first wanted me to include a copy of the receipt, so if you ever want service, save your receipt.The waranty on these printers is \\"select exchange\\" and not an advance exchange. They will not send you the replacement printer first, unlike other manufacturers, you have to box up your printer, send it to them and they will send you a refurbished printer. The whole process takes 3 days if you overnight the printer to them. So, if you need a printer quickly, drop your Canon in the trash and go buy an HP or Lexmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Bought brand new out of the box, locking lever was broken , fell into printer when first set up, unit hopelessly broken,returned to seller for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"for what its price its a good deal","review":"The text printing is of good quality.

GREAT BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IN DEFENSE OF THE CANON BJC 2100","review":"I recently moved my 2100 to the office and began the search for another one. No machine is without fault. However, I found the 2100 easy to operate and easier to fix. I am a bookkeeper and print constantly. The cost of the BC-20 all black printer cartridge is a small price to pay for the service I've received in the last seven years. This printer came with my Gateway package and if it quit tomorrow I would still be impressed by its durability. I have been hard on this printer demanding endless hours of printing. If it jams it's easy to clear and reset. For non-color printing this would be my choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this printer because it was relatively cheap. It thought it would be a good home printer. I could use it to print assignments and reports that I do for university. At first it worked fine. However after about half a year the print quality started to suffer. It still prints however the quality is hopeless. I wouldn't recommend buying this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canon BJC-5100 Unreliable in the long haul","review":"I bought a Canon BJC-5100 about 2 years ago because is was the most economical printer that would print on 11x17 paper. I used it for occaisional light home use. It has become very unreliable with frequent problems. It will tell me there are no ink cartriges when I have just installed a new one. Some times it won't communicate with the computer. I have re-installed drivers frequently in vain attempts to get it to print. Other times it simply won't print at all. I have concluded that I need to replace it. I won't buy a Canon.Another big disappointment was that it advertised that it would print on up to 11x17 paper, but no where on the box or available literature did is specify that it had to be manually fed through the back ONE SHEET AT A TIME! Not particularly convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"Unfortunately our printer only lasted 6 months.

This album offers up two classics from Elvis, Carl Perkin's \\"Blue Suede Shoes,\\" Fats Domino announcing \\"I'm in Love Again,\\" and the Teenagers asking that musical question, \\"Why Do Fools Fall in Love?\\" The music of the period is clearly defined by Gene Vincent & His Blue Cops working through \\"Be-Bop-A-Lula\\" and Bill Haley & The Comets finding some success with \\"See You Later, Alligator.\\" Rock music sure has come a long way since then, but here is a representative sampling of the early days. All in all this is an average album in the Billboard Top Rock'n'Roll Hits series, and if you are old enough to remember these songs then you may well reach the magic number of five songs you would like to add to your music library, at which point picking up this album would be a worthwhile investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Portrait of the Artist as an Old Man--Moody, Meditative, Magnetic","review":"John Fahey plays this live set on an electric guitar, which became his usual instrument in his last half decade. Other reviewers have commented on the overall tempo. I too find the playing relatively slow, but in a meditative sense, not footdragging; mild syncopation here and there, never leaden, dull, or frustrating. Fahey's talents are still here, but in a different voice.Georgia Stomps, Atlanta Struts, and Other Contemporary Dance Favorites both recaptures some of the relaxed, exploratory assurance of what I cherish as Fahey's best, 1960s work, and it forges new ground without an iconoclastic attack on his creative past. Riffing on Dock Boggs indeed. Unlike some of his other late-period albums, where the experimental noise won out, I think Georgia Stomps lends itself to repeated listenings and deeper appreciations. If you want a better-than-representative example of John Fahey's later recorded works, then this one will do nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely horrible","review":"Swindoll was in love with a \\"golden age\\" of patriarchy that never existed. Not only does he find role models in the brutal ignorance of the Old Testament, he cites a 1947 book, Family and civilization, as an influence. Are feminist movements a cause for the \\"downward spiral\\" of civilization? Really? Try to imagine your life today if you had not encountered a well-educated, dedicated female teacher, physician, mentor, business partner, police officer, or political representative. This isn't a quest for character, it's advice on how to justify browbeating and manipulating your family and others. While a little lip service is given to helping others and compassion, mostly it's about being a tough guy. Needs to reread the New Testament."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great splinter removal","review":"I manage a swim and tennis club and these are the best for getting out the many splinters that kids get there.

The album takes off in a hard rock direction that was indicitive of the short lived Paris group. The real keeper of the 4 tracks from Paris is the \\"Heart of Stone.\\" A real fluid type, fast-paced ditty that just keeps on trucking. The rest of the album focus' on his more successful solo albums, drawing the most from \\"Three Hearts\\" (4 cuts). Tracks such as \\"B666\\" and \\"Future Games\\" just don't seem to make the cut, but are tacked on anyway for some purpose. The final track is something brand new for fans, which resembles something of a polished Styx number. It leaves us thinking what will come next of Welch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"I love Bob Welch's music.

It is still in my collection (although I am looking for a replacement of Scheele's other great book \\"The First Animals\\").Both these books are memorable for their great illustrations of prehistoric mammals and reptiles. The information was basic and easy to understand but not kiddy stuff. It inspired me to pursue both science and art. I recommend it to any serious young person willing to track down a copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent introduction...","review":"I took this book out of the library repeatedly as a young person(12+). After getting my own copy finally, I realized why this book had such an impact on my imagination. Excellent drawings and art work, detailed pronunciations of all animals, explanations of each individuals place in the evolution of mammalian forms. Considering that this book was written over 40 years ago all the information contained therein is still relevant,including a discussion of plate tectonics; a very controversial idea at the time. All in all it is a fantastic book to introduce the future palentological enthusiast to the genre. Compared to todays introductory tomes on the subject, it is light years better and far more comprehensive than any book I've ever seen on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for starters!","review":"I bought this book with a background in 3D Max which made it very easy to understand. Although, I think with no experience, this book is an excellant teaching tool for 3D VIZ beginners. It takes you step by step through the process and explains the reasons behind the actions. It's best feature is that all commands are in large bold type while all explanations are in regular font type. You can cruise through picking out the steps of the process if you want to create your model with out reading all of the explanations first. Then you can go back and see the reasons why.There are a wide range of models that span many disciplines as well.

What makes this especially bad is that the velcro closure holds like iron, and you have to tug quite hard on the flimsy flap to yank it free. So, the very first time I opened it, the flap got all bent. I cannot imagine the flap will last long, so I decided to toss this in the garbage (within 5 minutes of receiving it).

Most times the blackjack book doesn't really offer me anything to write home about...or even write a review about. But I must say that not only does Mr. John May's book live up to the hype, it surpasses it. I learned several new and devastating advantage-play techniques that are just wonderful. I would recommend you get this book fast before the casinos discover what Mr. May is writing about and start watching the games even more closely than they currently do.

I want to Be With You, NightSong, While the City Sleeps, Lorna's Here and No More are brilliantly dark numbers conveying the story of a love doomed to fail. It's a shame this recording uses The Fight as the finale instead of Joe's Death. Both were recorded and Joe's Death only appeared on a short lived re-issue of the LP.

There it stays with some red at 50 degrees and the rest at whatever temp it is outside. irritating. I ordered another hoping this one was defective. Nope. Same thing.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to par with the other two cds by this artist","review":"I rate the other two cds by this artist as fives, but was disappointed in this one. There is too much time between the tracks and the nature sounds often sound like they are just placed before the songs rather than incorporated into the music as well as the other two cds. With a \\"moods\\" cd - you want the experience to flowwwww together - this one falls short in that department.

I would skip this one however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as the Reviews Indicate","review":"Technically the guitar is well done, however, this CD totally lacks any emotional intensity in any one of the tracks.

This album is more than a breath of fresh air than monotonous club tunes by Cher, Madonna, and all those boy bands that the world is tired of.From start to finish, the album is flawless.

By the way, what is it anyway? I have to suffer and listen to something hoping I'll GET TO LIKE IT? I agree to do it 2 or 3 times but not 20.

So are the two men of Cassius (one of which is half the Daft Punk duo, and somehow one-third Stardust if my Parisian math is correct) up to the task?Mostly yes. Over 16 tracks (!) the hits come early, such as \\"Feeling For You,\\" and follow a devised formula: choice vocal sample, mid-tempo disco groove, and enough quirky funk to keep things flowing. In fact, not even these elements are needed in songs like \\"Foxxy\\" and \\"La Mouche\\" which survive off the strength of a swirling beat.As skillfully produced as the numbers are, this sound is hard to sustain, and indistinguishable filler tracks like \\"Crazy Legs\\" and \\"Planetz,\\" do creep in. Hang around for the \\"Cassius 99 Remix\\" at the end, and shuffle the album in with a few others when listening to fully appreciate. Grade: B"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vive La France!","review":"Bon!

While \\"1999\\" does show signs of promise, this French group fails to live up to the hype. The album is essentially house music, with elements of funk and R&B -- very groove-oriented. But the songs often go nowhere and there's no defined form or structure to many of the tracks. If you're looking for a no-brainer, forgettable album, then \\"1999\\" is for you. It's obvious Cassius was \\"dreaming when they wrote this,\\" but I can't forgive them for \\"going astray.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype, No Substance","review":"Since some french dance acts started appearing in the late nineties, a new dance scene began to emmerge as well, mixing disco beats with electronica and generating a retro-futuristic sound. Daft Punk were one of the more challenging and inventive bands, even if their albums are flawed and uneven. Air offered laid-back, dreamy and smooth atmospheres. Cassius, however, failed to engage, as one can prove with \\"1999\\".Yes, this record has a couple of interesting dance songs like \\"Crazy Legs\\" or \\"Interlude\\", still as a whole it\`s a repetitive, uninspired, endless and at parts irritating album. Some of this material is ok for a nightclub, but as a record it doesn't really get off the ground.

The wood grain is not attractive -unlike the picture. The stain and finish are rough -- there are scratches from low grade sandpaper and flecks of dust in the finish.Assembly is poor. Some screw heads were stripped and not tightened. The screw holes look like they were made with a chisel rather than a drill - uneven, differing depths, ragged edges, non-round holes.If I return the product, I'm out about $32. Thus, I'm stuck.

I started out at 190 and im 188.Another setback is that it suppresses your appetite. TOO WELL. i didnt feel the urge to eat for like 3 days. and if i DID eat id get sick as a dog. ive stopped taking the pill and decided to be a NON lazy person and just EXERCISE. some people should try that instead of wasting money on this pill.

Nausea is indeed a powerful appetite supressing feature, but not a desirable one.Would you buy this product is the main feature was \\"causes 546% more nausea than exercise alone\\"?OK, maybe you would.

The cover art is misleading because the so-called mailman works for a non-existent private delivery service and isn't a real US govm't mailman...that would be scary and what motivated me to rent the movie. There are no closed captions or extras and the film has the look and sound of a cheaply made TV movie; the expensive purchase price is puzzling.

It has a handful of songs that are very good. On the other hand, if you're more a fan of Pat's earlier stuff, you will be disappointed. The band has evolved and the song-writing has changed, fairly drastically compared to his old stuff. The new sound is very produced sounding and does not sound \\"Texas\\" at all. It sounds polished and produced and basically like everyone else (pop country). To me, his band has too many people in it. Why do you need 3 guitar players in a band?

Over 200 people have said that Judy was the kindest and funniest woman, is that so hard to believe?. June Allyson said \\"I get so mad when people say unkind things about Judy.

Using her own experience as athlete and coach and that of other athletes, Dr. Saint Sing both informs and inspires the reader to excel, to strive toward excellence as a way not only of balancing body and soul, but also as a way of breaking through to an experience of the Divine. This book would be an excellent adjunct text for college students and for high school students, as well. An extraordinary job of taking the reader on a journey through the inner world of the athlete whose determination and discipline allow him or her to break through the limitations of the body into the world of the soul where body and soul have become one.I highly recommend this book for athletes and everyone who is determined to pursue a goal greater than one's own perceived limitations.Murray Bodo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blade of Tyshalle","review":"Very good read. Has a satisfying blend of fantasy and sic fi. Has a strong, well written story and great fight scenes. Caine continues to be one of my favorite literary heroes. He's almost an anti hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Tolkien, Heinlein or anything remotely literary","review":"To give the author the benefit of the doubt I read the whole book hoping that somewhere I would find some redeeming quality within it's pages. The characters are simplistic and one dimensional. I suppose Hari's (main character) FU mouth and attitude is supposed to be his endearing characteristic, but after awhile it becomes dumb, crass and boring. ... There is nothing subtle or artistic about his ability to describe a scene or situation. ... P>On the cover review they compare it to Lord of the Rings and other classic books and it has nothing in common with any of the good books that so many people love. It is blood, guts and gore with a liberal dose of profanity and some skewed anarchist philosophy thrown in...I give it one star because it made it into print without a lot of typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"great but preachy","review":"I love the character,Hari michaelson, especially as Caine. The story is really well written and holds your interest. It is a great read. The only problem I had with it was the over the top anti-capitalist, radical environmentalist point of view that was piled on with a steam shovel. In a future world where they can travel to another planet without a space craft, they still cannot gather resources without destroying the countryside. The, man is the evil destroyer of the planet, story line gets a little old as well. Still the writing is good and if you can get past the radical environmental [stuff], I think you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best, seriously.","review":"This book kept me up every night for four nights until I finished it. I literally just put the book down and my eyes are bleary and dry. But if there was a sequel on my nightstand I wouldn't be writing this, I'd be still reading. Stover weaves the Sci-Fi and Fantasies genres together and creates a world full of tragic characters who experience everything imaginable in two dangerous worlds. The roller-coaster ride of constant action and anguish left me exhausted, but wanting more and more. This book takes you by the arm and drags you across every human emotion without saying 'you better close your eyes for this one'. Mix in social commentary & phylosophical observation with the action, emotion and larger-than-life characters and you have one ... fine book. Read and re-read."},{"rating":"2","title":"TRUE STORIES END IN DEATH","review":"Probably the best book I have ever read. The best part of it for me was CAIN's philosophy which is a little like Nietche who states that \\"what does not kill you, makes you stronger\\" and \\"beware that when you fight monsters, you don't become one\\". Bascially, CAIN is an \\"anti-hero\\" who would destroy the world and almost does to save his true love \\"Pallas Rill\\". Cainism states that you must 1st decide what you want and then determine what you will do to achieve your goal. A good way to try to live your life, it does not hurt to be like Cain, ok maybe a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite books!","review":"I chose this rating, these Caine books are the best I've read.I'd reccomend to any science fiction/fantasy fans who love a book that just keeps building up to epic, fast paced action climaxes.

Unfortunately, the writer cripples (in more ways than one) the protanist for well over half of the 800 pages. He is crippled mentally and physically. He doesn't do ANYTHING (other than get beat upon). He whines, self-pities and gets beat upon till he is simply not the character created in the first book.If you want to read a book where the 'bad guys' simply have their way for an eternable time with no [reader] relief, have fun. I started skipping pages after pg 300 just so I could find a place where a protaganist/antagonist action could start again.

Not a single redeeming quality in the book . Avoid this book at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget the follow up","review":"I tried, really I did. After the success of \\"Heroes Die\\" I assumed Stover would provide a comparable sequel, he did not. This book is about 400 pages too long, the characters are simply a re-hash of the previous novel, the plot is seemingly complex but wasteful, the action is lacking, the philosophy is strained (and not helped by the constant use of the f-bomb), the author simply tried a new approach to making a good novel but his original formula should not have been altered.This novel is so bad that I feel it actually tarnishes the previous work \\"Heroe's Die\\". Stover has his strengths and he needs to stay with the simple, violent, seething id that is encompassed by Caine.

Familiar works take on a fresh new face when played on handbells, and the original works showcase the unique tonal qualities of the bells.

I have to shut them off at the switch inside. Once I do that, they seem to \\"reset\\", and usually come back on at night, but the same 2 never shut off during the day. At least they haven't yet. Called the company tech support, they told me to replace the entire units as the photo cell is bad and that part alone can't be replaced. Seems like they should last forever. I don't think these are that old.I would recommend finding another brand.

There is a small negative aspect of this lamp and that is it has a timer and once the time is over, it goes to a dim light mode (less consumption) rather than completely switching off. It remains in dim mode for a while and then switches off. This means there is still power consumption. Further, when in dim light mode there is a motion, it does not start instantly.All other aspects of this lamp are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 2 months","review":"We ordered this to replace the fixture outside a home we purchased a few months ago.

It's a great series of stories. In this book, it's April Fool's day, and Sweet Valley Middle School is all excited about what tricks they're going to play! Twins Jessica and Elizabeth decide that instead of trading places as they usually do, they're going to do the opposite. They're going to emphasize themselves so much, that people will assume they've changed places, even though they haven't. This backfires, however, and Elizabeth gets stuck with all of Jessica's problems. This story is very unrealistic. I don't know anyone who gets so pumped up over April Fool's Day. Nor do I think everyone would react that way to Elizabeth and Jessica.

If you're just one off due to miscount, or confuse the start of one code for the end of the previous code, you'll waste time and money investigating and replacing the wrong components.For about $10 more, you can get an ODB-1 code reader with a numeric read out, which eliminates counting flashes and beeps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Buffalo S.

The extra rare completed songs would perhaps almost make 1 c.d. of rarities which would be a better addition to our B.S. collections than an expensive hefty box set.

My real complaint/wonder is why we didn't get versions of Neil singing his great songs? \\"On the Way Home\\", \\"Clancy\\", & \\"Do I have to Come Right Out and Say It\\".....these are such beautiful songs and while Richie sings them nicely, I really need to hear Neil sing them.

Look, there was only so much good music this unlikely and short-lived group was capable of, and it sure wasn't sufficient to spread over four CD's. Even some of their best songs were poorly recorded, especially on their debut. In places they sound like a garage band. And Stills, with his sophomoric lyrics, deserved less air time.

Lots of great surprises, including \\"Down, Down, Down\\" which eventually morphs into \\"Broken Arrow,\\" an early acoustic version of \\"Hung Upside Down\\", and various takes on \\"Flying on the Ground is Wrong.\\" Neil Young's songwriting genius really shows.I docked it one star for not including the extended and legendary version of \\"Bluebird\\" found on their early 1970s 2-LP anthology (long out-of-print), featuring jamming guitars versus the banjo close we are used to. Another fault is the lack of background on the songs themselves, relying instead on a period piece, fan magazine type booklet that resembles the \\"Last Time Around\\" album artwork."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor collection","review":"I've seen this group perform in person. They brought the house down. I brought this box set hoping to get most of the music they did. I was kinda dissappointed in the box set. Why didn't they put in live tracks in the fourth CD.

Even though they only had a two year stint they had big influence in the music of that era and even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown but hardly definitive","review":"See, the thing about demos & outtakes is they are rough drafts or works in progress which make nice filler or bonus material. That said, buy the 3 individual CDs. They've been nicely remastered & reasonably priced. The 1st album even has the mono version of the album included(preferred by the band members) along with the stereo format. If this had contained all 3 albums in their entirety plus the extended version of \\"Bluebird\\", this could've been a 5 star comp.

He was my least favorite in the band..I much prefer Furay and Stills. Richie Furay seems to be the only one who is not totally full of himself and is appreciative of what the band had done to music and his friendship with the surviving members continue.His book on Buffalo Springfield seems like a fair representaion of what went on and he is not one to place blame. He always has a respectful view on what happened.He is a Pastor now and a devout Christian..and if for some reason that puts you off...you should still read his autobiography.He just seemed like the right guy to tell the honest story and he should have been the one to put this collection together.Pickin' Up the Pieces: The Heart and Soul of Country Rock Pioneer Richie Furay"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned","review":"This has to qualify for disappointment of the year. A seemingly endless batch of hit-and-miss demos and outtakes are mixed in with the released masterpieces, making for a tedious listen. In the end, this box diminishes the band's legacy instead of immortalizing it. The final insult: three songs from Last Time Around are arbitrarily deleted while the tracks from albums one and two appear twice -- and you STILL need to go elsewhere for a stereo mix of the debut outing. It's hard to miss Neil Young's ongoing contempt for his audience. The label could have squeezed all three original albums and at least 40 minutes of the worthy outtakes onto a double disc. A waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's not Aaron Copeland, but close.","review":"Aaron Copeland would be proud.

I have it on mute unless I'm talking so other people don't hear my dog, street noise, etc. So, I had to return it after a week.In summary, if you use mute, you won't be able to use this.

This device doesn't even allow you to enter an age greater than 60. I guess they figure if you're over 60, you're too senile to care about your weight or appearance. Actually, it's even worse than that. Certain combinations of weight, age and height throw an ERROR when you try to enter them for your profile. So even their ALGORITHM is flawed.

They also recommend that you do the measurements couple of hours after eating/drinking. I used it couple of times and now it is sitting somewhere in my basement collecting dust. I don't think this measurement method is accurate at all since the numbers that it showed me are no way real in my case. I admit I am 10lbs overweight so there is no way I am only 10% body fat.

My intent was to use this as part of diet program where during the weeks when my weight didn't go down, I'd see a change in fat percentage. But, despite losing about 25 pounds over the better part of a year, and having ample visual evidence that my fat percentage was lower, the HBF-306C gave me no useful information.

Between one moment and the next, you could see a difference of 1-4% in the readings. I've done very well to follow all of the directions both in the manual, and in a comment left by someone in the review section here on Amazon. My suggestion is to spend the money towards a pair of calipers and take time learning how to use them properly. If you don't mind your readings being off slightly (or massively depending on the time of day) then you can do with the Omron HBF-360C... Otherwise, it really isn't worth your time. It's still just a science project with lots of experimenting and refining to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool for monitoring your fat loss.","review":"This monitor is very simple to use and easy to understand.

Remember, it's the amount of body fat you lose not the weight, so this thing checks your body fat and BMI.

It seemed like a lot of people just weren't following the directions properly so I ordered. I follow the directions to the letter and have had positive but somewhat mixed results. Disclaimer: I am tall 6'6'' and muscular (although not as lean as I could be). The absolute level of body fat seems 5 or 6 % points high to me, although its possible it is correct. Directionaly it is correct. Meaning, when I lose fat (based on looking in the mirror) the body fat % goes down. The BMI monitor is where I have issues. This also has to do with the way BMI is calculated in general but it says I am \\"Very High\\" or well over the efficient ratio, when that is just not the case. Overall it is a good way to monitor progress regarding fat loss but maybe not THE most accurate way for absolute %.

As others have said, get calipers and learn how to use them.Also, people, forget about BMI. This was a measurement developed to study POPULATIONS, and never intended for the evaluation of individuals. Use common sense. How can a value that considers only weight and height be a valid reflection of an individual's health and fitness? Muscle is denser than fat, so an individual with minimal muscle will show a lower BMI than a heavily-muscled one of the same stature.

Gibberish, but consistent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorified calculator","review":"The Omron HBF is a one trick wonder.

I had read the work of many of his Boston colleagues and post-modern poetry more generally, but I have rarely come across poems with so much jazzy beauty in their sound. Jonas' _Exercises for Ear_ which are reproduced here are exceptional and showcase his obsession with the rhythm and sound of his verse. His life story is also fascinating; racially ambiguous, gay, and always prickly politically, he is still enigmatic today. Later in life Jonas seems to have become increasingly mentally ill and espoused bizarre political beliefs, but in all of this he remains uncategorizable, his own person unassimilated to anyone's stereotype of the gay black poet.

The actual code example was fine, but I was uncertain about whether this is the norm or the exception.When presenting new commands, there sometimes is no explanation about what each of the arguments to the function mean.

A 18 Volt discrepancy at 208V is well outside the stated accuracy of 1.8%.I still believe that Fluke makes some of the best measuring and testing equipment in the world.

You know, just below average.","review":"Interesting collection, but probably not worth the price. The Selecter's \\"On My Radio\\" is a classic and well worth having in any rudeboy's collection. The Specials' \\"A message to You Rudy\\" is an interesting rendtion, despite having its authenticity called into question by another reviewer. It too is worth having as it stands in stark comparison with Rancid's version of \\"A Message to You Rudy\\" on \\"And Out Come the Wolves.\\" The Selecter's \\"James Bond\\" is pretty funny, particularly if you're a 007 fan. The Judge Dread works waffle between being annoying and pleasantly entertaining. But then again, these tracks' authenticity have also been called into question. The rest of the set seems to be filler, some tracks are very high quality filler, but filler all the same. Regardless of how the set was recorded and mastered, it is entertaining. It's not worth going out of your way for, but if the oportunety comes up to get it cheap - go for it.SDG"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST ska in the world!!","review":"i bought this collection because i am obsessed with ska music. boy was i thrilled when i listened to this. this 3 cd set is awesome! it's a lot of british ska, (which is the best kind), however every song is different! it's a lot of fun to listen to and i highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Complete Win At Whist\\" is a Winner!","review":"My name is Dennis J Barmore.

I'll go through the book and buy 2-3 meals worth on Monday (it's still fast, maybe not express though!) and basically be set for the week.I wish the cookbook had a list of the recipes that use the fresh-purchase ingredients.

It is not inviting in any sense. I just can not believe that there are only handful of pictures of the respices in the book. I guess it is just more important to get, I don't know, several books out in one year rather than doing one professionally. Cooking is something of a special field of \\"science\\" and a well made cookbook with appropriate pictures will not only give one that preliminary \\"taste\\" of the recipe but the visual connections makes your mouth water.

No exceptional ingredients (in my opinion), doesn't take more than 30 mins (I did the Leek-y Chicken in 7 mins.) and the recipes are easy to manipulate if you want to go in another direction.So, its a pantry-meal cookbook. Its a great place to turn when you're looking for something basic, easy and in your pantry already. I haven't loved the recipes yet--they are actually somewhat bland. But I've done them by the book, so to speak.I didn't by her book for fine cuisine. I bought it to give me some fresh ideas when I'm feeling brain dead after a long day--and REALLY don't want to make rice and beans again or mac and cheese.

Fit is right on, but it feels like a rubber boot on your foot. The drawstring at the top does very little or nothing to actually tighten the boot to your foot. Easy to get in and out of due to the zipper. Comfortable to wear in moderately deep snow. Just the right amount of insulation for 15 degree weather (shoveling snow etc). I'm not sure I would reccomend this for hiking or working full time as it fits like a rubber boot and will move around on your foot. Basically, if you want a snow boot that doesn't make you look like Farmer Joe in muddy rubber boots or Yukon Jack in trekking gear this is a great boot."},{"rating":"1","title":"They never sent the right item.","review":"Furniture risers - two sets of 4 each, one set 3\\" high, one set 4\\" high both cone shaped risers.

Peak x is a contaminate that is found regularly in 5-htp products and has been blamed for an out break of EMS(a serious and sometimes fatal desease) in 1989 when a manufactured produced tryptophan that had the same contaminate. Since then there have been reports of EMS related to 5-htp many of which also contain \\"peak x\\" studies have shown that the amount of peak x in 5htp products is not as high as it was in the 1989 cases of ems however dosages between 300mg (per day) and 900 mg per day can bring it to similar levels as the 1989 outbreak in tryptophan.

I found that 5-htp helped my sleep cycle normalize.I have always had problems falling asleep. After taking 5-htp for a month, I found that I fell asleep when I was supposed to.

Also found it interesting that they spend most of their holidays with son Neil and now ex-wife Sharon(because they lived near by.) Sharon said Neil had been cheating on her for sometime, yet Barbara acts like they are all one big happy family. Also thought it was interesting she never mentioned Jeb's daughter Nicole's serious drug problems and the drinking problems of the Bush twins.

She treats the amputation of her own toes the same as why George Bush left the NRA which is treated the same as her bland chicken casserole recipe. The book is sprinkled with bland recipes and it's riddled with asterisks by names of famous people I should probably care about but don't.Perhaps Mrs. Bush has earned to right to look back on such a rich life and treat it with the depth and wisdom of a grocery list.

The deepest comment? \\"Wonderful\\" used frequently to describe grandchildren and friends.If literacy is such an important cause to her, why doesn't she take her son to task for taking steps to end funding of Head Start programs?

The $5 is excellent, though I would like the first movement ca 30 seconds slower.This Rooamunde is totally superb- great choral work and a great soloist, Aafje Heynis, and wonderfully paced orchestral work-winds especially. The more often recorded suite of this work fails to do it justice- the entire work is much greater. This joins another Haitink Special, Mendelssohn'sMN Dream incidental music. I find both peerless. Closest in the Schubert are Fritz Lehmann/BPO, and in the Mendelssohn : Peter Maag/LSO"},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium Phc85 Chrome Hair Clipper","review":"This is the worst product I ve ever purchased on Amazon.com so far.

There's a 3 year warranty on this battery, so I emailed Lenmar to ask if I could get a replacement. Lenmar responded quickly, providing me with a return authorization number and detailed information on their warranty policy. However, since my battery was purchased more than 90 days ago, there's a $7.50 shipping and handling charge for the new battery. Since I only paid $12 for the battery itself, I didn't think it was worth the trouble to get a replacement, especially since I could run into the same problem with the replacement.

Comparing side-by-side to the Canon battery, it looks similar except that the metal contacts on the Lenmar are a bit more recessed than the ones on the Canon.

'Classic Toys in Wood' was a truedelight as was the follow up book 'Making Timeless Toys in Wood'.Classic Toys in Wood contains 40 toy plans including; construction toys,a host of fun toys in the 'boat marina' theme, rocking horses, and more.The book itself contains 12 mini plans as well as an illustrated storyfor children.My niece was just a small child while I was working with theprotypes of these toys. She visited often and of course loved toplay test them. She especially liked the ferris wheel and allthe little people she could put on the ride.Unlike some mass made toys, these stood up to the rigors of play.Along with the mini-plans included in the book you will findexcellent step-by-step instructions and materials lists.Full size plans for all the toys shown in the book can be ordered directly from Sun Designs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all good.","review":"Please don't buy this. It damages the ear. It has some additional noise we have to hear always. It irritates your ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for I guess","review":"This thing is large and gaudy- not to mention it doesn't match the picture. It's got giant writing on the side proclaiming what it is and the name \\"brand\\" if you will (which you conveniently cannot see in the picture of the product here on Amazon). Not exactly something that should be loudly advertised. I should have sprung for the extra $20 the first time around and got something a little nicer. Perhaps if I purchased this for the intended purpose, which in this case is obviously stalking Bambi with a rifle, then I wouldn't mind. It would be the least of Bambi's concerns, right? But alas... my intent was to improve my hearing ability in a much more urban environment. So I'm cheap and it bit me in the tail.Honestly I have no idea how well the item works because I was so horrified by the appearance I didn't want to take the time to pry open the indestructible plastic package."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what we ordered","review":"According to the item pictured on the package and on the screen when we placed out order. The item we got is not what was pictured. The one on the package has a extra piece , you can see on the enchaner the tube is thicker at the top coming down to the ear, to help hold it on the ear, it is missing on the enchace we received and it will not stay on the ear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearing enhancer","review":"The sound reproduction is excellent, but it's hard to hold onto the ear. Fast delivery and excellent condition of packaging is to be commended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woodland Whisper behind the Ear enhancer","review":"Save your money, very cheaply made, which for the price probably can't complain. I bought this to encourage my granddaughter to wear hers, well it doesn't fit behind the ear and stay in place and very uncomfortable, as for hearing, it is like hearing an echo from the bottom of a tin can."},{"rating":"2","title":"review on Belfast diary by John Conroy","review":"Great book.The first one I've read that really describes the situation here"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story Told By An Outsider For Outsiders","review":"This book answered a lot of my questions about the conflict in Ireland. The history of why Protestants and Catholics don't get along and how the Protestants got there by the British sheds a lot of light on the current day conflict. I found myself furious with the British government many, many times for the way they made the situation worse. John Conroy was fortunate to be in Ireland in the early 80's, a time period I find very interesting with the Hunger Strikes. I would recommend this book to any person wishing to understand the conflict over there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decalogue Soundtrack","review":"This CD evokes the mood of the Decalogue. Preisner is original and dramatic. The music is like nothing else in classical music. He and Kieslowski were perfect collaborators. The Decalogue would not be the same without his music."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST RARITIES OF COVERS OF ROCK SUCESS","review":"This album is rare for any Elton fan, a gret collection of songs of other artists who Elton singing in this album.Inclues McCartney songs.United we stand was my favorite song of this monumental album in my opinion.If you are a greatest hits buyer, this is a collection to add to your list. Elton fan buy this disc? Yes, after he or she has purchased all the 70's Classic Years reissues and Rare MastersTHIS ALBUM IS ESSENTIAL"},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I tried this primer and am not impressed.

I PLAY ALL THE TIME, I WACH ALL THE SHOWS, AND COLLECT THE CARDS. BUT THIS TOY IS COMPLETLY DOME I MEAN IT DOESNT EVEN COME WITH INSTRUCTIONS. YOU CAN SEE THROUGH THE CARDS THATS STUPID REALLY. I BOUGHT IT ONE DAY AND THE SAME DAY I TOOK IT BACK. I OPENED IT UP AND STARED AT IT FOR 10 MINUTES I MEAN THARS NO REASON FOR IT ITS USELESS. THE ONLY USE FOR IT IS CAREING YOUR ACTION FIGURES. I GIVE IT A 0 ON ALL THE RATEINGS. OK I JUST WANA SAY I HATE IT. WELL C YA."},{"rating":"1","title":"?Satanistic? - I don't think so!","review":"I'm a 35 year old mother of two, ages 6 and 7, and I watch Yugi every afternoon and Saturday with my kids and love it almost more than they do. While I agree that Yugi is nothing like Pokemon, I disagree with the statement that it is satanistic. I'm sorry, but I don't see that this show has any 'satanistic' or 'devil worshipping' connotation at all. It does show extreme good, extreme evil and all the grades in between, but isn't that what real life holds? Personally I love how they strongly reinforce friendship and truth to oneself and others. I do NOT see any more 'satanism' here than is in the bible. If you do, perhaps you need to sit down and read your bible again.As far as this game goes, it is not a very good buy and really just an expensive storage case IF you have the right figurines."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I bought this for a Christmas gift for my 9 yr old son, who just loves collecting the trading cards and figures. Unfortunately, he was not too excited about this arena. There are no instructions and we are no quite sure what to do with it. Needless to say, it has been sitting under the tree and has not been used, other than to store his figures (expensive storage case). If he hadn't of destroyed the box trying to get it out, I would have taken it back and got him more trading cards. SAVE YOUR MONEY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The holographic cards are not holographic. There are no instructions.

He thought it was truly a game, rather than just a display case for the figures. There weren't any instructions in the box, so we figured out that there wasn't much we could do with it besides purcha$e more figures and have a way to carry them around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonicy!","review":"Yu-Gi-Oh is satanic and imitates people summoning demons and using witchcraft. I would not recommend this for ANYBODY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organizer and fun when used with imagination!","review":"My 6 year old son owns approximately 50 little figurines. I purchased the arena as an organizer and it was worth every penny. All 50 figurines would have been lost if not for the arena. In addition to holding figurines, it can be turned upside down to resemble the dueling field on the tv shows. My son uses a lot of imagination and duels with his figurines using the arena and a lot of sound effects. I have stuffed all of the figurines in it and still manage to close it, and it has not fallen apart yet. We have had it since it was first released ... My son takes it to friends houses to play and it is a favorite to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yu-Gi-Oh---imagination, mathmatics, quiet clean FUN!","review":"My son enjoys this game and it has helped him at school also. Math is the key to this game. People that write reviews and scorn this game because of witchcraft need to review their childhoods. Even Snow White had witches. Let kids be kids!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste","review":"My 7 year old son bought this 4 months ago. Although is a huge yu-gi-oh fan he found little to like with this toy. Played with it only a couple of times. The cards it uses are totally different from the usual playing cards."},{"rating":"1","title":"My son doesn't touch it!","review":"My son loves Yu-Gi-Oh, and cannot be pulled away from the TV show or his cards. But he has hardly touched the arena play set. Some of it, admittedly, is that no one else has it. But it just is not a necessary component of the game. The cards are portable, the arena is not. I wouldn't bother with getting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed. No instructions","review":"The idea is great but there's no instructions in how to play the game. The cards don't have any information about their defense or attack abilities. You have to figure our a way to play the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame-e-oh","review":"This was pretty weak, but it is Yugi so my son wanted it. He has played with it a total of 15 minutes since we got it 2 weeks ago. the cards do not fit in the case, and it only comes with 2 characters. And the others from the store do not fit in case either."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG WASTE OF MONEY","review":"My husband and I were under the usumption that this was a platform to be used with the game, but were we fooled. It is the biggest waste of money I have ever seen. It is only used for carrying and storing figures. So if you are fooled to believe that this is a game save your money. My son and I duel all the time and he often has friends over to duel, but the WASTE has never been used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Scholarly-Work","review":"A very timely masterpiece.

His view or personal opinions are very misleading and does not represent true islam, I was rather shocked to know that Jesus died a natural death as totally opposite to what a muslim belives and other misleading opinions like the age of Adam or the father of Abraham etc. Mr.Omar failed to provide any sources for his conclusions and even if he did, it really did not mention how?? Any body seriously intrested in looking for a dictionary should probably find an alternative.
