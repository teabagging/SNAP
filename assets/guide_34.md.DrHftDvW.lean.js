Tire slime helped, but didn't eliminate the problem. This tire did.I don't know about the 500 Lb load capacity, but it will handle 4 bags of concrete (320 Lbs)without \\"squishing\\". The steel rim is heavy duty and the grease zerk will help the ball bearings last for years.The price is a bit steep compared to pneumatic tires, but you'll never have to air it up.

We use these bowls about 4-5 times a week for dinner preparations. We have never used them in the microwave or dishwasher, always washing by hand. After less than 2 months of use, the smallest bowl cracked at the bottom and \\"spidered\\" out up the bowl. Then a few weeks later, the exact same thing happened to the medium bowl. We have done nothing excessive to these bowls to make them crack, but they are just not strong enough for routine use. I had to pull the $10 set I got from Wal-Mart out of retirement. I have a lot of KitchenAid products and really like the brand, but these bowls are just not strong enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"UPDATE!! - pieces of red plastic chipping off bowls into my food","review":"I got this as a gift for Christmas. I've already used them numerous times. They are perfect use for mixing ingredients in baking and cooking. They have a spout for easy pouring and minimal spills or drops. Additionally they have a rim on the opposite side of the bowl to grasp when pouring. They are easy to scrape and very durable.UPDATE: I had originally gave these bowls 5 stars, but after only 5-6 months of use, I noticed red specks showing up when mixing things in the bowls, this happened everytime I was using them. After a couple times, I figured out it was the red plastic of the bowls chipping off into the items I was mixing! Do not buy!! I am sure eating bits of plastic is not good for you! Very disappointed in Kitchen aid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy and Inefficient","review":"I received these bowls off my wish list for Christmas '07. They are very flimsy and don't handle well at all. My twelve year old boys refuse to use them (they're very handy in the kitchen and enjoy cooking) because they're a pain. They're difficult to pour from because the tab-like handle doesn't give enough surface to grip, the spout isn't concaved enough and the liquid spills from the sides of the mouth. They aren't marked anywhere on the bowls (we checked) yet they are *not* microwavable. In less than 3 minutes the bowl melted. I'm using the other two for pet bowls and tossing them when they're no longer working for that either. I highly do NOT recommend these bowls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy these bowls!","review":"Well, one might think that a set of KitchenAid stacking mixing bowls would be a very versatile part of one's kitchen. Not so. The sides are flimsy, but okay, you might not find that to be offensive. But they don't even go in the microwave! To make matters worse, KitchenAid does not even put on the bottom of the bowl that you shouldn't use the bowls in the microwave. In fact, the dishwasher is even too hot for them -- they warp. A total waste of money -- don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but I've had better","review":"I bought the set of 3 white bowls. I like the sizes and the bottom that sticks to the counter. BUT they stained easily from a variety of foods. And recently, after very light use, the largest bowl got a very big crack from the upper edge down to the middle of the side. I'm really disappointed. (I have an old Rubbermaid mixing bowl, that I've had for decades, that's still going strong.)

The men are weak, the women are weak, not one character is stands out as a hero."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I read this book and can't see why it is so highly praised by Oprah. What disappointed me is that I couldn't really get a mental picture in my head of the things the author was describing, especially the landscape. The plot was very boring, and the characters were not developed well. I think if the story was told from Carl's point of view it would have been a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"I have read 5 Oprah recommended books and have loved them all except for this one. I guess my expectations were too high, on the back of the book it's catorgorized as a \\"psychological thriller\\", well I was not thrilled.I will say the story was told very uniquely, by the different characters, but from the beginning, you don't really know HOW it happens, but when you find out, it's not a suprise.All in all, I was disappointed. But it won't stop me from reading other Oprah books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really interesting","review":"The book is mostly cliche. Clearly the author has read Beloved too many times without coming up with many original ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!","review":"This book rocked my socks! I loved the way it was written and how it went back in time and then to present. It always kept me guessing. You have got to read this book!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I thought this would be much more interesting than it turned out to be. The blurb on the back cover is intriguing, but the actual story is rambling and poorly structured. Though the author tries to set up a 'mystery' ending, it's actually pretty obvious from early in the book what is going to happen. I soon lost interest and started skipping pages to see what happens in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun read","review":"I enjoyed it! Thanks Oprah, I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.

Schwarz does a good job of describing the relationship between these two sister. Her descriptions of the areas where the novel takes place are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CHARACTER EVER","review":"I just finished reading this book because that is what I do, I start a book and I will finish it, no matter what, but the main character (Amanda) is just too much, I generally don't hate characters in book, even the bad ones, but Amanda was so \\"me\\", \\"me\\", \\"me\\" that I started disliking her immediately, the only person important for her was she, she lied the entire book to protect herself but always thinking that she was doing the noble thing. So stay away from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would benefit from some subtlety","review":"While it's not a terrible story, I was greatly disappointed in the author's execution. This story gives far too much away, far too early. There were many \\"revelations\\" in this book, and I can't think of any that truly surprised me. Foreshadowing is a great tool for an author when used well, but it was far too obvious here.I was also disappointed in the characters; they're very flat. For example, Amanda's motives are there, but they're not subtle in any way, and they don't provide you with a real look inside her head."},{"rating":"1","title":"never been more disappointed","review":"I really tried to finish this book so I could write a decent review. I felt as if I should finish it considering I paid money for this book.(Something I wouldn't advise you to do). But why should I finish a book that you already know what happens after this first three chapters?Even though the ending was predictable, I still didnt want to see how or why it ended that way. The book just wasn't very engaging. It seemed to drag on. Schwartz didnt do her homework for this book. There is no mention of anything from this time period. (except maybe a couple of articles of clothing). This book was put together rather poorly. She just didnt seem to master phasing in and out in time.Here is a few words to sum this book up - grim, simple, bleak, and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Great","review":"This book started out pretty good and the exceptional detail really gave me an excellent mental image as I was reading. But in the middle it seemed to get bogged down with too much detail and skipping around which made it hard to follow. I found myself skipping whole chapters just to get to the end. If someone gave me the book it would be interesting reading but I wouldn't spend the money if I were doing it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost a Great Book","review":"Drowning Ruth was an engrossing and beautiful story from the beginning. A pleasant surprise as I'm not typically a fan of Oprah's book lists. I was looking for a good read over the holidays and what a perfect fit that kept me turning pages late into the night. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because even though the story was interesting and extremely well written, there was just something missing that kept it from being a truly great book. I believe for me it was the ending. The story kept building to what you thought would be either a great revelation or twist at the end but instead ended abruptly and very predictably. Still a good story and worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"This story was incredibly dreary and lonely, and while I am reading many reviews describing Schwarz's characterization as powerful, I can't agree. I didn't care for the characters much, except maybe Ruth, and what I felt for her was mostly pity. I didn't have any feelings or thoughts about this book after finishing it, which is very unusual for me. Specifically, I was chomping at the bit to get into a \\"good read\\" because this left me rather unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying","review":"The first chapter of this book was great, but then it was quickly downhill. Complaints: the weirdness and dysfunction far outweighed the \\"crime\\" as *finally* revealed at the end; there is a familiarity in this book in tone, setting, and dysfunction to other books I've read lately -- the turn-of-the century, crazy sister who is made crazy because everyone ignores her because she is weird, ugly, plain, or too smart genre -- give it a rest; long stretches of this book are very clunky and suffer too much from first-novelitis; it just takes too long both in literal reading time and novel-time for the final \\"truths\\" to be made apparent to everyone; the unrelenting grimness of this book is a success on one level (in the ability to maintain tone) but doesn't make for an uplifting, insightful or entertaining read. I was most disappointed in this book. Parts of it are superb, but not nearly enough to carry its weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic quick-read!","review":"Drowning Ruth was a somewhat predictable book, however, a fantastic read nonetheless. I found myself unable to put the book down until it was finished. The storyline is definitely unique as it centers around Amanda who's lifetime of sacrifice, guilt, and shame leads ultimately to a horrific deception that affects the lives of those whom she loves most. As the story evolves it is not difficult to predict the end, however, I was disappointed that one of the seemingly most important characters never reaches a full resolution and is not honored with the truth. This book brings to light at most, just how critical it is to be honest at all costs and how a lie, whether how big or small can absolutely devastate a person. I look forward to future novels by Christina Schwarz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distracting craft problems","review":"As a former Milwaukeean, I was drawn to this book set in historical Wisconsin but was very disappointed in it to the point where I couldn't finish it. The story jumps around too much, the shifts in voice are very badly handled, and the historical details often shaky--a WWI era photographer urging a girl to \\"smile\\" for her photograph? Never! I'm really sorry I jumped on the Oprah bandwagon and shelled out for this one in hardcover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disappointing \\"secret\\"","review":"I thought the book was a really good book. However, the whole time I was reading I couldn't imagine what it was that really happened that night. After finding out what really happened, I was really disappointed and never understood why it was such a secret in the first place. (What happened to Mathilda, that is--not what happened to Amanda. With that aside, I still found it to be a great book. I had a hard time putting it down every night at bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great 1 From Oprah!","review":"I hate reading, but found myself drawn to this one. I love the way it plays out and wow what a surprise!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on Oprah you can do better","review":"I know I am the voice of dissent but I was truly disappointed by this book. I had to force myself to finish it. It was predictable, the character development was poor, and it was very unrealistic. It is promoted as a mystery and of insight into family secrets but I found it neither. I know the ending after the first three chapters. If you must read it at least wait until paperback...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning Ruth","review":"Poisonwood Bible and Mother of Pearl lulled me into a false sense of optimism and I had my husband buy Drowning Ruth for me. \\"Oprah's Bookclub\\" selections usually evoke fear in me. I avoid depressing (she calls them real life) books because most of my early life was lived in a family situation that could be the plot for one her common bookclub choices. I will be much more cautious next time. Drowning Ruth can be described in one word: GRIM!!!!! If you must try it I recommend reserving a library copy. That way you can spend your money on a book that entertains, uplifts, humors or celebrates life. You know, one of those that you just hate to finish!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Effort that Needs to be Measured on its own Terms","review":"This is one of those books that often gets panned by those who approach it with unrealistic expectations. While the characters are believable and well-developed, the book is primarily about relationships, not a Pulitzer-level story. However, the writing is beautiful, the plot quite engaging, and the mystery sufficiently plausible to keep you thinking. You'll be wondering about various scenarios for Ruth's drowning well into the book. Aside from the story, the time-setting is most interesting, as is the relationship between the sisters. Once you get into it, you'll have a hard time putting it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Draging on and on and on and on.","review":"This book drags on and on and never seems to end.

The story is quite depressing. Don't waste your time or money unless you enjoy reading about \\"gloom, doom and dispair\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"This book was SO boring. The time frame kept switching back & forth. The descriptions and details were so in depth as to be tedious... Characters came and went without any feeling of attachment or familiarity.. And I kept waiting for something to hold my attention. I wouldnt recommend - the title is meant to grab your attention, but the story is disappointing overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRAB READ","review":"At the start of the novel you get a sense of impending doom, family secrets and interesting characters. The novel doesn't follow through. The story gets bogged down, spanning decades, with the too careful doses of subtly retelling the long ago \\"secret\\". With such a promising beginning it was a disappointing novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment to the fullest!","review":"I have read many books from Oprahs book club over the past few years, and I have never been let down until now. This book reminded me of something that could be found on the shelf at the supermarket. It jumped around way too much and it was unnessarily cheesy and predictable. I hope Christina Schwartz more luck in writing her next book. I only reccomend this book to people who thrive on daytime soap operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I'd never purchased this book","review":"Badly written and dull. Not sure I will even be able to finish it. The author has no gift or skill at telling a story and making characters interesting. Consequently the reader (ME) just does not care. Wish I could return it for something more engaging. Oprah's book club ? Must have read this when she decided to give up her syndicated show and start her own network - not her best decisions !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oprah knows how to pick them!!","review":"I adored this book. It was suspenceful, I plan on reading it again very soon. I love all of the books Oprah picks for her club!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great thriller!","review":"I really enjoyed this story. The author pulls you into the lives of Aunt Mandy, you can't help loving and disliking her at the same time. Ruth is the main character, the story takes you through her childhood friendships and her revelation of what happened the night she almost drowned. I could not put it down once I started."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow","review":"Im 16 and I found this book to be awesome It touched me in a way I cant even begin to explain it was excellent full of secrets lost loves and lost lives anyone who loves a good book should read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting.","review":"This book was not what I was expecting. I don't like the way it changes back and forth between the characters,and time lines. It seems really drawn out, and wasn't a book that I just couldn't put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book Club Selection","review":"This was one of Oprah's book club choices. It takes place on a lake in Wisconsin between the first and second world wars. Amanda is a nurse who comes back home to help care for her sister, Mathilda, and her daughter, Ruth. Her sister Mathilda is found drowned under the ice of the lake, and Amanda is left to care for her daughter, Ruth, as well as Mathilda's war-injured husband. There is a lot of suspense in the story. It jogs back and forth between Amanda's point of view and Ruth's, while also skipping back and forth from the past to the present time. It is a complex book worthy of book club discussion, although I was not terribly fond of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and implausible","review":"At the end of the paperback version that I purchased and read there were comments by the author. Scharz wrote that the plot was the most difficult element for her and so the book had too much plot. I can see why she thought the plot was the most difficult element because I don't think the book had much plot. The associations among the some of the characters and some of the key actions by characters were implausble. The writing was good but the story-telling was cryptic. I'm originally from Wisconsin and I bought the book mostly because the author grew up in Wisc and the story was set in Wisc. Using these criteria to choose a book was a mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"It could have, but it didn't","review":"The story could have taken soo many twists and turns to keep it enticing, but it didn't. I kept reading hoping that in the next page it would get me jump started, but it didn't. I thought up of soo many fascinating endings that could have saved the story, but it didn't do that either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-hum","review":"Yet another overrated Oprah's Book Club book. I don't get it. This novel was entertaining enough to keep my attention until the end, but overall I was left to think wonder what all the hype is. There was not one thing surprising or overwhelmingly exciting about the plot. Certain characters' story lines were unceremoniously abandoned midstream to focus on the main characters again. I'll leave a summary of the book to other reviewers. My conclusion, is read it if you want, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT BEGINNING BUT THE REST WAS BORING","review":"This book started off well and I thought that it would have been really good but after the first 3 chapters, I couldn't get into it because the book was disappointing later on, and boring in spots. It was allright but not worth the time to spend reading it. GOT to be A BIG DISSAPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabbed me and held me under!","review":"What an interesting novel. Very well-written, and thought-provoking. Yes, it is a little formulaic, and all the familial connections seem to be a bit overwrought, but I found myself thinking about the characters while working, and I kept coming back to the book. It had a mysterious charm, much like Mathilda's hair waving underwater, that grabbed me and kept me under its spell. The \\"secrets\\" are perhaps a bit too telegraphed - you could see them coming on the horizon. But there was always just enough of a twist that the resolution was slightly different from what I expected. I have to say that when I saw this was an Oprah book, I reconsidered finishing it. But I did, and that will teach me to be a little more open-minded in the future! All in all, a book full of dark, damp, murky imagery, and thoughtful writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful debut!","review":"I don't believe I have every read a first novel that has been nearly as impressive as Shwarz's Drowning Ruth. It is a story about love, family, children and making something out of unbearable circumstances. The characters are numerous and well-developed. The story is captivating and suspenseful - the reader only finding out in bits and pieces what has actually happened as Schwarz swiftly switches between the past and the present. I would liken her writing to Anita Shreve if anyone; fun and interesting yet inundated by deep issues of morality, shame and love. Finished easily in a few days, I anxiously await her next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment.","review":"I've read ever Oprah pick and was very disappointed in this one. I felt the characters were weak and uninteresting and the plot was too predictable. I didn't feel any of the characters were likeable and was very happy when I finished the book. I'm beginning to get the feeling that Oprah isn't actually reading these before they are recommended!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Tried","review":"This book irritated me on many levels; not that the writing was poor or the plot weak. In fact, the plot, the premise, the writing were good--unfortunately the characters didn't pull it off or keep me interested because they were all kinda indifferent or unlikable.I read somewhere the number one reason people keep reading a work of fiction--regardless of plot--is because they care about someone in the book.In this book, I was hoping they would all drown by the end of the story..."},{"rating":"2","title":"----- What Secrets We Keep ------","review":"Loved this book! First off, great book to read in the dead of winter. Curl up & get comfy 'cause it gets your attention.Schwarz switches from the past back to the present a lot, so once you have that down, it's easy to become absorbed within.The characters are so true to form for this near-turn-of-the-century tale that you seem to walk among them! The secrets they hold shed light on what it was like living during that era, especially as a woman. Yet, just the same, it reminded me of the common bonds that all women share. The emotions were shockingly real & raw at times.And please, don't be fooled by that title. I was intrigued by it, but I think some might shy away from it because of the title. This is not some antique horror tale.Take some time to escape with this wonderful author! Her style is creepingly effective throughout! You'll see!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It","review":"I have read many reviews were people have said they didnt like this book.Im glad i didnt listen.I really liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close But No Cigar","review":"This was a truly amazing book. The only reason I didn't give it the full five stars is because it took me a while to get into the flow of it. I believe Christina Schwarz is an extremely talented writer. The way the story is written, it gives all of the characters' point of view. You hear what everyone has to say, whether it is memories or daily life. Some of the characters ask questions that really make you wonder, make you think, if what has been told to you so far in the book is really true. Once I found the flow of the book, I could not put it down. I would definitely recommend this book to anybody who enjoys a creative, slightly twisted, plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow from the Library......","review":"I have bought all of Oprah's book club selections and I honestly have to say that this one was the worst so far. I was so upset that I spent good money on such a pitiful tale. I couldn't even finish it, which is rare for me because I want to get my money's worth out of what I purchase, but honestly, I became so apathetic toward the story that I just couldn't go on. I sure do wish I had borrowed it from my local library instead, then I could have returned it without losing anything but time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talented writer; So-so story!","review":"Okay, I admit it - I just wasn't crazy about this book. The whole idea of a mentally-ill and controlling aunt (Amanda) ruining the life of her little niece (Ruth) after the girl's mother (Mathilda) mysteriously fell through the ice and drowned one cold winter eve just disturbed me. ...And the ending was even more disappointing, leaving me with a tremendous feeling of hopelessness!This was Ms. Schwarz's first novel, and I did find her to be a talented writer in that her literary style was intriguing. The narrative alternates between the 3rd-person and the 1st-person. The 1st-person segments were from both Ruth and Amanda's perspective and I liked these parts best. It was this style of writing that kept me interested, despite my apathy toward the story. Because of her obvious talent, I would read a second novel by the same author if the story itself interests me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drown This Book","review":"There is only one word to describe this book, and that is GRIM! The main character, Amanda, is manipulative, cold, and selfish. I only finished the book because I was hoping that something bad was going to happen to her, and I thought that would at least satisfy me. I never felt any compassion for any of the characters portrayed in the book, with the exception of Mattie, who, in my opinion should have pulled Amanda into the water with her. How this made the bestsellers list amazes me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately a disappointment","review":"Christina Schwarz is obviously a gifted writer. Her lucid prose delivered the sounds, taste, and smells of that farm on the water right to my senses. Not many writers have that magic touch. Unfortunately, such beautiful writing led to a terribly disappointing and anti-climatic ending. It was almost like the author suddenly realised that she needed to come up with an ending and couldn't quite figure out what to do. Or maybe she just got tired and \\"stopped.\\" The other minor problem was with the throwaway storyline involving Clement Owens. But it is the ending that caused the biggest disappointment in this otherwise lovely book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written but depressing as hell.","review":"Read this for a book club.

Going back to romances now so I don't have to deal with any more suffering than absolutely required."},{"rating":"2","title":"You won't want to put it down!","review":"What a terrific book! You will not want to put this one down. The characters all seem a bit odd. Amanda will scare you and keep you wondering. You will find yourself feeling a bit sorry for Ruth at times and Carl also. Schwarz writes beautifully and very detailed. The whole storyline was fascinating. It will keep you guessing. I was thrilled to see in print, many of the places and settings where I have lived all my life. I can honestly say I will never be able to look at \\"the island\\" and lake here in Wisconsin without getting the chills. This book gave me the chills, you can expect that. Christine Schwarz is an extremely talented writer. I'm really looking forward to reading her next book. I highly recommend reading Drowning Ruth. You will really enjoy this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now featured on my personal Top Ten list . . .","review":"I rarely write in reviews of books, but \\"Drowning Ruth\\" moved me to add my voice to the crowd. This is by far the most interesting and engrossing novel i have read in a very long time. I love it when I find myself sinking into the story, into the characters, and that is exactly the feeling I got when reading this novel. The writing is so good that it carried me away, to another place altogether, to a cold Wisconsin lake in the winter. Christina Schwarz paints such a compelling picture of the sisters' relationship that I felt almost a part of the scene. In fact, all of her characters are so vivid that i feel as though I would recognize them walking down the street. And the story itself is a page-turner. Anyway, BUY IT!! READ IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PAGE TURNER FROM THE VERY START!","review":"This is a GREAT book with lots of plot twists and turns! If you want an easy read that will keep you guessing until the end then this is the book for you! I have three children under the age of seven so my reading time is limited...but this book was definetly a priority! I loved the way that it was told in the first and third person....just goes to show that the same event can often be seen in many different ways! READ THIS BOOK:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A collage of ideas","review":"The book offers some new plot points but they were not fully tied together in way that would be expected in this type of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I was at first a bit confused with the writing style, but the more I read it, I caught on and by the end of the book I was singing praises of the style. This is a story I couldn't put down. For me, the more I think back over the story, the more I appreciate it. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary","review":"One of the finest written books I've read in years, this is a stark, taut literary novel--as much character study as thriller. The reader is immersed in the characters' world and psyche. A great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Modern Jane Austin?","review":"The story reminds me of Jane Austin novels but less interesting. Perhaps that is because the story setting is more modern and closer to home. Regardless of why, the story of affairs, unwed mothers and [illegitimate] children from a woman's point of view is trite. The story of mysterious murder was interesting however. I cant recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read... forgettable plot","review":"This book was a fun, quick read but a very forgettable one. The story of family intrigue, farm life and WWI America has been told many times in different ways, some which are more effective and impacting. Frankly, I did not find this book to be innovative or unique. It is a great attempt for someone learning how to become a writer. But it dissappoints the well-read person. It would be a good book to read on the beach during summertime but that is all it's worth for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y did so many people rate this high?","review":"Save your money.

I would not have finished it if I were not a person who must finish what I begin.It has been a while since I read the book, and I had to look at other reviews to refresh my memory about the book. I did remember the sense of place. The author described places so well that I felt as if I were there.However, I was not able to relate well to any of the characters. I guess I am grateful for that. What a depressing cast of characters!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"I just finished Drowning Ruth and I was completly unimpressed. I've been looking forward to reading this novel for awhile. It earned two stars for an interesting beginning and fairly decent writing. The problems with the book are that 1) There is no mystery, you know from the second chapter what occured between Amanda, her sister and Ruth. Consequently you know exactly how the story will unfold; and 2) It's way too overlong. The entire middle 150 pages was repetitve and boring. This novel would have made a wonderful short story, but as a full length book it is unsatisfying. I strongly urge you to pick-up one of the other fabulous books that Oprah has recommended over the last few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, slow moving.","review":"I found this book to be completely predictable.

Unfortunately nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow to start...hang in there...","review":"EVERYONE I knew that read this one couldn't put it down...maybe that was too much hype for me. It was lacking some things for me...one being the main character Amanda. She was a very flat character to me and I had a hard time caring enough about her to read on. I didn't care for the style of jumping back and forth from the past to the present and from one characters perspective to the next. This was mainly due to the fact that I would go days at a time w/o reading it and then get confused about where I was at.It took me nearly 2 weeks to get passed the first 100+ pages, to a point where I felt I was finally getting to the heart of the story. It was an interesting \\"mystery\\" and the secrets that are revealed about \\"that night\\" were worth struggling through the first part of the book to get to, but I was never on the edge of my seat for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family Secrets","review":"This was a terrific book.

By the time i started reading the book, I was going through a reading phase...you could say. Reading a book a day for the summer months. A month later...I am still reading this book. Sure, I have read other books during the month...I just can't seem to finish this book. It's more of chore than anything else. I have 70 pages left of it...and have vowed not to read another book until I finish this book. And it's killing me.It's slow.Too quiet.THE SILENCE!I am giving it two stars (and not one) only because I have lived with the characters so long...they are kind of like family now. You know...how you love your sisters but don't like them.Just stay away from this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Literary Thriller","review":"This was a very good book! I really enjoyed how all the different pieces fit so neatly together by the end- though the ending was not quite as far-reaching as I would have liked! I really liked the relationship between Ruth and Arthur, and would have liked to have seen it develop even more. The structure of the book was quite unique, and though original, it really fit the story well. The setting was great, too, and played an integral role in this novel. It really fell under the sort of literary thriller sub-genre - I would certainly read another book by this author!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Show, don't tell.","review":"I suppose there are Oprah readers and non-Oprah readers. If I had known, in fact, that this was one of Oprah's choices I would probably have avoided it. I'm not sure when a dark and complex plot became enough to recommend a book, but I wish it hadn't happened. DROWNING RUTH gave me no one to love, no one to follow. The point of view changes so often that I lost contact with all the characters. In addition, a number of important plot points are told in narrative, rather than in dramatic scenes. It's frustrating, and it's dull.A far superior novel is Philippa Gregory's 1993 book FALLEN SKIES, set in about the same period. Gregory is masterful in her presentation, and she doesn't tell us anything. According to Hemingway's dictum, she shows it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Oprah book.","review":"Another great pick by Oprah. I have to give it to her, she knows how to pick them. This is a great book that is a fast read. There are twists and turns that you aren't expecting which makes it more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm shocked so many people liked this book","review":"I agree that the writting style was interesting at times (at other times it was downright odd). I agree that the characters weren't the worst I've ever read (they weren't the greatest either, by ANY means! I didn't care if they lived or died).There wasn't one character I could \\"root\\" for or identify with; even Ruth was annoying at times. The pace of the novel was slooooow; not \\"artsy\\" slow, not \\"I'm making a point\\" slow, not \\"symbolic\\" slow, not even \\"setting the mood\\" slow.....I think that's what the author was aiming for, but it just didn't do it for me. It was snail-pace slow, end of story.A good first attempt on the author's part; that's never easy. But why Oprah and half the world are raving about it is beyond me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A REAL PAGE TURNER!","review":"I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT STARTED OUT KIND OF SLOW, BUT BEFORE LONG I COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN. I FOUND IT KIND OF DEPRESSING AT THE BEGINNING AND WASN'T SURE IF I WANTED TO FINISH IT, BUT AM GLAD I DID."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the minority","review":"I wanted to like this book. I love fiction set during this period, and I have an affection for *A Northern Light* (young adult novel also set during this period, which I used as a reading selection for my high school students). This book, however, just seemed ponderous by comparison.The plot moves slowly, and the characters are rather unlikeable. The male characters are under-developed and under-used for the plot. The switching points-of-view don't move smoothly and cause confusion, rather than clarification. Mostly, though, I just found myself skimming (rather than reading) large parts of the text because I was bored and wanted to get to the end.Divergent points of view are difficult to write. If you want a masterful use of this technique,read Faulkner or Shirley Ann Grau's *The Keeper's of the House.* Leave this on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most intriguing books I've ever read","review":"When I discovered that Drowning Ruth was Christina Schwarz's first novel, you could have knocked me over with a feather!

I am very much looking forward to reading more from her! --Nicole"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible book!!!","review":"Depressing things happenning to depressing people. Do you want to see the story of a life that is misery after torment after trauma?

The author should have detailed more of the era and the hardships. Too bad, had a great start."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surprising disappointment","review":"I didn't expect to be so terribly disappointed with this book, I purchased it even before Oprah chose it for her book club, based simply on what I read on the front inside cover. One would expect this book to be powerful based on the reviews it's receiving, yet I found it incredibly dreary, slow and uninteresting. I felt no empathy whatsoever for the characters, and getting through this book was basically a chore, but I'm stubborn like that. Needless to say, the glowing reviews and the position on the bestseller list puzzle me. . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drowning Ruth","review":"This is not the kind of book I would normally read. My reading tastes run to mysteries or spy/political thrillers. Someone had suggested \\"drowning Ruth\\" to me, so I decided to give some time to a new experience. I loved this book. It kept me up for nights on end. The time period and the characters just grew on me. I could hardly wait for the next chapter. When it was over, I wanted to know more... What I found so revealing is the fact that people are more or less the same today as they were years ago. The same fears, the same hopes, the same secrets. I also appreciated that you could use your own brain to fill in the details. No dirty words or explicit sex scenes. I would recommend this book to all age groups. I promise you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mental illness","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. The relationships between the women were well developed in the story, the men less discussed. The search to know what really happened is good and many of the accounts near the water keep one in suspense thinking something may go wrong in that scene. Underlying the various handling of events by the female characters is a sense of some type of mental illness. The mother has times of needing complete quiet and is once mentioned as beating her head on the floor among other descriptions. The actions of the daughters in their adult life arose from this early exposure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A compelling story with many twists and turns","review":"The characters seem to come to life and immediately the reader feels like part of the story.

This was a waste of time since, even after I got my answer, I still cared nothing for Mathilda or any of these other demented characters. As a child, I was forced to read books all the way through; after this, I'll act on my own good sense and quit sooner. After all, I could have been reading about characters I want to know. As one of your reviewers already pointed out, these people are quite ill; as often happens when one starts out to criticize someeone else, I've said more about my own lack of judgment than that of C. Schwartz. As for Oprah, she really should take a literature course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Books are sacred but I threw this one away.","review":"I disliked this book so much, I abandoned it at a bus stop in San Francisco. For some reason, reading this book felt like watching a reality tv show, which I hate. I felt it was pandering and ponderous.

It is because this wonder writer draws each so perfectly that we feel what they do. While angry at the percieved motivations of one, there is also the traits that allow you to understand how they may reason out their twisted behavior. I read this once a year and each time the ending takes my breath, makes me cry, makes me think about our own capacity to act in behalf of those we love in ways we can't begin to imagine unless necessity is forced upon us. Read this in the warmpth of summer by a lake or in the depth of winter by a fire. If you have a sister you love, keep her close in mind as you read this book.

I'll admit, it catches your attention at the beginning, and keeps you guessing, but the guessing game becomes the central problem with this book, it just goes on and on, and when you finally arrive at the conclusion, you are not at all shocked. The way the author flips back and forth between characters and time frames is at best annoying. Spend your time reading something more fulfilling and exciting and less nerve racking."},{"rating":"2","title":"truely phonominal","review":"This well written book, grips your imagination, pulls at your heart, and plays with your mind. The author's knowledge of the area gave her the oppurtunity to give vivid and accurate accounts of the Wisconsin landscape and harsh frigid winters. The book catches the reader form the first page and intrigues them until the last words. The situations provide for an interesting plot full of unexpected turns and an interesting conclusion. The book is truely phonominal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointment","review":"After having read several of the books highlighted in \\"Oprah's Book Club,\\" and enjoying them immensely, I expected to be similarly impressed with \\"Drowning Ruth.\\" I was disappointed. I found the plot tedious, most of the characters shallow and unbelieveable, and the symbolism crude and obvious. I have learned my lesson. Never choose reading material based solely on its inclusion in Oprah's Book Club and the resulting hooplah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too predictable","review":"After hearing about Drowning Ruth on the Oprah show, and how much she loved it, I couldn't wait to read it. I finally (after waiting over a week) got to check it out from the library. I've never been so disappointed! It was a very predictable plot and was very hard to follow going back and forth between time periods and from first to third person. It took me the whole three weeks the library gave me to read it all because there were times I found it downright boring - it took about 100 pages to even get into it - but I kept reading, looking for the \\"surprises and twists\\" in the story... they never happened! Parts of it were \\"ok\\", but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"As an avid reader, perhaps I am getting too picky. Drowning Ruth has a predictable storyline--I once watched a movie with the same 'horrifying' family secret. Schwarz's characters are shallow with a lack of insight and development. I was left wondering where a few of the characters went and why there was no depth to the ones that were left behind. Amanda has no redeeming qualities---her motive to 'do the right thing' was selfish, and ultimately cruel. How is the reader supposed to understand and sympathize with her--even a little? I recommend you read a superior book with 'Ruth' in the title: Jane Hamilton's The Book of Ruth'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read","review":"This is a great read. The characters are subtley developed. The book speaks to weaknesses in all of us. It describes much of the meodramas of our daily lives that are so familiar. The white lie and occational deception. I doubt there are few that cannot relate to this book, or few that this book would not invoke some memory of something treachorous. It also shows the lengths a person will go to in order to protect one's own. In short, your time is not wasted reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Start.. But tThe Rest Was Bad","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. There were some good reviews but I found that the story could not deliver.It started off good, a good murder mystery, I was excited to see what would unfold... I kept waiting for the book to get exciting or suspenseful or to get attached to one of the characters but it never happened.The whole book was, to me, a lot of filler and the end was anticlimactic"},{"rating":"2","title":"life improving","review":"I enjoyed this book in that it left some mystery until the end while the characters' lives tended to improve-they overcame their pasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't wait for the movie--it would be a snoozer!","review":"I dislike giving a bad review to any author but this time, I really cannot say BUY THE BOOK when I don't mean it. It took me forever to read this. There was so much talk throughout the book about Ruth's Drowning (title tells you that this happened) and I kept thinking I may have missed where this story told of it. I thought I slept through it. Not until toward the end do you find out when, why and how it happened. The voice(s) of the story teller were too many. The story jumped all over and was very frustrating to follow. I hope the author's next book is more fulfilling than \\"Drowning Ruth\\" was. Just please tell your story in one voice instead of several and you may have me hooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"distracting craft problems - I agree","review":"I wholeheartedly agree with the \\"reader from NYC\\", although I rate the book higher than one star - mainly because I wanted to know how it ended. The back-and-forth between scenes made for a very confusing read; that style is used in many books, just not used well here, I couldn't start reading again w/out reviewing the last couple of pages. The story itself was interesting, to remember how unaccepting society was of women that would choose a different path. And the characters were developed well. I would give it 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but slow","review":"This book describes the guilt and pain of Amanda and how those emotions affected her entire family and even those within her community.Although the book starts well, I almost quit reading half way through it. The plot lines move slowly, and there are sudden jumps in time. You'll be reading along in one chapter, you run across a break, and the next thing you know several years have passed. However, you don't even know that for several paragraphs, so it's too easy to get distracted and confused. I also think too many sub-plots and the recollections of the characters were not always expanded upon enough, either.I did think that Amanda, Mathilda and Ruth are well developed characters, and you do feel sympathy for them all. However, I would have liked to see Ruth's father, Carl, and Imogene, Ruth's friend (and something else to the story...) more developed. Imogene especially- I felt like I didn't really know here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drowning everyone","review":"The title is very symbolic. It does not only refer to the physical drowning as experienced by some of the characters, but also to the suffocating love & possesiveness of Ruth's aunt towards her. It also stands for Amanda's drowning in her own secrets & personal internal turmoils - a choice she made to protect herself instead of telling the truth. It also refers to Carl's frantic search for truth like a drowning man clawing for support & life. In the midst of these all, we see Ruth desperately wanting to be free but finding herself clutching to the one thing that actually holds her back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible story!","review":"Incredible writing, engaging story plot. I have not been so interested in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drowning Amanda","review":"First, let me say that I know alot of people have given this book a great review and that's fine, as everyone has their own opinion and their own take on every book that is read. Personally, I would have liked it if Amanda had drowned instead of her sister. It is hard to read a book where you seriously dislike one of the main characters from the very beginning. And it never gets better, if anything it gets worse. Don't get me wrong, this is a very well written book, which is mandatory for me. However, I found the character of Amanda to be so awful that I have to rate it very low simply because of the intense dislike of her. She is weak, distrustful, manipulative and conniving. This is the first time I have had to rate a book so low simply because of character flaw, but it really distracted me from the rest of the book. I did not like it at all and really wonder why it ever got to be an \\"Oprah\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've read this at least three times.","review":"I haven't found an emotional thriller to beat \\"Drowning Ruth\\". The fact that I could get so involved with the characters that I wanted to shout at them is a credit to Schwarz's style. The plot twists -so surprising-yet not, in retrospect, reminded me of the last chapters of \\"Rebecca\\".I'm sure this will remain one of favorite reads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"The author makes you want to just know what the heck happened. She doesn't tell you until the end, so you keep reading on. It's a good story, although at times I found myself skipping paragraphs just to know already what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remarkable","review":"What a great first novel! It's really a mystery, one that unfolds in the most interesting way. It's like the movie Memento, or the India wedding trip episode of Seinfeld. You start out knowing the end result: someone's drowned--but someone named Ruth is alive in the book--and you won't find out how it plays out until the very end. I loved the setting, and found the austere writing tone really appropriate to the time period. I am from the midwest, and found the author was spot on in describing the seasons and weather and how lives play out according to it. I really enjoy how the author tangles up the lives of the characters, and this is a remarkable first effort. If Schwarz keeps this up, she'll be the American answer to Margaret Atwood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written First Book.","review":"Drowning Ruth combine good character development with page turning action.

I love historical romances and in my nearly 20 years of reading them I have never not finished a book...until now. \\"Viscount Vagabond\\" is AWFUL. Literally nothing happens. NOTHING. There's no romance, I can't understand why this man would help some pale, fragile governess and take her to his sister's home and then all of a sudden she runs away, and he searches for this stranger for days and days, yeah right. In the rare conversations they have, she is a preachy, boring, prudish, dull idiot. He atleast has some personality, but he seems to always be trying to stifle it b/c it overwhelms her delicate sensibilities. Everytime I expected something to happen it just didn't. This was my first Loretta Chase book and most likely my last. I only made it as far into the book as i did by skimming through.

I contacted the manufacturer to complain about the early and quick demise of their product and request a replacement. They refused. They told me to contact the selling store for a free replacement and that the mfg has a replacement agreement in place with retailers. The manager of Ace Hardware innitially told me he has never heard of such agreement. Ace however DID exchange the can for me at no charge. The manufacturer also told me that the container is a \\"TEMPORARY CONTAINER\\" !!! They advised me to transfer remaining product into an air tight container! It is a little too late for that now it appears. I'd ONLY buy this product if I intended to use it ALL in one day. It works fine when the can is first opened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"Purchased this item after reading other reviews.

Possibly the surface smoothness or aluminum was the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst of the genre","review":"This book is a great example of the worst romance writing - cliches, trite dialog, preditable situations, implausible resolution.

I bought it after I got my Harsch fermentation crock and I do not find it very useful. There are 8 recipes for fermentation for different vegetables (in addition to two different variations for sauerkraut)and about half of the book has 9 food recipes all for sauerkraut (ie pineapple sauerkraut, reuben, etc) with a full page color glossy photo on the opposite page of the recipe (wasteful in my opinion). There is a section on adding herbs and spices and it is unhelpful as it does not give details for many of them on how to use/prepare them for fermentation. There is an interesting section on Healing with Lactic Acid Fermentation, but that is about it. The biggest reason I do not like this book is that there is little troubleshooting detail or any help/suggestions for fermentation when the conditions are less than ideal."},{"rating":"1","title":"More objective info available elsewhere","review":"This book adequately describes how to ferment vegetables such as cabbage with a fermentation crock, but the same information could be obtained with a quick search of the Internet. There is no discussion about the risks of fermenting, and I wonder of the authors' enthusiasm for the \\"miracle healing powers\\" of fermented vegetables (discussed in considerable detail) might be clouding their objectivity. The authors emphasize the use of a particular brand of fermentation crock, and I was disappointed that alternative techniques were not discussed in much detail."},{"rating":"1","title":"not much help to a beginner","review":"Chapter after chapter on the probable health benefits of fermented vegetables, but very little as far as procedure and recipes.

The transistions are fluid and the song selection makes good sense. The lyrics are intelligent and paint a deliberate picture.Not being familiar with Mark's style I was pleasantly satisfied with this compilation.

It really pulls at your hearstrings at times I had to hold my breath reading parts of the book for fear Ravyen would just let go of his one true love. I found this book wonderful for being a \\"vampire romance,\\" novel. I would have to say a few times though it almost seemed like something out of beauty and the beast but I would definately read it again.

The narrator also has a lovely voice and does the different accents (Irish, French/Russian, Italian) very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Bad","review":"This was my first \\"vampire romance\\" and will likely be my last. I have never read anything so contrived since a Barbara Cartland novel. The plot revolves around Rayven and Rhianna who insist on repeating their paltry emotions until you wish to strangle them both in order to get some action. There is no heightened suspense and I had a difficult time finding the climax.On top of that, the author has no descriptive style. If she is going to describe the vampire's longing for food and how he examines the dishes placed before the heroine, she cannot serve Mutton and Potatoes 3 time in as many chaptors. It may seem small but it is an excellent example of the poor planning and a certain laziness in the author's attempt.check it out at the library - don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"This is the first book of Ashley's I have ever read but it will not be the last. I loved the fact that it was a simple love story often times in historical romances there has to be some sort of external mystery or other action taking place besides the love story. Ashley creates an endearing tale about a vampire in love with a human. There were instances where the characters became a little to repetitve but besides that i would give it five stars. I would encourange anyone who loves vampire novels or historical romance to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special","review":"Predictable and tedious ... there's nothing special about this book. Extremely repetitive writing ... much of the book is rehashing of previous sections of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it.","review":"It started out okay until I read that Rhianna, the heroine,was only fifteen. As a mother of a young teenager, 13, I found it really, really, really, really hard to get into a book about a fifteen year old having a relationship with a man. I stopped reading it, then would pick it up again, then stop, then pick it up again. It usually takes me less than two days to read a book this length, and it took me almost three weeks to get through this one. Her age was a major concern for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"so frustrating","review":"I really wanted to like this book but I was so frustrated by the wooden, one-dimensional characters. Amy, the elephant, is an interesting subject; however, slogging through this poorly written story to learn about her just isn't worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amy is in Arkansas","review":"The true story of Bob and his good natured Amy. It is a wonderful read for anyone who loves animals but Amy's story did not really end the way the book implies. Instead, Amy resides at Riddle's Elephant & Wildlife Sanctuary in Arkansas. I don't believe the author intentionally misleads the reader but I think the plans just fell through in the end and everyone decided it was best. I saw first-hand the excellent care and freedom she is given at Riddle's and approve whole-heartedly of the true ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book You Will Never Forget","review":"This story will make you laugh, make you cry, make you wonder but most of all, amaze you. You will learn things about elephants that will make you want to welcome them into your own family. They are so human like in a big way. I am a horse owner and expected to be intrigued by the introduction of an elephant to a ranch. Little did I know that an elephant could capture my heart. Very easy and interesting reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could not love an elephant!","review":"Since I was a child I have always gravitated to books and true stories of animals and their encounters with man. This book is so well written that as a reader I felt I had truly gotten to know Amy. Though this story is not as exciting and eventful as \\"Modoc,\\" it is better written. I'm going to buy several copies now and get my Christmas shopping out of the way in July!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book","review":"The Cowboy and his elephant is an exellent book for any reader. No matter what kind of book you like to read this book will satisfy your interest. This book is about a cowboy (the Marlboro Man) that owns a ranch. A transporter from africa comes and asks to store some animals. Bob (the cowboy) instantly falls in love with a special elephant. They have an interesting relationship that can only be described in the words of author Malcom MacPhearson. Sadly the fun must end the elephant ,that bob names Amy, gets too big for Bob's ranch. She finds happiness at another place though, when she starts to work in a circus. If you are looking for a book to read this is definately the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great story","review":"I loved Water for Elephants so much that I had to read about more elephants.

As someone who is quite familiar with this issue and has read a considerable amount about it, I do feel qualified to assess the worthiness of this book. This book is really intended for those who wish to gain an understanding of the Irish Troubles. This book does not go into as extensive of detail as Tim Pat Coogan's books (e.g. IRA Man, The Troubles, etc.) which one could find as being difficult to follow if they are not overly familiar with this issue. This is a well written interprettation of The Troubles and its value is enhanced by the useful insightfulness of the author which seperates this book from others that just recite the facts of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"a rather superficial look at things","review":"I think the author missed the boat here. He apparently had access to a number of Sinn Feiners and Republicans with no doubt interesting stories to tell. But he chose to focus on himself and a lot of ancient history. I think Toolis's book \\"Rebel Hearts\\" is far better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better books out there","review":"I agree with those who found this book not very informative. McFerran talked to far too few people, wasted about a quarter of the book retelling Irish history, and frankly rathered embarrassed me with his naive viewpoint.

He's certainly sincere and well-intentioned, but read Toolis, Coogan, Adams, Belfrage and many others for far more thorough interviews, detail, and analysis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apologist for murderers","review":"Another book written seeking to find reasons for IRA terrorists planting bombs in public places ie Oxford Street Bus Depot,La Mon House Restaurant,Enniskillen Rememberance Day,Shankill Fish Shop.This seems to be a book that gives excuses for murder,torture,maiming and hate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smoke, fog and mirrors without touching on the murders.","review":"McFerran is certainly impressed with his comparisons between the American and Irish revolutionary movements. He forgets that Washington and Jefferson never took a family man hostage and strapped him into a bomb ladden car or detonated a car bomb in a shopping district of London. There is no excuse for these actions and it has only served to hurt the republican movement. He never even met with the heirarchy of the political movement in Ireland yet takes the views of street merchants as the word and philosophy of the leadership.

I have the Murray Perahia recording (Sony Classical) of Brahms's Quartet for Piano and Strings in g minor (with the Amadeus Quartet), his rhapsodies, intermezzo, and capriccio.

To my ears, he wasn't often singing from the heart, but maybe he was. I'd rate about 80% of this set 5 star, but some of it is lamentable. Thus, 4 stars. When he brought in some backup singers to coo in the background, that was terrible. Attempts at sounding like Nashville country didn't work for me. I didn't much like the snare drum.

The section on the Cultists of Ecstacy was possibly the best, giving desperately needed insights into the most stereotyped tradition. Has some great hints at Ecstatic factions, too. The Dreamspeaker section is satisfactory, and it stresses a very authentic core threaed for this diverse tradition: vision. The Verbena section, from the second oldest of the Tradition books, is also good; if all the White Wolf game books' superfluous stories were as good as the Verbena's, I wouldn't complain about them!

Personally I give the Zen a lower rating than the iPod, but the Zen has price and a back lit LCD in its favor.OK so what I dislike about this player. First of all the battery lasts maybe 5 hours rather than the advertised 8 and the software is horrible! I had to buy 3rd party software just to keep my sanity. The included headphones are also decent sound but they are way uncomfortable. The buttons aren't very well oriented on the device - it's easy to shut off in your pocket but you cannot change tracks without pulling it out.I am very happy with my purchase, I just think Creative has a few little kinks to work out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A small but great mp3-player","review":"I haven't tried iPod, but to me Jukebox Zen is the mp3-player on the market. I haven't encountered any problems and it has worked like a dream. The 20GB storage capacity is more than enough to store your mp3 collection (well, at least mine :). The default software for communicating between the computer and Zen - Creative PlayCenter 3 - isn't that bad, but it could be better. The audio quality is great (for my untrained ears). Compared to iPod I must say that even though iPod might be better, it hasn't got a USB possibility and I don't have FireWire, so no iPod for me. But enough of this, test it for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I bought my Nomad Zen Jukebox a few months ago. After treating it very carfully it unexpectedly froze on me. I called customer support and they were extremely unhelpful. This is a very very fragile player. On Nomad's website they even say that you shouldn't jog with this player. This mp3 player is terrible and you will regret buying it when it breaks on you in 6 months. (Their warranty only lasts 3)"},{"rating":"1","title":"good player, bad connector","review":"I am now on my second Zen - ready to return it also. After bringing the first one home, I ripped my entire collection (~10GB) of music onto the player. I then put the carrying case on it, plugged in the headphones and took it with me everywhere I went. In my car, I would use the car adaptor. After 2 days, the headphone connector went bad. Music would play out of one speaker (mono), instead of producing a nice stereo sound. I then realized the carrying case did not fit the player very well and it put a lot of stress on the headphone jack. I exchanged this for a new Zen. I did not use the carrying case with my second Zen. Again, after two days, the headphone connector jack went bad. I am returning this one for an iPod, since Apple uses quality parts. I really do like the ease of use and the \\"one-hand\\" design, though. I would just like to use it for what it is intended - listening to music. This really isn't possible when partial sound is produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends what you want","review":"I thought that this was going to be a good product that i would have for a long time. But i thought wrong. The zen is good comparing to other mp3 players but no match to the i pod.I wish i had gotten ine instead of this. Im not giving this 5 stars because well the damn thing broke. I dont know how because i didnt drope it and it was only one year old. Anyway the new gen Ipod is AMAZING and only 50 bucks more.

First of all, to get a pretty standard item for all wireless/portable product, a car adapter, you're going to have to shell out an extra $40 and this is for any of Creative's Nomads since they purposely made the input voltage a non-standard one of 5V. Secondly if you ask questions to tech support, they pretty much just answer questions you didn't even ask and ignore the one you really want answered. I had this issue both through e-mail and on the phone. Finally, during a phone call, I said, \\"So am I never going to know the answer to this question?\\" The tech guy ACTUALLY said something in regard to it making his call time average high, if he looks for the answer. To get a replacement battery, expect to pay around $120. $20 for diagnosis, $15 to ship it there and $85 for the battery itself. All of this just a couple months after it's 90 day warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"High pitch squeal and crashed after 6 months","review":"My player worked for about 6 months, but whenever I turned it on, before playing the first song, it would make this really awful high pitched squeaky jittering noise for about 20-30 seconds. Then, it played a few songs (5-10) and then it crashed. Also, the memory was really sporatic. The memory bar always fluctuated between 2 or 3 bars, but then, when initializing a song, it would dip down to 0 bars. If it didn't crash while initializing a song, it would start the song up, and the bars would read 2 or 3 again. Really annoying, but I lived with it. The last straw: I went on a road trip, and it crashed (as usual). I then charged it for at least 4 hours on the car charger, but it never turned on again.I hope the problems I had were just first early model problems (I got it when it was first released). I contacted customer service, but they were totally unhelpful. My suggestion is to keep the receipt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best firewire player out there for [the price]","review":"Overall I've been very happy with the Zen (Firewire/USB version).The battery life is good and the menu system is very intuitive.The signal to noise ratio is one of the best.Of course the small size is the main feature. Only the iPod is smaller. But a 20GB iPod is currently $...!Through the Creative s/w you can store non-audio files on the hard drive. This is handy for transporting large files from home to office.The only things I don't like about it are fairly trivial.- The ON button is recessed and can be difficult to reach.- The text on the LCD screen is a little on the small side.- You can only access the unit from a PC with the Creative s/w installed. It would be kind of nice to be able to access it as a normal Firewire drive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money - Do NOT buy","review":"Purchasing the NOMAD Jukebox has been one of the worst buying experiences I have ever had. This unit is EXTREMELY fragile. After experiencing problems with loading the software and ripping CDs, the entire O/S crashed after only 6 months. Unfortunately there is only a 3 month warranty. The customer service department is terrible, they were completely unsynpathetic, and there is no where in the company to even lodge a formal complaint. The cost to repair my unit was estimated at [money amount]. So after a [money amount]initial purchase, my unit was worthless after only 6 months. I have complained several times and filed a complaint with the BBB - but to no avail. Creative Labs has not even offered an apology - yet alone a refund or discount on another unit.DO NOT BUY A CREATIVE LABS MP3 PLAYER!!

I have gone through 2 of these babies, both of which died due to shock...and in my opinion, the \\"shocks\\" I gave were not all that shocking at all.

The definition is very precise, and the examples too. This book works like a mini dictionary.

The bad, you have limited skills you can use, you can only do 4 clones at the most, you can only play the others characters for like 5 second each, hear the annoying dubbed voice, but the worst, at least for me, is that every time you do a mission or enter a event, YOU HAVE TO SEE THE WHOOOOOOLE CINEMATIC OVER AND OVER AND OVER.

It has a fairly rapid overview (if you can call 500 pages rapid) of OS X's Graphic User Interface which is especially useful for Mac users upgrading to OS X.Then they provide a fantastic and detailed 700 page guide to the Unix underpinnings of the OS controllable from the command line from the perspective of a mac user.The book is perfect for anyone unafraid of the command line and wanting to learn the Unix side of things, whose power and elegant engineering is matched only by the inscrutibility of its naming practices and syntax.Although the first part of the book is well done, I think the 1200+ page volume is overkill for those who never want to see a command line sully their user experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible!","review":"This is the best single reference you'll need for Mac OS X Jaguar - buy it! As with the previous edition, it covers both the Aqua environment as well as Darwin. With the rapidly changing face of Darwin/X11, there are bound to be some things that change by the time you get this book - for example it was published only a few weeks before Apple released the beta version of their own X11 server with aqua window manager - so you won't find that in this book - but that's no problem - you might choose to stick with XDarwin anyway and install it as described. You'll learn as you go and the authors' brilliant writing styles make exploring the Darwin side of OS X a pleasure and a thrill - the essay on why LaTeX is better that WYSISYG is a great example - you'll want to trash Office and start programming in TeX immediately! This is a really great book and we should pay homage to the authors for the books' mere existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be good, but now is dated","review":"This book is for more advanced users. For example, unlike most OS X books that would cover file transfer protocol (ftp), by telling you how to download and upload to other sites, this book tells you how to setup your own sites.It is a longer book and covers subjects in more detail than other OS X books I've read.I own this book, but it covers OS 10.1 which is too old. I recommend that you buy a newer version of this book that matches the version of OS X that you will be using.1st Ed 10.1, 2nd Ed. 10.2, 3rd Ed. 10.3, and 4th Ed. 10.4"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a haystack full of needles","review":"The index of this book is very inadequate. It's the size of my Subaru yet the index is very short and has no references to things like routing, routers etc. The index for NetInfo Manager which is central to the control of OSX refers to two pages that only refer to it as a method of enabling the root password. If you have to leaf through the entire 1400 pages to find what your looking for you will run out of time very quickly. For my part, anything with a menu is self evident, anything complicated tells you to read the man pages, which, anyone with any salts has already done.

The proportional size was very interesting as for a 4 year kid it have size and ergonomic of a full size Leica camera in adult hands. Being a Leica replica toy and the price tag, I was expecting some \\"Leica\\" style build quality. But it's not the case! Build quality it's very poor for what you pay.

Originally I bought this camera on the shear reason of my faith in German engineering, especially with companies like Leica and Zeiss. The packaging is great, the wooden box is well made with the words MINOX GERMANY on it. Once I opened the nice wooden box I only discovered a cheap light plastic camera with the words MADE IN CHINA proudly labeled on the bottom of the camera. I still gave it a chance and took some pictures only to discover the quality of the pictures. GARBAGE. The LCD screen on the back is so artfully illuminated on the pictures of this camera, once again only to realize that the pictures were misleading and the LCD screen was of poor quality.

NOT a camera!!!","review":"There is no other way to put this: as a camera, it is totally useless. It can only take a somewhat useable picture under the most perfect of circumstances, and even then, you are horrified when you zoom in on the pixels. Now, add any kind of unfavorable lighting to the equation, and you end up with TOTALLY UNUSABLE PICTURES. The whites bleed into big blurs, the depth of field is so shallow that all your pictures end up out of focus (and no - that does NOT add a charming bokeh effect at all - it just makes everything look horrible).Do NOT buy this item if you are shopping for a camera. You'd be better off taking pictures with your camera phone, even if it is an old one!If you are after this item for nostalgic reasons, and you have $130 to stick on a shelf, then by all means - it looks nice, and gets a lot of attention from people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good at ALL - very disapointed","review":"Bad quality image - for the price you get someting better from other brand.Really disapointed and very cheap cameraSorry but I regret"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Junk","review":"Levers don't work.

The picture quality even under good lighting conditions and setup to \\"fine\\" is terrible. Worse if you use the digital zoom, then the images become unbearably pixelated. Any cell phone camera can take better pictures. No flash, no way to change the date, no shutter or apperture priority, and no programs. You cannot charge the camera unless you connect it to your PC or Laptop, so it's not even practical for traveling. The menu is limited and hard to use and the manual is a disgrace. In addition, it has poor workmanship and is made of cheap plastic, the cord is made of the cheapest leather and has an ugly brown color. Mine didn't even come in the nice wooden box!

It also comes bundled with a lot of neat software, like DVD programs and multiple desktop software, which lets you hook up your T.V. or another monitor to computer.

I kept trying on other scraps with the same result. Looking closely at which piece of wood ended up higher than the other, I found that i had to add 5 layers of thin duct-tape on both clamps to raise the board that always ended up short. Then it was \\"dead-on\\" with a smooth level joint. So I conclude that the bar that separates the two pieces of wood was not \\"dead-centered\\" between the 3/8\\" holes. It looked like they were, but never gave perfect results without the \\"spacer (duct-tape) I added. Spent a couple hours diagnosing that misalignment. I suppose I will have to play with the 1/4\\" and 5/16\\" holes to see how they align...am thinking it might need 2 or3 pieces of duct-tape for 1/4\\" and 3 or 4 pieces for 5/16\\".

The story is rather bad melodrama, the camera work is still shaky at times, and a good many bit players seem still learning how to act. But for fans of Thirties flicks, this is an excellent example of how Warner Brothers was developing an assembly line of films in the early years of the Depression. From 1930 to 1937, Blondell made 47 movies; this was Fairbanks'28th film. In short, Union Depot is for students of the era.

Unfortunately, Genie doesn't remember what happened when she was attacked in the lab and Nick feels responsible because he was on their floor working but wasn't there to protect her.How Nick and Genie turn their relationship around, find out who is trying to kill her and dealing with both of their pasts and insecurities are the foundation of the book.

However, her ability to write the eroticism surprised me, as none of her later novels contain this consistent display of sexual eroticism. These parts of the book were written with skill and were sensitive to the subject matter at hand. The rest of the book, however, was pure \\"fluff\\", and that's not what the Sandra Brown of today is made of.

It was written in 1984 and probably when she first started writing. That's my guess anyway after reading the book. I suppose after so many years the authors/publishers think they can bring these older books out of the closet and reprint them, and then because of the author's name the younger readers will grab them up. It must work, I see a lot of it. But Brown would have been better off to left this one on the shelf. Because I finish a book when I start it, I read it all.

She makes the children sound like cartoon characters and Alicia, the main female character sounds like a cross between Morgan Fairchild and Anna Nicole Smith.

The install was pretty easy; the woofer fit into the speaker hole and I mounted the tweeter surface mount to the door metal because I didn't want to drill into the door panel. Mounting gear that came with the speaker wasn't very good so I would recommend sheet metal screws. About a year later I heard a scratch sound form the left front speaker. Upon closer examination, I noticed a crack in the cone. I fixed it with superglue and have not had a problem since.

They represent us; they *are* us. As with all recordings of Katie facilitating The Work-her unique and deceptively simple self-inquiry process-there is food for thought here that you can digest again and again for new insights. From quotidien complaints to life traumas, The Work-a written process of cognitive restructuring, if you want to get fancy about it-is a way to relieve the suffering that occurs when we attach to thoughts that are not true for us. \\"Confusion is the only suffering,\\" Katie says. While you listen to these people \\"undo\\" themselves, you'll empathize, realize, learn, and laugh along with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music that's a recipe for living!","review":"5 out of 5 stars A really enjoyable Project, Music that's a recipe for living, for inspiraton.

You'll be informed and your table manners won't offend your Thai hosts (they use forks and spoons but not the way that we do). More photos and maps would be nice (the D-K guide to Thailand will fill those gaps). But the big shortcoming with the book is the subject itself: Bangkok. Sophisticated and curious travelers to Thailand always say that their favorite spot is Chiang Mai in the north! You've got to fly through Bangkok to get there so you still may want to carve out a week to see Bangkok and environs. But do try to get to the north (Parkes also wrote the Moon Thailand Handbook, which will be useful if you do decide to visit Chiang Mai)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I got this book to cross reference with Chilton Repair Manual.

While it has a few shortcomings when compared to the Nomad Jukebox 3, the Nomad Jukebox 2 holds its own because of the huge amount of storage. Unless you have thousands of high bitrate songs, you can probably put your whole MP3 collection onto the player and still have space left over. The battery life is 16 hours, a huge improvement over the original jukeboxes 6 hours. The Nomad Jukebox 2 is lightweight and portable, but the IPOD is the way to go if you are looking for an ultra-compact MP3 Jukebox.

I figure this happens when the battery is below 20% and is fine on AC power.Another thing, sometimes the file format corrupts and it tries to fix this by Rebuilding Library. Sometimes this works and sometimes not.There is a way to boot into a secret maintenance mode that allows you to run some tools like Format HD, Rebuild library,which has always fixed this for me (happened maybe 3 times sinceI got it).

It was like buying a great toaster that came with the wrong extension cord. Of course Creative Labs will tell you to ignore the warnings that pop up in XP while the software loads and try to help you get into the back door after its installed and doesn't work.

They seem to me to be definitive. Reading some of the poems is like watching a Visconti movie, Rocco and His Brothers or something like that.

The chapters offer very little constructive information regarding the theory of language teaching.

Clearly the book is intended to facilitate group discussion and be used in conjunction with the teachers' manual which provides more concrete answers.

Instead, we get an exasperating sameness to her work: general distress, marked by general language. Much has been made of Graham's difficulty, but this volume contradicts that.

I've read all of her books, my opinion shifts, but swarm is in the top tier (so crass that there should be tiers but passions have opinions). so different from the forms of her other works, this seems a distillation, a bare minimum necessary to float a story. These poems are like nets, split here an there but nonetheless ambitiously gathering-in the blank space of the page. you could throw this gauntlet down next to a heidegger or a deleuze and it would make a pretty confidant.

This is precisely why we shouldn't dismiss it as an attempt simply to \\"baffle\\" lovers of poetry.True enough: hardly any of the poems are palpable. Rather, most of them resist palpability. Read aloud, the poems, with their blank spaces and sporadic dashes, remind us of Emily Dickinson's poems. How, though, do we begin to make sense of her abstractions and unusual imagery? Essentially, readers must extract Graham's primary metaphors (i.e. veils, unrequited love, creativity, history, seasonal change and so on). Understanding how these metaphors and images are woven into SWARM's overall tapestry is one possible approach to understanding the volume as a whole. Firm believers that poetry is an evolving art will surely wish to read and appreciate SWARM."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Smarm\\" instead of \\"Swarm\\"","review":"Well, that's not true. There's nothing smarmy about these poems. In fact, there's nothing to these poems at all and the people listed here who've liked the book are only fooling themselves. Indeed, claiming that they understand these poems is another way of patting themselves on the back and I would really love to see any one of Jorie's (many) sycophants write a considered, analytical paper extoling (or even making sense of) the virtues of this book. I am not an frivolous reader or a superficial one and these poems don't cut it.

This shower head system is missing an additional \\"joint\\" to allow for fine-tuning of the position of the shower head when it reaches the tightest point. Mine happened to reach the tightest point when the shower head was pointed sideways.

The head on the old one was corroded even after cleaning several times over the years with vinegar , etc. due to calcium deposits. The main problem with this one is they did away with the swivel nut on the arm where it attached to the shower arm coming from the wall. You need to turn this entire arm to connect it and hope it lines up correctly when it tightens up. It doesn't. Therefore it is loose and twists which renders it pretty much useless.Also the adjustment nuts on the arm iself are very hard to turn and don't keep position.Older model was way better and it appears they cut corners on this one and charged more $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Hold Position","review":"The problem with the product is the mechanism does NOT hold its position. No matter how tightly I twisted the wing nut the shower head would not stay in place. I was trying to get the long part of the shower head to stay level, but it simply would not. The shower itself is OK with plenty of water coming out, but it is a soft, rain like, shower.I removed the All Directional Shower head and replaced it with a WaterPik. The WaterPik holds its position well and has two setting for a soft rain like shower and a harder directed spray.AD2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design","review":"I've owned 2 of these shower heads and was completely disappointed with the performance. After several weeks of use, the shower head started leaking at the joints.

This looks similar but looks can be deceiving. There were no instuctions, not important if you've had something similar before but a big deal if you haven't. The deal breaker flaw is that the nut that screws onto the fixture in the wall and the arm are one piece. The whole arm turns when you are tightning the nut and that is not a good thing. It was a very difficult process to get the arm to end up in the proper position. It's there and works but it's crap. That's the best that can be said about it. Don't buy this!

Sometimes it sticks when I try to shift from 3rd to 2nd or 1st, but only occasionally.

My overall reaction is that the drill is a workhorse, but it has some serious design flaws.First, the good: The XRP system is fantastic. Plenty of rugged power. Case, battery, and Dewalt interchangeability is what you'd expect from the brand. Good weight for the power delivered. Overall, decent first impressions.Now, the bad. Granted, these are minor things, but we're talking flaws on a $200 \\"professional\\" drill. The clutch doesn't work in 1st gear. It's an inherent design flaw of the model confirmed by Dewalt. Combine that with the fact that speed selector switch locks up, and in my mind, you've got a badly designed drill.If you can deal with these two issues, then by all means, it's a great drill, and you'll be happy.

I completely agree with the other reviewer who commented on horrible battery life and a stubborn clutch.I don't know what all the nonsense is about buying ony American made. You learn in Economics 101 that outsourcing is good for everyone--increased competitiveness creates greater efficiency, well made products at a cheaper price, increased trade among all nations, and raises up poor people in developing countries to a higher level of opportunity and wealth creation, which a healthy reciprocity of trade.

The maps were too few, and not area/city maps like I'd hoped.

But, if you and your child are enjoying the tooth-fairy game, I'd wait on reading this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Silly Comic book Punk!","review":"This album is really great.Very upbeat and good to listen to when exercising or jumping around your room pointlessly.I recomend it to anyone who listens to punk, ska,j-rock, or any rock in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"The first time I saw these guys was at animeNext 2003 convention.

Ithought it may wear out and the phone would start popping out of the holder at the slightest bump, but that hasn't been the case. The swivel is just tight enough that it moves easily when you want it to move and doesn't move when its not supposed to. My theory is that you need a holder for your phone if you plan to use your phone on any kind of consistent basis and this is a great holder for the Samsung R225."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best one to buy","review":"I really didn't like this workout routine. The core workout hardly makes me break a sweat and I'm totally out of shape. The metabolic booster workout is way too complex and I feel like I miss half of the benefits from the workout because I'm too busy trying to do the moves right. Overall, this is my least favorite video from Jennifer Kries."},{"rating":"2","title":"two-thirds of perfection","review":"I have enjoyed other workouts by Jennifer Kries for the past couple of years. I absolutely love the core conditioning and AM/PM segments of this program. She holds the stetches longer, gives better directions on posture and focuses more on breathing than in the other programs I have. I already loved what I had and ordered this for variety, and I have been very happy with my purchase.The matabolic booster was a nightmare for my friend and I when we tried it. We sat sat and watched it then tried it ourselves. Unless you are already coordinated and smooth, this segment is not helpful. I can't walk and chew gum at the same time, so swinging weights and trying to combine 3 or 4 other movements at the same time only led to big bruises and frustration. Forturnately, we tried this when the 2-year old was out of the house.This program is totally worth the purchase price, but I am going to have to look elsewhere for a more aerobic workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"forget this book","review":"I bought 3 books on the subject all were better then this. this is about \\"alternative\\" medicine. forget it. i through it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not as great as it seems!","review":"Even Stephen was I book I throughly did not enjoy. The books just had event after event which did not even apply to the book. For instance, Sunny asks a boy out to the dance, he forgets to come, he takes her to the movies on his mother's wish, then he never comes into the story again. The situation hardly plays a role in the book. This happens with many other scenes also. The plot isn't too interesting, and the book itsn't a page-turner. We had to read it as a project for school; not one person I know liked the book. Don't waste your time with this book; if you wanted to read it because it deals with the whole issue on not being perfect, pick another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is an amazing compilation of flute music.

Cobbett's instruction on our language is indeed impressive and contains information useful even today. However, the real fun starts with his made-up examples of bad grammar, which frequently include a completely gratuitious broadside aimed at one political antagonist or another. He also quotes extensively from these political antagonists to demonstrate how their book learning and social position in no way prevent them from committing astounding blunders of grammer and cogitation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Again","review":"Do not order from this COMPANY!!!

It was a fast read and fun too, even though I usually do not enjoy books I can't identify with personally.In this book Jo is a 33 year old woman who discovers her husband is cheating on her at the beginning of the story. We get more than a year of her life, in which she comes to terms with her husband leaving, learns to deal with her kids coming and going, learns more about her parents, and even does some dating. In this latter area she ends up with four choices...as the synopsis on the back of the book with tell you.My only problem with the book was that when she finally chooses who she wants, we do not really get to know why, and we really didn't get much of him in the story. But despite that, I really did like the book, and I think anyone looking for a nice breezy summer read that deals with the topic of divorce would too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fourplay","review":"Excellent book.

What else can I say, buy it! If you have ever seen this show on BBC you know it is a gem which anyone who appreciates immature slapstick humor should explore. Some people, particularly religious types, could quiet easily take offense at the portrayal of priests in this manner but it should be noted this was not written for the Politically Correct audience in the US with it's overly sensitive sensibilities. As such it is fecking hilarious and should be viewed repeatedly, preferably with friends. Even better watch it with a couple of those sticks in the mud and watch them squirm and tell you how wrong it is, which makes it even funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Canned Laughter","review":"This show seems like it would be a good idea - good caste - good plot.

I had never heard of it until an Australian talked about it and said how much his family enjoyed it. Typical British humor of the Faulty Towers genre. Very light humor and I did not find it anti-catholic. I converted to Catholicism about ten years ago and am conservative. Humorous setting (Craggy Island) and characters (Father Ted, Jack, Dougal and Mrs. Doyle). Enjoyed learning a few of the Irish terms like \\"eejit\\". I am still unsure whether this is an original Irish term or one adopted from the Father Ted series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Hefty Price","review":"Unforgivably awful picture and sound quality. The home-made quality of the recording is inexcusable, and at this price, criminal.

Udo Dirkschneider is gone, so Accpet feel free to \\"accept\\" the dubious good advises from their managers / record company executives / whoever, and they go for an all-out assault to \\"make America\\", destroying their established raw sound for a pedestrian, lifeless, stupid hair-metal sound typical of middle-eighties... What a shame.. Udo's replacement, David Reece, no doubt has a powerful set of lungs, but he delivers the songs in an unoriginal way, similar to all of the hair metal bands of the eighties.EAT THE HEAT is a very bad album, don't be fooled by the others reviews. Of course, Wolf Hoffmann and the rest of the guys are extremely talented heavy rockers, but the trouble here is the lack of soul in the record: it is clearly a commercial metal product from that period, with all the obligatory love ballads, love lyrics, reverbered drums, etc. When you compare it with their previous classics, even with RUSSIAN ROULETTE, you will want to cry.

He has almost zero screen presence. The story itself is a pretty typical Mob flick and it seems more like a made-for-TV movie the way they shot its 1970s settings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kill the Irishman","review":"This movie was done in a very accurate manner, yet it doesn't come off as a documentary. I remember hearing about these happenings on the news back in the days when they were occuring. I found it very interesting. A brutal eye opening account of what was happening in organized crime before computers and internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"gritty, well done movie","review":"This movie is well done in every way. The story is about organized crime in Cleveland in the 1960's and '70s, with actual news footage of the time interspersed with the action making it all even more authentic. This is based on the true story of Irish mobster Danny Green, and the effect his actions had on organized crime in the U.S. The characters are well written and believable, and the action gritty and at a constant high level. The cast is 1st class. From the lesser-known (for me)Ray Stevenson, to Val Kilmer, Tony LoBianco, Vincent D'Onofrio, Christopher Walken and Paul Sorvino, among others. There is a great deal of violence, which is predictable, but it is surprisingly less that many films of the same genre, so even those of us with weaker stomachs will find it not excessive. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 70's Gangster Action ...","review":"I received this movie from Amazon Vine for review and I must say that I was not familiar about this film at all. Coming into this blindly, I found that I really enjoyed the actors, the screenplay, the 70's music and great cars, and the action-packed and very well developed true-life gangster story line.I was surprised at how well made this film was and the nice balance of action, drama, and character development. I found myself laughing at times at some of the witty dialog and situations. It would have been nice if there could have been a little more development of the main character and his close family relationships, but overall everything was very well done. I enjoyed it.If you like ganger-style films, then this one might be for you. I give this movie a thumbs up and a recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a classic","review":"I saw this movie yesterday on Netflix and had never heard of it at all.. I decided I would watch the first few minutes and see how it was and wow I'm sure glad I did. You can compare this film to some of the old mobster classics we all love and it will surely fail in most comparisons but I really feel like this movie is a classic in its own right and hopefully over time it will be known as such.Everybody cast in this film does a wonderful job. They all seem to flesh out their characters and make the viewer see them as real people not just cardboard cutouts there to move the thing along. Ray Stevenson is one hell of an actor, he takes the role of Danny Greene and basically just transforms into the man himself on film.If you like gangster/mobster films or just solid entertaining films in general you should give this a shot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Believe the Two Critics' Reviews","review":"This movie was lame. Nothing you haven't seen 100 times before in other gangster movies, only this movie just repeats those cliches. The violence is formulaic - yes, there are lots of explosions. Realistic, I suppose, but the beatings were not. Almost comic book-like. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Bad","review":"Just watched this last night. My girlfriend feel asleep half way though, not surprisingly. This morning I told her \\"don't worry about it. You didn't miss anything\\". Yeah, this movie failed on most accounts except the actors. Christopher Walken has little more than a cameo and his lines and direction were so terrible that it didn't even feel like I was watching Christopher Walken! Val Kilmer can do so much better too. He's in the movie a fair amount but is so hamstrung by the film itself that it's like he's not even there.This is a sad, non-riveting docudrama that has little actual story to it, and what shallow fragments of plot we do get are so cliche! Kill the Irishman gets 2 stars because the actors did their best, the film looks professionally shot, there are a few moments that were decent, and I got to see some tits by the end.All in all, Disappointing.Awake!Venger As'Nas SatanisIpsissimusCult of Cthulhu"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"This dvd wasn't what I had expected.

It's not really psychedelic. It's more like bubble gum. But it's not very good at that either.

I simply had nothing else to read. What I found between the pages was a story that has since inspired me to seek out every piece of known information on Greenland. Smiley's literary style in this book is to tell a fictional story as hard cold fact -- non-persuasive, non-judgemental. The depictions produce unforgettable mental visuals, making you feel more like a spectator than a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"As wooden as the proud ships they sailed in","review":"This is a research-driven book. The author obviously did a lot of reading and then stacked up her note cards, hoping the accretion of historical details would ipso facto form a novel.It didn't. The book is tedious. The characters are cardboard. The dialgoue sounds like one of those Hollywood Golden Age historical dramas where the 16th-century Englishmen all think they should sound like Shakespeare.And like one of those dispiriting Greenland winters, it goes on and on and on.Occasionally she captures a mood, but by and large this is the Elvis Impersonator of sagas. Hard to believe it's by an author as good as Jane Smiley."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Greenlanders","review":"This book is very slow moving and very hard to understand.

I picked this book up at a library book sale for 50 cents...and that's a good thing, because it sure wasn't worth much more to me. I could NOT get past the similar and way too frequent names of the characters. The writing style is almost biblical...in it's lack of readability. I can surely understand someone with a Nordic background liking this book, and spending the time getting past it's pittfalls.

It fitted nicely onto the camera, but the nasty surprise came when I actually tried to use it during snorkeling.The shutter lag is about a second, which means that the camera takes a picture about a second after you press the button (see other review). Now try shooting fish when bouncing in the surf!Very disappointing indeed. I hope they fixed this for the Xt, because the Minolta hotline plainly stated, that it's just the way it is for my camera, not fix is being considered. Now if you shoot static pictures on the beach, the case may be nice, but trying to frame marine life is next to impossible and makes the case practically useless for snorkelers or divers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for small pictures","review":"This studio is great for product catalog pictures and ebay pictures. It allows good lighting to be displayed through the two lamps. The reason I gave it four stars is the difficulty of getting the legs of the lamps out.

My little boy (4 years old) bought this with his Christmas money at Toysrus, so I had no time to do my usual online research. The claim is that by moving your finger(s) across the board in different directions it makes different colors. Essentially you are moving little light bulbs in different directions. They are very sensative so there is absolutly no way that you are going to get all one color. Not to metnion it hurts your fingers after awhile and the pen that it comes with is useless. The only way to actually make a picture is to use the templates that they give you in a dark room and don't take the template off. The second you touch any other part of the board it messes up the whole picture. Unfortunately I threw away the box so I can't return it. This was a a big waste of money.

How disappointed we were. The pegs move too easily which makes it hard, not to mention frustrating, to keep it a certain color. They should have made it so the colors stay put. Also, there should be an automatic shut off so the batteries don't die down. It is hard to expect young children to remember to always shut off toys especially when so many other toys have auto off. Also the patterns that come with it don't stay in place unless you hold them. Yeah, that's easy for little ones to do.

I found the reviews here are right on the money (except for the one person who recommends this toy for some reason). There is no way to start out with a black screen to try and make a picture and you cannot separate the colors so easily, the tiny pegs in the holes just flop around on their own and do their own thing.

It is difficult to move the pegs to the desired color, and once they are in place, they move out of position easily making it very frustrating for the child. It is almost impossible to see any image on the screen whether with the lights on or in total darkness.

No wonder people think the Chinese are inscrutable - even I don't have a triangle-head driver, let alone a long-shank one to get those buggers out.Also - it uses 4 D-cell batteries, and since all the lights are on all the time (tho they aren't very bright - like whoever engineered this product), it should eat the batteries up, and even then they're protected by four (standard phillips) screws.I'm giving up and tossing it in the trash to save future researchers the frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Don't Get This One!","review":"I saw this on TV and thought it would be a great toy for my nearly 4 year olds.

And, it takes a long time to move each pixel to the desired direction. I let my soon-to-be-3-year-old daughter to play with it, she completely lost interests in a few minutes.

I am saving the box and hoping she changes her mind. I even called the company to complain, they think it works great & say it is because of my daughter's age, not being old enough to work it properly.

The idea is good, the actual toy is the worst I've ever purchased. The lights are tiny little pointy lightbulbs that change color when moved up, down, or diagonal. They never all move the right way, and it's IMPOSSIBLE to get the whole screen to start out black. The stylus it comes with is useless, because the little lightbulbs bounce off it instead of all moving in one direction to acheieve one color.

Then you are supposed to be able to draw pictures or follow the outlines to trace pictures. It was impossible for me (grandma) or my 13 yr old granddaughter to even get all the little lights to be all black.

I placed the template on so he could make a house. My child got so frustrated that I read the box to see if we were doing something wrong. He could'nt get the little pegs to turn to the right colors no matter how hard he tried. Then I tried to make the pictures for him. I couldn't even get the pictures to look like they were supposed to. It is too hard to manipulate and is no fun for kids. If I hadn't torn the box up so badly when we opened it, I would have DEFINITELY taken it back.

That was a big mistake. First of all, the recommended age is three years and up, but that is crazy. There is no way this toy is appropriate for anyone who doesn't have very nimble fingers and a whole lot of patience. Secondly, I know that boxes often make toys look a lot more exciting then they turn out to be, but this one is not even close. The colors turn out to be completely different from how they appear on the cover. In reality they are dull and barely detectable, not of the primary, vibrant sort shown on the box. And lastly, if you so much as touch this toy when you are done with your creation, you can kiss it goodbye. Any child will be heart broken, as mine was, once the ample time was taken to get it right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensory Integration Toy","review":"This is a great toy for kids who have sensory issues.

I am not sure if it was due to the heat given off from the toy or because he might of gotten his skin caught between the base of the unit and the lighted pegs.. but the harsh fact is due to that and the fact it doesn't work well I would not recommend this to anyone..I would recommend the older style light brights over this anytime."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG FAT ZERO!","review":"Do not buy this toy!!!It does none of the things shown on the commercials.There are little pegs that you are supposed to move certain ways to make the different colors.

James Levine, one of the finest Verdi conductors active today, paces the performance perfectly and illustrates many of the felicities of the composer's scoring of this attractive earlyish work.Maria Gughelina is in excellent voice as Lady Macbeth, though I sympathize with the fact that she has to sing some difficult passages lying down. She also is lumbered with some dreadful frocks. Macbeth is well sung although there is some strain in the high notes.The updated production is eccentric and tends to loose focus in the later acts.

It does cover just about everything needed for the test. Most of the book is well written with hands-on exercise, chapter quizzes, and chapter summaries. The sample exam on the accompanying CD is a nice bonus.A couple chapters seem to be clunky and thrown together. These chapters point to the accompanying CD for source code examples instead of listing them in the book like all other chapters. These same chapters seem not to offer much in the way of hands on exercises. Unfortunately these seem to be the more difficult topics. Fortunately these are only a couple out of over 20 chapters.If you work with VB.NET, then this book might be all you need to pass the 70-306.If you do not have much hand on experience with VB.NET you will find that you need to supplement your studying.If you just want to learn VB.NET then this is not the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"There a much better books available","review":"It's obvious why this book was the first VB.NET book available.

The book is written in a really friendly and accessible style.

It is not the actor's fault, for sure. As a matter of fact, I thought the physique of Sally Hawkins suited my imagination of Anne Elliot the best out of all 3 I have seen. Yet, the way she was directed was horrendous. She is constantly running after Captain Wentworth (and not only in the last ten minutes, what about the concert scene?). I also much preferred the older Captain Wentworth (played by Ciaran Hinds). He seemed to show a lot more emotion while still staying true to Wentworth's steely character. Finally, why on earth was this one cut so short? We hardly saw anything pass between the main 2 characters and the cousin Mr. Elliot character was just a silhouette in the background. Very odd and poorly done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh.","review":"I was so excited to watch another BBC version of what is my favorite Austen novel but what a disapointment it was. The actors don't quite fit with the characters and it seems that all of the humor of the book is lost in this movie. The changes at the end and the running through the streets were just too much for me. Save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe BBC was a part of this version!","review":"The fact that the cast is better looking in this '08 version cannot make up for the complete meltdown of the story in the second half of this version. The first half of the movie is true to the book. Once Anne arrives in Bath, the story strays away from Jane Austen's novel. Anne's friend Mrs. Smith and her vital role is completely diminished and you barely even realize who she is, since she isn't an invalid in this movie either. Also one of my favorite parts of this whole story is skipped, Wentworth doesn't ever write Anne a hurried letter containing his true feelings. I don't understand why they couldn't have tacked on 20 more minutes and made this version live up to Austen's novel. Very poor adaptation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why???","review":"That is the question I had after watching this. Why, when there is a beautifully done movie-length version already in existence (Persuasion), was this made? I was very excited to hear about The Complete Jane Austen project, and was happy to see from the previews that the casting looked age-appropriate. I was hoping that the stories would each be shown in several episodes to allow for character and plot development. What a sad, sad disappointment this adaptation was. No one who hasn't read the novel and/or seen the 1995 version would understand from *this* version why Persuasion has so many devoted fans. While the misinterpretation of Anne could partly be blamed on Ms. Hawkins' choices, the bulk of the missteps of this production are due to poor adapting and directing. It's a shame; the cast is talented (based on seeing many of them in previous endeavors), and would have benefitted from a better project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done - I enjoyed it!!","review":"Good story - true to the novel and very good acting by the two leads. Excellent writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but its name to recommend it","review":"I belong to the school of thought that proclaims \\"A bad Austen is better than no Austen\\" but friends, this is the most appalling film adaptation of ANY Austen novel. It is as though the people responsible for this disaster were DESPERATE to distance themselves from the perfection that is the 1995 film with Ciaran Hinds and Amanda Root. To achieve this lofty goal, they set out to hire ALL the wrong people: Screenwriter, Director, Actors and Photographers. The result--the Anti-Austen, or rather, Austen Lite--a film reduced to a melodrama that surely has the author spinning in her grave. All the opportunities that make this a most wonderful book were cast aside. The result: A spiritless, emotionless and humorless film--and a colossal waste of an evening. What a shame!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic Offering","review":"Anyone who has viewed the 5-star masterpiece of Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds in their portrayal of this love story will surely know how truncated this depiction was. Poorly done, poorly directed, poorly acted. Devoid of any true depth of feeling. What a sad portrayal of Captain Wentworth in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Hideous","review":"I had been looking forward to Masterpiece Theatre's \\"The Complete Jane Austen\\" for several months, and was especially excited they chose to begin with \\"Persuasion\\", which is my favorite Austen novel. I could not have been more disappointed. Seriously, the only good thing to say about the film is I only wasted 90 minutes of my life. The script was atrocious - they cut much of the story out, and the bits they did keep, although the correct conversation(s), were between the wrong people. There was no chemistry at all between Anne and Wentworth, the characters did not feel developed at all, in short, it was ghastly. On the other hand, the 1995 BBC version starring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is its polar opposite - never a false step, superb casting, tightly woven script, magical chemistry between Anne and Wentworth. If you're looking for a film of \\"Persuasion\\", the 1995 one is the only one worth viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible shame. Don't waste your time.","review":"As a long time Jane Austen fan, I bought this thinking it couldn't be as bad as some of the reviews suggest. Boy, was I wrong.I don't know what the producers could have been thinking. They turned Anne into a weepy dishrag! And their Captain Wentworth may look nice but he doesn't look like a sailor. He looks more like a rich landowner's son who never had to do a day's hard labor in his life. He would have made a good Mr. Elliot actually. The rest of the character's in the story have been similarly skewed. And I was horrified by the changes that were made to the plot. They actually took out the most romantic scene in the whole story!If you want to see the real story ofPersuasion, please get the 1995 version starring Amanda Root. It is a far superior adaptation in every way. Don't bother with this travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Persuaded either!","review":"I agree with \\"Eileen\\" who has not read the Austen stories, but knows all the films. She gave one star and so do I, only because I was able to watch it through...just.I , in contrast, have read the stories, and Persuasion is my favourite. Watching this new abridged and adapted version, I had to wonder why MT bothered at all. The feeling of the piece in no way evokes the intimacy of the story. It has a remote tableau-esque objectivity, jarringly punctuated with overwrought carryings on. The hyperventilating panic-attack characterisation of Anne is terribly distracting.I too recommend the Ciaran Hinds/Amanda Root version, which truly portrays the fine subtlety ,intimate poignancy, and reserved intensity which are so vital to the fabric and feel of Austen's original story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I thought this movie was good. I've watched it more than once and that's always a good sign! The acting was good and the leading man is gorgeous to watch. Those British men really know how to stare longingly at someone. Anyone who is a fan of Austen or romantic movies will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed the movie for what it is","review":"I totally agree with many of the reviewers on the content of the movie vs the content of the book. I concur with the view that Anne would not run around Bath without being properly attired, even though the character has no great feelings for \\"propriey\\" as it is found in her own family circle. I decided to just enjoy the two as separate, without being fussy, other than one unexplained detail in the movie. Kellynch is entailed; how, therefore can Wentworth present the property as a wedding present?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen would object . . .","review":"Attractive actors, sets, costumes and a great score, but outside of those elements a veritable disappointment! The film does not portray the characters in a way that is consistent with Austen's own depiction. Anne is whiny and timid. Wentworth is inarticulate and, at one point, actually confused to find that he has been flirting with Luisa Musgrove. The Crofts, sensible and smart in other versions, are similarly confused and bland in this one.Austen would never have countenanced a heroine of hers running a marathon around Bath because she can't master her feelings or a pround hero who gives in so easily. . .she might enjoy certain scenes and scenery in the movie but she would not have recognized this film as her own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch the Amanda Root Version","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is my favorite Jane Austen novel and I was excited to see a Masterpiece adaptation on PBS. Unfortunately, I found this version dull and dismal. I didn't feel that the film makers adaquately portrayed why these two characters were in love or why he would wait to be married all of these years. In the lovely 1995 version, you see the underlying humor, will, and strength of character in Anne. Frederick and Anne also have exchanges that reveal their passion for one another. While it also takes liberty with some of the original story - I've always wanted to see the drama with her widow friend included more - it is definitely more moving and better developed. I would recommend bypassing this Masterpiece version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful Rendition","review":"Please do not waste your money. The actors are dour, lifeless, and constantly stare into the camera. It quickly becomes annoying. They have pointlessly rearranged dialogue from the book so, for example, Wentworth makes an idiot of himself describing the woman he would marry in front of a crowd of people. Even more annoying at the beginning and the end of the movie they have Anne running marathons through her house and the streets of Bath. Did anyone read the book or even the Cliff Notes to get the point about persuasion? Guess not. For some reason they have taken out all of the wit and insight of Jane Austen and left you with some soggy melodramatic sop. Run, do not walk, to the nearest bookstore and buy the book or, if you want a video, there is a very solid and more faithful rendition from 1995 as mentioned earlier."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't like the fact that my disc would not play","review":"This version of Persuasion is my favorite. I have no complaint about the acting or the story. The disappointment of not being able to see any picture or have any sound is my complaint. I went though the process of returning the disc through Amazon and it worked. I was pleased to get responsive emails and a speedy refund. Thank you Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Changes the feel of the story","review":"I was so disappointed in this film. I love the Amanda Root version, and was hoping for another great adaptation, with a newer look. This version changed so many events to try to make it more dramatic. I guess it succeeded in the added drama, but in so doing it changed the mood of the story. The whole movie up until the very end focused on the sad and serious aspects of the story. You never get to see Anne start to open up and come alive again the more she's around Captain Wentworth and other friends and seeing more of the world. This lack of emotional evolution bothers me so much more than all the changes in events. Even if you've never read the book, I wouldn't recommend this one-tone movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrific","review":"I own the earlier Persuasion with Amanda Root and Ciarin Hinds. It's beautifully acted and filmed. This version fell flat for me very quickly. I like Penry-Jones in Spooks and the BBC's Cambridge Spies immensely. I did not care for him in this role. I can't pin down exactly why, but I simply didn't feel he was right for the part....to distant, unemotional, even nonverbally, facially. Granted, Hinds, who can be explosive when he acts, was also very contained, but Jones here did NOT come across as contained, rather as nonresponsive much of this film. Overall, I felt none of the actors were that strong; the pacing also dragged with this version to me. If you want the film, buy the earlier BBC Persuasion!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Persuasion--it's one of my favorite of Jane Austen's. So I was looking forward to this version since I'm not a huge fan of the Amanda Root version.But is it too much to ask that they try to follow Jane Austen's story line? Since it holds together? I was going along with it until the end when I realized there's no motivation for how the characters are acting. Because they didn't follow the story line--misplacing conversations and events.If you aren't a huge Persuasion fan and you are a fan of costume drama, this might work for you. But if you love the book, don't get your hopes up. And go watch Pride and Prejudice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Persuasion - Masterpiece Theatre","review":"This version of Persuasion is not my favorite. This actress can't compare to Amanda Root, though this Captain Wentworth is handsome. There are two scenes that are so out of the Edwardiarn era that I can't justify liking this film version. When Anne Elliot runs around town looking for Captain Wentworth, I nearly laughed until I cried. No respectable woman of that time period would ever carry on that way in public, let alone in private. In addition, there is a ridiculous 5 minute unrequited kiss that is absurd! I felt like saying, \\"Oh, get on with it!\\" All in all, not my favorite film version of Persuasion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Must Suspend Belief Here Because Of Character Casting!","review":"So far this is the only version of Persuasion that I have seen so far,and I thought it was ok,despite the fact that I usually avoid films and books that are full of 'angst' as almost this entire film is.I haven't yet read any of the novels by Jane Austen,so I cannot judge how true to the book it is.My real problem was that I didn't much care for the character of Anne Elliot(Sally Hawkins),I thought she was incredibly dull,and it was totally unbelievable that the 'Drop Dead GORGEOUS'(but his acting here doesn't thrill either)Frederick Wentworth(Rupert Perry-Jones) would have fallen for such a plain Jane,and pined for years for her!Now I want to see the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds.So I can't really recommend this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the 1995 version","review":"This adaptation was disappointing, with the characters not really coming to life. Everyone seemed rather leaden, actually. Anne's 'race' around Bath at the end was totally unbelievable, and the kiss between Anne and Wentworth was staged so awkwardly that I nearly fast forwarded through it -- not pretty to look at. And what's up with Wentworth buying Kellynch for her at the end? Stick to the 1995 version -- it was tons better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie, Nice Package","review":"I received this movie yesterday, and it came in a nice cardboard DVD package. I saw the movie on youtube already, but I still liked it when I saw it again. The cast was nice, the only thing is that I wish the movie was a bit longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst adaptations","review":"The movie lacked real emotions. All the acting and actors were dull and nothing about the whole thing was aspiring. \\"Persuasion\\" is one of my favorite novels by Jane Austen but not even that was enough encouragement for me to root for this poorly portrayed couple (Anne Elliot and Captain Wentworth). I must admit the 1995 version of Persuasion staring Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is my favorite and maybe I had too many high expectations this version would also be wonderful but I was very disappointed. I think I knew I would have a problem with this movie from one of the earliest scenes of a maid doing nothing more than just standing around holding an inkwell waiting for when Anne needed ink from wondering from room to room making a list of the house items. What was the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Shreds and Patches\\"","review":"This is a poor man's version of Austen's late masterpiece. Full of odd cuts, misrepresentations, and a generally rushed job feeling throughout, this adaptation makes one wonder who considered it worthy to film in the first place. Some of the Complete Jane Austen entries, after all, will be repeats of earlier TV versions, and the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds \\"Persuasion\\" of several years back is in all respects infinitely superior to this mishmash.

I have watched it over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as good as previous productions","review":"In order to be different from previous productions, the director has decided to make the female lead a shopkeepers daughter rather than a Baronet's daughter. She seems to be in pain all the time, the costumers appear to have decided that two or three outfits (dowdy ones at that!) were adequate and that the director thought it was perfectly normal to have a Baronet's daughter sprinting the streets of bath as though a pack of dogs were after her.If one wants an elegant production, one that matches the novel then I recommend the 1971 BBC version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have they ever read Jane Austen","review":"This movie was a complete disappointment. it left me wondering one thing, have the creator's of this film ever read or watched Persuasion. What was the point of hitting the shuffle button on one of the most beautiful plots ever written. They completely took any meaning away from Wentworth's letter and mixed up the plot so much the to create drama they had Anne Elliot running all through bath. The ending seemed forced."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing simplification of a sublime ending","review":"I agree with the most recent reviewers. The screenwriter chose to substitute the sublime denouement written by Austen with a most un-Austen-like, undignified chase around Bath, culminating in a public kiss -- Jane would have been mortified! I'm not a purist if the change improves the product, but this one doesn't. Perhaps the screenwriter shouldn't have aspired to best Austen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.....","review":"This version of Persuasian was at times silly (Anne running all over Bath looking for Wentworth - Oh Please... how un-Jane Austen can you get.) and unfaithful to the book. The acting was pretty bad too....The costumes were wonderful, so was the music.The 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds was much better and was faithful to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not true to character","review":"I am an avid fan of Jane Austen's works. As such, I am very forgiving of any version of her work that will gain her a greater audience. However, this screenplay so totally changes the character of Anne Elliot that she is hardly recognizable to those who have read the book. Anne was perhaps Jane's ideal woman, yet this screenplay makes her a pathetic silly woman and it's quite hard to believe her capable of attracting anyone's interest, or maintaining it over a span of many years. Too bad we can't hear Jane's critique of this adaptation. I'm sure it would be quite caustic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run, Anne, Run","review":"Persuasion is one of Jane Austen's best books and this version really does not do the story justice. I don't think it was well cast (Wentworth was fine, but Anne was relatively annoying) and what is up with Anne running all over town, kissing all over Wentworth? I'm pretty sure all of that was not acceptable in the period, especially since Anne had given up her engagement to Wentworth because of her status, I can't see her flying in the face of tradition this much.If you really want to watch a version of Persuasion, watch the 1995 version. It was much more true to the story, better cast and better filmed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen would denounce this film production!","review":"PersuasionThis film production of Persuasion is so disappointing that I believe Jane Austen would denounce it if she were alive today. The screenwriter and film director clearly did not understand the story characters in this Jane Austen story. They turned Anne (the heroine) into a weepy, desperate & emotional basket-case instead of portraying her as a self-confident (in a quiet way), dignified, and full of common sense. A number of the support characters were so marginalized that it weakened and oversimplified the story. My recommendation is to go with the Amanda Root/Ciaran Hinds film production which is about the best we'll ever see."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible waste!","review":"\\"Persuasion\\" is one of my absolute favorite Jane Austen stories but this adaptation is just insulting. The character of Anne is completely misrepresented! In this version, she is so spiritless and dull it's impossible to imagine how Captain Wentworth could ever have fallen in love with her in the first place, let alone carry a torch for her for almost a decade! And though the gentleman playing Wentworth is handsome, he lacks charisma and doesn't leave much of an impression. The costumes and sets were quite attractive though, it's just a shame they were wasted on such a terrible production. If you must see every Jane Austen adaptation ever made, just rent this one, because purchasing it would be a mistake."},{"rating":"2","title":"magnificent jane austen","review":"bloody unrealistic story of love lost, but so enjoyable to watch! starring the handsome Rupert PenryJones, and beautiful Sally Hawkins - they were cut out for these roles. if Jane Austen adapted to film is your thing, this is the pick. great casting, extreme close-ups, countryside shots, pain and hurt, slimey cousin, Jane Austen speak, an hour and a half of delectable viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this?","review":"Another Masterpiece Theatre production where I ended up thinking, \\"huh?\\" (I felt the same way about \\"Woman in White\\"). And I just saw an excellent MT adaptation of Jane Eyre so I'm amazed at how bad this production was. The lead actors--Rupert Penry Jones and Sally Hawkins-- had no chemistry and I didn't believe they had been pining for each other for the last eight years. The camera angles were annoying and I hated the way Anne would speak directly to the camera--it was too campy and out of place. And I didn't like this Anne nearly as much as Amanda Root's potrayal--in the 1995 production Anne was quiet but smart and strong and dignified, nothing like the Anne in the MT version who seemed silly and weepy and so so weak. And don't even get me started on the ending and that laughable kiss. I was glad it was only 90 minutes long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Favorite Moments","review":"A couple more hilarious moments that I don't notice other reviewers mentioning:-- Wentworth and Harville ignoring the drenching swells that are about the wash them off the Cobb.-- Charles Musgrove crossing the log bridge and strolling around the dining room leaving his shotgun unbroken and in firing position. I was a little disappointed that he didn't take out any of the characters that I could have done without seeing for the following sixty minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"please watch the 1995 version instead of this one","review":"I was very disappointed in this version of one of my favorite Jane Austen books. When Anne repeatedly looks directly into the camera, it felt like I was back on Gilligan's Island and the Skipper was doing one of his looks. Offputting. The cast was fine and I thought Sally's acting was pretty much on target-besides the disconcerting glances at the audience. She really was able to give the emotion to Anne she needed, although her personality seemed a bit more martyrish than I would like. The 1995 version was much better overall, in involving you in the life of the characters, and I felt much more true to the book than this version."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, but could have been so much better","review":"Having been a Jane Austen fan for years, I was really looking forward to this movie. Persuasion is one of my favorite books, and I have read it many times. However, the movie left a lot to be desired. While the whole film was rushed and out of order, the ending was the worse. Why try to cram everything in in the last 10 minutes? The ending made little sense; it had unnecessary additions, way to much running, and a LAME kiss.The book ending is perfect, so why they strayed so far from that is beyond me. While that actors where much more enjoyable to watch then in the 1995 version, I would have preferred that they stay with the book. The movie lost much of the Jane Austen wit and charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!","review":"This story was presented so briefly that anybody having not read the book a number of times would be totally lost. There is not enough of the book in it to even give clues to events portrayed! Relationships are not portrayed as in the book...everybody gets a long far too well. Casting seemed to be well enough, but the story line lacked enough depth to convey the plot along. I was so looking forward to this, especially after watching Sense & Sensibility, which was superbly done!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A severe disappointment!","review":"I read the reviews but Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen novel - I bought the DVD. Apart from the miscasting of Elizabeth (she is beautiful in the book) and Mary (either she can't act or was mis directed)- I enjoyed most of this version but the ending.....the running was insanity! It ruined the whole production! I could not recommend this, the last BBC version was much better, buy it instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad, So Sad","review":"I am \\"all astonishment\\" that the BBC could film such a version of Persuasion. No chemistry between Anne and Captain Wentworth, no suspense in the relationship between Anne and Mr. Elliot, no character development, and the end, which in the book was romantic and satisfying was a total let down. Buy the Amanda Root 1995 movie. It is much truer to the spirit of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the...?","review":"This was a very disappointing adaptation of one of my favorite novels. The acting was horrible. It was over the top and ridiculous. This version lacked all of the subtilty that makes Jane Austen delightful to read...and watch if done well. Some of the camera angles were nauseating, especially when Anne is running around Bath like a lunatic. The kissing scene between Anne and Captain Wentworth made me laugh. Stick with the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciarian Hinds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A capital disapointment","review":"Along with others who have written, I was very unhappy with this version of Persuasion. One would think that a newer adaptation would be better than the one in 1995 but this is not the case. The actor who played Captain Wentworth was well enough but where did they get the actress who played Anne Elliot? And why did the director spend so much time having Anne stare into the camera after writing one of her letters? How annoying! I did'nt really feel that much sympathy for her as much as I felt for Amanda Root in 1995. The gentle way Captain Wentworth helps Anne into the carriage in the 1995 version coming back from the 'long walk' was changed with the abrupt way this new Captain grabs Anne by the arm and hoists her on the back of the carriage like a sack of potatoes! There were so many inconsistencies I cannot understand why this version was even made. Somtimes it is better to leave well enough alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just wretched.","review":"Persuasion is my favorite Austen novel, so this movie was pure butchery to me. The story, the characters, the charm, all of it was lost in what felt to me like a rushed attempt to make Persuasion-lite. The only reason I watched this movie all the way through is I kept thinking it had to get better, but it just devolved. The only good thing I can say about the film is to agree with everyone who has the sense of sight that Rupert Penry-Jones is a beautiful man, but he is given nothing to do in this movie except stand around looking good with all the expressiveness of a gorgeous stone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much unsteady cam","review":"The main complaint I have with this film is its photography. I don't know how they did it but it was like they attached a frame to the actors with a camera on it and shot several scenes like that. The result was like the actors were disconnected from the scene and the shots were jerky. I got a headache just watching them.The idea of girl of the lower nobility running all over bath with out being horribly out breath is ludicrous.Aside from that Anthony Head was excellent as a member of the aristocracy. The rest of the cast were good. The plot was OK even if it wasn't conventional though I didn't care for the Anne's looking into the camera in several shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a snob","review":"This is a disappointment. No, I am not a \\"snob\\". Why on earth did they not change Sally Hawkin's hair to make it softer and more appealing as time moves forward in the film? Anne Elliott is supposed to have a \\"second spring of youth and beauty\\". Sally Hawkin's is youthful but she never achieved a modicum of loveliness, there was no change in her look from beginning to end. As other reviewers have noted, her sister Elizabeth is supposed to be very pretty also. With the great costuming and sets, why not complete the picture Jane Austen painted and have the characters look the part?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful costumes and sets but...","review":"I agree with so many of the other reviewers, the Amanda Root version was sublime. I have seen it several times, including at the movie theatre, and that version was so rich and deep and satisfyingly romantic. In this current version though, I did like Sally Hawkins a lot. I found her to be a wonderful actress with beautiful eyes and expressions. It was not her fault her part was written so poorly and wimpily. Several reviewers have mentioned the kiss between the leads, I have to agree! It was not good, and shot at a bad camera angle.Also the sound was horrid, people were talking in those big drafty English parlors and rooms, and the echos were so strong it sounded as though they just had put little microphones on the floor.I did enjoy the show, but I have to say I kept constantly comparing to the 1995 SO much better version.And I hate that Masterpiece Theatre changed it's name to just Masterpiece. How stupid is that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"new addition to my Austen movie favorites","review":"Love, love, love it! Sally Hawkins is phenomenal as Ms. Eliot. The emotions that she conveys without words seem to jump from the screen. This quite easily make its way to the top of the Austen best of list. I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves good writing, great acting, and beautiful storylines. 5 stars.If you like this you also may enjoy the 2007 Sense and Sensibilty as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh take on Persuasion","review":"Although the older version staring Amanda Root is still my ultimate favorite, this version is a more modern, fresher approach. It moves a bit fast in some parts, as it is difficult to fit the entire novel into about an hour & half. If you want to experience Jane Austen with a different point of view then this movie is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Austen Romance ever!","review":"This was a wonderful surprise! I loved it. it turned out to be, in my opinion, Jane Austen's most romantic novel to date. Truly well acted, well directed and pure Austen!!!! WONDERFUL! You'll watch it over and over again. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Art","review":"This version of Jane Austen's classic, is so far from a well produced drama that it doesn't merit being called drama. Not because of the acting but because the script, directing and sequencing in an attempt to modernize and shorten results in a movie that is difficult to follow, whose characters seem shallow and within a short time, you think to yourself, why am I watching this bollix of a film in the first place. Watch the Amanda Root version, much better, true to the story and a classic that warrants your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please buy the 1995 version with Amanda Root....","review":"Did the writer who wrote this 2007 version for BBC actually read the book?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Trash","review":"Where to start? First, the case arrived cracked (damaged in shipping) so I opened the plastic to survey the damage and found a big crack down the inside of it. Well, I decided to give it one more shot and go with a three strikes your out basis and it struck out! This movie sucked! I could barely stay awake through the boring and uneventful dialouge, the way it dragged through each scene like a snail and whoever complained about her running through the streets at the end being the only bad part was crazy. This whole movie was slow, poorly casted and all-in-all a complete flop. Have you not seen Pride and Prejudice? Becoming Jane? The Inheritance? Anything but this...!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Amanda Root version instead","review":"This version borders on the ridiculous, with all the running about.The one with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds is far superior, and who can resist the additional casting of Sophie Thompson (Emma's sister)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ciaran Hinds version is better","review":"I was very disappointed in this new version. All the characters were bland. Very unfaithful to the book.If you are a Jane Austen fan and are a purist, I recommend the Ciaran Hinds version which is much, much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to Beat Jane Austen","review":"I saw this on PBS and had to have it! I have seen other renditions of Jane Austen's Persuasion, but this by far is the best one. Wonderful screenplay, great job by all actors, outstanding costume and set design, and beautiful music. Casting Rupert Penry-Jones as Capt. Wentworth was a good move, but I have to give kudos to Julia Davis as Anne's sister Mary. She is awesome! Passionate, honorable and romantic story. I've watched it about twenty times!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the 1995 Version","review":"I like many other avid Austen fans was thrilled to see that a new version of Persuasion was to air on the local PBS channel. Although the PBS version was edited, I doubt that anything could truly save this movie. Outside of the beautiful scenery and music, this version lacked all the charm of the 1995 movie with Hinds and Root. It was so greatly altered from the book, the story was almost unrecognizable. It was a tremendous disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Persuaded to like this one!","review":"On initial review, all I could do was compare this film to the 1995 version with Amanda Root and Ciaran Hinds, and so I was less than objective. However, this film is NOT that other version and needs to be reviewed and weighted on its own merits. It does follow the storyline rather well, and while some scenes do seem a bit rushed, it is still true to the heart of this moving story.Upon a 2nd and third viewing, I found the film rather charming, the acting good, the scenery and sets excellent. So, I would recommend this film. I think it is especially good for someone new to Jane Austen, but I feel that even Jane Austen fans will come to appreciate the film if they can but give it a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally charged","review":"No, it's not quite like the book. Is any movie as great as the book? I, too, enjoyed the earlier film version of this. The lighting and scenery are more beautiful than this one. However, I really enjoyed this version. The ordinary way it was presented made it feel more real, like I was there instead of watching a movie. I'm not an Austen expert, but having read the book I thought it captured the spirit of it. Captain Wentworth was SMOKIN', plus I identified with Anne immediately. It ended wonderfully despite the marathon Anne ran, and the kiss was worth the hour spent. The acting is good, the story is great, it's a good time to be had by all. If you are a purist go spend the time reading the novel, but if you want a relaxing hour of well written characters and a heart-wrenching story you've come to the right place."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent movie","review":"I haven't read any Jane Austin, like many of you have. I just can't get into the style of writting. So my exposure to Austin's work comes through movies. I loved this movie. I saw it on Masterpiece Theatre on PBS. Unlike the other Austin productions I've seen on Masterpiece Theatre (Northanger Abbey, Mansfield Park), I felt this movie rather than watched it. Here is Anne, confronted by her lost love, watching him court another woman right in front of her. Here she is, unable to reveal that she still loves Captain Wentworth, about to loose him again. Sally Hawkins portrayed Anne in such a heartfelt way, I'm touched every time I see the movie. I thought the movie was well done, the score beautiful, and oh, how I sympathized with Anne. I can't say if this Persuasion is better than the book, or better than any other production of it, but I really enjoyed it as it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of Two Worlds","review":"Presenting a simplified version of a novel widely regarded as a masterpiece of English literature is not a meritless idea: though we understand that especially the development of character may be diminished or compromised, it may be worth it to get the essentials across. To present a simplified version of a novel which is an out-of-order, jumbled, misshapen, meaningless shadow of the original is a disservice to all who watch it. It neither helps us understand the infrastructure of the original novel, nor is it a worthwhile piece of art in itself. This production represents a total failure of engagement; it's a piece of cotton candy. Watch the 1995 Amanda Root version, as close to perfection as a filmed version of an Austen novel has gotten so far.(Will no one ever cast a version of \\"Persuasion\\" in which the heroine's sister Elizabeth really is beautiful?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed to many important scenes","review":"I read this book prior to watching any adaptations. This version gets it wrong in so many ways. Pivitol scenes are split up or omitted completely. Things made up. The ending - rubish. There is no way that Captain Wentworth could have given her what he did in the last scene. He did a great job at being steamy and intent... but the whole production was disappointing. If you want a better adaptation see the 1995 with Amanda Root and Ciarán Hinds. It is much more faithful to the book and does not miss or mess about with the pivitol scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible adaptation","review":"I don't expect Jane Austen movie adaptations to remain completely faithful to the books - that would make for long and boring movies. However, i do expect important, key parts to not be overlooked or completely messed up, so to speak.So, this version? The camera-man can't hold a camera still; the acting is so-so but characters as mis-cast and hard to believe; the script, well, wish they would have stuck more to the book... Skip this one and check out the one with Amanda Root & Ciarán Hinds if you want a nice adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Jane Austen","review":"This is my favorite movie version of Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion.\\" Some have criticized the ending where Ann runs to meet Captain Wentworth. They say Jane Austen never would have placed such behavior in her novel. Maybe so, but it perfectly demonstrates what Ann was feeling at that moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice film","review":"I was not familiar with this story at all before watching this adaptation.

The production quality was very good, the costumes were lovely, and the casting was excellent.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Persuasion","review":"This was a disappointment, the lead role Anne was odd looking and her hair and clothes drab.
