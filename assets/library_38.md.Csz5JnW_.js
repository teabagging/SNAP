Everyone should have one talent and Jim Steinman clearly has several; but singing is not one of them.The second problem with this album is that 90% of the songs can be found scattered on Meat Loaf's various albums -- and sung and arranged much better. It's too bad -- the lyrics are fantastic but this just isn't a good CD to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best music","review":"This album is one of the best that my husband and I own we bought it on vinyl,cassette and cd.

The album is bad. REALLY BAD. Nothing can change that. Is is bad for good.Stienman is, whitout a doubt the single worst producer in recorded music history. His bombastic, overwrought style should never have been allowed to be recodred.But this is not all. His songs are just as bad. A song like \\"Rock and Roll Dreams\\" is simply horrific.

When the album was released in '81, it was accompanied by an EP with \\"The Storm\\" as the A side, and \\"Rock and Roll Dreams\\" as the B side. The disc indicated that \\"Storm\\" was intended to be a \\"prologue\\" to the album, while \\"Rock and Roll Dreams\\" was intended to be an epilogue. So what you gotta do, I mean to really appreciate the album as the director intended you to, is listen to \\"Storm,\\" then the album, then \\"Rock and Roll Dreams\\"Come on, you know you care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad for Good Review","review":"While Steinman's voice is no where the quality of Meatloaf's the CD is very good and enjoyable.I can see why it's a bit of a shock to some of the negative reviews about the vocals. If you expected the power of Meatloaf's voice, you'll be disappointed. But when you stop the comparison and take it for Steinman's own work and effort... the brilliance and passion really shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jim, don't quit your day job!","review":"I have to admit to being a major Meatloaf fanatic, and being one, I had to check out Jim's album for reasons anyone knowing either one one the two should be obvious. What can I say? The songs are great, if woefully under-produced for Jim's vocal efforts. The writing is terrific. But Jim can't sing - not like Meatloaf, not even passably. He's got an interesting voice, good for theatre, but I've heard better singing efforts at my local Karaoke bar. The Storm is a great orchestral piece, but you can get tmoe of that, (and less of Jim's singing) on other albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I bought something else","review":"I bought Philips MCM240/37 Micro Hi-Fi System because I liked the slick look, small size, and MP3 support. The sound quality is not best, but tolerable for a smaller room. After about 3 years of very infrequent use, the CD door stopped working (it does not completely open, just moves up a bit and then moves down). The remote stopped working a while ago (I suspect a drained battery, but since I use Harmony remote, I did not bother to change it). Another problem is that some operations (like changing equalizer mode) can only be done via remote. Overall, I'm very displeased with the quality of the product. Since others reported the same problems with the CD door and remote, it looks like a design/engineering problem. Had the CD door not stopped working, I would've given the product a good rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fine when it works","review":"Here's another example of a product that has features available only on the remote control. Once the remote quits, you are out of luck. The first remote worked for about 8 months. The replacement the company sent worked for two days. I'm awaiting the third replacement; it's been six weeks and I fully expect I won't ever receive one. So the unit works well and the sound is fine, but I I can't set the sleep, repeat, or shuffle funcitons. I won't ever buy another Philips product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds \\"OK\\" and looks nice...","review":"Pros: Looks good, works.Cons: \\"Micro\\" sized sound. Zero low-end (bass) response.I run wireless audio from my main stereo system to this unit mounted on the wall in a smaller room.

Mine works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a small office","review":"I recently purchased this item for my wife who has a small office. the reception on this unit is great.

My one requirement was that it MUST have RCA inputs. I found this stylish and good quality sound unit from Philips. It was $70 at Wal-mart. I plugged it into my computer headphone jack (you'll need to buy an adapter cable) and have great sound from my office computer for internet radio, streaming video, etc. Or I can tune in local stations or play a CD. My co-workers were amazed the first time my e-mail alerts came from the stereo on my desk. It is very stylish and takes hardly any space on my desk. Because I use it in the office I don't need super audio quality at high volumes. Perfect for the office. All the other boombox-like models with RCA inputs were $60-$80 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun while it lasted","review":"I purchased this for my wife's studio about 8 months ago; about 2 months ago the CD door started to stick and was difficult to close; now the CD player stopped recognizing CD's altogether; it is now just an AM/FM radio.

The radio is alittle difficult to setup. I am the type that doesn't read the manual. I guess I will need to read the manual to figure it out. Also, there is no MIC, so to connect an ipod to it requires buying a more expensive adapter. But hey, you have the MP3 function already. Just play and forget about it.I highly recommend this product for simple needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good...Sounds Mediocre","review":"Really a great-looking item, sleek and unobtrusive. Remote is extremely slim, but needs backlit buttons. I returned mine for two reasons:1. Overall sound is VERY cheap. An old, inexpensive Sony boombox I own sounds much better.2. Volume control: The lowest setting is too loud for relaxing (we had ours in the bedroom.)Unless you plan to only look at the stereo rather than listen to it, get something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"This thing is a joke. It doesn't play loud enough except for low volume listening. There is no handle to make moving it easy.

She has that kind of voice and rhythm that seem so natural and yet, like Billie Holiday, defy the human range thus placing her in the pantheon of jazz greats. She is earthy yet refined and completely in touch with the band, she moans and cries at places that you'll find yourself wondering how she got there. \\"Darktown Strutters Ball\\", \\"Georgia Brown\\" and the intensely down and dirty \\"My Handyman\\" are sensual, comic and dramatically original-your body will react- guaranteed. Unpredictably fresh, this late great senior citizen packs all she's got and all we need, right in to each piece. I have given this CD as a gift to many people and they have all been smitten and grateful. Decidedly worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible","review":"I'm absolutely blown away by this recording. Alberta Hunter may have been a blues singer but her phrasing and breath control (at 83!) are fantastic. Quite a few jazz singers could learn a thing or two from listening to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice collection of materials from her later years.","review":"CD is good quality recording done in Ms. Hunter's later years. Alberta had a successful career in jazz in the US and Europe in early part of this century, came back to the US, raised a family and had a full career as a nurse. After \\"retirering\\" as a nurse, she went back to performing. While her voice clearly shows her age, it also shows what makes Alberta's performances so great, STYLE! Her voice is filled with character and personality which is simply wonderful. If you ever got to see her live, you'll know what this means. This recording captures some of that and for that reason is worth adding to your collection. She can still make me blush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought this transmitter receiver to watch cable in a room with no line access. I placed the receiver about 15 feet away from the cable box and transmitter, and it still did not work. The best reception I got was by holding the receiver above my head as close to the door as possible - not practical for everyday use. In addition, answering the phone caused more static, a \\"flipping\\" screen, and crackling sound.

The fact that this 800 page book is as fat as some books twice the page count irks me no end (think of the trees!), as does the gratuitous CD ROM (as near as I can tell, it just has the same \\"review\\" questions as are included at the end of each chapter).Well-worth reading if you can borrow this one from a library or a friend, but if you have to shell out 60 skins you may not be thrilled with the value."},{"rating":"1","title":"For novices","review":"A lot of pages wasted on some basic CCNA type of stuff.

We picked up this book thinking it might be on par with Tamora Pierce's books, however, this is a very, very pale imitation. Don't bother buying the book if you are curious, just borrow it from someone or the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claidi is a great heroine","review":"This is the first in a series of books that revolve around a young girl named Claidi. Claidi has lived her entire life as an orphaned maid in the House, a town isolated from the outside world. Claidi has always been told that the world outside the House is full of poison and nearly impossible to live in. Her life changes when a handsome young man from the outside world is captured and imprisoned in the House. Claidi decides to rescue the man and they escape into the outside world.I really liked this book but not quite as much as some of Tanith Lee's adult books. The world is very interesting and Claidi is a great heroine. I also liked the diary format the book is written in. I never really got too attached to any of the side characters but this will probably change in future books. The shocking twist at the end may turn a few people off but it also really separates this book from others like it. If you like YA fantasy/adventure then you should give this series a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ecxellent Book","review":"What will happen to Claidi in the horrible life of the house? The only life she knows is one of harsh punisment and cruelty. But one day when a mysterious traveler gets shot down she is a little suprised when she is summoned to see the oldest and most respected princess of the House and she learns so much about her past and what she must do. Will she go and live in the wonderful citys she hears about? What will her new life be like? I loved this book. It is so interestining and VERY hard to put down. Do you want to know what happens in the end? READ IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book","review":"This story is beautifully written and I think that it is exciting, thrilling story. With some love thrown in as part of the adventure. If you have read books by Tamora Pierce you will love this book. Buy it today. Everyone should own this book. It starts out pulling the reader in. Everything is desribed beutifully. It feels as if you are there with the reader. Get this book don't hesitate."},{"rating":"1","title":"there's so much better fantasy out there, I wish I had spent my time reading them","review":"Claidi is a maid to a mean princess in a prison-like castle surrounded by the Wastes. Her life changes when the lion-haired Nemain crashes his balloon into the castle. Told she is a princess, she rescues the prince and heads for adventures among the peoples of the Waste with Nemain. Smitten with Nemain (who doesn't treat her well), Claidi follows him blindly to his home, rejecting the love of a \\"thief\\" she meets in the Waste. Tanith Lee's writing style is convoluted and distracting. The story is boring and predictable, an endless and tedious journey with the ending clearly spelled out; the characters are flat and banal and hardly empathetic. Wish I had spent the time reading Gail Carson Levine, Neil Gaiman, Diana Wynne Jones, or Douglass Adams. Grade: D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"This was a great book!!","review":"I LOVED this book! From the time I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I have never read anything like it! It is unique and enjoyable, with interesting characters. I love Claidi, who is impetuous and always getting herself into trouble. I also love the character of Argul, the mysterious leader of the Hulta, a group of bandits which Claidi finds herself a part of.This is a great read! I definitely reccomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing, fast-paced, and hilarious!","review":"Claidi is a daring, extremely likeable, and very sarcastic person. Her sarcasm is hilarious and her writing very plausible and intriguing. Tanith Lee creates an amazing world where rain falls sticky red, trees froth over, extraordinary towns (Peshamba) and infamous Towers exist.The Claidi Journals, in my opinion, are perfect for anyone of 10 years or older. Some may consider it petty and too forthright, but this series is perfect for anyone up for a good fantasy read.I have only completed my reading up to Book 3, Wolf Queen, and urge anyone who enjoys Wolf Tower to continue reading the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"a swell journal that tells like a noval","review":"the first book of the claidi journals is not like any book out. the story tells of a naive and headstrung servant girl who wants out and will do anything to accomplish it. Claidi is a lovable character with a lot of heart. her writings are truly those of a young woman with a lot of passion. i really love the way tanith writes in this book, its very honest about the character's feeling of what is happening in the book. i was so hooked on this book that i finished it right away and went to the library for the rest of the series. i liked it so much that i had to get my own copies of the whole series."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great start...","review":"I loved this book. Claidi, the main character, is fun and exciting if occasionally somewhat clueless. Filled with adventure and sarcasm, friends and enemies, and lots more. Great read. Be sure also to read books 2 and 3, Wolf Star and Wolf Queen."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best 4 realz","review":"okaye hey i'm done reading all the claidi's journal and i'm waiting for WOLF WING which is coming in next year so damn i have to wait so long!!!!!! This book is wonderful. I love how Tanith Lee wrote it! but yeah to all of you i hope you do read this cause if you don't than your missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An assortment of wonderful performances by real stars","review":"In my opinion Eddie Dean steals this DVD, right from under Jerry Lee Lewis's feet, and that is NOT easy. Eddie is a real professional and introduces then sings some of his best known hits, which he wrote. This is either an entire show or a compilation of clips from a tv series of the 70's with a young Ricky Skaggs at the beginning of his solo career singing one song. The others sing 1, 2, or 3 songs, and Jerry Lee Lewis is added at the end to 'knock 'em dead', which he does."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"Tah Mahal is one of the best blues legends of all time. His vocals, blues harp, and guitar are the quintesessial of all blues players. I have been listening to him from 1970 the songs never get old. I hope he gets the recognition he richly deserves while he is still on the planet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BUDGET $ CD FOR ANY NEW TAJ FAN OR BLUES FAN!","review":"Yes there are just 10 tunes on this CD but they are the classic Taj from his CBS days. For lil' $ you get a get introduction to this legendary blues cat. From here, go onto the rest of his catalog. HE IS THE REAL THING! A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can hear screams for remastering!","review":"A masterpiece of a CD -- if you can use that word for a compilation -- in some ways. This collection, while rather skimpy and sorely needing of remastering, is one of my favorite discs of all time.Taj Mahal is a bluesman to be sure, but his stuff is infected with reggae (Johnny Too Bad), calypso and other wonderful sounds of the islands. He is the happiest man in show business -- this really comes through in his later records and in live performances.While there are other places to start with Taj's catalog, this CD is very near and dear to my heart. Probably because of \\"Fishin' Blues\\" and \\"Ain't Gwine ...\\" -- two of his finest works. I would recommend this CD if you're looking for an inexpensive way to get a flavor for some early Taj Mahal. But given that there are only ten tracks of poor sound quality, my recommendation is of a personal and sentimental nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery NO GOOD","review":"I am extremely dissapointed in the product (battery) and the processes associated with the product. Namely, the battery would NOT CHARGE as advertised. Secondly, I have to SPEND MY MONEY to return the product and to make matters worse, I had to pay the shipping charges TWICE, for the initial purchase and for the re-order, for which I AM NOT GOING TO RECEIVE A REFUND, not one red cent. So bottom line, I paid over $30.00 for a $8.00 battery. What a great country we live in. Will I use this procedure again, not likely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bought this for my 5 yr old so she could brush her teeth, the thing broke within a week of buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a book that tells you what to do, and what NOT to do to help an addict","review":"I really wanted to email the author and tell her about how this book changed my life, but couldn't find contact information for her anywhere! My mother is an alcoholic, and although this book focused heavily on parent-to-child-with-addiction relationships, I still found it very helpful. Finally, a book that tells you what TO DO and what NOT TO DO when it comes to dealing with an alcoholic in your family. What behaviors actually help the addict, which make the addiction worse, and which simply waste time for everyone? Extremely helpful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addict in Family","review":"A very comprehensive book that shed lights on how one should handle their love ones who has an addiction issue to drugs or alchohol. At the same time, is a book for anyone who is suffering from the negative aspects from their addicted love one, and dun know what to do, to seek refuge, guidance, and hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I've read on addiction","review":"I would be remiss if I didn't get on here and leave a review for this wonderful book. Written by a mother who's daughter was a heroin addict, it's as if she realizes all the mistakes she made and wrote this so others didn't have to go through as much as she did. Easy to read, well written with good real-life examples, plus plenty of highlight worthy helpful suggestions and steps to take. References in the back for getting help with your own situation. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential resource for parents of addicts","review":"Addict in the Family is a helpful guide for parents of addicts. Conyers reviews what is known about drug use today, including detailed information about the effects of alcohol, marijuana, cocaine and heroin, without using 'scare tactics.' Using personal stories, she demonstrates some of the characteristics of addicts (lying, manipulation, denial, etc.). Most important, she provides a blue print for parents to work on their own recovery. As selfish as it appears, the work parents do on themselves also helps the addict. As a coach helping parents of children with addictions, I will recommend this book to all my clients."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent....right on!","review":"Addict in the Family it a great read for both the family as well as the substance user. For the family it confirms everything we feel and how we unknowingly continue to enable the user. It gives you help on how to encourage the user to seek the help they need while not enabling and giving them the love and support they need. I though I understood my user, but this book filled in all the missing pieces and helped me to really get it. For the user it helps them to understand what the family really goes through and how their substance use really affects the ones they love and the family dynamics. I leave mine in the bathroom or on the coffee table and often I see it moved or placed differently....he reads it a little at a time when he visits....and sometime we have open discussions about something he has read in the book.

The book itself was in EXCELLENT condition even though it was used and was advertised as \\"good\\" or something like that. So the company exceeded my expectations which made me very happy. The book itself wasn't what I thought it was going to be about BUT it was very nice to know the experiences that people have gone through being a family member of a loved one who has an addiction problem.

Amazing book well worth the price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starter smoker","review":"So far, I've done briskets, pork shoulders, chickens, turkeys and salmon, and everything has turned out grat. It's easy to use, easy to feed and keeps food moist; the water pan works as a buffer.The review would be 5 stars except that the temperature gague says \\"warm\\" \\"ideal\\" and \\"hot,\\" but neither the manual nor the company knows exactly what temperature range those words correspond to. I actually contacted them and asked, and the answers I got were imprecise.I've found, for example, that \\"ideal\\" is great for doing a chicken in 2-3 hours, but you want it at the high end of \\"warm\\" cooler if doing brisket for 10-12. Otherwise, though, no complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok design, but comfort is hit or miss","review":"Like many others going through a \\"pillow crisis\\", I've tried many pillows in many shapes and sizes and I know it is a maddening process. I purchased this based on the level of customization it provides, and on that level it does succeed - however I just couldn't get comfortable on it. It is well-made and easy to use but comfort is so subjective with pillow shopping and the no-return policy is what gives this a lower rating. My suggestion is to try to find pillows that are returnable, but if you are desperate like I was, then all you can do is buy it and hope for the best. That is a tough way to shop, so read the reviews and take your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"OMG! I love this pillow","review":"I bought this pillow after using my wife's one night when she was out of town. She bought it from her chiropractor who said that it would help with her shoulder pains and headaches.I was sold right away. My sleep quality has greatly improved, and I have more energy during the day. It takes some getting used to, but it works well for side and back sleepers (I'm both). Also, sleep apnea seems to have diminished as a result of clear breathing passages. This pillow is a great find, and I've already suggested it to several friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the CD!!!","review":"I am only 16 and taking level 4 french, but I LOVED this cd! I am taking french at my highschool, and I was so thrilled that my french teacher played \\"Romeo et Juliette\\". We also listened to \\"Notre Dame de Paris\\", but I did not think it was as good as \\"Romeo et Juliette\\". I would highly recommed that people all of the world should listen to this CD or watch the DVD. Without french musicals and songs, my class would not have been able to listen or watch any of these plays. I will give all of my credit to this CD to Gerard Presgurvic and my wonderful french teacher Madame Deckas-Becerra for showing us french music and culture. Thanks for making a great soundtrack! Also, when will Romeo et Juliette come out on DVD with english sub-titles??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romeo & Juliette de la Haine a l'Amour","review":"This is an absolute masterpiece. I saw the original musical when i was in France in summer 2001 with my parents for my father's business trip. Then he got tickets for the Romeo and Juliet musical. First, i thought.... musical? But then I saw it. Even though we were near the top, it was amazing. Unforgettable. The music grabbed my attention and held it through til the end. I couldn't understand French, but could just feel the love and the pain from the singers' voices. When it was over, i could not leave the theatre without getting the CD.

I think there was only about 3 people asking questions that I didn't recognize from another DVD. If this is the only one you buy it's good but if like me you watch and buy quite a few then you might want to rethink this purchase.It's a shame but I am going to stay away from them from now on and just read the books because there is no point and I don't want to feel like they are just out to get more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Abraham on weight loss","review":"This DVD is a compilation of people asking Abraham about weight loss during many seminars that Abraham has given.

I dont think it's meant to be used all over, but it's great for spot treatments."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I have to agree with the reviewers who said this product was not a strong hold spray. It does nothing for me at all. It does not hold as well as my medium hold spray. I don't know how it can be called a Freeze Super Spray, for it is definitely not. It was a complete waste of money and I would not recommend it to a friend or buy it again. I have short, fine hair that I curl with a curling iron and this was worthless to hold it after just a few minutes and I sprayed it from a distance so just a fine mist fell over my hair as per my hairdresser's instructions so it would not flatten my hair. There don't seem to be any good products out there for my purposes these days so I guess I'll just save my money.

I think Ray would be pissed if he knew they were selling junk like this with his name on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tough read","review":"This is a tough book. In the beginning the main character, a Palestinian girl, is just realizing she has lost her father. Throughout the rest of the book she is realizing she may soon lose her brother to the dangerous anti-Israeli activities he engages in. The story is strictly told from the Palestinian point of view. The mother in the story introduces the idea of antiviolence as she explains to her son that Islamic Jihad was the group that killed his father, through their actions toward Israelis. There is a bird the main character uses as comfort and as a symbol of flying away from her world of violence. It is an engaging book. If I were to use it with my classes, I would need to be sure both sides of the conflict were presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-sided, should not be used alone in a class","review":"The book, while written well for its target audience of elementary school kids, it is so one-sided in its description of the Israelis and the Palestinians that I would never use it in a classroom, unless it was used in a course on political commentary and bias. The book provides no context, no explanation why the evil Israelis would be gratuitously causing violence against the innocent Palestinian people. Nothing about suicide bombers. Nothing about 40 years (at that time) of efforts by Arab countries to \\"drive the Jews into the sea.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatally Flawed","review":"While there is a lot to commend in this book, it is fatally flawed because it gives no background to the Arab-Israeli conflict. The Israeli government is portrayed as a particularly horrible villain oppressing an innocent nation. This book needs an Afterword that, at the very least, explains that the Israelis have suffered tremendously by the Arab nations' refusal to let them live in peace.

A brilliant spoof of just about every sci-fi movie made in the 40s and 50s (and naming just about every one of them in the opening number), this show is a real treat.

I finished the book in a few hours and felt utterly insulted. I can summarize all the advice given in a sentence = MEMORIZE every programming book you buy and have the most basic common sense when dealing with various situations in your life. The author treats you as someone retarded lacking any sort of common sense, repeating almost every \\"idea\\" at least 5 times. He then tries to sell this as a perfect example of his \\"method\\", which is to memorize everything. This book could maybe be a 10 page article in a magazine but that's about it.

This music is not for the immature or people just wanting to hear some music. In order to appreciate this album, you have to have been through some things in relationships. You have to have to be able to understand where he is coming from in order to apprecaite the seemingly simple lyrics of most of the songs. Case is not your plain old R&B singer...he sings love songs.

You can listen to it from start to finish without hitting that \\"next\\" button. His last 2 records went only gold, but this one definitely deserves to hit platinum.

Reminded of the mad general in Strangelove, warning of \\"losing our precious bodily fluids.\\" Somebody behind both these films obviously shared this terror. I see the other reviewer here claims the soundtracks on these two are redone, but I can't imagine a different soundtrack would improve these.

I went through stages: from Addiction to Intrigue and then to anticipation of wanting to beat it.Cons: I was hoping for more of a scary feel. At times you may feel a little creeped out, but nothing more. A few (4 out of 38 or more)puzzles did frustrate me.Tip: Buy the game if you like detective work (the constant studying and keeping your mind open) and you like forensics (not the study of dead people but the pragmatic approach of seeing the result and looking everywhere for the cause), if you like details.Look for hints and beware of forums that don't hide spoilers.

It had a very confusing intro. like a situation comedy, where the film immediately opens to a 3-4 minute scene before any opening credits--only the scene feels like you're suddenly watching the middle of a movie. It seemed out of place. Then the credits started and I was relieved that neither my computer nor Amazon was messing up after all. With the introduction of the first 2 lead characters, the writing and acting seemed engaging. However, I started to get bored when these characters ended up at a restaurant, where the 3rd lead was introduced.

It acts as a great introduction to a wide-range of musical talents and styles, and it contains some powerful compositions. The tracks featured demonstrate the versatility of many African vocalists today, and the album exhibits some beautiful experimental sounds.Check out E'MMA, a plaintive anthem, DONI DONI, or M'FONO YAMI for a taste of cd 1.On cd 2 try ATTENTION COCO, an uplifting folk ballad, or SANGO, a fast-paced soukous number with a soaring guitar duet."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does it mean?","review":"This is one of the most confusing bunch of words thrown together that I've ever seen.

To quote the product description: \\"Beautifully presented with archival photographs, newspaper articles, and racing memorabilia, this book commemorates one of the best racehorses of all time.\\" That sentence is what made me choose to order the book. There are two small photos, one of Phar Lap and Tommy Woodcock on the title page and a small photo on page 165. Okay, 2 pictures qualifies it for plural on \\"photos\\" but only technically. I don't know what qualifies as \\"racing memorabilia\\" but there were racing statistics and a chapter rambling on about pedigrees, pricing colts, etc. I get a lot of good books, some at great deals, through Amazon.

This finds the remnant of the Jews staying in Petra and the GC unable to harm them. Meanwhile, the Co-op is trying to continue its work for believers without being caught.As an individual book, this would be a very difficult read. As the series progresses, new characters are introduced, which makes it a little difficult to follow everyone's movements. The cast of characters in the beginning helps, but it still takes some concentration.In this book, the authors mention the followers of Islam. The depiction here doesn't follow what LaHaye has written in other books outside of this series, but it makes since that the followers are mentioned in this series.I would recommend reading this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can they drag it out any more!","review":"The Remnant was extremely disappointing. It was almost as if different authors wrote this book. It took over 200 pages to move through one story line that didn't really move the story. And where was the God part in the first 200 pages. I love the series because it makes me think. I was so looking forward to the next book and now I am extremely disappointed in how slow the book reads. We now have all these characters but nothing is happening to them. I hope the authors take more time on the next book, it showed that this one was rushed through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not anywhere as good as the original first book, \\"Left Behind\\", in this series....","review":"I bought The Remnant on audio cds at a local thrift shop, thinking I would enjoy it as much as I liked the first book of the Left Behind series, titled simply \\"Left Behind\\".But I was deeply disappointed. \\"The Remnant put me to sleep...it was so s l o w moving that I never made it past cd #2."},{"rating":"2","title":"all of the left behind series","review":"I have read all of the series. each one build on the next one.

I liked it because it was very readable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading into soap opera...","review":"I've been disappointed in the TV show ER, in how they have abandoned the great medical action and descended into a soap opera of character combinations. That mirrors the feeling I have toward The Remnant. I feel that the tribulation action has been replaced by the petty interactions between the main characters. The whole thrill of the books is the way they bring to life the Biblical prophecies of the book of Revelation. This one didn't do that very well for me.It was very disjointed, especially in the scenes with the angels appearing. It was hard for me to sense continuity in this book. It could be that this book will prove to be a foundational book for action in the ones to come, but I have to admit that I had to force-read this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Let Down in the Series Begins....","review":"I guess it had to happen. Books Six, Seven, Eight and Nine were absolutely excellent. Halfway through this book, I was getting excited about what was promising to be a strong end to the series. But as I noted, halfway through this book, everything hit the brick wall with a loud, resounding splat. The first half of this book continues an excellent storyline, and continues working phenomenal character growth. But for some odd reason, this book quickly degenerates into a Bible tract. Much like Books Four and Five, the second half of this book destroys the excellent promise and progress of Six through Nine. I have hopes that things will turn around in the last two books of the series, but somehow I see the preachy Bible tract aspect continue through to the end. What a shame if it does...this series had so much potential to be more than just a scare tactic towards witnessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.. God forgive me..","review":"I'm sorry but this was poorly written. I've enjoyed the series up to this point but this is not very good. I love LaHaye but he should have read the book and at least spiced it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had enough","review":"After immensely enjoying the first few books in the series, I have started to find that the last few just plod along. I find myself just turning the pages without absorbing what's going on. It seems as if they are trying to stretch out the series as much as they can. I've decided to stop reading these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad theology and worse writing","review":"If you are sitting on a hilltop waiting for Jesus to come rapture you out of this world, you are sitting exactly where satan wants you to be. But Jesus wants you to get off your backside and get to work healing the sick, visiting the lonely, making disciples, etc. If you absolutely must read this tediously boring book, you can check it out for free from your local library. Don't give another dime to LaHaye and Jenkins. You can read this book on \\"fast forward\\" by skipping over the pages and pages of meaningless dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Left Behind book where nothing happens!","review":"Just read the last few pages if you want to see what will happen! I can't believe how boring this book was. It was torture to read. I really loved the first few books in the series. The idea was compelling and the writing was pretty good. Now, I believe the authors think they have become such a commercial success that they feel obliged to turn out a book every few months. The books are very short; huge margins are found on every page yet it is beginning to take forever to get through each one. And, like I previously stated, NOT ONE THING HAPPENS! I know one thing, I won't be buying any more of these books; I have wasted my time. Now, on to Jane Austen where everything is wonderfully written and you can't wait to see what happens next (even if you've read it ten times before!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is dragging on too long","review":"I have read all the books in the series up to now and the last few have very much disappointed me. The first few were so breathtaking that I counted the days until the next one was released. Now I feel most of the story is just filler to stretch the story line out as far as it will go.With this tenth edition I'm finally calling it quits and will not read another until the series is completed. This is the only way I feel I can state my opinion that enough is enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Speed It Up!","review":"I have enjoyed this series from the beginning, but the authors are getting ridiculous. It's like Jenkins and LaHaye want to milk their cash cow for all it's worth and don't want it to end. The book should have been titled \\"The Rescue of Sebastian\\" because it seems that's all they covered. I'm done waiting for these books, and done reading this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book of the series","review":"This volume shows extreme unbalance with the first half totally concentrates on the escape from Greece/the deliverance of Petra from the missles. The second half is very boring with many episodes copied straight out of the Bible, e.g. the openning of the earth to swallow the rebels. This is the only book in the series that I had to force myself many times to finish reading. Also, I hope there will no more airport-escaping scenes in the next books. Maybe my expectation is too high, but I really think that the authors have not done a good job with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have lost their way.","review":"I loved the first nine books in this series. I loved their imagination and interpretation of the end of days. They did a great job in the first few books to really build the characters and involve you in their struggle. I could not put the first 5 books down. I read them straight through. However, this book is just a list of events. It is neither engaging or addicting. It seems like they released this book because they feel a need to complete the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough, already","review":"I concur with most of what other reviewers have said about THE REMNANT. Authors, where is the other dimension of writing that would have given us an idea about what the rest of the world was going through in the Tribulation? Authors, where is the character development that would have strengthened the credibility of your series to a wider, secular audience? Authors, why didn't you stand up to Tyndale House and say, \\"Forget the launch dates. We need more time on each book to write more thoughtfully and comprehensively?\\" Editor(s): why weren't you more objective and helpful in working with Jenkins' and LaHaye's manuscripts--why didn't you tell them, \\"This can be much, much better!\\" Did you think your readers wouldn't care? I certainly do."},{"rating":"1","title":"simply awful","review":"Regardless of your theological viewpoint on the endtimes, it is hard to get past the shallow, irritating characters, silly plotlines and insipid dialogue. The authors are doing a serious injustice to Christianity by continuing to churn out these poorly written books. My guess would be that most people buy them only because they have read the previous umpteen in the series and just want to see how it ends.Well, I have a suggestion for them: read the book of Revelation and you will get the idea and save some money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone Should Read!","review":"Yes, everyone should read this entire series. It is so spell-binding, it is hard to put down. Each book is as action-packed as the one before. These two authors have my complete respect for the research they did & the way these books were written. I am so impressed with this series, I will recommend it to all my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Togetherness","review":"This tenth book in the best-selling Left Behind starts out with God miraculously protecting both believers and nonbelievers in Petra from a rain of fiery missiles. Dr. Tsion Ben-Judah and Chaim begins to teach them the Lord's Word, all the while Carpathia thinks he has the upper hand with the Trib Force gathered all together. Tsion and Chaim begin developing programs to teach believers world-wide (as much as the world is left, even as Petra is swept for any known impostors. Now with six months into the Great Tribulation, Jews and other believers were being tortured and killed on every continent. Rayford and George are punished to do manual labor. Now with more of God's judgments being sent, Carpathia and others are steeped in heat.This was a book I reviewed for Tyndale House Publishers."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Remnant is Gathered and Protected in Petra..","review":"I just finished Armageddon, and I am writing a review for both of these books right now.This series did seem to drag a little slower in the middle books, but this book, The Remnant, and Armageddon both kept my interest rivetted to the pages and I am thirsting for more.The series picks up in this installment and takes some giant leaps in the next book. I am still VERY hooked on this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright, already...","review":"Loved the first several in the series, but now I feel like it's all a rehash with no new material. Character development is weak. Still worth reading, but just doesn't have the emotion of the first books in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"Book 10 is mostly an action book that covers a longer time period than the earlier books in the series. It didn't leave as much of a cliffhanger ending as some of the pervious books."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Remnant","review":"Talk about being left behind. This book just drags on and on. I really enjoyed the books before this one. I guess I had my expectations too high. It is taking me forever to get through this book.......3/4 th's through it at the time of this review. I am determined to read the whole book. If anyone has trouble going to sleep at night, this book ought to help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wordy & repetitiousI","review":"I read the first two-thirds of this book hoping for some action and less conversation.

Were it not a Costco-line read, in depth and content, I probably wouldn't have made it this far. For a quick reference, try The Confessions of Alistair Crowley. No big fan, me, but his old man, another evangelical nut case, swore that any day [now] the Armageddon would commence and JC would return to watch the non-believers burn, baby burn. And that was like 150 years ago. Oh, but the \\"signs\\" were all there, for the \\"seers\\"... Folks, it ain't gonna happen. Will we burn? probably, but you can thank your elected officials for that probability, not good god, sitting on high. Save your money and watch TV, at least on TV you get a little superficial love and affection served up with your daily dose of guilt and violence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready.... FIRE! Aim...","review":"Wow.. Did this book miss the mark.. (no pun intended). I am a hyper fan of the left-behind series, and this one left me in a serious lurch. I think they're not sure how in the world to dramatize the end of life as we know it before the armageddon. This book meanders around, and has zero focus. The first 210 pages of the book revolved around the crew in Greece. Its so pathetically looking for page material, you wonder why in the world they published it. In prior books, many things would be going on, and a little operation like the one in Greece would only have taken a few pages in any other book, certainly not the 200+ pages this monstrosity devotes to it.I will still be devoted to the series however; I can't imagine its easy writing about the Apoacalypse, how to describe what will happen then is difficult. I'm dying for the next Dramatic audio series to come out, what a phenominal job they do.God Bless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"This book, like all the ones following the first one, is a big disapointment. The authors are stretching this story too much because of marketting strategy. For example, the whole rescue operation for Sebastian could have been written in half the amount of pages it took. I find it really insulting that we have to wait a whole year for a book with mediocre writting and diluted storyline. In my opinion the series should have been over by now. This book is not even a good paper weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going Downhill","review":"I really loved the first few books in the series, and really liked the next few. The previous book and this one, however, are really going downhill. This book contained a lot of filler and just didn't keep my attention like the books earlier in the series did. I think it's time for the series to be closed out instead of stretched out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the narrator","review":"I have purchased all of the Left Behind series books in audio form to listen in my car when traveling. They were all fantastic with Frank Muller. This one I shut off before listening to all of the first tape as I could not get into it. The narrator makes all the difference in the world. I hope that before the next one comes out, contact is made with Mr. Muller to do the reading.Please, please go back. I will not purchase the next one if it has the same format as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame!!!","review":"That's it, I have given my last dime to LaHaye and Jenkins!!I thought book 9 was bad, but this one is even more boring. The last 4 books could have been combined into 2. Obviously this story is being strung out to what end I don't know...money I suppose. Not very becomming guys. This book is wordy, repeatitive, and lacking in creativity. It's entertainment value is zero. This is sad for a series that started out so great and had such good potential to end up like this.Could they at least get the firearms details right? Guys, an Uzi uses a \\"magazine\\" not a \\"clip\\" and your description of the recoil of the .50 caliber weapon is a gross exaggeration.Bottom line, this book goes nowhere fast. I used to read them to at least see how things finish up. This series has become so tedious that I no longer even care about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged too long","review":"This series is dragging too long, becoming so boring... The authors should bring the story to an end and look for a new story line. I'm only going to read the next book in the series if it ties up the story and covers the Glorious Appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well below par...","review":"Boring. There is nothing to this tape. No real story, suspense or drama. The narration was well below par of the previous tapes. And, the music has got to go. You get three minutes of fluff at the start of the tape. I agree with an earlier review, either they are milking it or, he has lost what he is trying to say. All the previous books were better edited, narrated and written. I hope that the remaining tapes are of better quality as we pretty much no how the story is going to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ever wonder...?","review":"To make this short, this is how it is going to be someday. I believe this series and the latest installment to be great reading and a keen insight to the coming tribulation the world will someday face. Read it - think about it - look around you and compare it to what is happening today and the book will take on a whole new light. Imagine yourself in the characters shoes.

Jerry Jenkins knows exactly how to get his reader inside the head of his characters, to make you feel like you are in the middle of all the action, actually living through the apocalyptic times after the Rapture. To any who have not yet started reading this series I must tell you to start right away, don't be one of the ones \\"Left Behind\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can Scim This In An Hour...","review":"Gosh darn, I ain't no speed reader but...This book is so wordy and full of redundant adjectives, you can read the first sentence of every paragraph and be done in about an hour.

I haven't been able to put any of the books down (I stay up late reading and don't get anything else done until I finish one of the books). Along with the great story line, the reader is able to learn about things from the book of Revelation in the Bible. I went to a Revelation Bible study a few years ago, and didn't learn as much as I have reading these books. What a great thing these authors have done for those of us who don't have a great understanding of Bible prophecies. I actually borrowed the first eight books and needed to find the rest of the series so I went online and I was able to find and purchase the rest of them from Amazon.

This began during book 3 and I find myself doing it more frequently. It is becoming apparent that the authors are either being pressured by the publishers or themselves to churn these out faster. In my humble or otherwise opinion, they could be at the same point of the Tribulation with about 60% to 70% of the text to date, with a lot more bang-for-your-buck page turning excitement along the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I picked up this book because I'm a fan of apocolyptic fiction...

The theological backing for this book is hardly examined, nor are the characters fleshed out...

I found it to be very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have followed this series and hoped for much more. It is more than clear that these writers are only out for financial gain. Each book I hoped for something better, I hoped they would open their eyes to the real reason we are reading these books, inspiration and entertainment. I can see no entertainment in mindless dribble and the story line is so far off course. If they were looking to write sci-fi or war novels they should have pursued that instead. This is my last, I recommend anyone to spend their money more wisely. How much more could this drag on, While we wait for something to happen these authors are out spending your money talking of how to keep this going for another 10 books. Flush these authors and their books!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Remnant","review":"The Remnant; It is very difficult to review this book due to the fact that I haven't received it yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Remnant","review":"LaHaye and Jenkins should go into dairy farming because they sure are good at milking this series for everything it's worth.

However, if anyone has trouble sleeping I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentalist Christians Against World Peace","review":"This book continues to perpetuate the myth that working towards world peace on a global scale is the anti-Christ's goal. Another myth continually advocated in this series of books is that Americans are the chosen people. This book undermines the belief that Jesus loves ALL people, regardless of whether they live within the boundaries of the United States or the United Emirates. I give this book two thumbs down for promoting right-wing fundamentalist Christian rhetoric, which leads our world down a path of racism, war, segregation, and terrorism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Scripturally Sound and Poorly Written","review":"The pre-tribulation rapture is not taught in the Bible anywhere, thank God that post-tribulationism is gaining more of its ground back.

Indeed there will. I must admit, the relentless marketing and didactic writing make me weary of the whole enterprise. But bashing the series doesn't do any good. I would instead urge anyone who is fascinated by this series to at least consider the fact that the millenial views it espouses have only recently gained this level of acceptance. In fact, it was in 19th century America that dispensational premillenialism exploded. The history of the Church does contain premillenial views, but other views of Revelation and the end times have had great support. Please consider a book like Mark Noll's Scandal of the Evangelical Mind, particularly its discussion of how these views came to thrive in the American context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow & Boring","review":"The Left Behind series takes yet another boring turn as it slowly runs out of gas!Having read all of the previous books in the series I'm sure I'll trudge through the remaining installments but it will be a trudge. Jerry's style is boring, never ending, blah blah blah, between characters we care nothing about because there are just simply too many! The entire story at this point is nothing but all these boring characters repeating time after time the same things, no setting of scenes, no attention to visual details, etc. It's just bad writing. You can get the jist of the entire book and miss very little by just reading the last two or three chapters. I'm sorry but that's not a good book.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"going through the motions","review":"What a disapointment! These guys are obviously running out of idea w/ this series!

This reads more like a Bruce Willis action film than it does about the rapture and battle of good against evil. I'm afraid the authors have forgotten the message they were trying to send with these books and seem to focus on more action and intrigue than sending a message about the scriptures. It's a real shame - up until the last 2 books I had throughly enjoyed this series - I just really feel that this is more geared towards Suspense and Action than it is focussed on God, Evil versus Good and Armageddon. Who knows, maybe the end of this book will have more redeeming qualities"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed.","review":"The Remnant is definitely not the best book in the series. Nor do I consider it to the be the worst (*cough*Soul Harvest*cough*), either.My biggest complaint is that the first half of the book covers about 3 days, and the last half covers about a year. It's gotten to the point where I believe the authors' favorite words are \\"4 months later...\\". Have they realized that they only have 2 books left to wrap up the series?Of course, no matter the quality, people like me will buy the next books, just because we can't stand not knowing what will happen. What if Christ returns the day before the publication of the last book.......... I won't complain! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent","review":"I have always been a Left Behind fan ever since I read the first book.

Apart from The Legend of Wooley Swamp, which is a CDB classic, it's hardly representative of his best work. South Sea Song has to be about the worst song he's ever recorded. It sounds like a warmed-over Jimmy Buffett track, although I doubt Jimmy would touch it. Lonesome Boy From Dixie isn't bad, but kind of cliched, as is the inferior El Toreador. No Potion For the Pain is kind of bland, and Dance Gypsy Dance is ruined by female backing harmonies that sound like Olivia Newton John. Carolina is a heartfelt track, and Money isn't bad, but In America is an example of one of Charlie's worst traits - his penchant for jingoism."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I HAVE PURCHASED HIGH END KENWOOD EQUIPMENT AND AN HATATCHI TVTHIS REMOTE COULD NOT LEARN THE REMOTES AND WAS UNABLE TO BE PROGRAMED TO RUN MY SYSTEM.

Keep in mind that I love Sony products, and own various new Sony components (home theatre system, blu-ray player, digital video camera, digital camera, etc.). I just thought Sony would have a superior universal remote, but I was wrong. This unit is very cumbersome to operate, and if could compare it to the Harmony One product, there simply wouldn't be a comparison.

Be warned that if you use the preset codes for the remote, you will NOT be able to change the commands. It is better to use the ADVANCE mode to program each of your remotes by hand. After 4 hours of trying to figure this out I realized I had to do this. If you try to mix preprogrammed settings with your own settings the settings downloaded to the remote will not be recognized. The touch screen has a really good backlight which you can program for how long you want it to stay on. Programming a sequence of commands to turn on all your audio and visual components is very easy to accomplish. There are other features, such as XPress that I haven't used yet.

It's not easy to change from one equipment to another, and when on the same equipment (e.g.: Digital Cable controller) it's cumbersome to move between extra options. All in all it's better than handling several different remotes, but it could be way better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I owned the original versiom of this product, and it performed well for 6 plus years. Regretably, it was dropped on a hardwood floor,and gone.I ordered the latest generation of the product, and to my dismay, I found that once correctly set-up, and out of nowhere, the remote would send strange signals. One of a nuber of examples: Push the favorites, and the power turns off.

Could not use PC Setup, kept getting an error message that Commander had insufficient available memory; OK, used Remote Setup. It works well for the first two or three commands, but then it slows down. For example, it turns on the Panasonic TV promptly (\\"Component\\" \\"TV\\" \\"Power\\"), then the trouble begins\\": Pushing \\"Input\\" to go from Cable to DVD takes FOREVER.Called Sony at (800) 822-2217, spoke with \\"Allen\\" in the Phillipines for 43 minutes (cell phone, free on the weekends thank God). He diagnosed a defective unit, transferred me to \\"Melissa\\" in Customer Relations to send the replacement. Spoke with her for another 25 minutes (a lot of the 68 minutes was on \\"Hold\\"). End Result: Sony MAY require me to pay $82.92 for a replacement because THE AMAZON PRICE IS TOO LOW (MSRP is $220). Needless to say, I'm returning it to Amazon.Just thought Amazon buyers of Sony products might be interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product usage","review":"I purchased thisi item to replace a similar older model sony remote. The new one I purchased has been found to be not user friendly and customer support was of no help. When programing the remote with the computer program it has difficulty matching with any reote that has more than one feature on it. And the online instruction manual does not solve the problem. Tech support could only repait what the manual said and had nothng additional to offer. It should be noted the software is PC only and will not work on a mac. In addition if you want to test the remote during programing the pc needs to ge hooked up and near the tv. This is a problem if you do not have an appropriate laptop.

However, this just didn't do it for me...The main problem for me was that the on-screen button area and text are too small to read without my glasses, which I don't wear when I watch TV, plus, you can't feel your way around the remote like you can with the normal raised remote buttons.The remote also does not do a good job of simulating things such as my Tivo remote. Also, while the box even said that it supported Tivo I had to go to the Sony web site and download the latest firmware for the remote before it even knew what Tivo was.Despite the issues listed above and others I tried to use this for a while, even though the rest of my family gave up on it right away, but after about a week I gave up and returned it...As usual, Amazon was great with their return process."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I rarely write reviews, but I feel compelled to warn people about this product.

Because of his fight for India's independence and the non-violence path he took to achieve it and brought whole India together, he was referred as MAHATMA.The author lacked minimal knowledge on Gandhi.

And the author made some good choices relating to the characters, namely that the main one, Ryan Knox, is suffering from real problems in the midst of encountering this haunting.The only problem is that the author misses some key instances where the story could've been developed a bit more. Ryan's wife is only minimally developed, so that I'm on the verge of caring about her loss, but am not quite there. Perhaps some flashbacks with dialog would've helped. There's also a scene where Ryan's doing an aside to the reader about a co-worker, Dave, and how he introduces him to his wife. Personally, I think doing this totally spoils the surprise when we encounter the woman later in the story.It's a decent book, but it's definitely not best seller material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not CRP, they are Meyle","review":"I expectecd these to be CRP pullys, but instead they are Meyle pullys, MADE IN CHINA!!!They are getting hard to find, but I wanted everyone to know they are the Chinese ones and not of decent quality.

The film is worth seing if you are a fan of the series, it has all the elements of a Zatoichi, but lacks the intense drama that acompanies the older films. Seeing Kitano as Zatoichi instead Katsu was just to weird. I also think the twist he decides to put in at the end is just to way over the top and I don't see why he thinks he can just change around a story that isnt even his.

Although \\"Zatoichi 2003\\" was beautifully shot with lots of choreographed violence and action, the plot centers mostly on what I would have considered marginal characters rather than on what Zatoichi is doing. Zatoichi barely says anything in this film! Furthermore, the ending is absolutely preposterous and insultingly comical, making this mere below mediocre imitation of a flawless original feel even more like a parody than it was. \\"Zatoichi 2003\\" is to be enjoyed only by those who haven't ever seen the original films and like their movies depthless, shallow, and with lots of meaningless action."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Zatoichi!","review":"I don't know what movie these other people watched, but it sure isn't the 2003 reprise of Zatoichi, not if they liked it at all!

It is by far one of the best films to come out of Japan since Kurosawa. Reading other's reviews, I found it hard to get a feel for this movie. Here is how I would describe it: It's like Kurosawa's Yojimbo, but with a blind guy, two geishas (who have their own little quirks), a bunch of small musical sessions which seem to be like Riverdance, Stomp!, and Kodo drums all put together, and blood spurts almost equal to that of Kill Bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Stereotypes","review":"This is my favorite Samurai film ever. Rather than go down the time worn formulaic path of traditional sword flicks pioneered by Toshiro Mifune, Takeshi Kitano blazes a new path without any regard to the expectations of the Western audience. Takeshi uses a modern hip hop soundtrack that is closely and cleverly tied to the action of the film as a signal to break down our expectations of what is to come. There have been enough films made in the traditional sense and so he is obviously trying something new.

The special effects were of poor quaility, the sword fighting by Zatoichi was mediocre and the story was nothing special. In addtion, his silly hair color was distracting and he had no personality. Perhaps the actor was attempting to make the character different from the original, but still, he was not interesting to watch.I really wanted to like this film, but at every turn I felt let down.One positive was the scenery and the setting for the scenes which did not feel fake like many Hollywood films."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Beat\\" got the beat!","review":"Perfect intro to get familiar with Japanese film.

Unfortunately for him, the American version of this disc simply chose to ignore their wishes, saturating the color to make the film look \\"normal\\" for American audiences (since we are a bunch of neophytes who could not understand that the color was desaturated on purpose). Joe six-pack apparently also wants films that have been oversharpened, distorting the original film look. This, and not providing us with a high quality version of the original Japanese soundtrack (naturally that is reserved for the dubbed English version, since, again, American audiences cannot bother to read subtitles or care about hearing the original language of the film) make this version of the film on Blu-Ray a slap to the face of any discerning film lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Basics of Christianity for Kids","review":"I am 19 years old.

The action and sets are very good, and the adventures are well done and believable. Lassie, the consumnate actress/actor, is gorgeous, brave and convincing.The outstanding cast of actors maintains the quality and interest of the stories, and you should find them very enjoyable, and your kids will love them. (despite the fact that it is a given that Lassie always comes out on top, and the bad guys lose. No mystery there.)The variety and depth of the characters she meets on her adventures are very well played, and even many or the antagonists are depicted as misguided, and many come around with improved attitudes, by the end of the films.These are films for the whole family to enjoy. I recommend them highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional service","review":"These are wonderful family movies for children eight and up.

I spent about 3 hours removing all 4 wheels, cleaning them, and applying the polish... only to find no benefit. I know this for sure since on one of the wheels I left one spot unwaxed so I could compare. After a week of driving, there is no difference between the waxed and unwaxed part of the wheel. When I went to wash the wheels I hit them with water and the unwaxed part of the wheel was no different from the waxed part. Save your time and money.

It def shows the ups and downs of love, and the lengths some people are willing to go for it. unrequitted love and determination are prolly the biggest things within this anime,since the main character is determined to win the heart of suzuka[which we learn early on]. Overall Suzuka keeps you on your toes. when you think one thing is going to happen and things are finally going to work, somehow something else gets thrown into the mix. If you like drama, and sport integrated animes and romance then I recommend Suzuka."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the manga no justice!","review":"Suzuka is a sports-themed comedy that intersects the pursuit of love and athletics. The story is based around Yamato Akitsuki, a young man from rural Hiroshima Prefecture moving to the big city of Tokyo, and his new next-door neighbor, Suzuka Asahina, a skilled high jumper. Yamoto falls in love with Suzuka and pursuing a relationship with her he joins the track and field team hoping to impress her. After joining, Yamoto discovers that he has the potential to become a top hundred-meter sprinter. The Manga is top notch and well told, while anime fails to capture what made the manga so great. The story only goes up to the end of Yamato's freshman year and never really shows us what the story is capable of. It isn't bad, but they could have kept going. Also the Dub is decent and the English voice actors do a decent job of bringing these character's to life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliches Galore.","review":"I bought Suzaka at my local video store, and I have to say it's a pretty weak show. The animation is pretty cheap, and theres not that many good moments in the show. I myself bought it on a whim because I though I would find the Track & Field elements interesting, and I did. However just as you get into those elements, the romance/SOL kicks back in. which I would'nt mind if it was actually well done, however the way the characters & romance are portrayed in this Anime is fairly weak. And again, the series feels Bipolar at times, it wants to be a SOL/Romance & a Sports anime, and kind of fails at both. Overall its decent enough for what it is I guess, I'd give it a solid C. However, I would stick to the Manga for this particular series, which I have heard many say is far better, and has nicer art, lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinante = Fascinating","review":"Though I��m spanish and not proficiency writter, my interest for Second World War spy and intelligence operations had found in this book, a perfect source of intrigue and action relates.With several chapters refered to different war stages; divided theiselves into lots of personal descriptions, subsume yourself into risk operations and secret files once upon a time.The writting style it's dinamical, fast, manage to wake up yourself inside the same action.It's not able similar book in spanish language, what a pity !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aweful -- not worth reading!

Two things set it apart: 1) It goes phrase-by-phrase in its commentary, covering nearly every word of the text, and not (like some) giving the gist of paragraphs. 2) It is heavy in Greek, yet one needs no background to understand. The focus is on the meaning of key words and the explanation sheds much light on the text. While based on the RSV, Fisher understands that no translation can do complete justice to the original Greek text.

I thought the book would be exactly what the title said: a celebration of the long, proud history of Harley-Davidson, replete with gorgeous, suitable-for-framing photos of the company's products. The book arrived. I took one look at it, and gave it instead to my friend Bob, who has a taste for oddities. Bob took one look at it, and exclaimed, \\"THIS IS A COFFEE-TABLE BOOK ABOUT HELL'S ANGELS!\\" As indeed it is, down to the last bike-chain-wielding bruiser and Jello-wrestling biker babe. Sure, they all ride Harleys, but Harley-Davidson itself is--shall we say--peripheral to the book's actual theme. The photos are very well-done, if suitable-for-framing pix of Hell's Angels are what you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, yes","review":"I have to agree with Durand. David Sylvian created a gorgeous ghost of an album with 'Brilliant Trees'. Check out 'Red Guitar' or 'Ink in the Well'. The jazz influences are kept in check, adding texture, not running loose. Jon Hassel's disembodied horn quivers and floats through the title track and 'Weathered Wall' while Sylvian's wounded croon paints a testimony.There are no stinkers on this album. Japan pinnacled with 'Oil on Canvas' but David Sylvian made a leap forward with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"1st and the most upbeat","review":"Sylvian's work is pretty mellow but this first solo effort has a little more groove to it than a lot of his later work.

Toaster ovens like my Cusinart that fit a 12\\" (medium pizza) will not come close to fitting this pan. So to use this pan I need to use a full size oven, not nearly as economical. I thought this would catch the edge drippings but still have a crispy crust due to the large holes. Since its TOO big, it caught any drippings but the pizza was noticeable less crisp. Would not have purchased if actual dimensions were listed or a warning that it is not intended for use in toaster ovens."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOW what is whiteness?","review":"When change finally came to South Africa, it came fast. Whites are the focus of this fascinating study, because whether they fought for or against that change, whites find the carpet pulled out from under their old identities. Just like their black compatriots, they are redefining themselves. Melissa Steyn conveys much about the dynamics of personal and social change and describes some of the currents flowing in the new South Africa. The book is searching and objective, in keeping with its academic status, but it is accessible, with touches of humour."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow movie.

I think years have passed between the two wars. Their is alot more problems with this book. So look for another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy and dated","review":"I am glad that I didn't pay for the book because it really isn't worth it. If you are looking for a more recent treament of the war, I would suggest Jenning's Empire of Fortune or even perhaps White's Middle Ground.If you are looking for a prejudiced, lurid, one-dimensional 'Injun massacre' book - I would suggest any of the works of Francis Parkman. His writing is much better, and at least his nineteenth century viewpoint can be used as an excuse against his bigotry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half a day of my life lost I'll never get back","review":"This book is terribly written and I wonder if the editor should ever have been paid. The author's documentation is poor and he plays it loose with his \\"interpretation\\" of history.

I will not even begin to discuss the awful editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided fiasco","review":"I've not much to say except I'll never read another of Leckie's books.

But I'd read a page, my blood pressure would sky-rocket and I've have to stop. It wasn't even a dislike based on his so-blatant-as-to-be-self-advertisement opinions, but the mere logic of his examples and sentences were too much to take. Having just finished Anderson's _A Crucible of War_ made this fiasco doubly painful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another book to learn about the North American battles...","review":"On paper, the concept for this book was decent. Discuss the founding and early colonization of America, discuss the relations of the French and English colonists with the American Indians, discuss the tensions leading up to the French-Indian War, etc. But, it is so long and drawn out that you begin to just jump to the specific parts that you're interested in: King Philip's War, Braddock, etc. It's especially bad for the biographies within the book: Columbus, Frontenac, etc.The author seems to be knowledgeable, but the presentation style in the book turns this subject into a long, boring lecture hall. My next goal is to find a better, more interesting book about this subject matter. I suggest that others should just bypass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, TERRIBLE!","review":"Do yourself a favor - dont bother with this one. It doesn't even qualify as history as far as I am concerned. Leckie comes off as a biased (he bashes female fighter pilots), racist (he flat out calls the Chinese a \\"backward race\\" and implies it's impossible for them to have been the inventor of gunpoweder!(see 51) and vindicative (he loves to bash on the British ever chance he gets) windbag. Nevermind that the first 30 some pages of the book put you to sleep going on and on about Columbus when what you bought the book for was the French and Indian Wars. What ever happened to objectivety? I am so disgusted with this book and this author I just can't get over it. I could spend well over a thousands words illustrating just how terrible this book is, but it would be much easier to just take the high road and discuss its merits: well, dang, there are none. That was easier than I thought. So much for the high road."},{"rating":"1","title":"A publishing travesty","review":"This book is so poorly written that I could not get beyond the first 30 pages. I returned it to the bookstore, telling them it was unreadable. They gave me my money back. I cannot imagine a reputable publisher having put this piece of garbage into print. For some of the specific complaints that readers had with it, see the other reviews. This is an especially significant problem because it is the only book published in this generation which purports to cover all four of the French and Indian Wars. That period of hisory deserves much better than this publishing travesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"French and Indian War","review":"I have read many books on the French and Indian war, by far I find that Francis Parkman is the \\"Godfather\\" of that time period but I stumbled across a copy of \\"A Few Acres of Snow\\" by Robert Leckie and couldn't put it down. He covers the settling of Canada and the colonies and gives you insight into what was happening in Europe at the same time. It's a must read for those who enjoy the history of the French and Indian war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel","review":"What a terrific letdown. Having been eager for information on the French and Indian War, I decided to purchase this book without first learning a bit about the author. Live and learn. Leckie is chauvanistic, pedantic, outrageously opinionated, and boring. Fans of Chuck Norris will likely find A Few Acres of Snow entertaining and philosophically reinforcing. I now understand how this author can be so prolific -- all the information he requires is between his ears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I have quite a large collection of books concerning the 18th century, primarily the F&I war era. When I heard about this book I looked forward to adding it to my library. Unfortuneately, I should not have. The book is poorly researched, if at all. If taken as a reference, it does nothing except propogate the inaccuracies that have plagued much literature on this timeframe. As sudent of the 18th century, I feel that this book was a waste of my time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist-Sexist-Uneducated-Unedited","review":"The author of this work must be associated with an ultra right-wing organization. His views are strongly pro-Catholic, pro-European, and anti-female. Examples include his repetitive insulting references to Cromwell and Queen Elizabeth I, his repetitive discriptions of torture by the American indians (while somehow ignoring parallels from the Inquisition), and his degrading comments towards females throughout. At one point he digressed to the point of suggesting that female fighter pilots are useless because they would be shot down by past world war aces (what? ). The historical content may be interesting but the \\"color\\" which the author adds makes it difficult to consider him any type of historical authority. Additionally, this book is unedited, with numerous non-sentences and considerable repetition. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly disappointing!","review":"I read through the first two chapters and realized my husband's bookmark was stuck a chapter later; he had tried to read it several times and couldn't make it past the first couple chapters. I suspected we purchased this book in a bookstore as it looked interesting without having the benefit of reading through a review. Anyway, the perspective is that of a devout and arrogant Catholic preaching to a teenaged audience and is written more like a bad juvenile novel than a history. I just wasted almost 2 hours reading the book and looking this up and writing this. So bad I had to share... one star is too much for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Story Gone Bad","review":"Robert Leckie has managed to take a great and fascinating time in American history and turn it into a thoroughly pedestrian affair. Leckie conveys little of the excitement and interest of the times and is rather short on facts, as well. In fact, too often he seems more interested in venting his curmudgeonly opinions about such irrelevant matters as women in today's armed forces. As if the poor quality of the writing weren't detriment enough, the proof reading job on the volume is abysmal, the maps are inadequate, and there are few illustrations (although many are available) to convey the color of the times. A very disappointing volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by a Grinding Axe","review":"A \\"saga\\" of an important historical period in the settling of the North American continent by the European powers.The author lost my interest in his prose and viewpoint by way of off-topic diatribes, sudden jumps in topic, and a readily apparent slant in his choice of quotes and verbage. Even his one \\"digression\\" in a footnote is a faulty argument.Even-handed this is not, therefore I don't see it of little value as a scholastic work since I'd have to question any and all of his assumptions by checking his source material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful--simply awful","review":"I'm glad to see so many other people despise this book as much as I do. I've been a fan of Mr. Leckie's work for many years, so this was a real shock. Badly written, incoherent in places, vague in others, totally off-topic in still others, this is by far one of the worst books I have ever wasted money on. My favorite (if that's the word) passage sets forth his speculation that if women had been allowed to serve as fighter pilots in WWII, they would simply have been shot down very quickly, thereby wasting something like $37,000,000 of the government's money. WTF?????????????? I can't decide whether Leckie was stoned, drunk, insane, senile, or merely crassly in it for the money when he wrote this, it's that bad. Ummm, would anyone like to buy my copy? Forget what I said, it's a treasure you will want to read and re-read..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating, well-written account of the long struggle for North American between England and France","review":"found it difficult to put this book down from the get go. In addition to presenting a very well presented history of the conflict between France and England in the New World and Europe, the author provides a graphic account of the role of Native Americans in this struggle as well as their own in meeting the mostly English assault on their lands. A less interesting and more politically correct account most likely would not have detailed the extent to which cannibalism was practiced by the Native Americans involved in this battle for North America."},{"rating":"2","title":"French and Indian War","review":"This is not Robert Leckie at his best. Having said that, it is still a very readable account of the conflict which set the stage for the Revolution that followed.

What keeps it from getting one more star is the lack of payoff in what was a nice build up of sexual tension between Lottie and Sean.

It's of use to those who are embarking on a lifelong partnership and want to know how to lay solid foundations, or those like Marjorie and me who know the ropes but just need to do a few running repairs after 45 years (the last 9 drink and drug free ).

This is extremely light business literature. I would not recommend it to a true student of wealth, as it has no nuts and bolts, on how money is actually made. Don't get me wrong, its in there, but you have to pick through all of the history information to get it. The history lesson should have taken a back seat to the business lesson, but that is not the case. Its like talking to a professional athlete, who, as an employee for the owner, can only tell you about the game, and what he did to get his check.

I read the book a to z thinking I might've missed something interesting, but most of the stories were boring with capital B and I haven't found any scary stories in it.

It's so nasty the kind of things that Leila(Molly Parker) had to go through. Her character is so discontended, and traumatized sexually, emotionally, and physically. It's a truly a star showcase vehicle for Molly, because she gets to display a great deal of dark and painful emotions. Callum Keith Rennie is very good as the deceiving and malicious boyfriend who gets off by manipulating Leila for sex, money, and betrayal to her husband. It seems that Parker has developed a fondness for dark and sexually disturbing films, examples like Centre of the World and Marion Bridge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This was a perfect fit and color, easy to order and quickly arrived.

Abrahams has the ability to create 13- and 14-year-olds who are real people, not \\"kids.\\" Yes, they are teens, but they have left childhood behind and haven't yet entered adulthood. Sometimes they act wise and mature, sometimes they don't. But at no time are the characters in this book \\"cute.\\" They're real.In this book, in addition to the conflict with her father wanting Grampy's farm land for commercial development (something that really bothers Ingrid, who wants the land to remain farm land), there's something going on with Ingrid's older brother (who is, she discovers, taking steroids). And there's something extra-strange going on at the company where her father works. As she tries to figure out what's going on -- Ingrid is kidnapped. This was a great twist in the story, something I wasn't expecting. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading for any Golfer","review":"Do you want to get ripped off the next time you buy golf clubs?

He was instrumental in developing the tests used to certify club fitters, so the information he lays out in the book is priceless.The information is easily understood and applies to the rank ameteur as well as the low handicapper.

And he does love this video, but doesn't like to watch it alone. First, there are a couple of graphic shots of dead elephants. Then, there are some dramatic sound effects and intimidating angles of elephants' feet coming down. Also, one shot shows a man (in a studio), aiming a rifle at an elephant, and shooting. The elephant disappears, so we don't see the animal dying. Still, our son has focussed on that, talking about people shooting elephants. The bottom line is, it's an excellent video for older children, but I don't recommend it for the very, very young."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Basic Instruction","review":"The book has the basics that you expect from a 'for Dummies' book.

No reason at all - the device hadn't been hit, dropped, etc. Basically it was still brand new and would have no reason for breaking. It just simply stopped working. So I called the customer support number and no matter what day of the week or time you call, the phone just rings and rings and rings and basically there is no service at all and nothing that can be done.

I've heard this work performed many times by many soloists and ensembles, often beautifully, but never better than on this recording. Every note that flows from Ma's bow is exquisitely formed. His phrasing is sensitive and deeply expressive, and he certainly is not afraid to take risks. The interpretation is fresh, dramatic, and daringly original. The orchestra's contribution is perfectly complementary. Yo-Yo Ma and the English Chamber Orchestra have breathed new life into this sometimes tired old chestnut.

This is a classic pop album, and a classic from Streisand! She worked with the Bee Gees on this album, who produced and wrote the album. Two of the songs were duets with Barry Gibb. That includes the title track which was a big hit, and the ballad \\"What Kind of Fool\\", which was a #1 on AC. The biggest hit though was the first single, \\"Woman In Love\\", one of her biggest and best hits ever. The rest of the album is just as good, with nice ballads like \\"The Love Inside\\", as well as other pop songs like \\"Run Wild\\", \\"Promises\\" and \\"Life Story\\". The album closes with a 7 minute ballad called \\"Make It Like A Memory\\".

Previously the Bee Gees composed and produced for their late brother Andy Gibb. No,Barry Gibb is not intruding in the photos contained in the album although his name does not appear on the cover or the label. He's only Barbra Streisand's producer for the GUILTY album. Two songs were written by all three Bee Gees. They are the title track and WOMAN IN LOVE. Between GUILTY,Dionne Warwick's HEARTBREAKER album and Kenny Rogers' EYES THAT SEE IN THE DARK album,this one had the biggest sales record to date. It still sells well after its release 23 years ago.

Yes, the sound is great, and much better than the regular CD, but if I can't get this onto my iPod, what's the point? I had to spend MORE $ to get the sonically inferior regular CD.

When I saw the 25th Anniversary edition, I grabbed it. Boy was that a mistake. Maybe it's just me but I absolutely HATE the way they've done the separation on the DVD side. I kept feeling like I needed to turn myself at an angle to hear things properly and even then it just didn't work for me.In fact, this was one of the first DualDiscs I ever bought. It put me off buying DualDiscs for a LONG time.I still love this album, but I'll stick to my old, single-sided CD of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guilty Not A Remastered Masterpiece","review":"I was very excited knowing I was going to receive a remastered version of Barbra Streisand's Guilty album, one of her most popular albums of her career. Upon playing it, though, the audio quality, in addition to the importing quality ('ripping it' onto my pc's hard-drive) I found to be very sub-standard. Upon reading the sleeve of the album, it stated that \\"Dual Discs\\" didn't conform to the same high standards for their audio reproduction as regular CD's, so you can imagine how disappointed I was at the lack of both quality and a 'remastered sound', which was also - in my opinion - lacking. I therefore returned the item, and was further disappointed to be unable to find the regular CD remastered version (without the dual disc feature), for I wanted to reorder just the cd. I still am without this great album..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm Guilty of Loving This Album!","review":"I was never a big Streisand fan, but with Barry Gibb pulling the strings on the GUILTY album, the outcome is a set of beautifully artistic love songs, hinted with the magic only Barry could give them. Barry and Barbara sound very good together. \\"What Kind of Fool\\" may be the most powerful song he's ever written, and that's saying a lot. Since Gibb did all the of the writing for this album, many Bee Gee's fans should find GUILTY up to par. I sure did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wearing Well After 20 Years","review":"Certainly worth re-discovering if this one's been at the back of your CD rack. Yes, it can be schmaltzy and Gibb-infused drivel, but who better to sing it? 'Make It Like A Memory' is still a phenomenal stand-out (just listen), with obtuse orchestration and an oddly ethereal feel. The test of Barbra as an artist is her constant ability to push herself into musical styles with which she is uncomfortable and make them her own. She certainly does that here.The commercial success of this album aside (I'm unclear why that is a 'bad' thing in many reviews), this album is a knockout."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect, timeless *and* exciting","review":"When Rolling Stone rated this 5-stars, I had to take a listen. The rating's no exaggeration. There are so many lovely tracks, wonderfully orchestrated and accompanied by Barbra, who will never have her vocals so well showcased. Every track, including the big hits like \\"Guilty\\" and \\"What Kind of Fool\\" not only sound great, but have genuine emotional content. And there's a bonus: Superb engineering. Just wait for the SACD version. I own the half-speed mastered CBS LP and the recording quality ranks with the best I've ever heard. A triumph of easy-listening non-mush adult contemporary music."},{"rating":"2","title":"thumbs up for barry gibb","review":"there are several reasons why this is streisand's most successful album - it was released at a time when she was at her commercial peak, having released four consecutive platinum albums, and this one continued the streak; another is that barry gibb was at his creative zenith, he really couldn't fail in the late 70's; much of the credit for this excellent and enjoyable album goes to gibb's superlative arrangements and production, and of course exceptional songwriting; whereas one could find fault with the oblique lyrics, his sense of melody is uncanny; streisand's interpretations are fine throughout, although not as faultless as on the previous album, 'wet'; this one is nevertheless an absolute must-have, a cornerstone of adult contemporary music"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album Of All Time","review":"I have anxiously been waiting to get this Cd.

This is a beautiful combination, and this combination produced this wonderful set of music.A little R&B/Soul enhanced Barbra's voice, and proved that she could sing anything, and make it sound like it's her own style.

They have managed to create some of the mostmemorable songs in history of which this album is asignificant and magical contribution.The melodies, lyrics, lead and background vocals on every cutof this album are pure magic.

Unfortunately, this book, as others have noted, is the antimodel for strong rhetorical arguments, which Mr. Perelman claims to be espousing and instructing in this brick wall of flowery language submerging any instruction to be gained from it. Not only is the translation severely lacking so that one must constantly reread sentences in a desperate effort to ascertain what the author meant to say, but the book is far, far, far too long. Brevity is a virtue Mr. Perelman never seemed to have. Each possible topic and sub-topic is demonstrated with story upon story upon story.

Cicero wrote that the essentials of a rhetorical presentation were brevity, clarity, and plausibility. Of these three essentials, \\"The Realm of Rhetoric\\" comes close to achieving only the third, and doesn't achieve that one well. The plausibility of an idea decreases as the opacity of its presentation increases.The ideas expressed in this book, if expressed with brevity and clarity, would probably make a good essay. Expressed with prolixity and opacity, they make for a tedious book. Aristotle, an author not noted as an easy read, did a much better job over 2,000 years ago in his seminal work \\"On Rhetoric.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Realm of retoric","review":"This edition is too condensed to make much sense.

Although the author has a couple of very good ideas, his thesis is ruined by his frequent reference to biblical stories as proofs of the points he is trying to make. Were he to rewrite the book with secular rather than biblical references and then get himself a really good translator, this book might even be useful. As it is, it is rather inaccessible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best one","review":"This is easily my favourite Loverboy album. Before they became just another AOR hair-band, this album was one of the best hard rock-new wave hybrids ever made. I remember the buzz that came from this album. It was so fresh and original that nobody could believe it was a local Vancouver act. The first two songs are indeed great hits, but my favourite remains \\"Lady of the 80's\\". You're not likely to find a better combination of new wave synthesizers and hard rock guitar on one song. Turn it up loud, and it will be a revelation. By the way, Paul Dean was a very underrated guitarist: not exceptionally fast, but a wonderful stylist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met them on an airplane.","review":"This was one of the first albums (although I bought it on cassette tape) that I ever purchased. I used to listen to it over and over throughout the early 80's. Roundabout 1995 I was on a flight from Vancouver to Chicago and the band was on the plane sitting all around me. They were nice guys.

This song had a fresh sound that brought new life to album rock stations across the country. \\"Turn Me Loose\\" will always turn up on a classic rock station somewhere. This, Loverboy's first album, also contains \\"The Kid is Hot Tonight\\" but little else worth mentioning. Both hits off this album can be found on \\"Big Ones\\", a greatest hits compilation that is far superior to their debut effort. Loverboy still turns up on rock stations to this day because they knew how to write catchy tunes and rock a little more than some of the other bands of the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing new group","review":"I have to disagree with the last review, giving Lace only 1 star.

I wouldn't really compare them to the Dixie Chicks or SheDaisy. They have their own sound. It's as simple as this... if you like \\"I Want A Man,\\" you will love this album. There are no unexpected surprises here. What you see is what you get.

The Albeniz works included on this disc, while not written for guitar, are transposed beautifully here for the instrument and are played by a guitarist who can deliver the music with great sensitivity and warmth. Part of that warmth, which, simply, can not be conveyed fully by mere words in a written review, may also be because this recording appears to be analog and not digital. For those who desire an alternative, better yet a supplement, to Williams' guitar renditions of Albeniz' music, Alicia de LaRoccha can't be beat in her 2 CD solo piano recording of Albeniz' works. Also, Williams' recording of Bach's Lute Suites can be considered \\"Volume 2\\" or an extension of this Williams' Albeniz guitar gem on account of similar warmth (in playing and apparent analog recording) and sensitivity.

The book if filed with his prayers and one of the highlights of the book is when he meets some LDS missionaries in Russia and the wonderful times they have going to McDonalds. Save your money if you're looking for a spy thriller, spend it if you're looking for a religious story about a man growing closer to God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst book I've ever read","review":"Really? I cannot believe that I actually finished this thing. There has to be vanity publishing that's more polished than this thing. At the point where we got page after page of what a thrill it was to eat at McDonald's I began to wonder if this was a joke and I was just missing it. Nope- there is no irony here at all- it really is that bad. However, if you have the kind of taste that thinks McDonald's is fine dining, then this is probably the literature for you.

I have purchased five in the past few years, three were gifts and two for myself. Each time I listen to it (which is frequently)I am captured by the pureness of the violins...absolutely perfect, of course how could it not be with the best violinists in the world playing!

Some how the Freestylers can give you an entire album that consists of variations on a theme. Songs seem to span multiple styles within the same genre. Each track is both entertaining and distinctly individual, yet they keep to the original thread. All things considered...it's fun, and it's funky. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost five stars, but...","review":"The first couple of times I listened to it, I enjoyed it all the way through. However, some of the tracks seemed to lose its effect--especially \\"B-Boy Stance\\" and \\"We Rock Hard\\" (6 & 7). They do have some catchy instrumental grooves like \\"Breaker Beats Part 1,\\" \\"Feel the Panic,\\" and \\"Warning.\\" On their next album, I'd like for them to explore more into d'n'b (drum 'n bass) like they did in \\"Warning,\\" the final track. BTW, I originally bought it for \\"Don't Stop\\" and \\"Here We Go,\\" which I thought were great... ...until I heard the instrumentals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some Dope Beats","review":"I agree with the previous review.

The world is still seeking answers, and only a few have found them and are trying to get the message out. Action packed and a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that bad...","review":"This book was recommended to me by an evangelical friend, and at first I dismissed it as one of his occassional attempts to convert me. But I'm a sucker for military fiction, so I gave it a try.The result? Not impressed. The book promises \\"technical accuracy\\", and you get that in spades, though I'm quite sure why we need to know that the M4A1 is indeed four inches shorter than the M16. In fact, there was quite a lot of unnecessary technical detail. The Simonov SKS is chamberef in 7.62, but why do we need to know that?I found the whole book very turgid and lifeless, and it seemed to me like yet another \\"LB\\" cash grab. As for the story itself, well, I follow Fred Clark, so I read this story with a cynical eye. It had me laughing at the utter absurdity of it all at several points."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Very good book series, expertly written, It really made me think about my relationship with Christ and reevalute where I stand with him.

Nobody expects an original plot out of Odom, given how his story is inevitably going to chug along the prophecised tracks laid down in the Left Behind books. However, he ought to at least make an effort at invention, else he might set an example for a generation of lazy hacks. I mean, the lead couple is named \\"Goose\\" and \\"Meg\\"?

It still is not clear why she married this man, stayed married to him or quite frankly why he stayed married to her. On their wedding night he tries to kiss her for the first time (not counting the quick wedding kiss) and she turns her face away from him, at which point he \\"forces\\" himself on her. After 2 or 3 such episodes she decides she's in love with this man she can't seem to stand and barely seems to tolerate his attentions. A more cold fish I've never read about. I take that back that would be her husband, maybe they did deserve each other but you don't.

If anything can ever get me to roll dough ten times, it will be the fillings in this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The only Pasta Book you will need","review":"It has everything you could ever want to know about pasta, making pasta,and sauces to go with that pasta. I cannot wait to indulge myself with some of the recipes at my dinner table."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Overlooked Gem","review":"\\"Elevation\\" is an album that fits nicely with much of the rest of Pharoah's Impulse! catalogue. Most of the elements one would expect to find in a Pharoah Sanders album from this period (early 1970s) are here: music that is alternately meditative and furious (some of the best free improv of the period can be found in those loud furious orgiastic moments); chants; tunes that place emphasis on percussion; at least one tune featuring sitar. Add to the mix elements of Nigerian Highlife. He's at the top of his game, and the band plays with that sense of looseness and familiarity that comes with years of working together. Mostly it sounds like a bunch of good friends having a deep, spirited conversation. Well worth picking up. Hopefully \\"Elevation\\" will be reissued here in the States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinkpad 63717DU","review":"This is a slightly out of date Thinkpad (Lenovo) with Windows XP and no DVD burner. The price was right for superior Thinkpad quality. Wide screen is great, keyboard is excellent, fan is quiet, hard drive is quiet and fast. Ergonomically this is even better than the Dell Inspiron 8000 it replaced, and the Dell was very good. This laptop is slim, light, beautifully well constructed, and the tiny keyboard lamp is very handy.Although this was a good buy from Amazon, I have seen more up to date versions of this computer with DVD burner and Windows Vista and a bigger hard drive and more memory for about the same price, so do shop carefully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best, not the worst.","review":"I picked up this book in the Barnes and Noble discount bin a few weeks ago. Seeing as how I am currently living in Chicago, I thought it would be a rather interesting read.Well, I was partially correct.First off - for readers that abhor poor editing, don't buy this book. It is self-published and has had little to no editing whatsoever. Reading this book was quite painful, from the misplaced punctuation marks to the unfortunate misspellings. The lack of editing made it difficult to want to continue reading.That aside, the stories are lackluster at best. You'd find better confessions on some of the HBO shows of the same topic. While I'm sure the author's experiences were quite a study in human relations, he fails to effectively communicate the humor or interest in some of the tales he tells.All in all, I wouldn't consider the book a complete waste of my time, but I don't think I'd choose to read it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Thriller With Plenty of Suspense","review":"Despite the fact that this storyline has been done many times (ideas seem limited among certain genres), Fault Lines offers a refreshing spin on this a tale of a released convict seeking out a shrink who knows too much about him.Readers are introduced to Psychiatrist Michael Stone who fears that pedophile and sadist Alex Willy, recently released from prison on a technicality, will seek to harm her because she is the only one privy to his sick and demented thoughts. Attempting to continue her practice and help other patients while looking over her shoulder makes for great suspenseful reading and it all comes to a finale with an awesome twist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poor ending!!!!!!","review":"This book kept my interest until the end- it was an anticlimatic conclusion.

She has even produced educational videos about sexual predators. Why then, does she use these types of people as a vehicle for entertainment? I can't even begin to understand what her motivation is.This book is about a sick and violent individual, who gets his jollies from torturing children. I couldn't find anything redeeming in it. Particularly gruesome was the scene where the sexual predator described to one of the characters how he was going to mutilate her genitals. What is the point of this type of novel? Stalter should be ashamed of herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was very disappointing","review":"I was expecting a BOOK of fairies.

Of course I love the lounder stuff like \\"Oh Well\\" and \\"Wild Love\\" and \\"In 2 Deep\\" but those 3 softer songs just get me. When I listen to them I get that feeling, you know what I'm talking about? But the only way to get the full effect of this album is to see them live.

I like the CD Live on especially the song \\"Where was I\\" which they did accustically and was the best song I have heard played that way. Also like the song \\"Was\\" that song is also very soulful. I would like to see them live in concert. I know it will be an awsome concert to see.

After two amazing CDs this is what KWS offers us? The sound and songwriting is rushed and the band sounds weak. The songs that were written strictly for radio play (more than half of the CD) are just awful. If \\"In 2 Deep\\" is the only song you've heard, be warned, it's the only good song on the CD.

The fact that people buy this trash and call Kenny a legend is a disgrace.

I suggest that all blues fans check Jonny Lang out and leave Kenny's trash right where it belongs, on the shelf collecting dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not your typical blues","review":"Just as we saw with SRV before his untimely death, the blues movement is taking many turns. No, this is not a blues recording in the traditional sense, but the blues can be expressed in many forms. That's what I see in this recording. Sure there's a lot of studio \\"work\\" on the album. But unfortunately that's the way his music will get the wide distribution it deserves. Just as we saw with Stevie, as this young man moves through his life he will stay true to his blues roots, but will also try to develop sounds that the comercial radio stations will air. Those of us who love the blues should support this young man as he moves the blues forward to the rest of the listening public."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big BIG Disappointment","review":"Ledbetter Heights was a good intro album, Trouble Is... was an excellent follow up where KWSB starts to show some style, but Live On sounds more junior than Ledbetter Heights.

Had the item cost half as much, I would have expected this. For an item that will cost over $20.00 by the time it's shipped to you, and only consist of a few wires and metal bands, the least you could expect is an appearance that it was put together carefully.

The previous reviewer is spot-on regarding the topics covered, but he fails to mention that De Villiers managed to leach almost every ounce of interest from them.

I have no doubt that this book will be a helpful aid for those who might not have believed such an educational opportunity existed for their child. It can also serve as an impetus in motivating parents to begin the process early in their child's educational career. You have done an apt job in tearing away the veil which has obscured admittance to many of our nation's best schools. I can only hope your book will have a wide readership among mainstream America.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is NOT for most people......","review":"I ordered and returned this.

What I do is fill up a cup with soapy water and switch it on, job done! This one comes with a tin case so you can take it along when you travel.

Especially, there are approaches that use newer technology with far more currency. The value of this book is the discussion behind the tool. Peter thinks. He thinks about why things work. He's seen enough fine craftsmen to know that his way is certainly not the only way, and that any number of odd approaches seem to produce exceptional results.Combine this book with his Woodworking Basics and you pretty much have the content of his two week course at his school in Maine. Remarkably, what you will get out that course is not an expert ability to cut dovetails or sharpen chisels, it the comprehension of why you do what you do. There is a difference between education and training. Education gives you comprehension that allows you to extend what you know into areas you may not know. Peter's forte is education, and it is reflected in this book.

Hate to tell you that this movie put one of the friends to sleep and others were clearly irritated at the pace and the material. After 60 minutes throught he movie, we all finally gave up. I tried watching the second half the next day and could not get through the next 45 minutes. Seriously, this is one of the worst movies I've seen. Again, apologies for being so blunt but weekends are the only time we get to watch decent movies and wasting both friday and saturday on this lousy movie was the last thing we had on our mind.

The outer and inner thigh exercises for one half of the body are totally missing!! I even rewound the tape just to make sure I hadn't made a mistake. I guess they thought people would buy the tape because they figured they would get a whole body workout in only 29 minutes. That's not the case.

This collection of previous material (primarily from \\"You Might Be A Redneck If\\" and \\"Games Rednecks Play\\")is entertaining, as always. It is also extremely misleadingly labelled, to an extent which would constitute fraud if I had paid a subtantial sum for this CD. Most of the \\"tracks\\" are single-joke segments of an extended routine, and half the material repeats from the song segments to the stand-up parts. Putting half the material on twice does not add up to a full length album (and, at about 45 minutes total running time, this ain't a full-length album anyhow). Next time, wait till there's enough new matieral to warrant a full release, rather than trying to soak fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth having","review":"If you have any of the other Jeff Foxworthy CD'S then it is best to skip this one.

Hebblethwaite chronicles Pope John's many significant contributions to peace during his brief reign. We can see how many exploited the goodness and the kindness of Pope Roncalli during his lifetime. It seemed that His Holiness wished to set up \\"peace at any price\\" as a rule of government. We can see this from his utterance of his historic phrase, \\"Me, I was born to bless and not to condemn!\\" Which was his underlying order for the Ecumenical Council that for the first time in history limited themselves to blessings and therefore did not condemn the errors of its day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising but Deceptive","review":"While there is much useful information in this book, I find it disturbing that these \\"Christian\\" authors claim to be speaking for christianity when what they are really doing is advancing right wing christian ideology.

Much of the best ones came early on and these included this one. It is set in the latter stages of the western Roman empire, and its decline is really felt here.Wht makes the book compelling reading is the fact that Attila the Hun features strongly here and much of the story is involved in the Roman struggle against the Huns, and the other is a poignant passage relating to Casca returning north to a now abandoned Helsfjord (see Casca 5: The Barbarian) and the sadness and melancholy is a man damned to live forever is fully brought out.

First off its short, REAL short. You could have stretched both into 3 episode OVAs on 2-discs making the experience more enjoyable. Instead we have every character smashed in for cameos with no partciular roles except for the ones we're accustomed to: Negi, Asuna, Ayaka, Konoka, Setsuna, Yue and Nodoka. That's right only 7 out of 31 characters were actually used properly. The biggest problem is the 2 episodes clearly took turns bashing and favoring both Asuna and Nodoka which is fine for some but for me it was a wasted opportunity to progress the relationships with some of the characters, finalize a romance with Negi and Asuna/Nodoka or bridge a gap into the second season.

I like my Celtic folk straight up, with relatively traditional elements and arrangements. When Talitha MacKenzie stays away from the synthesizer and the drum machine she makes me very happy. She has a lovely voice and she shines in the simplest tracks on this album. Unfortunately, most of the tracks have been arranged as 80s pop tunes, which have not aged well.This in mind, I recommend the following tracks:Uamh an Oir (The Cave of Gold -- Mouth Music)Rol Hol Ill Leo (Waulking Song, Sea Shanty)Theid Mi Dhachaigh (The MacKenzie Lullabye) -- very lovely.Otherwise the album is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lord, this is so terrible!!!!!!!!!","review":"This album is so incredibly tacky.

I have been anticipating listening to Untying the Not since the day I heard it was coming out... At first listening, I was confused (not in a bad way...) when I heard the songs. It definitely does not sound like the bluegrass SCI but has everything a music fan can appreciate. The material is as strong as ever but the album is overproduced in some ways.With that being said, the more I listen to the album the more I find myself discovering different textures in the music. The album is definitely worth buying if you are a fan of SCI but do keep an open mind w/ the (over)production.

I've tried going back and listening to it after taking breaks of several days and even weeks and it still comes out BORING. They seem to have lost that creative streak and are trying to play maybe something that someone in LA thinks will be more commercialy appealing? I really can't tell other than it dosen't do any thing for me. I went back and listened to \\"Born on the Wrong Planet\\" and was struck by how much fun it was and how creative.

It is excellently done. Man is powerless to overcome his plight, it is the Power of God that is needed to deliver. Well written and as valuable today as 50 years ago. Interestingly enough, M. Lloyd-Jones observed at that time that the Wrath of God had not been preached for the preceeding 50 years resulting in the complacency of man at his time. How much more so now, after another 50 years of false prophets healing the hurts of the people superficially saying peace, peace when there is no peace. The Wrath of God is vital imformation, it is one of the five topics covered in depth to present the Power of God as the cure for the plight of man.

Mark McLaughlin presents fact in a fascinating format that I found most entertaining. The research behind each story is transparent as the story unwinds like a family history passed down by word of mouth on the front porch. His attention to detail regarding trains of the past and his generous supply of accompanying photographs solidify the experience of riding the rails yourself.I highly recommend this exceptionally fun book.

Pathetic.I wouldn't even say it was character driven. The characters are flat, emotionless, pathetic excuses for human beings.

Okay, I admit I only watched about 20 minutes of it, and most of that time I went in the other room to do something else; but I could still hear it. I was waiting for the funny. It never arrived. The characters were uninteresting bores too. This is probably interesting to a NYCity person who considers him/herself to be ... less than boring, watching more boring people on screen. I mean, the occasional quip was a massive release for the heavy boredom that would have put me to sleep otherwise.

Her performance alone is worth buying the CD. \\"Wolf Tracks\\" however did not do as good of a job. This was not due to Clinton's performance as he was simple reading the story not writing it. 'Wolf Tracks' is very preachy and very weak attempt to get people to care about the environment. In addition the music for 'Wolf Tracks' is pale in comparison to 'Peter and the Wolf'. With Prokofiev you walk away with humming the themes for all the characters, with Beintus you walk away wishing you stopped the CD after track three.

It is read by Sofia Loren, and she has a nice way of telling the story. I was surprised how much I liked her reading style. There is an intro by Mikhail Gorbachev, which is nice. There is also a second story read by Bill Clinton. I am a pretty liberal person, but even for me I thought this story was way too sanctimonious. It is a lecture on the need to preserve environmental habitats. I listened to it once just to make sure I gave it a fair shot, but it is more irritating than anything. Sorry, Bill Clinton.

(this is reason review is 1 star instead of 5)Personally, I believe that religion should be taught in the home. If the makers of these cards wish to include religious holidays they should not only print the names of the holidays they include on the box but they should also include a sampling of holidays from ALL religions.I decided to \\"edit\\" the deck of cards.

Liner notes explain that at least one was planned to be included but, when it came time to shoot, they realized the scene was not needed. I wish they'd left these out and included the nine that I purchased separately in order to have a complete listening experience.

I found the arrangements too \\"busy\\" and just occasionally noise for noise sake. This live album reinforces my feelings concerning their recent musical directions.

Overall, a disappointing effort technically, and this is one listener they have left behind over the past five years.There's nothing \\"wrong\\" with what they are singing these days...I just find a lot of it too showy, and un-musical. just an opinion from a former fan who will await Janis' next solo work, and maybe something new from Keely Smith.I mean, \\"Gone Fishin?\\" What a five minute exercise in boredom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing!","review":"I have been an enthusiastic fan of TMT since the 70s, but this is too bad!

The first story she ever wrote alone?! Given that, it is stunning. Borrowing a leaf from Tennessee Williams, she begins the story with \\"I took the Lone Star from base down Hope Highway, where I switched to a local.\\" She goes on to describe, in the best tradition, a true tragedy - one where both sides are right, and both sides are wrong... and there is no easy solution.If for no other reason, this book is worth purchasing to see Ian's first real entry into published prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reasoning behind the rating","review":"I have been a dedicated fan of Tokio Hotel ever since I first say their music video for Schrei on FUSE.

However, it quickly fades into tediousness as the romance between the Princess and the Pilot becomes ever more impractical. I don't know why, but reverse Cinderella stories just don't seem to work. And in this movie what should by all counts be a happy ending, ends up being a flat and unrealistic disappointment. Even for Hollywood. Part of it is that Robert Cummings as the Pilot doesn't come across as likeable as in some of his other films. He seems a little bit arrogant in a way.

The prose, especially in Oedipus Rex, is well-paced and dramatic. Oedipus at Colonus and Antigone, perhaps appropriately, fawn in comparison, but are nevertheless well-wrought and engaging.This book, as, I'm assuming, all works in the Lattimore-Greene collection, lacks the in text resources to carry the laymen along. One must have an acute knowledge of Greek mythology to catch all the references, as there are no helpful footnotes or endnotes. The introductions to this text are of lesser quality than Lattimore's introduction to the Orestia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning and morbid, Highly recommend the Grene and Lattimore translations","review":"After working through the dense, turgid monologues of the Oresteia, the Oedipus cycle feels almost snappy and modern by comparison. Sophocles was way ahead of his time in understanding how to blend short, tense exchanges with longer, introspective ruminations. He can even throw in some humor which, considering that these are Greek tragedies, is no small feat. Oedipus Rex and Antigone are definitely the stand out pieces here. They're sharp, to the point, and always emanate this creeping sense of primordial abomination and oblivion. The middle act, Oedipus at Colonus, just doesn't seem to be quite sure what to do with itself. It just seems like this unwieldy, bloated set up for Antigone. Considering that whole school's of thought (and counter-thought) have been spawned out of the central issue of Oedipus, I felt obligated to finish it."},{"rating":"2","title":"well made","review":"well put together and great for last minute costume shindigs that come up and you dont feel like going all out for"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part Of 3 Rarities Comps","review":"Derek Lawrence produced alot of bands and sessions in the 60s, this collection featuring many gems some of which are unreleased.

When a society girl (DeHavilland) develops an intense crush on Howard, her fiance (Patric Knowles) asks Howard's help in disillusioning her. Of course, everything goes wildly amiss. Howard's and Davis's rapid fire deliveries anticipate the rat-a-tat-tat dialogue of Hawks' HIS GIRL FRIDAY three years later.

Many of them were my friends. Jack Russell, who in my opinion is a punk stated that he would never play Desert Moon live again out of respect for all the lives lost. Apparently, all he cares about is money because as you can see the song is the first song, as it was in Feb of 2003 when 100 people lost their lives selflessly. Jack Russell was never charged, and really took no responsibility for what happened, even though it was his tour and he was the boss. The least he could have done was kept his word about not playing that song again ever. I was a fan of Great White in the 80s and didn't go that night because I had a headache.

The series ranges between general anthologies of mythos stories, works by a single author and studies of certain aspects of the mythos. This book is of the 3rd variety and gives us the history of Hastur. We get works by Lovecraft, Derleth, Chambers and others while tracing the concept of Hastur in the stories. This is an excellent way to get introduced to the classic horror of Chambers King in Yellow. These eerie works are best in short doses as given here. Couple that with a Lovecraft classic and a story by Will Murray (the hardest working man in pulp these days) and you've got yourself a feast of great horror stories. This book is also a good intro to horror fans who haven't discovered Lovecraft yet. Yes, it's like a private eye fan who doesn't know Hammett, but they both exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very inspiring","review":"This was the first of Chaosium's collections of out-of-print Mythos tales, and can hardly be expected to be as refined as later editions. The most useful aspects of the Hastur Cycle are the exploration of the evolution of the concept of Hastur and the major stories about the Mi-go. Of course, I agree with everyone here that the two concepts should not have been joined.The two Chambers tales, \\"The yellow Sign\\" and \\"the Repairer of Reputations\\" are both excellent, as well as \\"the Return of Hastur\\". Some of the Mi-go tales are pretty good, but clearly the best is \\"The Whisperer in the Darkness\\", which can be found elsewhere. Otherwise, it all seemed pretty derivative. I would look for the stories separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book for Beginners","review":"I am new to any version of Visual Basic and found this book on the recomendation from a friend to look into the Sams Teach Yourself series.

James Foxall is a very talented author who writes clearly and explains in detail. The only drawback to this book is that it doesn't go as in depth and as far-reaching as I might like. For instance, he only has a few-page overview of web programming, which I think he could have omitted or put as an appendix since it contains little information to have its own hour. After seeing his webpage, www.jamesfoxall.com, I can see that Mr. Foxall is a very personable individual, and I probably would have bought the book after only browsing his website.

This book is set in a period where there was little contact with Europeans. Prior to contact, and in the early stages, women held influential positions within their tribe. They, and their work, was seen as important, not demeaning. In Sign of the Beaver, the women and their work are belittled. Repeatedly, they are called \\"squaw\\" by both Matt and Attean. Squaw is a derogatory word. It is highly improbable that Attean would have feelings of disdain for the women in his tribe, and it is highly unlikely that he would use the white man's word \\"squaw\\" to refer to them. Matt, perhaps, but certainly not Attean. While many argue it is a good adventure/survival story, I think we must step back and think about that appraisal."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky in spanish","review":"I read this book in spanish class (i am fluent, so I understood everything) and this book bored me to death.

We get a glimpse of how they lived, and how very practical it was as opposed to the white man's way of life. It was more in tune with the land, for sure.I'm getting off track, but I was very touched by the story. Matt is essentially invited to join the Beaver tribe by Attean and his grandfather, and Attean calls him his brother.

It's about a boy who befriends and accompanies a native boy named Attean and his tribe on many adventures. The boy, Attean, becomes his daytime companion and together they learn about each other's culture. When Matt's father still doesn't return from picking up his family to bring them to their new home, Matt starts to worry. But when Attean's tribe ask him to accompany them on their hunt, Matt is forced to make one of the most important decisions of his lifetime. Should he stay and wait for his father, even though he might not come, or should he go with the tribe? This book does give really good information. It is also sort of a suspense book and hard to guess what is going to happen next in certain parts.

Like so many other Newberys, the main character is a young person who finds himself alone without the support of family, in this case, with responsibilties for the newly built family home in Maine around 1770. Matt is taking care of the home he built with his father before his father left to fetch the rest of the family. The location is isolated and Matt finds himself having to fend for himself. He makes understandable, but problem-creating mistakes, and becomes involved in the life of a young Native American from the nearby tribe whose Grandfather rescued Matt from one of his mistakes (trying to get honey). As historical fiction, it stands the test of time better than Newberys that are contemporary when published, but don't read well a decade or two later.

For a split second when a program comes back on it is clear, and you can see how great the picture would look ( HD ), and then the haze appears. I am VERY disappointed for the price we paid for it that this is happening. I will never again buy a Toshiba television."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG BLACK SCREEN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this Plasma on 11-09-05 and it is now 11-19-06 .... has a one year factory warranty!

On February 14th of this year I started getting green dots all over. A local service company came and took my TV for 1 month and still not fixed. They came back out a month later to evaluate the TV and said they had to order parts (that was back in May). Here we are almost October 1st no answers...the service center says the parts are back ordered, Toshiba keeps referring me to new places. I told Toshiba to get me a new TV (as another reviewer stated they received) or prepare for legal action. I have an extended warranty and believe it or not the TV went bad 1 day before the factory warranty expired thus all of this falls under the 1 year warranty. Toshiba is a crappy company that keeps blowing me off and will not answer my requests. My advice to you is spend a bit more and get a better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy This TV!!!!!","review":"Just as all the other reviews state, two months out of warranty the screen went black and everything else worked.

Same problem others have had--required a new powersupply kit, to the tune of $800! Talked to Toshiba, there are no recalls or bulletins on this model....right. Add to this that the new part is only warranteed for 90 days! This, ostensibly, because the previous wear and tear on the other, working parts may \\"adversely affect\\" the new part. Doesn't give me much faith that Toshiba has redesigned the part that failed.

Thats why they broke.

While most documentaries, historical texts and illustrations concentrate on the Western and Eastern Fronts of the \\"European War\\", this documentary, complete with vivid graphics, rich narrative and compelling photographs and archival footage, goes beyond the trenches of a European continent torn apart by modern warfare and pulls the viewer into the bloodletting of the \\"World War\\". For those who are frustrated with narrow descriptions and the ill-defined nature of this conflict I highly recommend this series for those who want to get a quick but poignant look at the war that set the stage for a century that was to be the bloodiest in recorded history and would leave the proceeding century hanging in an uncertain and greatly misunderstood balance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine WW I Doc","review":"good, solid, always moving along, I would haved liked less multi-repetive news reel footage placed over and over in different battles and situations - using the same footage over and over.Narration good, maybe they could have stayed a bit more chronlogical.But over all outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Intro to scope of WW1","review":"This was an informative and well constructed story of a period that is probably destined to be less and less understood as well as its lessons.The impact of WWI was staggering and its legacy gave context to the rest of the bloody century that followed. The events in Iraq today can even be directly linked to the Great War as well as the continuing unrest in the the rest of the Middle East and the Balkans.One of my few criticisms of the series is that I wish they had more of the many great visuals of the battlefields and locations as they are today while narrating the story of what happened so long ago. Visuals of the thousands of monuments and cemetaries would be dramatic testimony to the horrors of this slaughterhouse. I also wish more explanation was provided on the cost and futility of the battles, primarily Verdun and the English disaster at the Somme... Nonetheless this series is a great achievement..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've seen","review":"Anyone who wants a excellent basic documentory of WWI, This is it.

Previously unseen film archives from Eastern European sources. I won't repeat other excellent reviews.There is one flaw. It won't be noticed by British viewers, but may be annoying for Americans.

A must for history buffs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific series, by any standard -","review":"The program does a fine job of relating the sheer scale of the war, its geographic complexity and the interplay of political and economic forces. It is also timely: almost 100 years later, big players seek their advantage on the world stage, often using proxies to achieve their ends; smaller nations struggle between the cracks, just trying to survive. Always, it is the poor and disadvantaged who pay the price. The program does not fudge the facts of German and Austrian brutality. However, Great Britain is not spared: while their soldiers died on the battlefield, policymakers in London were often guided by commercial self-interest and preservation of empire. The series is a building block for better understanding of World War 2, the Cold War and today's 'war on terrorism.' The film and sound editing is also superb.The First World War"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mile wide and an inch deep","review":"This series has wide scope and little depth.

In addition to The First World War, I ordered The Complete Story: World War I ('the CBS series') and World War 1 in Color.

Most episodes very good. Lots of flashing lights and loud music I suppose to make sure you stay awake. Lots of excellent old film to help in presenting the story.

I tried it out on a regular flat table and without additional fans, my palm rests would still make my hands sweat and the table top beneath would still become very hot after 2 hours of light use. From what I could tell, the air wasn't getting from the back to the very front due to the incline so I might try using a second fan or book to prop the other half of the computer up so the air can circulate completely.

My USB ports are on the right side and this caused stress on the cord, which is why it broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Notebook Cooler by Antec","review":"Very happy with the performance and the pass-through USB.

It still works really great, by pushing air down and a bit to the left right towards my laptop's intake fan!

The name \\"Hadouk\\" combines the words 'hajouj,' a Moroccan 3-stringed bass, and 'doudouk,' an Armenian double-reed wind instrument, but the trio makes use of a wide array of instruments to create exuberant, uplifting 'World Music.'Buy this & the other releases before they are no longer available.

It worked great during all that time and then all of a sudden it stopped producing any real froth. It started just producing some bubbles that quickly dissipated, leaving the milk as flat as before. Changing batteries doesn't fix it; it appears that it simply doesn't have the RPM it used to have and can't do the job anymore.Having gone back and reading more of the negative reviews, it seems this is a common thing. Some get their Aerolatte in this state from the get-go and for some it works for a while and then slows down like it did for us. It's such a shame because it worked really well while it lasted. If it was half the price, I might consider buying a new one, but at this price it's just not worth it. I will look for an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerolatte - Excellent but Battery Intensive","review":"Just purchased my second aerolatte (first lasted 3 years before it started running down batteries too fast). Excellent for frothing steamed milk (I put 8 ounces in microwave on high for 1 minute), then froth. Very similar to \\"caffe con leche\\" in Spain.

In fact, I bought another one to keep in the RV. The only precaution I would give is to watch the switch. My previous one had a pulse switch, so when my finger let up the unit stopped. On this one, when it is turned on, it stays on. It took only one time lifting it up in the air and then having to clean up the splatter to learn to use it properly.

The experiment consisted of flour, water and who knows what else. I had to soak the whizzer for hours to get the dried on paste out of it. It was never the same and wobbled to and fro instead of whizzing. I bought this one because of the fun reviews I read, and I have not been disappointed. New batteries yesterday and I'm good to go.

It's not quite the same as the microfoam you get from a really good espresso machine with a steam wand, but it's a little less expensive too.

I'm going to try using it to make a small quantity of homemade mayonnaise over the weekend so we'll see how that goes...**update, after a few months it stopped working.

I am very happy with my purchase. This is a nice hand-held froather. It works within seconds frothing the milk and making a very thick foam. I've used in coffee, hot chocolate, and even in a milkshake in order to make it a bit thicker. Pros: hand held, battery powered, fast acting. Cons: Sometimes bits of power (for hot chocolate or cinnamon from a drink) can get stuck in the coils which makes cleaning difficult, the coil does not detach from the wand, meaning you have to have a pretty long drawer to store this."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY AMAZING & QUICK - BEST FOAM!!","review":"I sure didn't expect to get such great foam.

So it's a buy a cheap product now, and then replace in a few months with something more expensive that you should have bought in the first place. Perhaps HIC will read my review and contact me for a replacement, but I doubt it.

Not sure just from looking at the picture, I went to the trouble of double checking on the aerolatte.com web site. There, they tout this model as \\"brushed aluminum.\\" Oh no, that doesn't mean it is actually MADE out of brushed aluminum (how could anyone possibly get such a mistaken impression?) \\"Brushed aluminum\\" is just their name for the finish.

That holds the frother up and may avoid the issue of milk seeping in that has been mentioned by other reviewers.

It again quickly started to weaken so I changed the batteries a second time (in about 3 months)but this time the frother was no better. There was a small amount of corrosion at the base of the handle (despite always being place in the drying rack with the handle up). After that it basically just stopped working.

I've had to replace the batteries once already so I'm assuming I'll have to replace them 3-4 times a year but like I said, we use it pretty often. I mainly use it for my at-home cappuccinos and it doubles the volume of the milk/cream. Makes a really thick foam (different from espresso machines so don't plan on being able to make that awesome foam art) but I don't mind that at all and I still feel like I'm enjoying an expensive coffee shop drink. We also use it for our protein powder drinks to blend up the powder more so you don't have those nasty chunks.

I make a quick cup of espresso with my 4-cup coffee maker (use a fine grind and less water) while simultaneously heating milk in the microwave. The frother creates just the right amount of foam in seconds; add some flavor, and it's almost as good as the real thing! (Just wish my living room looked as cool as a Starbuck's lobby.)

I had it in a small glass of CREAM and it sounded like it died once it went into the liquid about an inch deep!! Like it was griding away just to keep up! Took FOREVER to whip it up and even when it did, it didn't stay whipped for long. I hate the design: The SLIDER switch on the SIDE? I mean now when you are done whipping something you need TWO HANDS!

To breathe, to live, to love, is the only purpose. According to Osho, the problem with Western logic is this: there is always a goal one must accomplish. From Socrates to Sartre to Christianity, one's existence is constantly challenged. We are always expected to DO SOMETHING in order EARN our right to exist. Yet, Osho warns us, that by wanting to do something, one is constantly living in the future. The present is ignored. Life is ignored. We are always thinking of our reward, our heaven. Ultimately, we end up missing the whole purpose of life-- when, in truth, all we have to do, is SIT down, and breathe."},{"rating":"2","title":"ingenioso!!! muy buena musica y liricas!","review":"Creo que es el mejor de la carrera solo de Juan Carlos Alvarado. tiene una musica muy bien hecha letra completamente de ALABANZA y nos quiere compartir el deseo de buscar el fuego de Dios!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best biography of Robert La Follette","review":"The are pluses and minuses to Davis Thelen's biography on Wisconsin's \\"Fighting Bob\\" La Follette.The biggest plus, it was short (211 pages) and to the point.

He not only has visual problems, but hearing problems, also. It was easy for him to hit the black strip on top to hear the time, but he can't understand what is being said. The voice is somewhat garbled to me, and my father can't understand it at all. He'll press it 4 or 5 times and then ask me what was said. I bought a Reizen 3-in-1 talking cube for him for Christmas and it works perfectly. The voice is loud and clear.

Rob Haynes is a very unique artist, but the story makes this book not fun or interesting. Im a BIG DD fan, and of all the Daredevil stories ive ever read, this just might be the worst.On the other hand, get all of Bendis' run on the Daredevil ongoing, which just keeps getting better and better, and is in my opinion even better that Kevin Smith's run and even Frank Miller's run.

It is truly remarkable to see how God is using people to spread His word in so many different styles.

The lyrics are full of TRUTH and encouragement, therefore elevating them above this world and what it has to offer. Definitely a MUST-HAVE, especially for those who enjoy a soulful sound like those of Angie Stone and India.Arie. If you've never really even caught on to soul music, you should still check this album out. Likewise, if you love soul music and never heard gospel, give this CD a listen, you will not be disappointed.

I was still a little skeptical(why I don't know), because of the two new members. However, these guys did it once again. It's amazing how the blend of their voices get better even though there's been constant change! Mitchell and Karl are the anchors, and Marcus and Chris fit nicely. The harmony is incredible. It sounds like these guys have been singing together forever.

Revelation is written in a highly symbolic manner, and it is the understanding of these symbols that makes this such a controversial book. Once the symbols are understood, and this is what Van Impe does, the Book of Revelation makes perfect sense.Van Impe takes Revelation verse by verse and proceeds from the beginning to end of the book explaining the symbols of the book, giving applicable history as needed, and relating how Revelation is relevent today. It makes a very good Bible study.For the reader who wants to understand Revelation, this is a great place to start.Jim \\"Konedog\\" Koenig"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"The book of Revelation in the Bible is very symbolic,this book help to explain the symbols chaper by chapter and verse by verse.

We all know Dolly Parton's art is beyond just country music but must we have nearly all of these tracks performed as if they were recorded for a easy listening/folk college radio program?? The instrumentation is as listless as the vocals by this slew of pop/rock female singers. Even Alison Krauss is among the guilty (strangely, the countriest track is by Shania Twain!)

I'm all for doing things in a new and unusual way - as long as you are making an improvement.

Of the remaining seven songs, \\"Breakdown Dead Ahead\\" was the biggest hit and \\"Dinah Flo\\" is a burning rocker.Taken as a whole, the ten tracks on \\"Hits\\" are probably all the Boz Scaggs music most casual fans will ever need to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good music that stood up to the disco music of the day","review":"A great cd.

The book is organized into chapters and lessons that increase in complexity as you progress. The opening lessons are simplistic and if you have basic computer knowledge, you can skip them. My advice is to go to the back of each lesson, where there is a brief bulleted synopsis, to decide whether you need to study it in depth. There is also a disk that includes interactive lessons that you complete as you read.

The main problem I noticed is that the instruction manual is based on the XP operating system and so since on a different operating system (say Vista for example) the driver works differently, you may not know what to do at first. With Vista, when it's finished installing it shows up as another \\"Wireless Connection,\\" usually \\"Wireless Connection 2.\\" It then picks up the signal you choose and configures itself based on that signal's current setting.

I followed the directions exactly in the pdf file to install the drivers and hardware. All seemed well until the configuration point, the utility did not get installed. After fiddling around with no success, I watched the Vista installation video that's on the disc. It used some different steps (I HATE inconsistency in documentation!) and NEVER even showed the configuration steps, which is what most folks would need help with.

So It can only pick up as long as the Wifi router send the signal to it.

It's very simple to install too, just follow the enclosed instructions. Also, you can easily add a more powerful external antenna if you need even more range (I use Hawking's HA12W).

Well, 'Skillet' refers to the groups' mixed sounds of rock, metal, electronica, praise and worship, and even pop. With every one of their albums (of which they have five, Invincible being their third) they created a completely different, yet unifying sound. And with 'Invincible,' they have cooked an omlette fit for the King (Jesus Christ)! Skillet has defied and shaken the secular world with sounds and lyrics that go beyond any group to date and LOUDLY proclaim the good news of Jesus Christ. While at times the message may seem harsh, soft songs like 'Rest,' 'The One,' and 'Angels Fall Down' display a more praise and worship side of the diverse group. Whatever your taste in music, 'Invincible' will not disappoint. This album is truly one of the best Christian Rock albums out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great CD","review":"Skillet is quite a band. I discovered these guys when they performed live on a church retreat I was on.

Talked into taking the CD on a long business trip by my son, I popped in the Invincible CD. Skillet delivers heart pounder sheer energy, with uncommonly good timing and changes. Everytime I think I know where the lead guitar player is going, he fools me with a clever twist.I listened to the CD for most of the 8 hour drive in total fascination and admiration. I am excited to listen to more of their work.

His book invites a beginning exegete into this complex method of study yet through his step by step process takes the fear out of learning the techniques required to thouroughly exegete passages of scripture. His creative writing style not only is humorous at times but some of his analogies help the beginner remember valuable techniques of exegesis. He also masterfully takes the beginning exegete from feelings of trepidation to feelings that exegeting scripture is a journey that requires each of us to relax and continue on. It is not simply something we do once and put the books away after a class is over, it is something we do for a life time if we want to grasp the divine-human intention of scripture."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Bomberman and DS game!","review":"The game goes back to Bomberman's roots with 2D levels and a new feature that allows you to store your power-ups and use them later.

(some taking advantage of the DS's microphone and others letting players race aginst each other to the finish line-Be a part of the battle even after you die by throwing bombs into the playing fieldSo as you can see,this is definatly one of the best games that the DS has to offer and shouldn't be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, only in multiplayer","review":"This game is better if you only play it in multiplayer. Its fun when you have 3 ~ 8 friends / computers (which you can set). The computers are a little hard to set them at easy.

The story mode has no point (or atleast I haven't gotten to the point yet) so multiplayer is the only way to have fun.The weapons are amusing though. The bombs which explode can turn into spikes. There is also a voice detonate section where when you say \\"bomb\\" into the microphone (or any other nonsense) your bomb will explode. I had to face this the hard way with an open window so it would always explode once you place it.Overall, this game can keep you amused for a good period of time.

The whole book was that way...","review":"OK I love the Saddle Club series and several other books by Bonnie Bryant, but this book sucked. This book(LISA: THE INSIDE STORY) was just a repeat of other books. I mean, at least Stevie's inside story was funny! This was just plain boring. Lisa's such a sappy perfectionist. Ugh! She used to be my favorite character but she's not anymore--too unreal. I think Bonnie Bryant desperately needs to fix Lisa more--Ms. Atwood used to be good, but in this book she was way too ridiculous--and take #67 & 68, for instance. Because of her need to be totally, 100% PERFECT, the usually smart, logical Lisa becomes incredibly stupid. HELLO!? PLEASE, Bonnie, fix her. Don't make her TOO much of a perfectionist. It gets incredibly annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these chilies!","review":"Chi-Chi's has jumped in to the selling on Amazon pool.

Thoughtful depiction on what might happen to an astronaut stranded on Mars. Enjoyed the commentary in the extra bonus specials. I always thought it was made in black and white since I saw it as a kid on a black and white TV. Color added a new dimension. I recommend it, especially for a sci-fi collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid scifi, but this is excessively expensive for all but collectors","review":"This is good hard scifi, told as an adaptation to the Defoe classic. The sole survivor realistically struggles to survive and finds some interseting ways of doing so, such as his chance discovery that certain rocks gave off scarce oxygen. He sets himself up pretty well, then is surprised to discover slaves arrive with a seemingly technologically superior race.While the arrival of the alines was a bit puzzling to me - where are they from? Why don't earthmen know about them? Whey do they keep themselves hidden from humans? Are they a race of men? it is tantilizingly never made clear, also a mark of good scifi. There is nothing that ruins the mystery of it, which is fun and had lived in my imagination since my father took me to see this when I was 8.Thus, I would recommend this, but the superdeluxe price is a bit out of range, to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robinson Crusoe on Mars","review":"I was very pleased when this movie was finally available on DVD. It is the classic Crusoe story with a twist. outer space. It shows that values and kindness towards others can extend beyond our human race. and courage to face unknown challenges. Not a complicated plot but a fun adventure story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent transfer","review":"Criterion has once again produced and excellent DVD transfer.

Even though some of the Science is wrong and it's a little dated I have watched it at least 100 times. Kind of hard to find them though and the price is too high I think. Especially since the copy write has expired. So there is no publisher of writer to pay. Anybody with a dvd copier and a printer can turn them out now. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deaf and hard of hearing people once again frozen out of classic cinema","review":"What, no closed captions or English subtitles? For forty bucks, you'd think Paramount/Criterion could afford to make this accessible to the millions of us with hearing impairment.I saw this film in the theater upon its original release, but it pretty much went by me because of my deafness. I had looked forward to seeing it again, but I'm disappointed to find that even 43 years later, I'm still not going to be able to understand the dialogue (or monologue).I'd like to give it 4-5 stars based on others' reviews, but as long as Paramount doesn't give a damn about people like me, it's going to have to get a low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Martian prices on earthbound flick","review":"This is a great film. BUT I will never pay Criterion's OUTRAGEOUS PRICES for OLD movies. Criterion is buying up the rights on old sci-fi and now a film that once cost about $9 is way over $25. This is profiteering pure and simple. Please don't buy Criterion's stuff, there are plenty of other old flicks out there....."},{"rating":"2","title":"looked a long time for this movie","review":"I saw this movie as a kid on TV and fell in love then. I never knew the title so it was difficult to find but I never forgot it. I think Paul Mantee does a great job considering he has most of the lines and leads all the scenes. The movie isn't the usual monster or alien vs human. It explores situations that involve human problems in an alien world. I am glad I found it and think the price is worth it if you are a sci-fi fan. Even if you aren't it's a great movie and I highly recomend it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful film for all ages","review":"Count me in with the rest of the gang waiting rabidly for this release. I saw this film several times as a child and was totally engrossed in the idea of a trip to Mars and the adventure it could bring. That adventure is grandly represented by this wonderful film, which allowing for a few flaws in the plot, does at least attempt to present the story with some scientific merit and plausible ideas.The cinematography is excellent! The stark, desolate landscape is both thrilling and chilling in it's magnificent but achingly isolated beauty. The lead actor, Paul Mantee, does a fine job of conveying the loneliness and edge of insanity mindset that comes from being in a situation of despair and solitude.And best of all, you can watch this one with your kids, grandkids, spouse or preacher, for that matter. Good clean wholesome fun for all ages.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched it Every Year...","review":"..as a kid! LOL! This has just been recently added to my collection. REALLY EXPENSIVE, but worth it. I'm not used to paying $20+ dollars for a sci-fi fix! I have a copy that I recorded off of TBS one late night back in the 90's. But, now I have the DVD! And all the extras it came with! Outstanding! Such an adventure - I loved watching it on local TV stations when I was a kid! You never see that anymore, so I had to buy it! Again, loved how they reverence God and His creation of the Universe! That's what separates the sci-fi of yesteryear from today. Thank you Criterion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie holds up after all these years","review":"I saw this film as a kid, and was surprised that it holds up as well as it does after this much time.

I first saw Robinson Crusoe on Mars when I was 10 years old and was thrilled to see it remastered in digital format. I paid for the movie what you'd normally pay for a new release, but I tell you it was well worth it.Survival on another planet has always intrigued me and so has Mars. You'll think there is no way this astronaut is going to make it, but something appears from the most unlikely source, I think the underlying message of this movie is that we are all dependent upon this planet and each other, no matter where in the galaxy we live.Marv"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mars adventure","review":"If you are familiar with the classic Robinson Crusoe then being on Mars evokes a lonely distance from home, namely Earth. Aside from the fact that the hero is not actually named Robinson Crusoe the storyline follows the efforts of a stranded astronaut to address the basics of finding shelter, oxygen, food, water and ultimately companionship. He does find those necessities and more unexpected things. This is classic science fiction so expect it to have muted action as compared to modern cg and stunt films.

Near the beginning, things picked up after a certain annoying character died, and I had expectations of a reasonable experience. Sadly, in the last few episodes, believability in terms of character and plot goes right out the window. I can't go into detail because I don't want to spoil it anymore than I already have, but I found the sequence of \\"twists\\" and \\"exciting moments\\" in these last episodes to be ridiculous, to the extent that it ruined the show for me.

I rather liked the time jump. We didn't need to see those years and a more mature Thor made a much more believable leader. The list price is rather steep but I got mine new from a third party seller and it was perfect and much cheaper. I think the title and the cover art are somewhat misleading.

But the series was so awful. I really wanted to quit watching after only a few episodes, I forced myself to watch the whole series simply because I'd paid so much money for it. After seeing a lot of really great series come out of Japan, this series reminded me of some of the bad 80's anime that made the genre something people joked about. There's all these good reviews for this series, I don't know why, apparently I should try to sell my copy as used if it is really so amazing. I just feel like \\"here have it\\" I just want to give it away and get rid of the horrible blight of anime in my anime collection. It just reminds me of what a sucker I was when I bought it and how stupid I was to force myself to watch the whole story arc."},{"rating":"1","title":"No way a 3 person boat","review":"The product itself is not bad.

Maybe too well, because after reading his book and his many e-cancer's symptoms descriptions,it's not always easy to stay full motivated in one's company, but he's showing the right direction, so ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great \\"How-to\\" for creating a customer-led web business","review":"This book does a great job of not only discussing relevent issues regarding eBusiness today, but also helps you build a road map to achieving success.

Too bad the writing is so pedantic that it takes a fair amount of willpower just to find the nuggets. This book would have been better had a talented ghost writer AND editor been on board. Also, it seems that a lot of the stuff here is untested; I'm not sure how comfortable I'd be leading my company down these paths. And I must admit a bias here: I'm very distrustful of some of these ideas simply because of the incredibly bad reputation David Siegel has among his peers in the digital world. I think Mr. Siegel would be better received as the author of a book about self promotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, it is all in print.","review":"Everything that I have been telling anyone who would listen in the past, in the UK and Australia, and that was mostly falling on deaf ears, is in this new book by David Siegel.Now that he has said it all, and more, in print, I know that I can keep saying the same old things, but this time I can back myself up by hauling out a copy of Futurize Your Enterprise.Thank you, David.

The book is made of a pile of pure stupid, simplistic ideas without any foundation. The author wrote a book about web design in 1996 and in 1999 he wrote this book, now about how people will do business in the future. The result? Just a pile of pre-dotcom-blow guru [junk]...I read this book just because I needed to do it for a course I attended and it was a torture. I wanted to throw this book in the trash can every time I finished reading one of its paragraphs, but I couldn't.If you don't believe me, just browse the book and you'll see how it stinks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Name and Address Witheld","review":"I'm responsible for the development of the iternet business in a major blue chip company.

I have shared this book with over 20 clients so far and have sold at least 200 through my recommendations because I truly believe this book will help companies understand exactly what they need to do to get on the Internet success train. Even those with minimal technical ability will embrace the thinking in this book because it's easy to understand and it just makes sense. For many, FUTURIZE confirms basic beliefs. For others, it helps clear the confusion. It should be required reading for every company officer and manager.

He cautions readers to throw off their old bricks-and-mortar mindsets and focus not on \\"how to build a Web site but how to build a Web business.\\"The book is divided into four parts--Principles, Practice, Prototypes, and Predictions. Siegel talks about the \\"tools and methodologies you'll need to transform your management-led organization into what he calls a customer-led company.

The band's main strength is its ability to rock out (Snowblind, Dave's Blues) while also ringing the pop music bell (The Jig Is Up, Alone Together), and Mike Roe's voice is what makes this versatility possible. And it doesn't hurt that Roe is a magician on guitar as well.

The contents often made little or no sense and had to be deciphered by the students.

When I watched this, my opinion of the DVD was \\"ok,\\" but in context and after thinking about the other VHS and DVD materials available I must recommend this.My perception of this DVD was created, at first, as a comparison with Marilyn Manson's live performances, videos, etc. However, this DVD gives us the raw footage of his transformation, and considering his budget (or lack thereof) he did one hell of a job putting on a real SHOW.This is the gritty, raw, early years material....before the elaborate concerts and massive props. Watching him \\"make do\\" with what he had available is fascinating, and the more you think about his stage sets the more you can appreciate his brilliance.

She literally gagged and almost vomited!I thought it might have been a bad batch and called the customer service, which was a waste of time. After weeks of trying, I could NOT get a call back from the company or an email response.

The bottom line is that I won't be buying it again, and while I got through nearly the entire jar, there is some remaining, which I probably won't bother with.Basically, it's cow's milk.

That was why I decided to pay $24.00 (without shipping) for a nice SET of gauges but when this one arrived, I was dissappointed in myself for not actually reading what the description of this product was but more dissappointed in Pierce This 2 for putting up a picture of the gauges AS A SET making it seem like someone ordering could get both gauges. (For someone to order just one is weird because no one gauges just one ear.) My advice? Pierce This 2, please either change the picture or sell them both for the price you'd like because I made a mistake, yes, but yours is very unreasonable.

A set this expensive with such poor quality cards in inexcusable. The publisher should be ashamed. I think it is a widespread problem, as I saw similar comments for the Tarot of Paris, which is published by the same people. If you plan on using this deck for readings I'm not so sure its worth the $$ - as I can't see the cards lasting very long. In addition to the very very thin paper stock, many of the edges were jagged. The author and the artist should really have a word with the publisher.

The story is light and lots of fun so it was obviously predicatable but it doesn't matter, and the sub-titles made it easy to follow and really appreciate the music.

Standout tracks are \\"everything under the sun\\", \\"salome's wish\\" , \\"cassius clay\\" and of course, the very impressive title track, \\"headrush\\" .

I wound up listening to \\"Look at the River\\" repeatedly, and I wound up really enjoying the song. I read other peoples' reviews of the entire album, hearing that it was considered a very popular album with cult status. I decided to take the plunge and purchase the whole album on CD.What I realized is that this album is quite addicting...I love every note and imperfection. This album is really fun to listen to. The music works its way into my brain like an unwelcome guest, and what it has become is an \\"I wish I discovered this album years ago!\\" piece of art.

The parallel English family takes part in the attack and is later the object of revenge. This is based on a true story, and the author does not take sides. Both families are represented from their own points of view. In short, this novel is similar to 'The Ransom of Mercy Carter,' but this is a more expansive, more detailed and far deeper work.

From a fan's perspective, this show continues to entertain and cause a lot of laugh-out-loud moments. I think its not quite as entertaining as the previous season, and I am not entirely sure why. It may have something to do with the basketball story arc (yes, you heard me), or more about preparing for the festival (this set does include the \\"gun battle\\" arc as well, which gives the series a different feel for sure).In the end, while it may not capture the greatness of the first season, it is still highly recommended to anyone who even slightly enjoyed the first season."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sequel!","review":"School Rumble Second Semester Part 1 is one the funniest series I have seen in a while since Lucky Star.

What a surprise package! The first five cuts are nice -mainly remakes in his own fashion- but tracks 6 & 7 just jump out of the speakers, and from there on the album takes a phenomenal leap forward with some of the most amazing guitar tones ever heard on CD. Track 6's \\"Cannonball Shuffle\\" is a lot like Clapton's \\"Hideaway\\" from The Bluesbreakers album, and #7, \\"Lifetime Thing\\", reminds me of the old Ray Charles's \\"Night Time is the Right Time\\" with just some burning guitar tones. Robben can't sing like Ray, tho', and that's the only drawback to an otherwise outstanding offer by this guitar master. Nonetheless, Robben finally proves he deserves a place alongside Clapton, Beck and Page, as this CD will show. If you want to hear great tone, it's all in there. This one should be a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a book to get riled over ladies","review":"Ok, so the guy is a pig.

He seemed only concered with himself and what he wanted. She was always made to apologize after their arguments regardless or whether or not she was at fault.

The most challenging part of the assembly was securing the pins that keep the handles from slipping off the tiny posts on the reel unit. I found that a pair of needle-nose pliers helped greatly with this.The mower pushes easily, maneuvers well, and cuts nicely. It does take a couple of passes if the grass is longer, but this is not a problem in a tiny yard. It could be a problem if you had a lot of mowing to do. The wheels do make it difficult to get close enough to edges.The padded covers for the handle are fairly flimsy and slip off easily; I have a feeling these may not last long, and I will end up with only the metal handle to hold.Overall, though, it was just right for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"vjones","review":"I purchased this mower to use on a small patch of lawn in my front yard.

Slides over thick grass and difficult to push if grass is thick."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment....","review":"I bought this mower because I thought it was a waste to hire a gardener to mow my tiny San Francisco lawn (it's maybe 15'x20'). It was easy to assemble (though one of the bolts fell out because I hadn't tightened it enough--doing it by hand is not tight enough). The first time I used it, I thought I was going to throw out my back, but I attributed it to the fact that the grass had grown pretty tall (high enough to use a line trimmer). But I just tried using it after hiring a professional to mow it a week or two ago, and it still was backbreaking work. I consider myself a strong person (220 pounds), but I could barely get the thing to budge. Maybe it works if you mow every few days and don't let the grass get too tall. But as for me, I'll probably never use it again.Anyone want a cheap hand reel mower???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this mower!

I live in a duplex and share a lawn with my neighbor so I do not have much lawn to take care of so this was a perfect mower for me.

I love the fact that I am using 'my power', not gasoline. I am female, over 50 and find this little mower fantastic.

My little lawn really needed a chop. When it arrived I put it together in about 5 min, simple no tools. I'm totally happy with the purchase, love cutting my small lawn, the sound, the feel, its light and easy to handle no gas stink or fouled plugs. Push and your done. It rolls over little twigs that others were complaining about. I live in the redwoods. You should rake your lawn anyway otherwise the twigs and leaves create a patchy clumpy lawn.

That is why I decided on a reel mower. I have a back yard that is 30x50, my front yard is 24x 9, and find if I cut it once a week that this lawn mower pushes easily, the key is not letting the grass get too tall. It is also nice to know that I am not using gas or electricity. I would find it tiring if I had a real large amount of grass to mow.

The dreidel and few coins are too big and clumsy, and there are not enough coins to really play. (everything is made of wood in this kit). The directions for playing dreidel are wrong (letters with game rules are mixed up). This is a great kit, though, and you can just go buy those cheapie plastic dreidels elsewhere.

The music accompaniment had memorable classical music, which is rare in many cartoons. Now-a-days they'd use New Age or Modern Classical music, excluding the old Looney Tunes but even then they'd use the same piece over and over, cartoon after cartoon.

Which brings me to another thought, I didn't feel that the story was compelling. Usually, when I am reading a mystery, I stay up all night once I have read past halfway, but with this book, I set it down each evening after a few pages and easily went to sleep. Sadly, I set it down several months ago and forgot all about it, now I cannot even find the book.

Robert Duvall made his big screen debut in Mockingbird.In Tender Mercies, Foote and Duvall team up again, and both men win Oscars. This time Foote takes us on the journey of a famous country singer/songwriter, Mac Sledge (Duvall), down on his luck due to years of alcohol abuse. Broke, and with a motel room to pay for when a friend skips out, Mac experiences the tender mercies of the kindly innkeeper, Rosa Lee (Tess Harper in her big screen debut).

As a recovering alcoholic myself, it also affected me on a very personal level. I first saw it when I was getting out of treatment, and I thought Robert Duvall's performance incredibly captured the pain of alcoholism, and ultimate joy of recovery. All of the performances were great. A very emotional film. I had videotaped it years ago, and now I can't find it, so I just ordered it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender Mercies","review":"So often the Academy Awards get it wrong. When the Academy gave Duvall Best Actor for portraying former country singer Max Sledge and Horton Foote Best Screenplay, they got it right. Though, Bruce Beresford should have gotten Best Director as well.This is a quiet, gentle film. But it's powerful emotions build and linger. It is a story of redemption, marveling at grace and yet also puzzling over grace withheld.Hollywood rarely turns the cameras on the red states and even more rarely on Evangelical Christians and even more rarely does so with compassion and understanding. (One of the few other films that does these things well also stars Robert Duvall, \\"The Apostle\\", which Duvall also wrote and directed.)Tess Harper is also very good in the film as the woman who takes in a lost, lonely man. Look for Ellen Barkin, so young that it takes time to recognize her as Sledge's daughter.Wonderful film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie.","review":"I watched the movie tonight.

It isn't as perfectly silent as I'd expected, but the sound it makes isn't nearly as loud as a powered mower would be. To me it's a more natural sound.

But this does such a poor job of cutting that I have to make at least four passes (2 going north/south, 2 going east/west) over each square inch of my lawn to make any difference at all. After the first pass, you look back and can see the wheel tracks, but you can't really see any difference in the grass height between what is uncut and what you supposedly just mowed. And the safety guard (on a push mower? really?) on the front does a great job of knocking down tall grasses so that they slip underneath the mower, never to be cut.I'm not sure if there are better reel mowers out there, but save your money and avoid this one. Scotts should be ashamed to have their name on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"As stated by another reviewer the pinon gears in the wheels gave out in only one season.

Based on my memories of mowing lawns as a teenager, I purchased the Scott's 2000 20 inch mower and used it twice. What a disappointment. This mower is a poor replica....it cannot cut thick, damp grass, nor tall grass. It's light weight causes the mower to jump on uneven ground and slide on damp grass, leaving an uneven cut. The cutting blades frequently jam from too much grass or from tiny twigs that other mowers break apart. The handle bar is wobbly even after being tightened as much as possible.

Ten of those minutes where trying to figure out the horrible instructions and finding the right size sockets. SO I tossed out the directions and had it together in the other 10 minutes..This does cut grass very well, but the biggest problem with this mower is that if your grass has put up seed stalks it will NOT CUT them. It rides right over tall stuff, pushing it over and NOT cutting it. Even in the lowest and highest wheel settings. So then you have to go back over these areas with a weed wacker and finish the job..Advantages: No gas, no fumes, no loud noise, much safer than a gas mower.Disadvantage: Does not cut tall/long seed stalks from grass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good mower for a small yard","review":"I bought this product after being given an extremely old reel mower which weighs about 60 pounds.

It cuts really well, is light, easy to use and doesn't take up a lot of room in the garage. The one drawback so far is that its lowest setting does not go as low as I would like. Because of this, I've kept old reel mower for those times of the year when I need to trim the grass really low.

I have had this for just over 2 years and have to say it does just an OK job, but what really ticked me off is the fact that the handle is a POS, both sides cracked within minutes of each other and no amount of duct tape would fix it.

Picture the difference in quality between a letter printed on laser-jet vs. banged out on an old IBM typewriter. Basically, this 2009 mower does as a poor a job as the one I used 30+ years ago. You pretty much have to crisscross your lawn to get a decent cut it will still be uneven with LOTS of tall pieces poking through. So the workout is good, but the job takes MUCH longer than I wanted it to.

I am also going to sue them for my time. I charge $350.00 an hour as an attorney. We'll see if any of these people understand the meaning of customer service... Do yourself a favor and don't patronize Target or Scotts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment..","review":"Probably disgust is a better word. I bought this push mower at a local hardware store for ten dollars more than its being sold here at Amazon. I followed the instructions to a T. The mower does not cut the grass. Even after hiring someone else to cut it down to even two inches...I can't maintain the lawn with this mower. Tried returning it to the hardware store, and they took over the thirty days to fix it, and even if they dismantled and reassemebled it, thinking that I had done it wrong, it doesn't work. Need to make at least eight passes in the same path to get about ninety percent of the grass cut.THe one that I tried at the Aubuchon hardware store in town workds excellent. Bottom line....some seem to work great, but I got stuck with ta lemon, with no help from the seller, or Scott's. So, it sits in my shed, and is worthless. Wish that someone knew what to do with scrap metal, as that is all it is worthy of. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Can't Go Home Again ...","review":"I wanted desperately to love this mower. I remember my grandfather and several uncles had reel mowers that I would use as a child. There's something about a reel mower that brings us back to simpler times. Plus, no gasoline is needed, they're quiet, and you just might get some exercise.Then reality barges in: this reel mower just doesn't cut the lawn very well. Weeds or crabgrass do not get cut. As other reviewers have noted, you MUST have a perfect, weed-free lawn or you will likely be disappointed. Plus, I was surprised at how LOUD the mower is. The \\"shearing\\" sound it makes is at least as loud as an electric mower (which I now own).Also, take a moment to scroll to a June 4, 2002 review of this product titled \\"A Metaphor For Socialism\\" where the reviewer discusses his \\"commie mower.\\" The review is hilarious (and I agree!).Bottom line: borrow a reel mower first if at all possible and give it a try. Based on my experience, you should be able to pick up a used one as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome mower","review":"I decided to try this type of mower because I was tired of messing with the gas mowers. I was never good at maintaining my gas mowers, so they ended up being \\"disposable\\" mowers that I would have to replace each year. Obviously, that can get extremely expensive. I bought this particular reel mower after reading all the reviews, thinking it was worth the money to not have to deal with the dust flying up my nose, debris shooting out at my dogs and the struggle of pushing the bulky gas mower. The Scott's reel mower is easy to handle and cuts beautifully. My lawn has never looked so healthy. The only drawbacks are that sticks get caught in the reel (it's simple to just pull them out or back up and they fall out) and the thicker weeds do not always get cut. Other than those two things, this reel mower is awesome. I find myself mowing more often just because it's so simple and enjoyable. No noise, no flying debris; just you and the great outdoors. I highly recommend this mower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than pleased","review":"First - doesn't come with a grass catcher. Second, grass catcher they suggest and says fits this thing is about an inch too narrow - technically it fits, but not well. Third, even if it did fit, this design is horrible about projecting the grass into the catcher! Also the mower is really bad as far as \\"getting everything\\" - expect to either mow your lawn 2 or 3 times, else do the push, backup, push, backup and go method.One other thing I didn't think of, but this is more to do with the basic design - this type of mower is really bad at handling any curves.Nice to save the gas and not have to worry about cords, but I hate to rake more. I'm guessing this is why you never see a gardener using a push mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Mower","review":"First of all, I lucked out after clicking the \\"Free Shipping\\" to save money. Turns out the warehouse was a few miles from my house... I got it in about 4 days. After reading previous reviews, my biggest concern was putting the thing together (dish soap on the handle bar pad??) but was delighted to see that the only thing I had to do was screw in 8 screws to assemble the handle. Assembly took about 15 minutes and I was mowing in no time. Quiet, responsive and quite a workout! The only thing I could complain about is the top two screws don't hold the bars together 100%... there's just a little give. Other than that, my little lawn is getting tended to, I don't have to buy gas or oil and I don't have to worry about replacing stupid little mufflers and spark plugs. Nice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scotts Mower","review":"Worst mistake I have ever made. It just does not cut the grass properly. It just pushes it over and cuts about 10%.

Not sure what type of grass this mower is suited for but I live in South Calif, and the grass on our lawn is a normal blade, but not a thick mat. Trying it out on a somewhat damp day, some of the grass just folded over. I did try and run over it three or four times, which helped, but kind of a pain...just wanted to get it over with quick.Even had a problem with the grass catcher that they shipped with it--kept falling off...the lowest setting on this mower wasn't low enough.Now I need to buy a gas powered mower...anyone want to buy mine?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd better have a nice, small lawn","review":"Small, smooth lawn, devoid of sticks? Maybe...Mine's over an acre, rough, with tons of sticks (mature oaks and hickory). I broke my 55-pound Agri-Fab mower's handle and bought one of these as a replacement. Trashed it within 4 weeks. Stripped gears, cracked one of the plastic wheels. Should have done my homework - pun intended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad--but not suited for all yards","review":"Probably better suited for a small lawn--particularly if you cut it regularly. If you neglect to cut your grass one week and let it grow tall, you will likely have a hard time cutting it with this mower. In addition, if your terrain is even slightly uneven, the wheels of this mower won't maintain contact with the ground. Since the blades are driven by the rotation of the wheels, the blades will stop or slow momentarily as the mower bounces up and down on uneven ground.I ended up returning this item and purchasing an electric mower instead. Still, this would not be a bad mower for some yards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, Very disappointed!","review":"This was the worst push mower ever...I was never able to cut my grass with it...I thought it would be great because I don't have much grass...I live in a townhome.

This was 22 inches, I should have tried the 16 inches if that would have made it any easier. If you push this lawn mower forward, it does not move in a continuous motion, so I had to move this thing forward and then backwards to cut grass. You should definetly get a grass collection container for the back because too much grass will land on the already mowed lawn and it is not easy to pick up. the grass does not cut evenly, it could work for small lawns but I think my lawn was too large for this mower to handle, I was exhausted, when I mowed less than half of the lawn in one hour. I hope this helps anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"I was very excited in hearing a lot of great reviews. Unfortunately, I was mislead. My troubles with the Scotts Reel mower is that It did not come factory ready. My mower did not cut evenly, missed grass, hardly touched the taller weeds and not to mention the rickety handle. I remembered using a reel mower when I was like 12 and worked great!The coolest part of this mower and the only reason I gave it two stars is. For one you don't need gas. The other is you can mow and still hear people, music, birds or what have ya.This mower has been a huge disappointment, when I can go out and buy a new push mower for $50 more. Maybe I just got a bad model but overall I'm not happy and would not recommend this product to anyone. Thanks to all you people that have put youtube videos about the Scott's Reel Mower this has been very helpful to me. It's sounds like I'm not the only one with issues."},{"rating":"2","title":"great even for large areas (1+ acre)","review":"EDITED: I ended up purchasing this mower just this month (5/2010) since no amount of adjustment made my Sears Craftsman mower useable. What a difference! I cannot use power equipment or my hands go numb and have been using a flock of domestic geese to manage 1+ acre of lawn in 4 fenced 'compartments'. A few times per year I need to give a once over with a mechanical mower and this does a fantastic job! I have some weeds and some areas with unevenness and the mower handled it fine. The blade height adjustment is a cinch to use. Cons: (1) wheels are positioned so I can't get close to my fence edge so I have ~6\\" of lawn to deal with otherwise (2) no grass catcher included. I prefer the snap on/snap off catchers I used to be able to get. Right now I'm mowing at the highest setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post cut green","review":"The grass was sliced not hacked. The sound not only didn't wake the neighbors it didn't even startle the cat. The weight was easy to control. If you are over 70 and need a work out this is perfect. If you are in any shape it is just fun. Mother nature thanks you for using human power with greener grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Practical","review":"We really tried to live green by buying this product, but there are several problems with it. First, it takes way too long to mow the lawn with this. Second, it's extremely hard to push this around, it just doesn't mow easily, it's a clunker. Third, you have to go over each section several times to get it even. Fourth, if you haven't given up and get done mowing, you then have to rake up all the grass clippings. I don't recommend it. We ended up buying an electrical mower. It's faster and easier. We also like the electric mower more than a gas powered mower because it's quieter and it doesn't use gas, two big pluses."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality control","review":"I searched all over to find a push reel lawn mower for our yard. This one was listed as their top of the line product on their website so I figured I would buy it through Amazon (best price). It came quickly enough, but since I got it it's been nothing but trouble. The manufacturer must have poor quality control because I had nicks in the handle framing, loose nuts on the parts that came preassembled from the factory, and worst of all it keeps losing the e-clip from the right side (the E-clip holds the handles onto the base). When I lost the first clip I figured I must not have put it on properly, but I carefully put them on afterwards and continued to lose two more before I went out and bought an o-ring to hold on the E-clip! Since then I've had no problems with it but jeesh, they could have drilled a cheap hole and included a carriage bolt, a couple of washers, and a wingnut for the amount of money I've spent on replacement parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"All work, no fooling around!","review":"Everyone should have one! I got tired of holding the mower's hand to do his job. Pass through a dusty spot and suddenly the mower dies and the cheapy sponge filter got clogged with dirt. Or the fuel is too rich or condensation got in the tank blah blah, sometimes you just want to go outside and get some work done, not become an expert on small engine repairs. So I figure you have to walk and push anyhow! This is hardly more effort than a fancy gas eating mower! I LOVE it! It makes a nice sound when you run to cut a row. Much less annoying than the loud gas engine. No stinky fumes either! And at this point gas cost too much to waste it on GRASS!!

Researching reel mowers, this is the only one I could find that would adjust the cut height. (Most reel mowers do not adjust AND cut the grass very short, which is bad for each the lawn and the environment-excessive watering required) I have a small lawn, in town. 50'x60'. This mower is easy to use/operate (little effort). Never worry about engine maintenance or having gas or using gas (environment). Also, of course, it is incredibly quiet. These mowers do struggle with tall grass or weeds. If you let the lawn go, it will not cut tall grass. I enjoy my mower a great deal. I let the grass get too long on vacation last year and borrowed a gas mower when I returned. I feel great about the environment and myself every time I use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push Mower Rocks my Abs and Makes the Lawn Look Smart","review":"Purchased the mower a month or so ago, right when the grass was starting to grow here up north. I live in the sticks and have a fairly large yard (200 x 200) so mowing can be a daily event with this mower. It works well if you can keep up with the grass growth. Don't think that'd be a problem with smaller yards. I've been mowing about an hour or so a night. My 13 year old has used it a couple times and hasn't complained... which says a lot! The mower pushes a little harder than a motorized mower, but it's quiet and does a nice job. It's a good workout and cheaper than a gym membership! To keep the blades from binding when I'm done mowing, I've been hitting the cutting edge with WD-40 and spinning the blades to coat them. Works well. Mower came in a small box and it only took about 10 minutes to assemble the handle to the base. Really happy with the purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Scott's comes through!!","review":"I wanted to do my part to live more 'green'. I have a fair amount of grass to cut. I certainly need exercise. If you can relate to this trilogy, give this mower a \\"spin\\". Once you easily assemble the handle, you're good to go! I don't have the best grass or level surface but the blades cut very well. I do find the handle, however, a bit wobbly sometimes, even after checking all the bolts. The mower, overall, is a winner for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice after you get used to it","review":"Having never used a lawnmower before when I bought the Scotts Push Reel Mower, I thought it would be as easy and relaxing as many of the reviewers made it seem. But, at least for the first time, it really stunk, as the mower kept on getting stuck at the same places.But, now that I've used it for about a month, I've gotten used to it, and it feels much smoother than at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cut, good workout","review":"The first couple times I used this mower I was second-guessing my purchase. The blades would lock up no matter how hard I pushed. I've since found that if I keep the grass short, cutting at least once a week, the mower works great. It is a good back workout, so I would not recommend it to someone with back problems or a medium to large yard. It works best on one of the higher settings (cutting to about 3-4 inches). It does not do well with tall grass but does offer a nice even cut when the grass is kept at a low height. Assembly was easy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic!","review":"I've used this lawn mower for a little over a season. It worked okay the first season, but beware the plastic parts. It has a plastic pinion gear that just wore out. I'm hoping to get a new one. If it's replaceable, it will be very easy to replace, but it would also be frustrating to have to replace the pinion gear every season. It's also a little too wide to accomodate most of the grass catching baskets sold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I couldn't even push this mower around the yard once because it kept jamming. The lawn was reasonably short and free of debris. When it jammed the blade would pop up and hit the handle causing the whole unit to come to a halt. It had to be returned because it was not useable. When it did cut it didn't do a very good job. It did seem to be a bit damaged from shipping so that may have been part of the problem. I ordered the American 18\\" Reel Mower and I'm very happy with it. The American works great and is better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice little mower","review":"I like this mower - it is light and easy to use. The first one I ordered was dented and Amazon sent a replacement right away. The second one arrived and there was no hardware. The manufacturer immediately sent hardware. After all the false starts I was able to assemble the mower and mow the lawn. Unfortunately some of the weeds didn't get cut down - may have to get out the weed whacker for them. Once this is done I have full faith that this mower will keep our lawn well groomed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it's ok","review":"a friend bought this mower then found out it's made in china then the handle broke . then it ended up in the garbage"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product, fantastic service.!","review":"This lawn mower was so easy to put together, lightweight even for a relatively wussy female. I didn't even need the instructions! It works great and doesn't pollute anything. I am very impressed with the quality of the mower and of course with Scott's you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly great but two small problems","review":"First the good stuff. It requires little or no maintenance. It is absolutely NO harder to push than a gas mower. It is more maneuverable than a gas or electric mower, therefore it takes less time to mow than either alternative mower.(I don't understand why people think it is a major workout or takes so long to mow) It is quieter than a gas or electric mower and it just makes you feel good not wasting energy when you can use your own body's stored energy.OK now the bad things which are relatively minor.1. You have to constantly tighten the handle screws or the handle will torque. It's a pain but no big deal.2. After mowing, you have to go back with a trimmer of some kind to get the taller grass and weeds. This mower simply will not cut them.Overall, I must say that I like this mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for the price","review":"I just moved from a townhouse to a real house and am mowing lawns for the first time. I wanted something ecologically sound and reasonably easy to deal with and this is definitely it. Easy assembly and it works great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do what it is supposed to do.","review":"Be aware that it cannot handle some tall grasses. The crab grass just stood out tall after mowing. Then it became easy for me to remove them manually.Some people think it may be difficult to push. My experience on my hillside lawm is that the effort is similar to handling a self-propelled motor mower. Initially I wanted to buy one from a local store to see how hard to push it, but I was unlucky to get one from Homedepot. I hated the noise from a gas powered mower so much, I just got one from Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A joy to use--and eco-friendly!","review":"Having grown weary of loud, gas-sucking motorized lawn mowers that need to be fixed up and re-tuned all too often, I finally went out and bought this retro gem. It cuts my lawn beautifully, gets into hard-to-reach corners with ease, and best of all, it's QUIET and doesn't use a drop of increasingly-expensive gasoline. I can hear birds chirping and dogs barking and kids playing while I mow, and the job only takes 10-15 minutes longer than it did with my gas mower on my 1/3-acre yard.My kids (6 and almost 4) wanted to try it out, and even though they didn't quite have enough oomph (yet) to make it go, they were intrigued enough to try it out and were fascinated to watch the blades spinning round doing their job.This handy mower also gives me a fabulous workout without having to buy a health-club membership!Everything old is new again. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For Hills","review":"I'm not sure how I missed that important point, but I did. I don't see that clearly mentioned from scott's, either. This particular model with the four wheels makes it nearly impossible to use on hills. It just doesn't have the leverage to cut the grass. So I'm back to the mower. One thing I will say is that it cuts well on flat surfaces, but it does require a bit more effort than I thought to push."},{"rating":"2","title":"so easy, our 9-year-old daughter can mow the lawn","review":"This year we decided to cancel the lawn service and do it ourselves - but with a few changes. No more noise and air polution. Gardening is supposed to be a peaceful time with nature, right? No more shaved lawn when the gardeners \\"forget\\" to raise the blade to 3\\" (the recommended height for St. Augustine). No more bald spots because a heavy gas mower can't evenly cut the crest of our hill. And no more money flying out of our wallets. Based on what we were paying the service, this mower paid for itself in less than a month. This simple, easy-to-use mower met all our requirements and our lawn has never looked better. We enjoy the fact that we can mow in the early morning or late evening - especially nice in our hot Texas weather. I never thought lawn upkeep could be enjoyable, but with this mower, even our 9-year-old daughter asks to mow the lawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for everyone","review":"Before I bought this I read other reviews and they were very helpful in not expecting too much on this product. I love having it but there are many times when a power mower is still necessary. And it requires a lot of preparation to remove any leaves or twigs that it can't handle. Also, you have to mow more often becaue if you let the lawn get too long it can't handle it. Also, my lawn is not thick so I'm not sure if it could handle a really thick, lush lawn. I like that I am not using gasoline and that I get more of a workout when I mow. I've used it for one season and had no problems. The cover on the handle looks like it will wear out fast. I regret buying the grass catcher - it is not necessary since you can't wait to mow when it is too long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Perfect, But I Prefer It To Gas Mower","review":"I've had this mower for 3 Years now.I love using this mower.You don't have to bother pull starting an engine or filling it up with gas. You don't have to deal with the noise of a gas engine or worry about it breaking down.There are some limitations.It skips over tall weeds if you let your grass get too high. It missses a spot here and there so you'll need to use a weedwhacker to do some touching up(I use a rechargeable B&D; weedwhacker).After 2 seasons the mower needed to be sharpened.I couldn't find anyone to do it at first but then contacted a local golf course since reel type blades are used to cut the grass on the course. Now I will have the blade sharpened once a year.-Good product-could be built more solid but it is cheap enough to replace. If I can get 5 years out of it I'll be satisfied.Cutting grass is a lot more enjoyable for me than it was when I used a gas mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Effort","review":"We've moved from an apartment last month into a house with a rather large backyard by 'burbs standards but decided to go with a reel lawnmower anyway despite the extra effort I might have to do and I'm glad I did. It's quite a forearm workout but cuts nicely and seems very sturdy. Assembly was super easy and I didn't have to deal with the soap-in-the-handle-bar mess other's have talked about since that part came preassembled. The major drawback, as other's have stated, is that it can't get too close to walls, fences, patios and leaves a bit of a gap that requires edging with a weedeater (so much for being completely gas-free).Glad I purchased it. We'll see how it holds up over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Handle","review":"Lasted for one season. The handle just broke on both sides where the two parts of the handle meet.

It is light weght and easy to use. I have a new house with a new lawn grown from bermuda sod. I do have to mow over some spots a few times before the grass is even, which is fine with me--I like the exercise. I do recomend buying a metal file to smooth the mowing blade just incase you mow over anything metal. When you hit metal objects the blade will stop and get slighly \\"nicked\\" which will cause the blade to click everytime the \\"nick\\" comes in contact with the cutter. Other than that slight inconvenience, the mower is great. No gas, no oil, no polution. It feels good to be nice to our earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basically Junk","review":"I was hoping this would be a good option for saving on gas and getting some exercise, but although this mower accomplishes both those things, it does a really poor job of cutting grass. I have to mow over some places multiple times, and this mower WILL NOT CUT DOWN A DANDELION. I have to go back and pull all of those up by hand. It also jams really easily with just small (1/2\\") pieces of bark or limbs. I gave it 2 stars because it always functions, and if something were to go wrong with my regular mower, I could use this one in a pinch. But as for saving fuel, it just isn't worth it. It takes me two hours to do my yard with this mower, whereas I can finish in an hour (or less) with my regular mower. An hour of my time is worth more than the $4 for a gallon of gas. I'll pay the $4 and save time and aggravation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its great on gas!","review":"Scotts 20-Inch Classic Push Reel Lawn Mower #2000-20 I love the width and the speed which you can cut the grass,however, the tall weeds that may sprout up seem to avoid the blades.

It works very well and is much safer than gas or electric 'blade' mowers, not to mention that when the kids are out in the yard with me and I am watching them playing and mowing at the same time, I can hear them! What a benefit!The down side is that you need to keep your yard cut fairly regularly. If the grass gets too long, it just 'bends'. We bought this when our power mower needed serviced and since then have really NOT used the power mower except for mowing the back yard when it got too high and the push mower just didn't 'cut it'.We bought a bagger attachment for it but it doesn't work very well and needs to be emptied frequently. We may do some modifications to the bagger to increase its efficiency."},{"rating":"1","title":"It will need to be sharpened before it will cut grass","review":"Out of the box, this lawnmower cut grass only in the middle 14 inches; 2 inches on the left side and 4 inches on the right side cut nothing.

To make matters worse the right side of the reel was hardly making any cuts and the section that was cutting (about 60% mainly on the left side) missed a lot of grass even going over the grass several times.I can't believe manufacturers are not coming up with a non-gas engine design that actually works.

In that respect, this mower fits my needs. However, it fails in one minor aspect. The MOWING part of the push mower. It does a horrible job mowing the yard. I admit I don't always mow once a week, sometimes it gets stretched out to once every two weeks on a busy couple weeks. If that happens every row will require three or four passes before it is done. If any weeds pop up you can forget out mowing them down. All you do is knock them over, only to have them pop up after you have passed them by. I am going to use this mower for the rest of the summer and try to get my money's worth. Next spring I will have to break down and buy a gas powered mower."},{"rating":"2","title":"works well if there are no tall weeds","review":"I found this mower easy to assemble, and no heavier than the gas mower it replaced, so it is quieter and yet no more work than before (contrary to the neighbor's opinion.) :) For mowing around flower beds and posts, I did have to remember what Grandpa did: move the mower backwards then forwards to get the blades moving in tight spots (instead of raising up the front end of the gas mower and back down). As others have stated, it does not mow anything too tall, even the skinny stems of the weeds that have gone to seed. So I still need to keep the gas mower on hand as a backup for tall weeds or those rainy weeks when the grass grows fast but weather doesn't allow for mowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad I took a chance!","review":"When my power mower broke (again) I explored the idea of a push mower.

Our house is on a moderately sized hill and this mower is lighter than our old gas mower and is so easy to maneuver that I never want to use anything else. The reviews that said a few extra passes are needed because of the width of the mower are true, but it's absolutely worth it.

I recently replaced my yard with Bermuda 419 and decided to get a nice cut by buying this reel mower. This is the first time I have ever used one and cutting the Bermuda was a breeze. I leveled my yard and waited 2 weeks before mowing it. The reel mower had no difficulties cutting the thin blades of grass (I think it is made for this type of grass). No more gas, oil, and ear plugs. You do have to be careful to check for small twigs and mulch pieces. If one gets trapped between the blades, you won't move; however it is simple to remove. The grass clippping comes out from the left back. I decided not to get the catcher. Don't need it. The clippings can go back into the yard. I was so simple that I went over the yard twice (manual mulch mower HA HA). Very please with this purchase and yard looks outstanding. Very low maintence too. Just WD40 the blades (once a year)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke immediately; cheaply made, waste of money","review":"This cheaply made mower broke completely the third time I used it.

They get stripped by the metal of the blade-axel. Then they are totally worthless. After one breaks then the blade is turned only by the other side, putting more strain on it.

So we felt that we were making a pretty informed decision.Our experience with the Scotts mower has been very disappointing. First, the mower is difficult to adjust. The cut is not even and it will not cut thicker or tubular stalks like dandelions. In order to have a good looking cut, I have to go over each area twice. The handle on the mower is very flimsy and the rubber grip around the handle has started to tear.We have had the mower about a month.In fairness, we have zoysia grass in the better part of our yard which may not be a good match for this mower. However, the issues with it not cutting dandelion stalks and the flimsy handle are the basis of my low rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality,,,I should have returned the item","review":"The mower's wide cutting path compared to other model compelled me to but it from [...]. The mower has poor built quality such as handle tends to flex, the wheels are made of plastic, and the gears are also made of plastic.The adjustment for cutting near the wheels are very difficult to set properly, at least on mine. Apparantly, the wide cutting path means that the stationary part of the cutting bladeif it goes out of straight true with respect to the cutting blades would means more difficult adjustment than the narrower cutting path push movers. I have narrower push movers whichhave not had this problem. I have extreme difficulty in adjusting the cutting edge on this mower. This is very poorquaity mower.

But nevertheless good mower 7 out of 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for anyone considering pushmowers","review":"Easy to use and fairly rugged. Assembly was easy. If you care even remotely about the environment, this is the mower for you. It is very effective - even in fairly tall grass (a gripe common with reviews of other pushmower brands it seems). Mowing my 1/3 acre only took about 20 minutes longer than with a gas mower - the lack of noise, fumes and flying debris definetly makes up for the extra time. Good upper body excercise as well. Only downside I can see is the reccommend cleaning of the blades with wd-40 after every use which can be slightly annoying due to the configuration of the blade guard.

I have been lazy to have the blades sharpened (after this season, it will in fact be the first time!), but I routinely spray WD-40 or silicon spray on the blades to keep them moving. I even left it out on in the snow this last winter on accident, not realizing I had left it out there!! But...it still works like a charm! Tall, thick blades do pose a problem for the mower, but if I'm good about cutting one a week (depending on grass growth), I almost always get a perfect job. And considering it has never had a piece break-off (other than the foam handle-cover coming apart on one corner...no big deal) and obviously no emissions, oil, or gasoline problems, I'd say a great bargain. And I've used it in two homes with rather large yards (1.5 hours max to do the job)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I got this mower a week or so ago. Even though everyone I talked to said to stay away from reel mowers. The common remark is that they don't work, and are hard to push. This is NOT SO with this mower. I found it extremely easy to push (in fact so easy you can do it with one hand) and it cuts evenly. It even went right through the thicker grass in my yard, and trimmed off the dandilions!! The best part being that I don't have to worry about storing gas or breathing in those stinky gas fumes from other push mowers!!

Basically, I was looking for something to help mow under a children's swing set and around some landscaping. After much research I settled on the Scotts 2000-20 20-inch push reel. I ordered one from Amazon at a price of about $75. The box arrived after 2 days (prime subscription) and the item was easy to put together. I read prior reviews and was fully prepared for a \\"work out\\" when using this item. However, the push reel constantly locked up, and I spent 2-3 hours trying to get it to work with no luck.

So far, so good. As compared with a much more rapidly spinning power mower, the Scotts has all the obvious advantages, but a few disadvantages.

I am more than satisfied with my purchase. I enjoy mowing the lawn and take pride in it. I get some odd looks from passerbys, but no big deal.The biggest criticism that I would have liked to be made aware of prior to purchasing is that you will be required to pass the lawn at least twice to eliminate any strays.

Since it is so quiet, I can mow any time (including 6 a.m. on a Sunday morning) without disturbing the neighbors.(This exact same mower is sold in the Smith & Hawken catalog for a significantly higher price -- you do get the Smith & Hawken name plastered across the front, but who cares?)I give four stars instead of five, because of the assembly -- getting the foam grip on the bar is a pain.

During warm months I mowed our 75x30' lawn about once a week, and quite a bit less in the Texas winter. It is quite easy to adjust the cut height and does fine even if higher grass if you push hard enough. It definitely didn't do well with high weeds, and thus the lawn never looked \\"perfect\\" but had various areas sticking up. But I guess that's the natural look. My main issue is that one day last week the handle simply rusted out and broke right off. I guess it's repairable somehow but a bit more effort than I'm ready for. For around $100 that I paid four years ago, I guess it was a good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent price and quality","review":"A much better reel mower than my previous 16 incher, pushes just as easy but cuts better, and seems to go over a lot of the small sticks on my tree covered lawn without jamming as much as my last one did.

It is horribly difficult to push when you get on hills or if you have to do edges.I ended up getting a honda gas powered mowed and my life has been much easier. While I wanted to forego gas and be more green, this mower just isn't feasible unless you have a VERY small yard without any irregular patches of grass or weeds. Otherwise, this device will cause you to have intense frustration since mowing will take twice as long and require much more strength (i.e. I have blistered hands and tired muscles).If you want to be green, recycle, donate to charity, preserve green spaces, etc. But, don't buy this mower.

I cannot recommend this mower enough.That said, there are a couple of problems. This mower, like any reel mower, will not chop up thick twigs, so thick twigs cause it to jam and you have to reach down to throw out the twig. The blades are very difficult to sharpen. My local hardware store will not sharpen reel mower blades. Every five or six mows, I have to re-tighten some of the bolts, which can be done by hand in about a minute.

If your lawn is not 100% perfectly level everywhere don't even bother trying to use this thing. You'll jam it and it will tear the lawn down to the dirt even on the highest height setting. We thought this would be a good way to be a little more environmentally friendly and were suckered by the pile of positive BS reviews. Now instead of saving money we'll end up buying two lawn mowers, as Amazon will not take it back and neither will Scotts. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY.

In the end, it takes three times as long and five times as much personal energy to cut an area half as well. Of course, there is no trouble-shooting guide provided, and there is no hope of taking it to a service place, so the only recourse is to trash this item and waste whatever money was spent on it.

I used the previous reviews as a guide and went for the purchase. Big mistake. If your grass is even a bit high, you can't push the mower. We tried adjusting the settings, but that didn't really help. Either the mower is too hard to push, or the settings are too loose and the mower won't mow. And, forget about pushing it up hill, which means if you live on a slope, you have to push the mower downhill, drag it up to the top, and push it down again. Not fun. The handle is too low, which makes it difficult to keep the wheels on the ground and the tray gets clogged, constantly stopping the blade from turning. This is probably the worst $99 dollars I've ever spent. I won't even try to sell it at a yard sale because I'd be ripping off the person who was attempting to buy it. For now, this mower is only good for decorating my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scotts push reel lawn mover","review":"I've read a lot of reviews on this product. I think most of them are prepared by the company that produces this product.This product is not designed for the purpose it supposed to be. The handle is not sturdy.You can use it for exercise purposes only. You can use it to move manicured lawns only, and even for those you have to go two-three times over the same place to leave clean.The only positive characteristic of it is that it is environmentally clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wasted $99","review":"I REALLY wanted to like this and did ... at first. Problem is once summer got here and the St Augustine started growing fast it became WAY too difficult to mow over the thicker areas.I DO NOT recommend this for people with St Augustine lawns unless it's a VERY small area. BTW, I am a strong 190 lb man and it became impossible with even an average St Augustine lawn. Maybe it would be ok up north on a lawn with some thin, slow growing grass.I had to get a power mower and the reel mower now sits rusting in the shed."},{"rating":"1","title":"jams on thin twigs","review":"i can only mow a few feet before it gets stuck on the tiniest of twigs....bend down pull out the twig...mow.....jam.....unstick the twig.....etc..etc....i'll have to rake first.....these twigs a gas mower would mulch up easily"},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked acceptably for a while","review":"I purchased this mower last summer to mow my roughly 40'x40' backyard. The mower did a respectable job for about a month, and then sheared the teeth off the drive gear on the right wheel. I continued to use the mower until this afternoon, when the left drive gear failed. Now when I push the mower forward, the reel doesn't spin. This mower may be acceptable for very light duty mowing, but the internal gears are made of soft plastic, and I managed to destroy both of them in about 4 months of use.Also, as others have noted, you must mow 1-2 times a week. If you let it go more than that, you will have to rent a gas mower to trim the grass, because the reel mower will not do the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scotts 2000-20-inch class push reel lawn mower","review":"It is heavy when pushing the wheel to cut grass. It will be stopped when it catches even a small piece of wood. The handle is wobbling and not sturdily built. It will not pick up clippings, as in some cases it is desirable to pick them up once a year. If you want a good hard workout, you want to buy it. I ended up buying a Sears gas lawnmower besides this.Not a good idea to go green in lawn mowing, maybe using a electric one.But it is too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a little disappointed this reel will not cut dandelions or certain weeds. This fact is not stated in the advertisement but casually mentioned in the owners manual. Unfortunately I didn't see this fact until I had tried to cut my lawn with it or I would have sent it back. I tried to go green but this machine leaves a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for thick Kentucky Bluegrass","review":"If you have thick Kentucky Bluegrass, I'd avoid this one. It gets stuck and ends up tearing up your lawn. Also, it claims to cut as high as 3 inches, but it was absolutely butchering my grass at the highest level. I could see it working just fine on normal grass with no slopes as long as you mow at least once a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I expected","review":"I purchased mine January 2011 and was surprised that I and my friend liked it so well. Easy to push but, can give a workout as well. Better health benefits as my husband and son have allergies. It always starts for me and I dont have to get gas. I can mow at anytime (3am if I wanted to). It is quiet. The kids (10 & 8)like to mow now. The nephew does also! I haven't sharpened it yet as I dont think it needs to be. Husband doesnt like it because its not self-propelled and the yorkie barks at it. other than that, its very peacefull and a great way to go green."},{"rating":"1","title":"works great until the handle breaks","review":"I have enjoyed using my scott's classic lawnmower for 2 1/2 seasons on a very small lawn. However, the handle is really flimsy. Today was it's last day and so far I have been unable to find a replacement handle. I will soldier on with a duct tape repair for the balance of the season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good if grass is too long","review":"If your grass grows past a certain length this mower pushes it down leaving it to spring up once the mower is no longer over it. Also, if the grass is a seed stalk blade this mower does not cut it.Bought it, assembled it, tried mowing with it, it failed, disassembled it, and returned it for a refund.I recommend you avoid all the above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy this particular mower...","review":"I received this as a gift for my house warming. I wanted to start off in my new house going green. The mower worked pretty well for the first year or so, but then it started leaving grass behind. Any kind of grass aside from zoysia or southern type of grass doesn't get cut and you have to go over it several times. It just wears you out.I recently got the blade sharpened and the blade height adjusted. It still isn't that good and leaves behind a lot of grass tall. Now I have to weed wack the remaining tall grass and it's just a hassle. I do care about the planet, and want to do my part, but I think I need to get rid of this and get something that works a little better.How about a rotary man powered mower? Why don't they make that?Or how about a reel type mower that cuts any type of grass?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Green - it's EASIER than you think (and cheaper, too)","review":"So get this, I paid less than half of what a conventional mower would cost, I don't buy gas, don't need motor oil, don't create noise pollution, don't create air pollution and don't work any harder to push this vs. a non-propelled mower. So, what you are you waiting for? Clean and Silent. My lawn looks awesome. Big deal you have a few strands of grass, here or there, that beat the blade. You really must search to find them. My 14 year old son now does the lawn and he is doing a great job! This price way beat local retailers."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST!","review":"I love this movie. There is wall-to-wall entertainment; or rather, tire-to-tire. Not one minute leaves you bored. It's a road movie but there is so much more. I love the characters. The actors playing them are all fantastic. I know this is an awful review but if you have ever just wanted to relax, past midnight, to watch a cool movie that will make you laugh but not to where your ribs hurt (the older we get, the harder it is to watch really, really funny movies, isn't it?) then this is your film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Fun Movie","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. It was fun and it probably helped that my expectations were pretty low.

They did film the scene of blowing up the overpass near Sarasota."},{"rating":"1","title":"SWITCH TO DECAF","review":"This was o.k. Nothing more nothing less.

Or the multi- faceted \\"Boo, We Ain't Forgot About You\\" None of the above, or none on the album.Sorry. And please, all angry people who think that this is a bad review, remember, it's a REVIEW. I can say what I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"great customer service and product","review":"Item arrived broken. It was very easy to order a replacement at no cost to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great character-driven story","review":"Jess Walter understands something that escapes many thriller writers: Character comes first. This first novel has a gritty and credible plot about a series of murders in Spokane, Wash., but Walter goes beyond the usual cliches of the genre by building his characters carefully and believably. Det. Caroline Mabry is an intriguing, complicated and wholly sympathetic escort into the world that Walters evokes, a dangerous world of prostitutes, johns and seedy bars. Because we care about her, and about her sometimes partner Alan Dupree, we care even more deeply about the case that consumes her. Walter also does an exceptional job of capturing the flavor of Spokane, a mid-sized Northwest city with a super-sized inferiority complex. The plot may invite comparisons to Spokane's real-life serial killer story, but Walter's story veers off in unexpected ways. An assured first effort by a fine writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? I'm re-thinking my faith in Amazon reviewers.","review":"I have never, in all the years I've quite faithfully trusted Amazon reviews, been so disappointed in a book I thought sounded good. Admittedly I'm not much of an \\"airport fiction\\" reader but this book took cheesy to an entirely new level.The characters are horrendously cliche, the writing is droll, and the storyline would barely be worth of a CSI script.There is, of course, some stupid pseudo-sexual tension amongst the two main police officers in the book which just put the cheesiness over the top.No offense to those who like this but this book will only appeal to people who like airport paperbacks and the crap you find on the $.99 rack at your local bookstore.I was going to give the book 2 stars just to be kind but am unable to stop myself from giving in 1-star. Writing this review makes me want the last 3 minutes of my life, plus the time spent reading the book, back."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"A good thriller. It will keep you turning the pages. The characters are well done. If you like murder mysteries you won't be disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book illustrates the difficulty of writing an interesting book about an entire NASCAR season. The same material gets covered many times during different races. Reading about changing springs or adapting to front steering multiple times gets boring. Every element of the story is treated with the same depth - working with sponsors, the life of a crew member, factory support, adjusting suspensions, planning pit stops, driver attitude etc. all get equal attention.By default, the focus of this book is on the driver, not the pit crew, so a better title would be On the Track, rather than Behind the Wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Club Mission rocks it out","review":"This Cd is really a showcase for Jay Frog's mixing and production, having been involved in at least six tracks on the album but then who's complaining, especially when you have tracks like Nexus Point.CD II is harder of the two, crank up the volume for Derb and the Warp Brothers!If this gives you a taste for German hard trance and what Jay Frog can do check out Club Mission II as well"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CDs of 2005 is now...one of the best of 2006","review":"Although this was released back in July 2005, I just found out about it and took the plunge - I wasn't sorry - out of the blue comes THE DUKE SPIRIT to make one of THE best rock debuts in years - no, seriously, from the opening salvo to the last cut, there isn't one bad apple in the bunch. Think a heavier PJ HARVEY or the album YEAH YEAH YEAHS wish they could make - but better. Tracks like WIN YOUR LOVE are at once sexy, deadly, ferocious, addictive, menacing, and just plain RAWKIN all at once - a very potent combo, indeed. Deserves to be a big hit in the States, but will it be since it came out on Loog/Polydor in the UK, but now licensed to small indie label Star Time for America? Time will tell, but nothing can change the fact that CUTS ACROSS THE OCEAN is spot-on brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much potential...","review":"I bought this after hearing the title track on radio. I never quite warmed to the rest of it, but I still love the title track anytime, and it is a truly talented bunch for a change. For reference: I had hoped this band would be \\"The Dandy Warhols meet Edie Brickell\\" and it almost delivered, sort of. In fact, they not only met Edie, but also seemed to give a nod to Grace Slick, a hint of Cowboy Junkies, and, possibly, Neco from Velvet Underground. Leila Moss is a haunting vocalist, and at times, this work comes so close to ripping something delicate inside. But not quite.I give it a \\"2\\" 'cause you can't dance to it, and I didn't understand it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"Tasty and addictive, well-crafted.

Highly recommend for those upgrading to 4.","review":"A few weeks ago I was in my local computer warehouse (MicroCenter) and was browsing the books like I normally do. Actually, I was NOT planning to buy a thing. Just killing time. Then, I saw this book. The title caught my attention because it implied the book was only concerned with the features in 4. I've become so use to computer books trying to be all things to all versions of an application that I found this approach novel and the size not so daunting like many of the huge tomes on the market. Curious, I picked it up and started reading. I stood there for two hours reading...needless to say, I bought the book... I have since read the entire book and can only say WOW. Great book. Written in a light readable style. Explanations are clear and succinct. Would highly recommend it to the intermediate to advanced Quark user. Thanks to the authors! Good job!

It is a ten-part series, so I plan to watch it again; there is so much to it. It starts off slowly, and the middle part seems the most engaging. Inevitably the modern era is not nearly as galant as the past. The host Neil Oliver is top shelf. He is really passionate and focused; you feel that it's his story, and that he's talking directly to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Panoramic Big Gulp","review":"Fantastic photography and sweeping history!

My mother was a Scot and I have never heard such a lousy narration/presentation. Shame on the producers. If they conclude that such doggerel is acceptable, they need to have their hearing checked.

It worked great the first few times and didn't do anything else. I thought it was the battery and changed it, still no froth. What a waste! When it worked it was awesome and fast. Now I have a piece of junk that spins but all it does is mix my milk. I'm not sure if it's because I'm using 2% fat milk warmed but if it's THAT finicky, I don't want it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working","review":"This frother was great, at first. I used it a few times a week for a month or two. Then, I got pregnant and took a break from coffee. After my coffee aversion passed (about 4 months later), the frother didn't work. I tried switching the batteries, no luck. I'm disappointed. I feel like I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great frother, but broke within a month of purchase","review":"I purchased this frother because the ones from Ikea are too flaky and break within a few months. The finish and feel of this product is great. It worked very well. Unfortunately, it broke within a month of purchase, and that too with some pretty light use and no abuse - it was never mishandled. The device is fine physically but doesn't spin anymore - and the batteries are not the problem, it appears to be a contact problem with the battery casing. Pressing on the black plastic that holds the batteries gets it to work - sometimes.I was hoping to use this for a long time but it's obviously disappointing to see it break so quickly. I made it worse by not immediately returning it to Amazon and missing the 30 day return window :/If yours works well, you'll love it. I wish mine did."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke within one week","review":"Bought as a replacement for one that I bought at IKEA for 10 dollars. The IKEA one lasted for about 3 years and had better control over the power on/off. I paid just over 20 dollars for the Aerolatte. Worked great for one day. After that, it was a crap-shoot whether it would work when I flipped the switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Frother","review":"I purchased this item 2 years ago.

I don't know why anyone would give this product a bad review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fix it yourself","review":"This thing actually does a pretty good job of frothing milk, and I would give it a better rating if it wasn't defective as received. The problem is that it was on all the time and couldn't be turned off using the switch. I had to disconnect the batteries to turn it off.Since the thing is so cheap it wasn't worth the postage to return, so I took it apart to try to figure out what the problem was. It turns out that the metal contact part of the switch was improperly bent and was making contact all the time. I bent it in the opposite direction and put everything back together and now it works fine.In these times we have the technology to put people on the moon and put thousands of transistors on a tiny piece of silicon. There is no excuse for turning out a product with one moving part that doesn't work.If you're mechanically inclined, this might be worth taking a chance on, but I'll never buy anything from this company again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had better","review":"I had already bought a milk frother, but needed a new one and decided to try this model.

The Elite mixer was one of the few that had an adequate range of speeds at an extremely reasonable price. I used it exactly six times, used it minimally, to mix cake batters, and now it won't turn on at all. This may be the most disposable mixer on the market.

The most disappointing thing about this album is that there is no real 'band' or group to produce another. It's a one- off. 'Broken Promises' and 'Candy' could have been hits for any Country or Rock band that chose it, they're just that good. Each song brings its own personality and mood to your ears and you'll find that just as you begin to put it on the shelf for a while, you find another gem commanding your attention. I can only compare this album to Old 98's 'Fight Songs' because of it's singular distinctness and flavor. There just ins't anyone out there doing this anymore.

The leaders of the two clans however are deeply in love with each other and are both torn between what they feel their duty to their clans are, and what their clans feel their duty to them is. Although the story line can be predictable at times, there are continuous twists. The action sequences are amazing and there is a good chance of becoming attached to manhy of the characters.

This story has been told in many forms (check out Shinobi the movie if you like the series/story) but looks beautiful on blu-ray. The colors are vibrant and very, very attractive.Honestly for the price, it's a good buy. Don't expect the drama/story calibur of something like Rurouni Kenshin OVA's. The action is amazing however (if you love hack and slash galore). To give it 5 stars wouldn't be fair (that is a thing that should be reserved for series like death note and code geass).Anyways, if you have doubts about it, don't.

Unfortunately, the 1983 edition teaches concepts which are useless in today's casinos (such as \\"depth charging\\"). The game is no longer single-deck dealt to the bottom, but rather multiple decks dealt only partially, or (occasionally) single decks with bad rules dealt out only partially.The two systems presented, \\"Red 7s\\" and \\"Zen\\", are still useful today, although \\"Hi-Lo\\" and \\"KO\\" are more widely used and (in the case of KO) more modern.Nevertheless, if you are just beginning to learn the game, this was the best book. I look forward to seeing the 1998 edition, to see how well it has been updated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, but contains no really bad information","review":"This book isn't a terrible one, it explains the theory and practice of card counting. But, personally I found I knew most of this information, and even if you didn't, it would be better learned elsewhere (eg Ed Thorpe's original). The count system presented in the book has been surpassed by the popular, more powerful, and more simple, K-0 system. You continually get the unsettling feeling that the book is giving you outdated info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate , very informative","review":"A must for any blackjack player book collection ,The Very \\"Instruction manual\\" like writing style is more tedious than learning the full indices for Zen count.Not enough shuffle tracking information, perhaps this is done purposefully.If your looking for a blackjack book , then do not even consider not getting this book.Definitely not a \\"fun\\" read but a somewhat necessary read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly a rehash of existing material done better elsewhere","review":"This book has little to offer in terms of practical advice, and nothing to add to the theory of blackjack. The count systems outlined in the book are both more awkward to use and less powerful than other commercially available systems in their class. For new players this book is emphatically not a good starting point. Experienced players won't learn anything new.If you have read another blackjack book, about 85% of the content will be familiar to you. The rest is either just filler, or theoretical curiousity.My edition has some awful typos which would really cost you money if you didn't spot them. I think these were corrected later, but it does give you an indication of how sloppily this book was put together, especially when compared with the thorough editing that went into blackjack classics like \\"Professional Blackjack\\" and \\"Blackjack Attack\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"I bought this book for myself, I was happy with the condition and the time it took to get here.

Each director's influence on Chinese cinema is briefly discussed. Authors also track how each director's style changed from film to film. The period covered is from around 1984 to 1997, 1997 being when the book was written, which means newer films such as Chen's \\"The Emperor and the Assassin\\" and Zhang's \\"Not One Less\\" are not covered.The photos and stills included are of high quality.

Make's a Chianti taste like sweet cool-aid. I picked up this book and started at the beginning. A few chapters in, had to lay it down as it was not helpful and I didn't feel like I was learning. And I'm pretty decent with science type stuff (how's that for smart sounding). I feel that she tries to explain technical points with a lot of fluff. It reminded me of an article I might write in college. I find the book wasn't good for reference because of that, too much fluff to get to the facts.

The author's pentecostal background comes through in the very first lesson. The idea is portrayed that our lying will send us to hell.

So, the book refuses to show you what is important, and what should be tossed out with the garbage - the postions which would not likely occur in real games you would play.I would like a book with 100 to 500 of the MOST IMPORTANT TACTICAL THEMES TO LEARN.

First, I'll have to agree with a previous reviewer in saying that Rahxephon is one of the best series to date. Since the first volume this series continually impresses me with its strong character development and engaging story. Volume six of this series does a great job of realistically showing the emotions of Ayato and the people around him, especially those of Nanomori and Megumi. This series continues to impress me and its definitely something I recommend you viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!!!","review":"We bought the entire 10-piece set from Amazon for $299.99 2 years ago. This was a great knife at first, good balance and super edge, but about 3 months after we started using it, the Grand Chef Knife developed a small chip in the cutting edge. Over the next year, about a dozen small chips appeared in the cutting edge and for the past 6 months it has become so damaged it is un-usable.

This along with the rest of the Lindsay Gordon series are light, easy and fun reads. I found the characters to be a little left of center, but that is what certainly made them interesting!The whole Lindsay Gordon series is like a young lesbian version of Murder She Wrote. A little more racey than Jessica Fletcher and a lot more fun.If you enjoy English humour (dry wit and loads of sarcasm) and want some fun who dunnit mystery reads, read the whole series but do yourself a favor... start with number one and move through the series in order. Will make a lot more sense. Common Murder is number 2 in the series and a fun read, but Lindsay makes a lot more sense if you start with the first book which is 'Report for Murder.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get through","review":"I just can't recommend this book because the writing style is very difficult to get into. I spent four months trying to slog through this novel, all the while putting it down and reading about six other books before finally finishing it. Maybe it's because the writer is British and I'm not, but I found it hard to keep track of what was going on, the political and social system where the story takes place, and the terminology or slang used. However, I can't help but think that a good writer would be able to spin a tale that would engross any reader, and this isn't the case here."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK ... except for the ending","review":"Maybe it's me but Bentley Little's endings seem too short. A bad ending, for me, ruins the entire book. Luckily, the ending to the Revelation wasn't that bad. Just too short, about 20 pages.This is the second Bentley Little book I've read. The first one being the House. I enjoyed reading the House very much, but the ending was garbage. It wasn't exciting and it was too short. You got the feeling, while reading the book, that the ending would be huge and dramatic. Not so.The same thing almost happened with Revelation. The first 300 pages were great. Scacy, suspenseful, gory... fantastic. But the final battle was finished before I could even start enjoying it. There's still enough there to be considered 'satisfactory'. I just expected more.Maybe I'm used to Stephen King and Tom Clancy. Now those two guys know how to write a conclusion. Other then that, Little's a huge talent in the horror genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"This is the second novel I've read by Mr. Little. I read The Store four years ago and was disappointed by bland characters doing lots of stuff. The Revelation is certainly imaginative, but Gordon and crew are also featureless and rather boring. A story is pinned to characters, right? No matter how many giant fetuses rise from the soil, I didn't care about Gordon and Brother Elias. They have no grooves on which to pin a story. I did read a short story by Little entitled \\"The Sanctuary\\" a few months ago which was fantastic. Hit and miss, I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dissapoinment.","review":"The book starts promising. There's an Ancient Evil to be fought, and its minions are rather original. However, as you keep on reading, you come across a chapter dealing with a kitten mutilation by the Forces of Evil. Frankly, I cannot understand why most horror fiction writers believe that they should have an animal tortured in some way. Especially when, like in this book, it adds nothing to the plot. Animal lovers, just pass through these pages. You'll miss nothing of value.And then, there's the ending of the book... It seems as if the author got bored or run out of ideas and just chose an easy way out.This book has been a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment!","review":"I have read two other books by the author and was really looking forward to this one. I have to say I was very disappointed. The characterization was under developed and I really didn't \\"care\\" about the characters. They were very one dimensional. The plot was also rather vague and not very interesting. One of the other reviews mentioned this was Little's first book so it was probably just his lack of experience. I loved \\"The Store\\"!!! The subject matter was also rather disturbing to me. I have had three miscarriags in less than two years so I was rather sensitive to the evil little fetuses terrorizing the town. I'm sure he didn't mean to offend anyone. Yes, I will still read Bently Little books but I can't recommend this one. Little is in good company though. As much as I like Stephen King there are a few of his books I thought were boring too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly Junk","review":"Bentley's first novel is a good outline of his career that was to follow, in so far as his writing habits for longer stories are concerned - a good start, gratuitous sex and gore, paper thin characters and a very anti-climatic ending. Most of his longer novels are simply a journey from the promising to the disappointing, and \\"The Revelation\\" isn't any different.After a boring prologue and an interesting first half, the story falls apart and meanders it's way to a lame, easily accomplished ending for the main characters. By the time you get there, you've lost what interest you had in his characters and feel very detatched from their dilemma.I wouldn't recommend \\"The Revelation\\" to anyone. It's not his worst novel (that would be without any doubt \\"The House\\", followed closely by \\"The Walking\\"), but this ranks pretty highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just disturbing, not entertaining.","review":"If your idea of entertainment is dead babies and mutilatied animals then this book is for you, if that thought disturbs you...RUN! I was alittle bothered by the graphic details of aborted and miscarried fetus that were possed by satan eating off peoples faces. I think that the author needed something absurdly diststeful to take my focus off the slow moving plot (if there was one). The ending left alot to be desired as well, I was not satisfied by this read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Clunky Bore.","review":"Realized within a few chapters that this was a mess but struggled to finish it. My mistake and my waste of time. Real scares require real people and these characters unquestioningly dove into the nonsense as if they were just plot devices. The B movie comparisons are somewhat apt but too kind. This is lazy and inept storytelling. I picked this up because some of the later Little books that had stronger recommendations weren't immediately available. I think I'm done though, since I find it hard to believe that writing this weak could really get that much stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sets His Standard...","review":"Read this book and you have the basic idea of ALL Little books with the exceptions of The Ignored and Dispatch.A fairly normal family somewhere in the Arizona region. Strange events begin. Unbelief! Absurd monster creature enters (zombie-babies in this one, but others include satanic postmen, Jesus-looking vampires, winemaking she-devils, evil store managers, etc). The endings usually include a fist-fight with said demonic monster or comically evil businessman. Don't forget some S&M;."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revelation","review":"This book was an easy read, and had plenty of good parts, but like many other reviewers have stated, it was nothing like Bentley's later works. I can see where he was going with this, but near the end it seemed hurried, hollow, and a little too cheesy. It did, however, get me interested in Bentley Little, and I'm glad I continued to check out more if his books. The Store, especially, was awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gore, Not Horror","review":"OK, a bad near-rhyme, but this book brings out the triteness in me. Like many other reviewers here, I have enjoyed Little's fiction, but this one was unpleasant, un-frightening, and poorly written. I also wish horror books would come with warning labels when animals are gratuitously slaughtered so I could avoid them. Here it's a blatant cheap plot device: no sooner is the kitten acquired than it's ripped to shreds. The Evil Fetuses were more ludicrous than scary; the arguably \\"human\\" characters were singularly flat -- just why does Gordon have to be a \\"literary\\" Pepsi delivery guy, as it adds nothing to the plot? -- and the pacing really amateurish, just one bloodbath after another. After reading and enjoying THE WALKING, which was so clever and original, I struggled to finish this piece of garbage. I agree with those who question how this third-rate splatter-punk exercise ever won the Bram Stoker award,"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Debut","review":"Despite an utter lack of support from the genre press and even his own publishers, Bentley Little has quietly blossomed into one of horror's best and most consistent writers. This is a re-release of his first book, and while it's obviously a first novel and is not as good as his recent work, Little's trademark mix of horror, social consciousness and black humor is still much in evidence. So is his ability to create strong characters. All in all, an impressive debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Silly","review":"I threw it down after 100 pages. It is just plain silly and boring. Having recently enjoyed an excellent collection of Bentley Little short stories, I had high hopes for this novel.The only thing remotely interesting in the 100 pages that I endured was the obvious homosexual tension between the main character, Gordon, and his boss as they used the word \\"fag\\" excessively while seeming to always be on the verge of going bed with each other.If this book is indicative of his other works, Mr. Little needs to stick to short stories and leave novels to the big boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"'How this get award?'","review":"This is very premature attempt in writing horror book. I dont understand how this book got 'Bram S. Award'? Nothing is new in book and whatever old funda is there, are also not much scary. I suggest to read some old books by old authors. There are lot of books on small town terror/good-evil fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CHICKEN season fry ever!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! AT LEAST NOT THE ONE FOR THE FRIED CHICKEN.

HORRIBLE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"expensive little rarity","review":"I can understand why Elizabeth Bishop claimed not to be an artist, so why then, was this published. The visual ability of some writers is well known, but not back then, maybe. Also some artists and poets are prose all the way.This was purchased for a research project. Historical overview mainly."},{"rating":"1","title":"royal pain","review":"I received this as a gift and thank goodness because I would NEVER purchase it. The music doesn't work correctly and every vibration of the floor causes it to turn on in the middle of the night or when someone walks into the bathroom. My son thinks it's great, but it leaks every time he pees in it. I am constantly cleaning up after him. I have another fisher price potty chair that is also a stool that i used for my daughter and I have no complaints about it. But the Royal Potty is a royal pain!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Dud","review":"I bought this for my daughter a while back. The sensor had a tendency to go off whenever. We also had a problem with the sound startling her when it went off unexpectedly while she was using it. She would leap off the potty and pee on the floor. We ended up using the Royal Potty sans batteries. Eventually we found the ovals you can buy for $6 and put on the actual potty to be a better investment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF MONEY!","review":"I have a little newer version of this potty chair, and I thought it would be great since it has a motion sensor (a light comes on) and plays music when my daughter goes in the potty. However, it is not great. The light sensor comes on at any close movement or heavy steps. And the music goes off just when my daughter sits down, let alone when she actually goes potty in it. This potty is CRAZY! The sensors are WAY too sensitive. And like others have said, children figure out really quick how to make the light come on and make the music play. All they have to do is put their hand down there and the thing goes off. It has driven me crazy enough that I took the batteries out of the potty and am using it as a plain Jane potty. My advice is this. I have seen really cheap potty chairs out there ($10 or so). You might as well go buy a cheap one as to buy this one that is close to $20 that is a piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"potty is a royal pain","review":"We recieved this as a gift. My son loved the music, he was more enthralled by throwing toys etc. into it to hear the fanfare than to go potty, I yanked the battery out. The next headache is the fact that the potty handle is guess where? In the front right between the little guy's legs and just so easy to pull out while sitting on the seat part. There is no way I can see to turn the thing around to where he can't pull the potty out while sitting. I tried to contact fisher price but apparently they don't feel the need to follow up with customer complaints. I would advise against this potty, and I would dearly love to give this one back to them, but they WON'T ANSWER my email."},{"rating":"1","title":"Red Light Teaches child to put their hands in the toilet!!!","review":"Ok, I am using this for a little girl, so I didn't notice the leaking that others who have boys noticed...but my daughter has a different problem with this toilet. First off...the potty is supposed to make a \\"royal song\\" when the child pees....but it makes the royal sound as soon as the child sits on the potty so it isn't any special reward. Second, my daughter is more interested in playing with the very bright red light inside the toilet instead of sitting on it. She will sit there and play with the light and get it to make music and all potty training goes right out the window...Just what I want -- to teach my daughter to stick her hands in the toilet! It is just a really bad product -- and a bad idea. Buy yourself a simple potty that costs less because this one is not worth the extra money."},{"rating":"1","title":"no worth the money","review":"my son received this as a gift when we was 16 months old. my wouldn't even be sitting on it and it would turn on and make music. now that he does use it leaks. so now my carpet smells like pee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money On This Potty","review":"This is the worst potty I have ever purchased. There are too many things wrong with this. Biggest problem is that it leaks and don't count on the music. It will play when no one is on it and when my kid does go in it, it wouldn't make any sound! What's the point then? The seat is also hard and not easy for a boy to use it with the splashguard in the way. Worst purchase I've ever made!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It leaks for boys","review":"Just as several others have said, this potty leaks when used by a boy. I found it easier to have my twin boys just use the grown up potty with a stool. Everyone was happy and I didn't have to mop hourly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy for Boys","review":"I am glad to know it is not just my child! This potty leaks just about everytime he uses it! The battery died very quickly and the sounds were always sporadic at best. I would DEFINITELY discourage anyone from buying this potty. It is hindering the potty training due to the fact that my son get's upset when it leaks all over his leg! I plan on trashing mine and finding a good replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small for chubby legs!","review":"This potty chair was a hand-me-down from my neice. The problem is, my 2 year old son's legs are too chubby for it. He's not even overly large. He weighs 29 lbs and is 34\\". When the guard is in place for boys, the sides of the chair force his legs towards the center and the guard digs in to the bottom of his thighs. He got up after 2 minutes and had deep, red creases in his legs! I'm sure this isn't an issue for girls no matter how chubby, but for boys, it doesn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't recommend","review":"If you use this chair with a boy, it will eventually leak. I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased this product. Our chair almost never plays music when my child uses the potty because his \\"aim\\" is a little off center and doesn't necessarily break the light beam. And when the urine hits the space between the bowl and the chair it leaks everywhere. My son is very comfortable using this chair and considers it his own special potty chair, so I am reluctant to change to a different one. I wish I had bought a different chair from the beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for little boys!","review":"I bought this little potty for my 2 1/2 year old little boy! What a mistake! It might be fine for girls but when my son used it, it dripped down the guard and out of the potty and onto the floor! I called fisher price and they snet me fisher price dollars as a sorry! Plus the music only worked 1 time, untill I had to wash off the whole potty! I have since bought a baby bjorn potty....It is easy to clean and my son loves it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great - except it leaks","review":"I don't know if it's just because I'm training a boy instead of a girl, but every time he uses this potty, it leaks urine all over the floor! Very frustrating. We bought a seat that goes on the big potty and will be putting the Fisher Price potty out for the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good for a boy!","review":"As a mom of 3 boys I am now training my twins. Every time they would use this potty it would go through the crack between the bowl and the chair. The splash guard was connected to the chair and not the bowl. It left such a mess on the floor.

It leaks!","review":"A friend of mine and I both bought this potty for our kids because we found the design cute and loved the idea of musical \\"rewards\\" for a job well done. We were far from pleased, however, to discover that it leaks and makes a big mess for parents to clean up! We have since experienced much better luck with a potty seat that fits over the grown-up toilet seat. In addition to its ease of use, kids seem to feel more \\"grown up\\" using the real potty. Don't waste your money on the \\"royal potty\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun potty, but very messy","review":"When we first bought the potty, my 2 year old son loved it! He loved sitting down and hearing the music trumpet when he had success! He also LOVED the book that went with it.The downside to this potty, it is leaks TERRIBLY. Especially with boys, the urine runs down the pee guard and underneath it soaking the underside of the potty.Taking apart the potty is a pain, as you have to take apart the piece that holds the sensor, as the pee gets trapped under this.After a while, we just took off the sensor, and I had to wipe the underside of the potty every time he went.We only use this potty in the car for an emergency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"Waste of money!!!

The collection bowl doesn't fit properly. There is a big gap in the front of the potty. Plus getting the bowl off the bottom is such a struggle that I usually end up spilling the contents anyway. I am going to buy a new potty today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't purchase this potty chair!","review":"This chair design is not for potty training toddlers. If you have a boy be prepared for a big mess. While potty training my grandson this chair was a \\"Royal Pain\\". First of all the child can not sit on the toilet by himself, he needs to be lifted onto the seat, and make sure that stay by the child and hold down his wee wee or there will be pee pee every where as the splash guard is inadequate to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"My daughter hated this potty. We have to go buy another one. The sensor that tells when your child uses the potty is red, and she was so scared of it, she thought it was going to burn her little bottom!!! Also, the sensor turned itself on and off at seemingly random intervals. Frustrating-- it also set us back because she was so afraid of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money!","review":"This potty is a complete waste of money. It give the child a false sense of accomplishment because the sensors are so sensitive on it it makes noise every time it's bumped. My daughter still will not go potty.

I'd rather give it 0 stars.Do not buy this potty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flop show","review":"I wouldnt recomment it to any one. My 10 months old takes the deflector out so easily and the pe pe goes every where. The potty leaks on the floor, the potty for sure's so hard to clean every time.

I am finding that everytime he goes, it is all over the floor or soaks a towel that I have started putting under it for easier cleanup. He aims like he should and I can't figure out how and why there is a puddle on the floor and the bowl is in correctly. He also complains his bottom hurts if on it to long due to the small seat size. I am having a difficult time training him #2 for I can't get him to sit very long to do so. Do not recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $$$","review":"I bought this potty for my 18 month old when he started saying \\"Potty\\" everytime one of us went to the bathroom. First time he sat on it, he caught his little boy parts on the splash guard. I guess it hurt him enough to scare him because he will not sit on it anymore. It was too big for him to sit on by himself, so I would have to lift him onto it to avoid him getting caught on the splash guard. He has learned to pull the guard off now, but still will not sit on it without clothes on. I would not recommend this one at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY MESS and WON'T SHUT UP!!!!","review":"My son always pees over the bowl and urine ends up in the floor.

We tried removing the batteries so it did not make any noise and she warmed up to it, but never to the point of actually wanting to use it to potty.

My daughter always removed the bowl when she sat on the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Potty is a Royal Mess","review":"This toilet appealed to us initally in the store but when we got it home it was another story. IT LEAKED ALL OVER THE CARPETED BATHROOM FLOOR! It really hurt my son's ego too which is very disappointing. He was so proud to have made it to the toilet in time only to have potty all over his pants, sock, and the floor anyway. I just threw the useless thing away. I had to call the carpet cleaner to get the stains and smell out. I would recommend the Bjorn toilet and toilet seat cover. They are a bit more expensive but worth every penny to save your bathroom from smelling like a urinal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky Potty","review":"This is a horrible potty! I am so disappointed with it. Everytime my son pees on it, it leaks all over the floor. There's a gap between the little bowl and the seat and he seems to pee right where that gap is. He loves to use the potty, but I find myself discouraging him from using it because I'm tired of cleaning up the mess. This is definately one of the worst baby purchases I've made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not room to sit correctly on potty","review":"I had 2 of these potties, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. Before potty training I thought these would be great for the comfort of the seat and the ease of disposal. It turns out that as soon as my daughter was ready to go potty the potty seat was too small and her pee often went right between the seat and the little bowl and wound up on the floor. The pediatrician advised a potty seat that allows for the kids to have their feet steady and their legs spread so they can relax to go potty. Another problem with my daughter not being able to spread her legs is that she couldn't get her hand in to wipe herself. I wound up getting the soft seat potties and those were great. Since then we moved up to a potty seat on the big potty with a step."},{"rating":"1","title":"*nOT VERY HELPFUL","review":"aLL CHILDREN POTTY TRAIN AT THEIR OWN PACE, BUT MINE LEARNED AS SOON AS i GOT RID OF THIS THING. mY SON LIKED THE LITTLE MUSIC SO MUCH HE VIEWED IT AS A TOY INSTEAD OF A PLACE TO \\"DO HIS BUSINESS\\". iT'S NOT EASY TO TRAIN A CHILD WITH WITH A MUSICAL TOILET (AS IF POTTY TRAINING WASN'T HARD ENOUGH). hE USED TO PUT HIS HAND IN IT TO HEAR THE MUSIC. wHICH IS WHY i'M GLAD HE NEVER ACTUALLY USED IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"This potty LEAKS all the time!","review":"I'm so disapointed in this potty, every time my son used it it leaked ALL over the floor, not just a little bit a LOT.

I ended up throwing this one away & buying another potty by The First Years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good-for a boy","review":"I have the same complaints as the other reviewers for my son's use of this product. Because of the sides of the chair being tall and close, it's hard for a boy to use. Without the deflector the pee just goes out in front of him because he can't sit with his legs far enough apart, and with the deflector my son won't sit on this potty at all because it hurts his legs and he can't get up by himself without getting his parts caught on it. It leaks urine from between the chair and the removable bowl, and the music only worked for 2 1/2 days. Maybe it would be better for a girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay potty but could be better","review":"I bought this for my son about 7 months ago and he did like it at first but it should be made a little bigger. It hurts his legs when using the deflector part and you have to use that part with a boy. Maybe this potty is better for a girl but definately not a boy. Also it is hard to clean with too many cracks and sometimes it leaks. The only part me and my son liked was he liked to pull the container out by himself and empty it thats why i gave it the 2 stars i did.I never even used the music part of it so i cannot review that but i think that it is useless.I have decided just to buy a soft kids seat for the big toilet and a step stool. I would not buy this potty again. I would recommend you research other pottys on the market because this is no good.If fisher price improved this potty by making it a little bigger for boys and improved some other things, then it probably would be the best potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work for boys","review":"I received this from my sister. She has a boy and had problems also. Even with the sheild on, urine still leaked onto the floor most of the time. There is a small gap between the bottom of the seat and the top of the bowl that is big enough to let urine go between the two and leak onto the floor. The music never worked for my nephew unless he went poop so I never installed the batteries for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks!","review":"I had the original version of this potty and called Fisher-Price to let them know that it was leaking. They sent me the new version which you see here and again it leaks. I think that they need to redesign the bowl so that it has a shield of its own.

Thankfully, Fisher-Price is sending a reimbursement for the chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for active boys.","review":"My son is 2 1/2 and this potty has been a nightmare for us. First, it did have a tendency to go off at all times of the day and night, and 2nd, the splash guard is not tall enough or secure enough. I can't even begin to count the times that I've turned around and seen him chewing on the guard he's removed or how often urine has shot across the bathroom because his penis is pointing 1 cm off of 'straight ahead'. On the bright side, it's comfortable for him to sit on and mine has never leaked, but that just may be because the urine never quite makes it in the receptacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"ROYAL PAIN IN THE ***","review":"1 Star is too many!

At first glance it seems cute and makes \\"reward\\" noises and even comes with a story. First, the story was kind of dumb in my opinion and there are much better potty books out there, but that is a side issue. My real pet peeves with this potty are: 1. It leaks big time, and I have a girl so it's not because she sprays like little boys might. About 1/2 the time I had to clean up around the potty after my dd used it, and I had the bowl in correctly! (As if we don't have to clean up enough potty/accidents in potty training!!) 2. The music is supposed to be a reinforcement, but my dd quickly realized that her hand could also activate the sensor, so here she would sit putting her hands down in the potty to make the music play! I took those batteries out real quick . . .Anyhow, we are now using the $1 garage sale potty that I got as an \\"extra\\" and the royal potty is in the closet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leeks pee","review":"I got this for my daughter and she likes sitting on it but it leeks pee almost every time she uses it.

First and Foremost, when my daughter does make it to this potty chair, the chair leaks. So I'm still cleaning up a mess!!! The pot/bowl has too much space between it and the seat, so the urine squirts out and runs down the legs and around the edge of the bowl. We tried the shield, nope! It is very hard plastic that hurts to straddle it. We tried placing a book under the legs to give it a tilt. That didn't work either. So the chair has to be placed on a vinyl floor not on carpet because it tends to leak 4 out of 5 times. Best wishes if you choose to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaking is a big problem","review":"I fell in love with this seat at first. It was comfy and the shield did not rub against my son when he went. However, I ended up having a lot of problems with leaking. My son seemed to just happen to urinate into the place where the seat and cup met. I would have a big mess on the floor everytime. Also it would rarely play music when he urinated. The flow has to be just right in order to interrupt the infrared light and play the music. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too leaky","review":"This is not a good potty, for boys at least. When my son pees, more ends up on the floor than in the potty. He seems to always be aiming right for this little opening between the seat and the bowl underneath. This is also not a comfy seat for when he's going #2 and is sitting there for a while! We have an Evenflo Training Rewards potty also and it is much better- rarely leaks and has a nice cushioned seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"This potty seat leaks","review":"My last review did not get posted, so I thought I would try once more. I appreciate these reviews, had I read these first I would have saved myself heartache and time. The above potty seat, the royal potty, leaks. At least 1/4 of my sons urine ends up underneath the potty almost every time. There is a space between the bowl underneath the potty and the bottom of the chair, that he sprays right through. I purchased a baby bjorn from [local store], and it is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Musical potty = all play, no potty!","review":"I have twin girls that are in the early stages of potty training. I thought a musical potty would spark an interest for them in wanting to potty. Boy, was I wrong. All they want to do is play with this potty! They are constantly putting their hands inside the hole to make the music sound. The two I bought are on their way to the garage sale and I am on my way to the store to buy 2 more- non-musical!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks,leaks,leaks","review":"This potty makes a mess. After my son goes potty there is always a puddle of pee on the floor. We bought two pottys and they both leak. We are returning them. Plus the music only worked for one day. In addition to, this potty's music will not work if your child \\"sits\\" on the potty for a while. Do not buy this potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"This potty will leak more than your child will.","review":"I absolutely hate this potty. My wife and I thought the potty would be a great motivator to get our son to start using the potty. He wasn't motivated by it at all. However, the worst thing about this potty is that it leaks everywhere. Every single time my son using the potty I have to clean the potty and the floor it sits on. I have checked it and check it to see if something is amiss but to no avail. Don't waste your money on this one. You'd do better with a Maxwell House can. This isn't a Royal Potty, it's a royal pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied","review":"As some of the other posts mentioned, we also have problems with the sounds not working and/or going off when you just walk down the hall past the bathroom.My daughter, 26 months, also has figured out how to make the music go off by putting her hand between her legs. Not something I want to encourage!I would not recommend this potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!! It leaks!!!!","review":"I have a boy, and like many of the others who have wrote a review, I am very disappointed in this product. While I'm thrilled when my son tells me he has to go potty, I'm tired of cleaning up the floor after every trip to the \\"royal throne\\". This product was very poorly designed. Boys somehow shoot through where the top of the pan meets the bottom of the chair. There is no way Fisher Price did any \\"trials\\" on this product before putting it on the market. And as for the music, the batteries quickly ran out because the thing was playing music all the time, even if no one was in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Failure for Us.","review":"My son thought of this seat as a toy. While he sat on it occasionally for fun, he would also pull off and throw the splash guard. He also pulled out the slide-in cup and stood in the hole of the seat. In my case, a one piece seat was clearly the answer. I purchased the \\"Once Upon A Potty\\" chair (not available on amazon.com the last time I checked), along with the \\"Once Upon A Potty\\" video. My son went from being a child completely not interested in using the \\"potty\\" to one that is self-training, all within two weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Potty is Terrible!","review":"I bought this potty for our son thinking that the musical sounds would inspire him to use it, but the potty has been terrible! First, the batteries ran out very quickly because any vibration from footsteps would set it off and it would play its little tune. In addition, the design is very poor. When my son would poop in it, it would get stuck in the back of the toilet and was really difficult to clean! So eventually, we actually took it apart and removed the battery/noise part of the potty. However, this then caused the bowl to be wobbly and move and so now whenever he uses it it there is a mess everywhere! I am about to buy a different brand and chuck this one! Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible for a boy","review":"This potty leaks very badly. Every time my son uses the chair half of his \\"deposit\\" leaks between the seat and the cup and ends up on the floor. Plus, the tune mechanism does not work well since the \\"stream\\" never goes directly across the sensor. The only good thing I've found is the handles on the side help him to sit down. However, I would not recommend this chair at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"more play, less potty","review":"My little girl has decided that she rather kick it to make the music play rather than actually use it for what we bought it for then play with it and touch the light that goes on which I feel may be unsanitary. This is our third potty and we are now finding that she rather just sit on the actual toilet seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Eater","review":"This chair looks cute but all it takes is the slightest movement and the music plays it EATS batteries (and i dont mean the cheap ones) the pull out tray seems convenient unless you have a little sports fan like my daughter who thinks the tray looks just like a base ball hat and it as often running around with it on her head as she is trying to potty in it or stick her hands in to hear the music. we have had no success using this chair only distractions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Floor cleaning required!!!","review":"I do not reccommend this potty to anyone. I purchased it because I needed a potty that was up on feet because of where the heater vent was. Well, my son does use the potty, but then I always have to clean up the floor. The (...)comes out the gap between the bowl and the seat, even with the splash guard in place. I only had the batteries in place for a mere few hours before I had enough. He was more interested in sticking his hand in and out of the opening to make the music go off. Then I found him testing all the other potty's in the house trying to make the music play. I am headed to the store to look for a new one today."},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes more of a mess than your kid does","review":"The potty size is to small and the pee falls out easily especially if it is moved in the slightest. When you place the potty back under the chair you do not always get it on the first try and if your child wants to put it back the potty is usually on the floor and so is the pee. Finally the musical award is fun for the child but not for the parent, because those little hands go into the potty to activate the music. That is not very hygenic and you have the wash your child's hands often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can be a \\"royal\\" mess","review":"do not buy this potty chair simply for the \\"bells and whistles\\" they never seem to work at the right time - or at all half of the time. I would have liked to see it be a little deeper as far as size goes, my boys had a little trouble squeezing in when the protector was on. The main thing that annoys me and maybe this only happens with boys, but it occasionally leaks underneath between the bowl and where it slides in. I am guessing that since the boys urine comes out the front, rather than underneath, it leaks out in that space where the bowl slides out. There are even times that my older son's pants got wet from resting at the front of the potty when he sat. If I had to do it all again, I would opt for using the big potty from the start - cleaning those things out gets old fast too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Royal Disaster!","review":"I wish that I would have read the reviews before buying this product. My 19 month old daughter was too fascinated with the musical chime and quickly figured out how to activate it by touching the sensor with her finger rather than actually sitting down. Who wants to encourage their child to put their hands in the potty? Not me! Also- the musical chime is sporadic-sometimes it would work and sometimes not. Sometimes it would chime when no one was even near it! Then the battery died after only one week! I tried to take it back because we had not actually tried to go potty on it yet- we just got it to introduce her to it, but I did not have the box and Toys R Us told me to call Fisher Price. Fisher Price apologized and issued me a manufacter's coupon for the purchase price. I then went and got a quiet potty!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's unfortunate that the bowl looks like a baseball cap...","review":"As my son started showing potty-readiness, I stood before the huge display of potties and thoroughly examined each feature and decided on this potty. How cool! It plays music! What a nice reward! Like other reviewers, I found my son quickly figured out what he could do to make the music, so he's constantly be sticking his hands down in the bowl which is a bit counter-productive. The worst feature for us is that my son thinks the bowl looks like a baseball cap... I assume that I don't have to paint this picture for you... let's just say that this is one potty we don't recommend. :P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Potty","review":"I have 2 of these for my twin boys. The music runs the batteries out pretty quick so we don't even keep them in. The good things are: the guard for boys, the easy to remove bowl, the high back, and the side arm rests. The bowl is easy to remove so after each potty I empty the bowl into the big potty to flush it away which has encouraged them to use the big potty to \\"put it away\\" themselves. It has never leaked; sometimes they miss the guard so pee completely misses the potty but that's not the potty's fault. The top potty part is extremely easy to use when put on the real toilet. On and off in seconds. I just think the hole should be bigger, we've had some trouble with poopy but if you make sure your kids sit all the way forward it should be okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great potty","review":"I bought this for my two year old, what a mistake. The first problem was it leaked. Just as you are watching your child do their business it was leaking all over the floor. The second problem was that this sound stopped after a few uses. I would not recommend this potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"royal mess","review":"Firstly, my daughter did NOT like the music. Well, I shouldn't say that, she got so distracted by it she stopped doing her business, jumped off, and then peed or pooed in her pants about 10 minutes later. So, out went hte batteris and we had better success.I must also say that it leaks. I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Potty or Plastic Floor Lubrication Device?","review":"For a long time, I just assumed that my 2 1/2 year old son was \\"missing\\" every time he peed in this potty, and I ended up mopping up the floor. I simply could not believe that any manufacturer, especially one as reputed as Fisher Price, would design a kiddy potty with such a glaring design flaw. But, in fact, upon more careful inspection, I realized that there is a substantial gap between the potty seat and the receptacle that attaches underneath the seat. Through that gap goes the bulk of the pee. I have managed to fill the gap with a combination of duct tape and tissue paper, but I fear that this makeshift gapfiller will soon become revolting. I am going out this weekend to buy a new potty seat. Save yourselves the trouble and expense."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Potty Training Disaster!!","review":"I know no one ever said potty training was neat, but this is ridiculous! Every time my son used this potty, I had a big puddle to clean up on the floor. Also, the music feature stopped working after the first thorough cleaning I gave it. We threw it in the garbage and bought the Safety First Potty. It's much cleaner and neater, and my son loved decorating it with the enclosed stickers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This potty set us back 4 months!","review":"This music scared my 20 month old baby girl. When she sat down on it for the first time it immediately made a loud \\"royal\\"sound. It really scared her and she jumped up and never wanted to go near this potty again for the next 4 months. I took the batteries out and now she does use it. I don't recommend this musical potty. Just a regular potty with no sounds is probably just fine for most babies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks with daughter every time!","review":"I could care less about anything else. This potty does the one thing I cannot tolerate- it leaks and I mean has leaked every time she has used it. We had an old wooden and plastic potty that never, ever leaked once. I foolishly threw it away when we brought this one home. Now, I have had it! It even leaks when it looks like it hasn't. Check underneath and there's a puddle. It's cute, I like the overall design and easy detachable bowl, but I would never, ever recommend this potty to anyone under any circumstances and am writing the manufacturer with our woes. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy","review":"this was the 3rd potty i bought my son who is 18 months.the first one was 3 in 1 step potty from safety first.i though it was ok but my son didnt like it,so i went and bout the musical flushing potty, the lid snapped shut my son could not open it by himself,it was hard to take out the pee bucket and the flushin handel was to hard for him to push down it wasnt nice and soft. this royal thing [stinks].the light stays on 24/7 which causes it use allot of batteries.the pee bucket wont stay secure in place and it leaks.there is no seal.im on my 4 and already dont like it.im gonna try the baby bjorn,but ive heard it is only for tiny kids.well see.saveur money dont buy this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Beautifully!","review":"I fortunately haven't had the problems many have had with this potty.My son started playing with it at around a year old. He learned if he stepped it in it the music played. He just turned two a couple weeks ago and this past week decided to start potty training. He immediately took to the potty chair and is doing great.He can get on and off easily on his own.The splash guard works perfectly.He can remove the basin on his own, although he does occassionally spill a little, but he's just two and would spill anything he's holding with liquid in it.It is very easy to clean out.The only complaint I have is that the music does not sound when he goes. It works fine if you put a toy in it or your foot (as he proved at a younger age), but not when he potties. But, it doesn't really matter. I don't think he'd be any more proud of himself if he received a fanfare.Overall, I think this potty is terrific and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy--Set potty training back","review":"This potty was given to us by my mom who wanted to encourage our daughter. It had the exact opposite effect. The first time that she ever told us she had to use the potty she sat on this potty the music started and she cried. She wouldn't sit on another potty because she was scared! I have talked to other moms who have had similar experiences."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Royal Pain","review":"I purchased this potty for my son. I thought that the \\"royal\\" turns would give him an interest in using it, it didn't. He used it once and cried! He would not sit on it again. I was very disappointed.

Sure wish I would have read the reviews before buying this potty chair. It has been the worst purchase I have ever made! My son doesn't complain about the fit, but I definitly complain about having to clean up the floor everytime he uses it. He uses a step stool and the big potty at the sitters, which is what I am going to have him do at home, as I am sick of the mess. I took the batteries out of the potty shortly after buying it as I found it real irritating and never working right. I have bought Fisher - Price items for my children for over 25 years, but they really disappointed me on this item. I will be writing them a letter to let them know how I feel. Maybe the item has been updated since I bought mine (I'm not sure,) but I wouldn't buy it because of my experience with this one. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and the music encourages little hands","review":"The first thing my daughter did was stick her hand past the motion detector to make the music go off. I had to take the batteries out so the music feature was worthless. Then when she sat down to go, the pee went through the crack between the seat and the bowl, down the leg of the chair and into a puddle on the floor. There are so many crevices that it is impossible to clean, especially along the route from the crack between the seat and the bowl and down the leg of the chair. This thing is a JOKE. I am a sucker for buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks Everywhere!","review":"I bought this potty and thought it was great at first - and it was. Then after about three months, my sons pee would be on the floor instead in the bucket. Even when he sits down, it goes everywhere except in the bucket. I turned it over, examined it and still can't figure out why this is happening. I beleive the space between the bucket and the underside of the seat is not designed properly. There must be too much space in the slide slot to allow pee to run on the floor. It's a mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super potty, works every time!!!!!","review":"My 2-year-old refuses to go on anything else. Ours works fine. I need to find another one for upstairs. She runs to it and I've tried several other potties that I had to return.Highly recommend, but each child has their own opinion. This one is great for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for Stocky little boys!!!","review":"I bought this for my son, who is now two, for christmas '05.His rear fits on it snugly and the guard on the front cuts into his legs so I have to take it off. It totaly defeats the purpose of the guard 'cause we can't use it.The music goes off everytime he moves...not just when he goes potty, so he just thinks it is a fun toy instead of a potty chair and would rather play with it then sit on it. Not worth the money in my opinion...I was very disapointed...looking for something different."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst buy","review":"I bought this potty chair for my son and it is horrible. I wish i had read the reviews before making the purchase. It leaks every single time my son uses it. I have to keep a towel under the chair.

Both potties leak when he goes. We have tried having him sit forward and slightly back from the guard but nothing has worked. It is very poorly designed and do not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend this for a boy! Leaks!","review":"I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one that's had this problem with this potty! We bought this over a year ago for our son to try to potty train him before he was 2. He was absolutely amazed at the music when he went (even though it didn't always go when it was supposed to and sometimes went when it shouldn't) and always wanted to \\"go potty.\\" Unfortunately, he eventually tired of it and was no longer \\"thrilled\\" at the music. My biggest complaint, however, is that it leaks! What good is a potty chair that won't hold the contents?!?!? Somewhere between the guard and the bowl itself there's obviously not a tight enough fit. I would've thought they would've tested this kind of thing before it was ever put on the market! Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE POTTY LEAKS","review":"The reward chime was cute but oh so annoying ,I let the batteries run out and never replaced them ( mind you the chimes were the reason I chose this potty) OK and after my son finally got trained i noticed that everytime he went there was a huge puddle of urine on the floor, i am very disppointed with this potty and i am oh so ready to just toss it out and buy a cheap one that is practical and mess free. I say dont waste your money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for chubby legged toddlers","review":"My son is big for 2 years old. He still has his chubby baby legs.

She has been going on it since she was 9 months old. 3 Complaints about it though..(1) it doesnt seem very comfortable,(2) The music is annoying and distracts my daughter when she is trying to pee, (so i remved the batteries)(3) This is the worst one. It leaks like crazy. I made it my mission to find out why. It has nothing to do with the bowl being placed in correctly. It has to do with the tiny gap between the bottom of the hole in the seat and the actual bowl. The pee runs down my daughters leg/butt towards the back or side and runs under the seat and in between the seat and bowl so it leaks out. So for all you people with leaks this is the reason as i spent so much time figuering out the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Product-Great Customer Service","review":"I really disliked this product. It leaked out between the potty and the bowl. It is also very difficult to clean. I noticed an odor from it one day so I started looking and found a lot of crevices that are impossible to get clean.

I replaced it with an inexpensive potty without the musical feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Royal Blessing","review":"I have tried two other potty chairs and I have to say that this one was the best one for our daughter. I can't really say whether this works well for boys, but for girls it works quite well. We haven't had any leaks, just pure success! We did take the batteries out of the chair only because the sensors are really sensitive, it seemed that it became an interference to our potty training. FYI: My mother-in-law uses the \\"3 in 1 Potty Chair\\" from Safety First and also has had no problems with that chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute,but annoying","review":"Seemed like a good motivator at the time we bought it. However, after the first couple of days, the batteries were removed. Every time you bump it, the music goes off. It's too cute, my 3 year old daughter thinks it's more of a toy than a functioning potty. She has yet to actually do anything on it. It gets more use as a chair or a pretend potty for her bear/doll menagerie. I also wish it had a lid on it. It sits between the toilet and the sink (the only place in our small bathroom that we can put it), and we're always knocking things off the sink into it, or kicking it (which is why we took the batteries out). There are more sensible options out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad bad bad potty","review":"I had went and bought the royal potty for my son becasue it looked real cool. the first time he used it the legs fell off. every time he sits the right legs pop off. when he goes #1 the hole is so tiny when he sits down the pee just dont make it in the hole. and the music i put batteries in and it just would not quit making music it is the worse potty ever.

Maybe a vinyl book would've been better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Waste of Money","review":"We bought this potty chair for my son and have regreted it ever since. The chair leaks every time he goes in the potty. At first we thought we didn't have the bucket in correctly, but we have tried every way we can think to make minor adjustments so that we don't end up with a mess. We even tried to show him how to hold his little parts down to avoid leaking and we still end up cleaning up the floor. Take it from me, buy a different potty chair. We eventually bought a new one ourselves because we just got to the point where we dreaded letting him go on the potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"This was a complete waste of my money. I bought this because my son loves music. The first one I brought home did not work (yes, I put batteries in it). I took that one back and got another, and it doesn't work either.

Don't buy this potty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst potty for boys","review":"My husband and I were having trouble getting our 2 year old interested in using the potty, so we bought this one because its suppose to play music. Well, it does sometimes, but most of the time it doesn't work and our son is tall for his age so he has problems sitting down without hurting himself on the splashguard. The worst thing about this potty is that it leaks !! alot !!! and my son ends up with a huge puddle on the floor under his seat or worse, down his legs and all over his clothing. He feels bad about it and its not his fault...the bowl does not fit tightly on the chair and even when he holds his penis down...it still leaks out the sides of the bowl and all over the floor....its a real mess.

The bowl is quite small compared to the Baby Bjorn one I also have, so he must scoot back a bit to go potty. And then when he does go, his aim happens to hit right at the spot where the bowl meets the main potty, and then it leaks and we have puddles on the floor. You would have thought it would have been designed better being from Fisher Price. We have since moved this to a less used bathroom and moved our Baby Bjorn back which is much nicer and leak proof!

I'm getting rid of this potty."},{"rating":"2","title":"The royal potty","review":"***************NOT FOR BOYS******************Unless you want to keep cleaning your floor. The problem is there is no seal between the seat and the pull out tray that catched the \\"mess\\". If your son points down, its all over your floor.

IT ALSO LEAKS AND THE SEAT IS HARD AND UNCOMFORTABLE. EVEN WHEN HE DID GO POTTY, HE WAS NOT REWARDED WITH MUSIC OVER HALF OF THE TIME.

It is cute, but that's the only postive thing I can say about it. The bowl and seat are way too small, and the arm rests come so far foward that there is no room for a child to spread their legs. The result (for a boy anyway) is the pee goes on the floor, or on you if you don't get out of the way quick enough! The music is inconsistant, it is triggered too easily so it is more of a distraction then an award. The little book constantly falls out of it's holder. But the worst thing is the bowl is pulled out from the front, making this a great play toy for a curious toddler, but not fun for mommy. My son keeps reaching between his legs and whipping out the bowl.

I was not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great...at first!!!","review":"I bought this potty about six months ago thinking this would get my little boy interested. It worked well for about a week. My son wasn't interested in it unless it made noise before he sat on it, so he would wave his hand in it and then sit on it do his buissness (sometimes). Anyways, after a week it stopped making the little music sounds no matter what you did. I cleaned it after every use and even changed the batteries. Then every time my son peed in it it leaked out all over the floor. It seems as though if you pull out the little cup too much, it doesn't slide back in the right way anymore. So, this is not a good toilet trainer, I ended up buying an 8 buck seat you put on your toilet and he likes to use that one more because it's the \\"big potty\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"He might as well just pee on the floor!","review":"At first, I thought this potty was a God-send. It was stable so my above average 2 year wasn't able to flip it over as easily as some of the others we tried. It is generally pretty easy to clean up too. HOWEVER, as other reviewers have noted, this potty LEAKS UNBELIEVABLY! Every time he went, it would just shoot out the gaps between the chair and the removable seat. At first I thought it wasn't together right, but indeed it was! He's finally begun using it regularly, so I've had newspaper under him and the Resolve carpet cleaner ready. Talk about inconvenient. I just went out and bought another one thinking this was defective. Same thing happend. They're both going back and I found one that doesn't leak. Maybe it's better for girls. Less of an angle! If you have a boy, don't go with this model or buy stock in Resolve. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Royal about it","review":"This is one of the biggest wastes of money I've spent. The music doesn't play when it's supposed to. It may be okay for girls, but my grandson uses it and we have to clean the floor afterward. The cup doesn't fit up tight and he urinates between the potty and the cup, therefore it goes all over the floor.Don't ignore the reviews as I did and buy it anyway. It isn't worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$","review":"I bought this for my son, although he likes to use the \\"baby\\" potty, I wish I never bought it. I guess my som likes it because it's his size, but the batteries run out quickly, the music plays whenever something goes by it, and it LEAKS!!!! I am very UNHAPPY with this product!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major design flaws - not for boys","review":"Thought the music would be a great \\"reward\\" for my son, however, he must have the techie gene because he figured out right away when he put his hand over the red light beam he could activate the music. Also, every time he sits to go, with the cup installed, it leaks all over the place. The only saving grace on this is that the seat can be removed and placed on a toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Stopped Working","review":"We have had this potty probably 9 months now. When we first got it, it worked perfectly, music played when it was supposed to etc. Now as my 2 year old is getting more serious about potty training the music won't work when it is supposed to, it leaks on the floor even though the shield is in place and he has tucked himself. I took it apart, cleaned it, and reassembled, and it still leaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!!!!!!!!!","review":"This potty chair LEAKS VERY BADLY!!!!! Pee gets on the floor EVERY stinkin' time AND on my son's feet. The opening is WAY to small to go number 2 in. It is very messy business to clean up afterwards. I am VERY disappointed with it. Buy this ONLY if you want to waste your money. Plus, the sensors for the music are WAY to sensitive and go off when no one is even in the room! Ugh. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaky Mess = Smelly Bathroom","review":"I loved this potty because of its look and its easy to remove bottom makes for easy cleaning. My Son has about 4 different potties between ours and Grandmas houses and this is by far the easiest to clean! However, it leaks all over the floor. I solved this problem by purchasing an inexpensive (but cute) bath rug. I clean it every other day by taking it in the shower with me. The thinner the mat the faster it will dry when hung.Now my three year old likes to sit on the big potty, but with his \\"boy equipment\\" its hard for him to hold himself up and hold his equipment down. I removed the legs from the potty and it clicks right into the toilet seat. The leaking is no longer a problem! I would purchase this potty all over again...its worth the hastle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty seat or play seat?","review":"I bought this seat for my son thinking that he would use it and start potty training. Instead he'd rather play with it. No matter whether it is put together on the floor or on the big potty, he'd rather put his hands in the hole to make the music play. He thinks the legs and the bowl are fun toys too.And with the batteries installed, any little thing turns the seat on! It needs to have an on/off switch.I will definately be looking for a different potty seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and money","review":"My 21 month old daughter sits on the Royal Potty like it is a chair but refuses to use it as a \\"potty.\\" The music only plays when you move the potty from place to place, and once when she did actually \\"go\\" in the potty, there was no music. The small book that comes with the potty falls apart very quickly. Fisher-Price usually makes good quality products. Unfortunately, they really bombed with this one. This potty got the royal flush from our house...it will be sold in our garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for a boy!","review":"I bought this for my 2yr old son based on bells and whistles without researching it first. That was a big mistake. The whole thing is kind of small, the splash guard is totally ineffective, and it cuts into his thighs. The worst thing is that he pees right over it (and on it) almost every time. It comes out easily, so he likes to take it off and throw it YUCK! Words can not describe my frustration! Also, he has learned that if he rocks back it activates the music. When he goes back forward he pinches his \\"stuff\\" in the splash guard. If you have a little boy, please consider a potty with a better better splash guard(deflector)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toddler Nightmare","review":"Every time my daughter (20 months) uses the potty her first reaction is to pull the pan from under the potty...causing the floor to get wet. The pan comes out from the front...did they think about which age group would be using this potty?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"It leaks like crazy and the seat opening itself is too small. The splash guard is way too small and doesn't work very well either. I am throwing this away and going shopping for a new potty chair. Every time my child goes potty, no matter which way I sit him, the thing leaks and there ends up being a big puddle underneath. He doesn't like his feet getting wet, and I don't like having a puddle to contend with in the mornings when I am trying to run out the door for work! It is very unsanitary in my opinion and they need to take it off the market!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Potty is no fun.","review":"I really don't think of this as a toy. Our kids are slightly amused with the potty idea, but lets face it -- not always an enjoyable experience. It seem comfortable for our three little girls ranging from 1-3. Easy to clean and sturdy as well. The potty \\"detector\\" and music thing rarely works. And occasionally it comes on in the middle of the night with no one in the bathroom. But the kids do love the book that comes with it. But there are much better potty books in the book store. Nonetheless I'd buy it again from among the choices out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A ROYAL PAIN!!!!!!","review":"The only positive thing I can say about this potty is that I never had a problem with it leaking. Of course...my daughter only ever used it two times. Reason number one is that it was VERY uncomfortable for her. Because there is no padding on the seat, after sitting for just a few minutes (which as you know is a part of potty training), her bottom would have a red mark from the seat cutout and she wanted to get off. At first I thought she just wasn't ready for potty training. Then...I bought another potty with a padded seat (because I was SO annoyed by the super sensetive \\"music\\" that played every time except when it was supposed to!) and she sat fine and is potty training great now. This potty was not worth the money. A rare fisher price mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"I bought this potty seat for my son thinking it looked great and fisher-price ALMOST ALWAYS makes great things, but I was wrong with this one. First of all, the music plays only when the chair is moved...it hardly plays when my son goes potty on it. Secondly, I would NOT recommed this seat for a boy. The \\"protector\\" is there for decoration only, at least that's what it seems to me...and let's not even talk about the book that was easily torn apart by a 15 month old...I should have bought the potty chair that can also be used as a stool, at least I could have got some use out of that..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double Your Clean-Up","review":"I bought this seat because of the musical reward. My daughter was 18 mos. old at the time and got a kick out of the music, although she didn't start using the seat until she was 26 mos. old. By then the batteries had died so the music was not a factor in her use of the potty. The big problem with the seat is that, unless she sits all the way back and completely straight, we have a bigger puddle on the floor than in the seat! I am buying a different seat for her as I am tired of the double clean-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I choice this potty chair because of the music playing feature. My 18 month old loves music, so I figured this would be a great reward for \\"going\\". First of all, I should have looked at the \\"function\\" of the potty before looking at the extras. The bowl is very small and the guard for boys is pretty much useless. My son is average size, but barely fit on on the bowl. His little legs kept getting pinched between the guard and the sides. I guess it was a $.. learning experience and I will know what to look for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pee On The Floor","review":"Not for my 2 1/2 yr. old son. The deflector does not work for him and the pee goes in between the cup and removable tray. Leaving me with a mess every time. Also, the music sometimes just plays all be itself and is very annoying. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE IT!! Leaks all over the floor.","review":"We got it as a gift for Christmas. Just started using it with my son who is 27 months. I don't know if it's because he's a boy but for some reason it leaks all over the floor. The urine comes out of the front between the bowl and the potty seat. Aweful!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A horrible idea...","review":"I received this as a gift for my daughter. She is 2 and a half and this chair has not helped at all in potty training. The chimes ring whenever she sits on it, and then she wants to stand up and see if she went. Not only that but it chimes in the bathroom, when someone walks by and randomly on it's own. Also the legs detach so that you are able to place it on the toilet, but it \\"locks in place\\" and is a real pain to take on and off of the big toilet. I would NEVER buy this product or recommend it to someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Leakage","review":"This potty leaks! My son only uses it while sitting down with the urine guard in place but after each use there is a large puddle of urine on the floor. Like a previous reviewer I studied it carefully (I am an engineer) and came to the same conclusion - the space between the bowl and chair is too great. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this potty makes me want to scream!","review":"My son absolutely loves this chair.<br />I on the other hand want to throw it out the window. The sounds and lights only worked for a week. My son couldn't get over the spash guard without hurting himself, so he took that part off. Also it leaks as the catcher is separate from the chair, boys tend to pee through the crack."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cute but leaky potty!!!","review":"I got this potty as a shower gift. The concept is cute. My 2 year old liked the sound effects when he sat, and went. However, it leaks every time he urinates!!! And frankly I am tired of cleaning up pee, so its extra work! They need to perfect the design. I know two other peple with the same potty and they have the same complaint. It works best when you attach it to the regular toilet. In my opinion do not buy this product, if you get it as a gift hopefully you get a gift reciept!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Potty is Pointless","review":"This potty is pretty pointless. If the music would work correctly, then that would be a really good reward system. The music starts everytime my daughter moves, while she is sitting on the potty. I would just buy a plain potty over this one, if I had to do it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks all the time","review":"My 18 mo old son started using the potty almost naturally but everytime he would go pee it would leak. The design of the splash guard is poor because you see the gap between that and the bowl. The guard seems to pinch his legs (average sized child) and the potty seemed a bit small. Wish I had read all the reviews on this one before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! Don't buy this","review":"From cars to paperclips and everything in between, this is the absolute worst product I have ever purchased. It leaks 95% of the time around where the bowl meets the potty. I did more cleaning up than anything with this potty. Unless you want to be on your hands and knees cleaning up puddles all day, do not purchase this potty. A true disappointment from Fisher Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Owie Potty - Zero Stars!","review":"I was very disappointed in this item. I thought it would be fun for my son to learn with. He is small for his age (2 yrs old) and still the seat and the splash guard pinched him. The hole is the smallest I've seen on any potty and I'm not sure how any child could aim correctly, boy or girl. I was surprised when I pulled it out of the box.This is the first product review I've written but had to share because it was such a bad experience. I've been very happy with other fisher price products.My son is potty trained now and we used the Graco which was a great chair. It had no music but he didn't really get excited by the royal music because he would just cry \\"No, owie potty - It hurts Mommy\\". Not a good experience for a toddler.I hope fisher price reworks a good concept but bad product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst potty ever!!!","review":"This was the worst potty ever. I bought it for my 2 year old son cause it looked different & it looked like it would be more fun but its the worst. Everytime he pees it leakes!!! I ended up getting a new one cause I thought there was something wrong with it but the new one also leakes. Plus the music is the worst. Every time you walk near the bathroom it goes off & the stupid red light stayes on which means the batteries keep dying. I thought Fisher Price was a good company?"},{"rating":"1","title":"GREAT FOR PLAYING, NOT FOR POTTY TRAINING","review":"I couldnt get my son past trying to make the light go on and the music play, which is WAY too easy. There should be an on off switch, a bigger seat and a much less sensitive mechanism to trigger the music. It is also way too difficult to detach the seat from the legs in order to use the seat on an adult toilet bowl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed","review":"I purchased this product under the assumption that it was the top of the line model. Unfortunately, my 2 year old son ended up paying for my mistake. We had a very difficult time just trying to fit him on it. Because he is big for his age, 41 lbs. at his 2 yr. visit, it was almost impossible for him to get comfortable on it, and when I finally got him on, I couln't get him back off without causing some level of discomfort. Also, did I mention the fact that this model was most likely designed for little girls!! After 2 long days, we called it quits and moved on to another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste the money","review":"I bought this potty chair because it looked different and i thought it would help but its just annoying more than anything. the music goes off when you walk past it or even when the cat does. and when my daughter sits on it it doesnt play music until she figits around and then it goes off every time she figits. theres a little red light to that completely distracts her cause all she wants to do is stick her finger on it and make noise. and the thing that holds the potty comes out extra easy. i would return it if i coul"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Us!","review":"My little 2 year old daughter quickly learned that she could activate the motion detector in the potty by sticking her hand in it! She started having a blast with it playing the \\"fanfare\\" with her hand that I had to take the batteries out for fear that she would try this after she used it. So the motion detector was totally useless for us. After a while I put it away and went back to the store to get the plain plastic Safely First potty. I don't want to teach her that sticking her hands in the potty is ok!! I'm surprised the designers of the potty didn't think of this!

That would be fine if you wanted a comparison, but anyone with FMS, like myself, knows that each individual case is different. I felt as though I was reading a combination of a second grade book report, (with too many little side comments like this) and a medical report. I would prefer something in between.

I was particularly interested in Martha Graham's techniques, and there is some filming of some of those with her voice narrating and explaining them. It is a treat to hear her speak.

There is nothing on sports, personal life, art etc. if there is it is tied into what some Prime Minister did.It seems a little right-wing history to me, only focused on the leaders and their policy but I don't think you'll get a better understanding of Australia when you read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Italy's Frank Sinatra in the 21st Century!","review":"I had a chance to listen to this at work - my secretary brought it in.

With his soaring trombone playing and hit tunes, he left an indelible mark on American culture, yet few know that off stage, Dorsey's personal life was as fascinating as the music he created on stage. A man driven by his passion for women and drink as much as for music, Dorsey was a perfectionist who lived on overload. Peter Levinson's bio, drawn on exhaustive new research and scores of interviews with those who knew Dorsey best, takes us center stage and behind the scenes, toppling the swing era's icon sweet and mellow image and replacing it with a more truthful, multi-faceted portrait of a man of extreme excess. All the high and low notes Dorsey achieved are here. Play on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tommy Dorsey Unbuttoned","review":"For those who wonder what it was like in the \\"big band\\" era - especially on the inside - this book is a gem. It gives an unvarnished picture of the origins and workings of the big bands and provides a personal in-depth look at one of the founders. If you wonder about the story of the horse's head told in the Godfather Movie or if you are nostalgic about the music and its producers in the heyday, this is the book for you.

Ours broke in a few months. Even when it worked it had the major drawback of having no temperature sensor. It just always heats, no matter how hot the tank. I guess this could work for some where the room temperature is constant the the equalibrium reached between heat added and heat lost results in precisely the temperature you want. But that seems to me very unlikely for most. The wattage is not really enough to work well even with a separate (and likely expensive) thermostat. And as I say, mine broke relatively quickly. I'm still not sure how that is even possible in a heating coil with no moving parts.

Look elsewhere if you are looking for really good ones. I was sold on the \\"gel\\" part, but that neither seem to offer extra comfort nor additional protection compared to a well padded gear. The straps are too big for my child and too small for me. It appears that these are made for either a small adult, a big child or an average sized adolescent. The straps on this are poorly designed. Straps on protective pads are usually made to turn around on a ring before getting strapped with velcro. These do not do that and just go straight.

Low maintenance, don't have to replace filters, no white residue all over the room, plenty of capacity and output, plus a digital humidistat. In theory, perfect. In practice, an epic fail. Started out wonderful. We were really patting ourselves on the back for this purchase. After 2 weeks the fan, even on low, started to make a lot of noise. Like the motor or some other moving part was experiencing too much friction. After a couple nights of this getting worse and worse the humidifier couldn't be used any more. I even took the fan guard off of the top, pulled off the fan blade, and applied some WD40 to the visible parts. All that produced was a really loud humidifier that smelled like WD40.

I found it to be very noisy on high, but tolerable on low speed. After using it for the Season, I cleaned it up and boxed it up for the Summer. When I took it out and filled it up the unit wouldn't even turn on. The humidistat was bad. After calling Hunter they sent me another unit. This one has worked for about 6 weeks. We woke up in the middle of the night to what sounded like a toy machine gun. This one has a defective pump, the impellers are out of alignment and it is not usable. So, in the Arizona dry air we're again stuck with another humidifier which is basically worthless. It was money out the window in my opinion. I'm switching back to a Lasko unit, they're much more dependable, and my last one lasted for over 10 years.

However, after running it for a couple of hours it started to become very LOUD (a kind of rattling sound) even on the LOW setting. On HIGH it sounded like a truck revving up. I thought that it was just a defective unit, and returned it for a replacement. Same problem. So it looks as though the loudness of this unit is a built-in \\"feature\\". I couldn't even watch/hear my TV when it was running on low.If you can't stand noise, this unit is not for you. I just returned the replacement unit and asked for a refund.If it weren't for the noise level it would be an ideal unit for me. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"very loud and unreliable","review":"This humidifier is cheap, puts out a fair amount of moisture, and has a decent-sized water tank. Unfortunately, it is extremely noisy and poorly designed. The lowest programmable humidity setting is 30% but my unit underestimated the humidity by nearly 10% so I had no way to get it to stop before the humidity hit 40%, which was more than I wanted. The permawick gets grimy is short order and is essentially impossible to clean and the water in the basin gets foul quickly. The fan on my unit started to fail after about 3 months and I decided it was not worth bothering to get warranty support. I upgraded to an air washer that is quieter, easier to clean, more energy efficient, and better engineered--of course, it was also more expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Bought this unit over a year ago. It worked fine for about a year. Then started rattling. I had to return the first one after a week because the fan split where the motor shaft went into it. The next one sent worked great.

The unit worked great for a year then had to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first unit I purchased had a malfunctioning humidistat and it was replaced immediately.

I purchased this in January to go in my sons room and it stopped working over the weekend so we got 4 months of use. I called Hunter and after sitting on hold for an extended period of time the customer service rep came on and was very snippy with me. She then informed me that she could not do anything without the serial number which I didn't have at the time (I was at work and the humidifier was at home). She said to call back when I have the serial number. Hoping I get a nicer rep when I do call back and really hoping that they resolve this issue quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunter Humidifer is Junk","review":"I own this humidifer. The problems are: Water is able to reach so many parts that then promote the growth of mold and bacteria and hard water deposits. These areas are not able to be cleaned throughly and therefore this humidifier is hazardous to your health. The permanent filter is metal and gets covered with scale and cannot be cleaned with vinegar or other cleaner solvents. The reason the units don't work the following summer is they corrode and rust and also get the scale deposits over the moving parts which then freeze up and don't move. Therefore, the \\"float\\" switch doesn't know there is water available and it won't turn on. The fan motor is extremely cheap in design and this results in excessive noise, even on low setting. Overall, if you want to buy an unhealthy, poorly designed product that won't last, this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEEP LOOKING","review":"\\"Whisper quiet?\\" As compared to what, a jet engine? I bought this unit to use in about a 1200 s.f. space. Although it claims to be able to work for a larger space than that, it cannot even maintain a 35% humidity, even with the obnoxiously loud fan on high constantly.

It's heavy and awkward to handle and operate. You have to use your thumb to push the switch forward and hold it down at the same time to keep it running, and this is extremely uncomfortable. I had a difficult time trying to do this and keep it running, and I was only testing it.

I found this book great for acquiring (some of) the necessary mathematics to get into a more serious study of mathematical control theory. It also boosted my capacity to closely follow some journal articles in control theory. People with the average graduate preparation in controls may skip the first four chapters and start with metric spaces. The book is not, however, adequate for studying Lie algebra as needed in controls (and robotics) as pointed out by the reviewer from Japan. It only defines Lie algebra in a very general way, and does not get into Lie algebras of vector fields, which is what we need for geometric control. The book contains, however, valuable applications of the theory to optimal control and estimation, as well as a clear exposition of existence and uniqueness of solutions to ODEs."},{"rating":"1","title":"broken when i received","review":"Unfortunately this product was broken (didn't work) when i received it.

My own class can hardly wait for reading time when we've got a Junie B. book, and they we're especially excited to hear about her foray into the first grade. We loved it. The first grade book introduces you to Junie B. and her new journal (where Junie expresses her famous off the wall sense of humor), her new teacher, her new friends, and (gasp!) her new glasses. The book is both touching and funny. It perfectly captures the fear young children have about being different and about being made fun of by their classmates, and handles it with both great comedy and a sense of reality that all kids can relate to. I was really surprised to read that this book disappointed some. I couldn't imagine a better introduction to the first grade and neither could my students. We're all looking forward to the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait!","review":"My kids love Junie B. and are thrilled that she's finally in first grade! The latest book in the series is just as funny as the kindergarten books, and I was pleased to see that Junie's now facing some of the same issues my kids are (fear of a new classroom, etc.), and is of course handling them with her signature hilarity. The book gave us a lot to talk about (it's a little meatier than the other books, and a great jumping off point for discussions) and my daughter wouldn't rest until we'd read it through twice (she also wants to start keeping a journal--which Junie does in the book). We loved the new characters (know-it-all May had us laughing out loud) and were so happy to see some of our favorites back from the earlier books. Kudos to Barbara Park and Junie B.

This newest book had no laugh-out-loud parts like the other books do. Junie has matured too much! She isn't funny any more!

Because Junie acts (now that the series tells of her life in first grade) like she's a forth-grader, and her journal entrees are too good for a 6-year-old. I didn't laugh either. Suddenly, Junie B. needs glasses. There wasn't enough to this book; another three chapters would have been better. And even worse: Junie B. is turning into a boss, show-off, I-am-better-than-you-and-I-get-what-I-want kid. Quite a change, huh? Go ahead, read it. Read ALL the first-graders.

She's different. And she'll never be the same. I loved the kindergarten stories. They're so realistic. But what are the odds that---not 1---but 2 and both of your friends will turn you down? That's not very normal. I'm 10 and have friends that I've carried with me since first grade. But Junie B. lost Lucille and Grace in a matter of days. I doubt a kid could lose both friends.

I expected Junie to be more mature, but she seems way too grown up for a first grader. I taught first grade for many years and the new Junie just does not measure up. I hope Barbara Parks brings back the Junie that we all love. **Junie also needs skills on level with real 6 year olds. Six year olds cannot write journal entrees anything like Junie does.

After doing the first 2 experiments my kids said that they are all the same which they were. The last experiment is glowing bubbling potion, it didn't glow very well we waited all day until night time to do this one. The only plus I will give it is there is enough material to do the experiments over all except for the glow in the dark bubbling potion which is the only one my kids wanted to do again. Overall it was a waste of time my kids lost interest very quickly I'd say to go with a kit with several different types of experiments!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly impressed","review":"I bought this for my 6 year old nephew, as I have a PhD in Chemistry, and I always attempt to bring a little bit of learning into present-orientated events. My nephew is off the wall with energy and I bought it on a long shot and a hope. My nephew absolutely loved it. From the \\"magic wand\\" to the changing of colors of solutions he was able to directly see chemistry in action. For the cost, and the \\"WHAO\\" factor, it was well worth the money spent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, poorly executed","review":"Well, cool, make a magic wand! What could be better for a school age child into fantasy books? But oh no, the ends of the wand do NOT FIT the tube, so the wand cannot be made- SO, massive disappointment for the excited child, complete annoyance for the parent! How hard would it be for the maker of this product to include pieces that actually fit together? The wand consists of 2 stoppers and a plastic tube, this is not rocket science!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this purchase","review":"I bought this for my son's 6th birthday and it was definitely a hit. He loved making the potions. I had to help him but he finds it very exciting. He loved making the wand the best (which I had no trouble putting together). It is teaching him measuring and fractions (fill test tube a '1/3' with water etc), and also some science too (the density of oil vs water etc). It is so great I am thinking of getting it for my nephew for his birthday - and he is 8. The only reason it is not 5 star is because storing the left over bits and pieces is messy, and I'm not sure you can get replacement ingredients easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loved it!","review":"I purchased this for my 5 year old son for Christmas. He and I had a great time with this kit last weekend. As others have stated, adult supervision and a towel on your work area are needed. It can be a little messy but it is worth it.

In summary, after about 15 minutes, she was in tears over the thing. Reason being is that she was frustrated with the overall navigation and controls for configuring and setting up the thing. We located the instructions buried in the packaging, and were able to eventually get past it.After configuring, she had the instructions out trying to send messages - she finally was able to do it, but it's not very easy. In addition, the IR is a severe limitation as line of sight must be maintained.This product would be much better if it was RF-based, and was less cryptic in the initial setup, as well as sending a message. For example to send a message, here's process:- Chat Mode button- type message- send button- it then asks for the P/I? which we have no clue what that is- then hit ICQ buttonSeveral steps, lots of button pushing, not the most intuitive.Recommend that you do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Trouble","review":"No directions - these kids have to figure out what these cryptic codes mean without an instruction manual or any indication of what the buttons are for.

The user interface is just downright befuddling...all these extra keys you have to press to get it to send text...you press SEND, but before sending it asks you \\"P/I?\\" to which you respond \\"ICQ CALL\\"... does any of this make sense? I think buying my kid a telegraph key and teaching her Morse Code would be somewhat easier. I plan to return mine and get something else for an Xmas present for my kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EVER!","review":"I bought this for my children who were overly excited to text each other back and forth and tell sister secrets and giggle and ooooh the hopes and dreams..then we opened the box. There were NO instructions in the box about how to operate. I had to look it up online. And when I did I saw a WHOLE BUNCH OF BAD REVIEWS and warnings NOT to buy this product. I'm VERY disappointed. It looks so cool but its very difficult to figure out. Instead of typing a message and hitting send, you have to go thru four or five steps. and i'm still not sure how to receive one from the other one. I wouldnt give this stuff away for free. The manufacturers should be ashamed of themselves. This is the WORST toy I have EVER bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible purchase","review":"This was for my 8 year to text with her bff in hopes of improving her spelling without nagging or quizzing her. They have to be in the same in the room together but is not user friendly for a child in anyway.

For those who don't mind a little Timothy Leary along with the tunes, this will be just fine. The cover art shows a large group of individuals across several generations, commune style, but basically Group 1850 was a five piece, although I suppose some of those pictured may be significant others doubling as backup singers, accompanists, etc. The playing is indeed very hot in most places, but it may take some patience to get there since the chants are pretty heavy near the beginning of the work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing ...","review":"Amazing ... that this many people could get together at one time and none of them have a good musical idea!

Many have compared this to early Pink Floyd, but I hear more of a Mother's of Invention influence if anything. Actually, this band very much has their own sound but the silliness and heavy cut-and-paste usage remind a little of zappa. The album itself would actually warrant four and a half stars, but the Rotation CD version rates a little lower because of the shoddy packaging.

Apart from the anglo-saxon mainstream the book offers little insight. I've found at least one instance of each of the following errors: 1) names sometimes carry alternate spellings that sound very similar, but are variants of a different name 2) names that are obvious variants of each other are listed separately without cross-reference 3) the ethnic categories, as far as I could tell are often questionable and in some cases plain wrong 4) at least for my ethnic background, the selection of names seems rather odd, and many names only appear in short forms 5) meanings of greek/latin names are often inaccurate Bottomline: If you are looking for some inspiration, the book is ok. It carries a wide ethnic variety of names.

It's very familiar and appealing.All in all this CD has a little bit of an Americana quality to it, but this is much more accessible to those of us that might not list that as our very favorite genre.This is a bit more pop-folk-ish and much more fun to me, anyway. If you dig Sarah Harmer and the like, I think you'll like Garrison Starr."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"The lyrics are insightful, the music is varied and interesting, and best of all, it really rocks! There is a lot of optimism in this album, and not just because of the upbeat music, but because Starr doesn't spend the whole time moaning. It is a young, fun album, with a fresh voice and a really rockin' style!Oh, and for all of the fans out there, check out Mary-Chapin Carpenter's background vocals on cut 5, \\"Silent Night!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Soaring High","review":"I was a fan of Garrison's music after hearing \\"SuperHero\\" from her Eighteen Over Me album and have loved her music ever since.This album is amazing.

I loved Cammy. And Jason is adorable and wonderfully sweet. I love when she kisses him in the ballroom. Sure, we figure out before the rest who he really is, but was a fun treat to geet there. When Cammy assists Jason in getting dressed to rescue the children, she does not blush or stammer but enjoys the view of him, which apparently is quite a sight.

They also work for discouraging burglars from breaking into your house and stealing your wide-screen TV and other things, because they'll assume you're too clueless to have anything of value, especially if you also have a couple of old cars on your front lawn missing a wheel or two.

Interesting, Stone credits Napolean Hill's philosophy for helping him amass his huge fortune.At first glance, Success Through a PMA may appear to be just another version of Think & Grow Rich. There are some similiarities, but plenty of differences to make this book a worthwhile read.When I first got into network marketing in the 70's, I met a guy who made over $2 million in 18 months (in 1970 $$$!!!) and credits this book along with the right opportunity as being his secret to success.Since following Hill's advice in this and Think and Grow Rich, I have achieved success far greater than I could have otherwise.Great book in addition to Think & Grow Rich."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in older edition","review":"I didn't realize this would be an older edition with smaller print and later comments by the authors.

I wish they had filmed it in Spanish - the dubbed in Spanish is kind of lame - then it would have really been hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"**Spoiler Alert** I think that this movie was written by a twelve-year old boy. It sort of reminds me of porn with the sex removed. Two heroines who are polar opposites meet and take an immediate dislike to one another because one is rich and one is poor. Then their fathers get into trouble so they rob banks to fix things, because money fixes everything. Then enter a gringo investigator who has come to catch them. They mess with him in totally non-threatening ways, both get a crush on him, sort of kidnap him, and then have a competition to see which one he thinks is the better kisser. \\"You've never kissed any one before?\\" Salma Hayek asks Penelope Cruz? What? Nonsensical convoluted junk. I understand why this didn't get released to theaters. The most disappointing thing is that the people in the cast, the actors involved are much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRING ON THE SEQUEL!","review":"An enjoyable film, Bandidas, brings to the screen the story of two beautiful Mexican women who band together in order to protect their land from the greedy Bank of New York which is out to buy up as much property as possible.

I used to limit myself to the \\"biggies\\" such as Pavarotti, Bjoerling, Corelli etc., but I am so glad I have broadened my scope to include non-\\"legendary\\" voices.For, while a tenor like Ramon Vargas may not have the sheer natural vocal endowment to become a \\"legendary\\" tenor for the ages, he certainly has the ability in the here-and-now to sing with surpassing beauty and exquisite musicality. He gives these arias a freshness that is, well... refreshing!He also sings in a very self-effacing and humble manner-- being more interested in letting his voice serve the music rather than his own ego. This type of singing is, for my money, where it's at and you sometimes dont get it with the \\"legends\\", perhaps because they know they are \\"legendary\\"!Ramon Vargas sings purely and without artifice and it is moving.

But as I understand things Square kinda ran out of money before they finished making the show. There really should have been more episodes, but there arn't. The premise for the show is reasonably good and the characters are pretty good too. It's just that not much happens and when it does everything happens way to fast. The first 20 odd episodes are kind of slow to develop the plot and then in the last episode they throw what should have been about ten episodes of plot development at you in about a minute and a half for a finale which, while spectacular, is really not all that good and poorly resolved. My advise is to not bother buying the show and to borrow it from someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor animation and VERY boring","review":"I picked this up because the character designer does some great stuff. I wasn't expecting anything incredible and got even less. I suppose some people like this sort of thing, but this dragged on way too long for me. I wouldn't mind poor animation if the story was at least half way engaging. The first episode on this DVD is rediculously stupid. The villian character pops up out of nowhere over and over again and it is irritating to say the least.The last episode on this DVD had decent to good animation as they apparently changed up the team (different art direction and flat, single local color style of character animation). If you really want to see these episodes -- rent. Don't make the same mistake as I did. Nice box art and a reasonably good 20 minutes of animation really aren't worth the price of this disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"More FF than Spirts Within","review":"I just cant give this five stars. Sure, it's cool, it's a great start to what promises to be an impresive series. Unlike FF: The Spirits Within, this series really is Final Fantasy. The opening of the show includes the classic FF crystal theme, and when battles end they are punctuated with the victory music from the games. Other refrences thus far: Chocobos, Cid, Summons (Pheonix, Typhoon, and Shiva so far), and crystals, lots of crystals. The series blends in CGI much in the same way that Cowboy Bebop did.The problem is, it is starting a bit slowly for my tastes. So far not a lot has been done with the characters themselves. Maybe in the next four episodes, we'll see some real development."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come On","review":"33 songs!

Yes, this book is strong and scary, but it makes you think. If it doesn't make a difference to think and talk like this why does it cause so much trouble.

This movie gives them the kudos they deserve for pushing the envelope. On that point alone, I recommend buying the DVD because it provides such a nice timecapsule.

They team up to produce a risky movie and Chili starts to make one of his own on the side. Soon, Harry's sleazy investors come into the picture and want Chili rubbed out. Chili's rival Ray Bones visits town, also with the intent on giving the slick hit man trouble. Meanwhile, Chili becomes friends with a big shot movie star and falls in love with Harry's leading lady. A fortune of cash is at stake while 'Get Shorty' evolves from one plot twist to the next. If you love movies or complex thrillers with gritty diolauge and human characters, pick up a copy of this fresh and enjoyable caper."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Elmore Leonard's Finest Novels","review":"Elmore Leonard may be America's foremost writer for fast-paced spellbinding dialogue and plots. With \\"Get Shorty\\" Leonard has produced a modern crime novel classic; a spellbinding, yet hilarious, update of Chandler with some sly, thoughtful commentary on the Hollywood film business. Those unfamiliar with Leonard's prose will be in for a treat. Leonard has crafted some of the best streetwise prose I've come across since reading some of William Gibson's early novels. Leonard has superbly brought to life such interesting characters as mobster Chili Palmer and \\"B\\" movie film producer Harry Zim. Regrettably, I haven't seen the film adaptation of \\"Get Shorty\\", but judging from other Amazon.com reviews, it is undoubtedly well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the fuss about Leonard?","review":"I read this after hearing a lot about Leonard, and how funny and clever his books supposedly are. Well, I tried this one and another (not sure what the other is called anymore, think it's Glitz) and did not find much that was funny or clever in them. In fact, I found both books rather dull and contrived, and think I am probably being generous by giving it two stars. Maybe I am just not a Leonard type of person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun but laboured","review":"Having seen the film, I was hoping for a more snappy book. Get Shorty is a good read, but at times the plot and dialogue drag. If you have the staying power, it's amusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Just Don't Get It","review":"Get Shorty is a dull, dull, dull, dull novel. It is so dull I did not sell my copy to a used paperback bookstore and risk exposing this piece of trash on another person. The lead character, Chili Palmer, has no appeal whatsoever and you frankly don't care about his fate or any of the other characters in the book. The story is contrived and totally uninteresting. Like one of the other reviewers, this was my third Leonard novel and it will be my last. His novels are always portrayed as \\"hilarious\\" and \\"exciting\\". Well, I don't laugh and I don't get tense. How he and his agent have snowed publishers and Hollywood I will never understand. Carl Hiaasen writes rings around this guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"BBBBBBOOOOOOORRRRRRRIIIIIIIIIINNNNNNNGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!","review":"I too am puzzled by the reviews this book got. All of the blurbs on the book say fast moving, lively, and funny. This book was SLOW, BORING and NOT AMUSING.

This really is perhaps the most BORING book I ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elmore Does it again!!","review":"Damn near impossable to top this one.

Elmore Leonard, a contemporary genious, brings us one of his best, Get Shorty is unbelievable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't ignore the book","review":"Okay, you've seen the movie, which is pretty damn good, and Travolta as \\"Chili Palmer\\" is pretty cool, but DON'T IGNORE THE BOOK. Leonard is the master of character and dialogue and an especially keen observer when it comes to greed. Sure, Hollywood is an easy target, but he skewers the movie biz in his oh-so-unique way. If you can erase the film actors from your mind (never an easy task), try to read this book with a fresh eye. It's one delicious ride you won't regret taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good solid crime fiction mixed with black comedy.","review":"Typical Leonard: lots of wierd people interacting in a comedic way with excellent dialog."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can one not like Elmore Leonard?","review":"How can someone not enjoy an Elmore Leonard novel? Its like an old buddysitting at the bar with you telling a wild story or two over some drinks...Leonard is a wonderful writer! Get Shorty was a hell of a read, and quite funny I might add.Read it before seeing the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an advertisement for the book the movie the . . .","review":"Ever get the feeling that you are being sold something without even knowing it? Halfway through Get Shorty, I thought, well, SOMETHING AMAZING MUST BE ABOUT TO HAPPEN, because otherwise, this book is the most mundane, run of the mill paint-by-numbers crime novel ever written by a human or (I suspect) a computer. Ooooh, the Cuban man pronounces the F-word \\"Fock.\\" How insightful! In a sense, I guess Leonard achieves the feat of mirroring in print the superficiality and semi-literacy of modern America. But with Dean Koontz still cranking out the page-burners, I'm not sure we need another reminder of our artistic bankruptcy. My recommendation is Don't Steal This Book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring boring boring!","review":"I couldn't bring myself to finish this book. I just stopped reading it and put it away. Then I rented the video because when I saw John Travolta and Danny Devito played in it, I thought maybe the movie would be better than the book. Well I was disappointed again. I fell asleep watching it. It's the first time I read a book by this author. I hope this is not considered is best yet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring without any true conclusions","review":"This was my first and likely last Elmore Leonard novel. I must have missed something but I didn't find it very suspenseful, there was no mystery, and by the end of the book there didn't appear to be any real conclusion. Chili Palmer was an alright character but come on. A collector working for a loan shark making it as a movie mogul with no experience! We should all be so lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"make another choice","review":"Despite Son Seals talent as a blues player, this Dvd does not reflect it. The shuffles are just OK.

Not likely to make it that far though. We'll see.That's all for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"By way of explanation","review":"While I take the points of the reviewers above, a little context is helpful. The Mahler 3 on this record was a performance intended for radio broadcast. The producers, aware of the scale of the work, told Mitropoulos that the broadcast would end at the appointed time, whether or not the performance was concluded. Feeling that this was artistically brutal, the conductor made cuts to the score that he hoped would allow a full (albeit abridged) performance of the Third. It's quite possible that, with an eye on the clock, he hurried things along somewhat (I haven't heard my LP copy of the K?ln performance in a while for comparison). The first movement is, I agree, a bit of a mess, though bravely played. The finale, that grand walk up to the gates of heaven, is profound and sublime. This should be no one's sole Mahler 3, but it is a unique (and given the place of the work in Mitropoulos' life and death) and valuable document nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questions about each state - not America in general","review":"I didn't like this version very much.

Couldn't give it five stars however, simply because much of the dialog was not very clear. No doubt in my mind, though, due to Javier Bardem's range, that if he makes his way to the States, he'll be big.Interestingly, Javier Bardem playing an honest counter-terrorist cop in this one, will be playing Pablo Escobar in the upcoming Killing Pablo."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dancer Upstairs","review":"Excellent movie! I had seen this movie before and wanted a copy for my personal collection. Many may think story moves too slow...in my opinion, not so. Excellent acting, directing, and story.

It is very boring and it takes forever for the movie to end. Besides, the dancer lives downstairs, not upstairs. Then when the girl is reading the index cards, you could see the spanish words on them...unperfessional. It would have been better if this movie was in Spanish and it never was showed to the US.

It surpasses the novel, which I enjoyed immensely. Its only flaw is that it was filmed in English, even though most of the actors' native tongue is Spanish. Javier Bardem is a gem, and so are the police chief, and Bardem's film subordinates."},{"rating":"1","title":"An odd film really","review":"Why is the film called the dancer upstairs when the ballet teacher is downstairs? Because the revolutionary leader is seen dancing in the video the policeman views. Hence 'the dancer upstairs'. All happy now?Well, that depends on what you feel about a curate's egg. Malkovich is something of a aquired taste too, judging by the special features."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dancer Upstairs.","review":"This film is too long and unnecessarily complicated to deliver a simple message.

Films like \\"Jamon Jamon\\", \\"Los huevos de oro\\" and \\"Before Night Falls\\" are must see movies for his performance. But I have to criticise his English. He speak so bad that some times you don't understand what he is saying.And most of the time I imagine that he make an incredible effort to speak that affect his performance.For the movie that occur in an imaginary place with imaginary people I can say that John Malkovich with this debut promise a great future as a director. The film is real as well as the performances, not like most of the Americans detective's movies.In general it was worth watching but you have to be prepared because is very slow.I only recommend for futures releases that let the people speak their native language and put subtitles, it won't kill anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"I was disappointed by this movie. Although it has Laura Morante and Javier Bardem in it, and their acting is well done, the movie itself lacks so many things it I couldn't wait for it to be over. The film is slow, tedious and somewhat boring. Also, the plot is a bit confused and convoluted. The film fails to draw the viewer in and fails to tie many many things together. Several things are never explained which left me feeling confused and unable to better appreciate this movie. I just didn't like it much."},{"rating":"1","title":"VOO-DOO OR REVOLUTION??","review":"I should have known this movie was in trouble when the credits said 'somewhere in Latin America.' That ambiguous statement is usually reserved for TV cereal productions.The movie runs 133 and if you were to just catch the last five minutes of this flick it would be enough. The story meanders , the dialog is trite and the only reason I stayed until the end, was, I couldn't believe Javier Bardem would be wasted on on a movie which could not make up its' mind; if the Latin American country where this took place was having the makings of a Revolution or a psychotic voo doo happening.John M. has always been spooky to me , he likes those dark and \\"Ha, Ha, bet you cannot figure me out\\" characters in most of his movies. But, if this is his Directorial debut, he has not much to offer his fans.Javier Bardem and his side kick Juan Diego Botto are the only light in a otherwise very dark movie.I give this flick a 21/2 out of 5 mainly for those two actors.ciao ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just Another \\"Merry Christmas\\" Record","review":"The album has its share of happy music (including the first recording of The Waitresses' \\"Christmas Wrapping\\"), and even has it nauseatingly sweet tune (\\"It's a Big Country,\\" a song about a man's widely scattered family).

One, his voice is not the same as before, unlike some other singers, such as Paul Anka, Neil Sedaka, etc, who never really lost their voice. In addition, the arrangement of songs were terrible! When you have a combination of these two deficiencies, what's left to listen to? It is really the worst nostalgic performance I have ever listened.

Also, don't wash these directly under water because water gets into the seams and the shakers get wet and won't shake. Instead, wipe clean with a wet one or some other kind of antibac wipe.Oh and, they love to chew the handle, which is fine except it's this weird waffle design that's hard to clean. When the baby is very young and you clean everything all the time, it's a pain. Once they're older and you accept that babies put all kinds of nasty things in their mouths, you won't be so annoyed.

I had a really clever mouse which has been dodging \\"Mice Cube\\" traps for sometime. It got caught in this. A couple of reasons for 4 stars instead of 5.1. There is no way to tell if there is a mouse inside or not. I had to shake the thing to feel the mouse inside. They should put a clear plastic atleast on one side to easily view.2. The design of the system is as such that if the mouse pushes or gets on top of the trap, it will trip without catching anything.

Didn't get one last night but forgot to pick up the cat food, so they probably ate that instead! I used a small amount (pea sized) of peanut butter and it must be appealing.

We only had one mouse. Problem solved.My only complaint is that I'd prefer that it be made of clear plastic so you can easily tell if the trap has an occupant, but it's a minor complaint.

Also if you choose this one, careful not to let the mice stay inside for too long. Their fur becomes wet and they don't survive for long with wet fur and cold weather. I left my captured mice inside for the night to dry out and then released them 1/4 mile away. Hopefully some of them made it through the night at -5F and no snow.

The directions are clear and concise. I plan to use it every night until all the little squatters have moved on, and then put it away for next time.

I think it's too confined and needs to be twice the width and height. There's barely any room for a mouse to turn around in there, so they don't go in since it's a dead end. Maybe Pocket Mice are smarter than the average mouse. I used peanut butter and sunflower kernels for bait. I moved the trap around too to different places, no luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this garbage.","review":"This mouse trap is complete garbage. I challenge anyone to catch a single mouse in this. The mice were actually skipping this thing, and going for the traps that killed them instead lol. The ONLY way I can see this thing working, ever, is in some kind of old, unused building scenario. Where there is little/no food for the mice, and there are a ton of mice in the building. Then you might catch a really stupid mouse in this. They just don't like it. They just won't go into it. I tried this thing for about 5 months, replacing the bait when necessary. Never caught a single mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product.","review":"Saw a mouse Monday morning. Ordered this trap on Amazon.com Monday afternoon, paying $3.99 for overnight shipping (I'm a prime member). It arrived Tuesday.

When this product arrived, we were shocked as too how small it was. I've seen our resident mouse, and it doesn't look like he can fit into this thing. We bought two of it and placed them both out anyway. Sure enough, we caught nothing, further more, we were scratching our head as to what happened to one of them. It was gone! We thought someone in the family just moved it around and misplaced it. Well, today we decided to dig further and cleaned out our garage. We found one of his hide-outs. He wasn't home, but we found an orange, our dog's brush which is now all chewed up, and yep, one of the mouse traps. It was all chewed up as well and there was a note... It said, \\"Is this all you got?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appealing to my mouse, apparently","review":"Seems so simple and effective in design, but my mouse has clearly gone near it but had no interest in crawling inside for some tasty peanut butter.

Shove'em in and pull'em out. The problem is, the plastic insert is just too short to be grabbed easily with your fingers.And that's not even the worst part. They just don't block out the noise. All other earplugs are made of some kind of a sound deafening materials, similar to memory foam. Not these. These earplugs are made of very thin rubber (no other sound deafening material is used) with that short plastic rod inside.

It was very good though. This time, they have matured and sound incredible.Luckily for me, first impressions don't last. When I first listened to the CD, my expectation was for another \\"American Made\\" which had Simple Plan/Good Charlotte-like choruses. I wasn't as impressed as I hade hoped for a while, then got to Picture Frame and I loved the rest of the songs. After listening to the CD again, while trying to forget their first album, I realized how amazing it is.The guitars on New Game are unbelievable. They're also really good on Without You, Take Off, and Asleep on Broken Teeth. I think the best song though is After School Special. The only downside I could find was Clean 1145 and the hidden track. I guess they were just weird experiments in song types.If you like rock in general at all, get Wakefield (both cds)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a good band gone bad...","review":"I agree with the others out there who loved Wakefield's first album, \\"American Made\\". I think it was very well done and though it isn't anything spectacular or a new sound they were very genuine and just sounded like they loved what they did. Their music was infectious and they had a great sound. I too was excited to get part two of this with \\"Which Side Are You On\\" but was sorely dissappointed in the album. I barely made it through it once because its so bland. Don't get me wrong, I still love Wakefield, but I hope that they get their old sound back. If you love Wakefield, you may be dissappointed by this, but choose as you will, just be careful not to pot too much hope in this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice.

This is not a masterpiece but these guys really have their own touch!If you like bands like SR-71, Lit, Yellowcard, New Found Glory, The All-American Rejects and this type of music you will like this cd either. Mix these pop-alternative-punk-rock bands in one and you'll get Wakefield but with bit of their own style. Wakefield use much variety on this cd so you can even hear some 'Lostprophets style' vocals here as well as some emo elements.The whole cd is quite melodic and easy-listening and it's obviously worth buying it if you're in this kind of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Rather Puke","review":"Review by Tyler Wagnon:Here is a quote from the press release on this album, \\"The first single, \\"C'mon Baby\\" is catchy as all get-out, and features time-signature shifts between the chorus and the verses. \\"The chorus is whatever tempo it is,\\" Ryan says, \\"and the verses are a whole different tempo - it was kind of a 'lets see if we can do this' type thing.\\"HAHAHA. You changed tempos! Wow! They say it like it's a hard concept to grasp. Not to mention it is still in a very simple verse-chorus-verse songwriting style and in the middle of the songs there is some dude RAPPING. Hahaha.

Everyone praises Glass for being prolific but who couldn't be when he really hasn't written much music; he has only written an hour or so of music and stretched it out for an entire career by repeating small bits of it for hours.
