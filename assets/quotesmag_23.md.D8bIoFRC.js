Ochs had a few highs, like the superb \\"I Ain't Marching Anymore,\\" but none of his songs had the initial popularity, staying power or cultural relevance that Dylan's did and continue to have. The Disc is valuable in highlighting the decline of the man-- the final songs on the third disc show how far into the bottle Ochs had climbed.

Maybe my expectations were unreasonable but I thought there just wasn't a lot to this software. After reviewing it for 15 minutes with my wife there was nothing left to do with it but shelf it.I thought it would be useful to track shots etc. but we were given a booklet (looks like a passport sort of) to record shots etc. As far as tracking milestones, maybe I will use this software but I don't see myself digging out the CD to update a date in the milestones list. Couldn't this application fit on a hard drive? Is the disk required to prevent piracy?I did not like the fact that I had to enter the same information more than once (birthday, name, etc.)I imagine there is a subscription service Internet site that would have been a better buy for me, I would rather have a web based information resource for the progress of my baby than this small database of dates with a semi-cute front end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great start for the new parents!","review":"This software helps to organize your babies first everything.

Being it was designed for older windows operating system the requirements to run are very low compared to today's high end computers.I recommend this for any new parents or even as a gift at a baby shower.

No? Well, then you should probably not buy this paper. The watermark is tacky and unprofessional, especially if you want it to look great down to the details. (Which is the whole point if you're spending this much on paper.)Rather than looking like premium paper, it looks like a discounted/sponsored version of their paper with an advertisement for the company. I wonder when they will start putting Google Ads at the bottom of their paper. (NOTE TO SOUTHWORTH: That was a joke. Please do not actually do that.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit over priced","review":"I paid $25 for this CD over a year ago. I've used it a few times.

This is pleasant late Victorian British music played pleasantly. Cowen was one of those gifted children who played piano and composed at a young age. Ho wrote six symphonies, numerous oratorios, operas and operettas, chamber music, but a lot of his music has not survived. The sixth symphony has no surprises. It is tuneful and easy on the ear. The first movement is especially pleasing.Coleridge-Taylor is better represented on disc. This symphony is a student work, and while it gives some insight into his better known scores, it remains a student work.I personally enjoy listening to neglected British composers, and make a habit of collecting these neglected works when they appear on disc, and for those with a similar disposition, there is some light, but charming music here to be enjoyed. Good, closely recorded orchestra sound, which suits this music. It probably rates four and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I have enjoyed the Lounge Lizards for years, but these numbers are musically dull and without much wit.

My son loved the patterns, but despite my washing them with fabric softener and dryer softener sheets, he still complains \\"these sheets are scrtachy and hurt me\\". Maybe its the printing. They've been washed about 5 times now and I've taken to using a white jersey pillowcase to protect his face. I hope OK upgrades their thread count, but from now on, I'm NEVER buying percale. My son is three and doesn't normally complain about fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable value","review":"Although my son loves the print on these sheets, the fitted sheet is lacking elastic. He's sensitive to fabrics, but hasn't complained about them feeling scratchy at all, even though they are rougher than I had hoped. I was disappointed in the actual color of the sheets; they aren't bright white at all. They're kind of a yellowed white that makes them look kind of old. All things considered, I was pretty disappointed in the quality for the price. The only redeeming factor is that the print has a wonderful variety of brightly colored construction vehicles, as opposed to the few different trucks featured on other sets I looked at."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit description","review":"The description of these sheets showed a 210 count cotton fabric and what we received was a 180 count. The picture showed a blue border on the pillowcase and top sheet.....the ones we received had a white border. The sheets were very flimsy and had obviously been repackaged. We ordered another set of Olive Kids sheets in another pattern at the same time and are very pleased with them. Can't imagine why these were so different."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves this bedding!","review":"I had to search to find the perfect truck/tractor sheets for my 27month old son.

They were helpful to facilitate transitioning him to his 'big boy bed' and he loves to point out each vehicle and tell anyone who will listen what it is. It is not easy finding toddler sheets with fun prints for queen size beds, so I was happy to find these. I think the quality and softness is perfectly fine~no complaints.

DOO IT !!!","review":"Can't argue with any of the good reviews on this CD, BUT . . . in a more experimental vein (but still TOTALLY accessible) is the deeply funky \\"Shout It Out!\\". Much less a pop-ish album, it's an early career musical stretching of serious musical muscle that foreshadowed her entree into pop success like \\"Forget Me Nots\\". The double Album \\"Prelusion/Before The Dawn\\" contains her first two records. Both fine jazz recordings. The first more \\"straight\\" or \\"post bop\\" flavor, the second more \\"fusion\\" flavored (this is where the Hancock super-funk comparisons are justifiably born). Highly recommended. But the bridge between Rushen's pure aesthetic aspiration and her excellently crafted commercial endevors is \\"Shout It Out!\\" and it NEEDS to be heard!Hello, Wounded Bird Records?

Like another reviewer stated, there are some loose ends in the story but it's my feeling that Mr. Petterson intends to leave those ends hanging in order to let the reader put their own personal feelings into play as to the how's and why's of what he's trying to tell us.I highly recommend this book and although it sometimes seems to drag at the beginning, stick with it, savor every word because you will not be disappointed when you finish this gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed This Time","review":"Having just completed, \\"Out Stealing Horses,\\" I was really anxious to get my hands on this one.

But polyglot Langton is no idiot - just unlucky to get caught between several mighty antagonists, striving to save a country and make a huge profit as well. The stake is the contract to supply large areas of Russia with essentials. Of course, Langton the interpreter and chair of the conference stands deep in the mud, and of course the situation does not get any easier for his affair with the beautiful, but elusive expert Martha. The picture of men representing different kinds of power - financial, political and the Japanese Mafia - is believable and chilling. One feels the strain on Langton when he muddles through as well as he can, playing chess on an unstable board and waiting for the earthquake. Another thriller - quite Western, and charming in its exploration of Japanese culture and the mystery of languages. Worth reading for that - and the plot is not bad, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough is Enough","review":"Ric's book is an example of what effect Christians should have on their community if they are effectively marshalled and co ordianted by a leader.

This book has engaged me to rethink my ideas of sexuality relating to culture allowing an alternative discourse to be entered not only into my head but also adds awareness to a larger social field. A must read for any cultural theorist, or anyone interested in condoms, American sexuality and society.

The only constants running throughout the film are the devotion of the two lovers and the harrowing depiction of the hell of addiction. This is definitely not a film for everyone, but I was consistently entertained by the confident brazenness of writer/director Kankuro Kudo and his talented cast. There are episodes of head-scratching weirdness, laugh out loud moments, and even some sequences that are oddly moving.

But you can't reconnect the motor without first rotating the worm gear shaft so that its groove lines up with the thumbscrew on the drive shaft.

You don't have to worry about getting eye infections, it REALLY gets your lenses clean, and hey, so what if you have to buy a separate cleaner.

I'm getting over one right now after using one of them. It's no walk in the park either. And besides, what's better than peroxide to clean anything? Well, bleach and a bottle of Coke rank up there pretty high too but neither of those work with contacts.

It starts of good(Empire vs. Empire, tradegy and all that), and it gets your attention. However, the story just dies from there.The story fails to keep you interested with all that political rabbling.The gameplay was interesting at first, but like the story, it gets dull. You run around for most of the game with a gambit system that requires very little action on your behalf. It is very easy to take advantage of the system and once you do it, it gets boring. Even if you don't it still is boring.Story and gameplay make a RPG, and Square Enix failed miserably. The scores would be lower if it did not have the Final Fantasy name. It is beautiful and nice to look at, but that does not make a RPG."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was awful.","review":"I hated this game. I grew up watching my older brother playing final fantasy games and I loved watching it. I finally got a ps2 and started playing them for myself and loved them. This one I got for christmas last year and .... well... it's a year later and I still can't stand to play it. I hate the fighting style. I didn't CARE about any of the characters and didn't really get intrigued by the story line. I gave it 5 hours before switching to Mortal Kombat just so that I could have a character I could REALLY control. This game sent me looking for my old sega! My roomate tried made it about 16 hours into the game before giving up. I couldn't even watch him play it I was so bored.The graphics were great. That's the only good thing this game has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I bought this game just over 6 months ago, and although I find it may not be a game to play over and over again, it is definitely a must buy. It is a very lengthy game that can keep you occupied for hours. This is the first Final Fantasy game that I have purchased, but I am looking forward to purchasing more Final Fantasy games. It's an extremely fun game, and like I said before, it will keep you occupied for hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"any easy victory","review":"The first boss actually more of a sub bosses is ridiuculous easy.

The graphics are not as good as in Final Fantasy X or X-2. The story plotline is easy to understand but it's so adult like. The battle system is kind of hard but a lot of fun. It takes forever to level up in this game. The overall hardness in the game is 3 out 5 stars for me anyway. That is not why I rated the game 2 stars though. The reason the fun is 3 stars and the overall game is 2 stars is because the graphics are not as good as X or X-2. The gameplay gets pretty boring after a while. And that the story is so boring. The plus sides of the game is that at least the story is easy to understad. The overall gameplay is good(exept for the battle system). And that all the cool abilitis you can get. That is basicely it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Final Fantasy yet","review":"Do not buy this game.i got it for christmas.i have always been a fan of final fantasy. especially the unique gameplay.in this game, when you phight, you move around, and can only attack enemies NEAR YOU! and it takes like 30 seconds to attack!and the citites are so BIG! and there are barely any save points! you have to play for like and hour before saving once!at least i gave this game some what of a chance. weak plot too. frustrating when you equip magic and weapons.if you like classic final fantasy gameplay i recomend:[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most underappreciated Final fantasy","review":"This one of my favorite game of all time, there so much thing to do, I got this game like a couple of years ago and it no longer work, but the amount if hours I spend was the most I spent in any video game. Hours of adventure and a good story, although the charecter are goid but, I felt that peneli and vaan could have been improve but overall a awesome game"},{"rating":"1","title":"To The Point","review":"Battle system is fluid and engaging (similar to FFXI), and the overall looks of the game are spectacular. However, anyone who says this game's storyline has depth, has never progressed past a third grade reading level (or played FF VII or VIII). Character development is nonexistent, so you gain no attachment to them through understanding, nor do you have any vested interest in finding out what happens to them. There are no personal relationships developed between ANY characters, and the plot itself is so one-dimensional that I found the thing, despite its great looks, a complete bore. I almost didn't finish it. There's no sense of climax and the characters are 100% static. They never change.What could be worse? Well, the game is also ridiculously easy. And I mean ridiculous. The end fights in VII and VIII, those were pretty tough, even WITH the best weapons. The end fight in XII, just select fight, and then heal occasionally and you'll be fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm not a fan of this change","review":"Square-Enix is very adventurous with its flagship franchise, but I just couldn't get into this one. The story seemed a bit overly-political and I didn't really like any of the characters. The battle system is convoluted and boils down to letting everyone do what they wish on auto-pilot or proceeding through a battle moment-by-moment micromanaging every movement. I really tried to get into this game, but no dice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Cons: Flat characters, boring story, boring battle mechanics (I have played several MMORPGs these mechanics do NOT mimic those of an MMORPG.)Pros: Open world, All skills/abilities/equipment available for all characters"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and dissapointing.","review":"I'll go against the majority and say that this is my least favorite Final Fantasy. First, the storyline is boring, the characters are not pursuing a major antagonist and don't have a clear goal. They travel from place-to-place with their goals constantly changing. This seems to result in repetitivness and makes the story plain boring. The characters for the most part seem extremely shallow, they are very simple and predictable and there seems to be nothing new to learn about them. Balthier and Fran, 2 characters in the party are a little more interesting but their stories are not well explored. The gameplay is reptitive, the license bored system becomes frustrating after a while. In order to learn new abilities you're required to get more and more license points yet defeating monsters still gives you 1 or 2 points even as the game goes on. Its hard to describe, but the game simply lacks substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game! A must buy for final fantasy fans\`","review":"Everything about this game was great. I've played most of the games in the final fantasy series and this game was one of my favorite. The storyline was great and was interesting. The new battle setup was a great addition and I hope they keep it for further final fantasy installments. Bottom line is that I loved this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Fantasy delivers again","review":"FFXII rises above my expectations as yet another great game from the FF line. The gameplay is great and the new battle system gives FF fans a new and exciting way to explore the world of Ivalice. Although the cinematics were not extraordinary (games as far back as FF7 had better quality cut scenes) the story more than makes up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The start of Final Fantasy's downward spiral","review":"I honestly don't know how anyone can like this game. Then again, I don't understand how people can hate Final Fantasy 8 & 10 when I though both were amazing. I gave this game my best shot but I just couldn't do it. The battle system is just awful, the storyline is terrible and lacking everything that normally hooks you to a Final Fantasy, and I just can't bring myself to like any of the characters (well that's not necessarily true, Fran is pretty cool). Square-Enix just messed up with this game. They're starting to neglect the things that make these games so good, which are: amazing plotline, deep/connectable characters, and challenging yet fun battles. I hope they will be able to figure out a way to bring the magic back to their games because I just finished Final Fantasy 13, and while it is million times better than 12, I definitely wouldn't rate it my favorite on my Final Fantasy, or just game in general, list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Applause To Square-Enix","review":"I must say, after hearing so many bad reviews about this game (before it even came out of course) i was tempted to not even buy it. Boy am i glad i changed my mind. The problem with people is that they want the SAME continuous thing in every game. They complain about the battle system because its not what they are \\"used to\\". Get over it people, this battle system is simply awesome! If you want the same battle system as FF7 and FF10 and FF9...then hey..go play those games again and again. Me, I prefer something new and unique with each FF game.Basically, don't listen to reveiws about the battle system, because its actually very fun and easy to get used to. Some people just cant accept changes.

I will probably buy more games of tthis type"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"Ok, at the beginning I wasn't sure at all if I liked this game or not, but once I figured out the new gambit system it made things a lot easier. The cinematics were really good but I think the story line was a bit confusing and hard to follow what the hell was going on. That was really the only thing I didnt like about it, oh and also the quickenings got really repetitive after a while I was there was a skip for that as well. But overall without the strategy guide It took me a great deal of time to finish the game which I really like in final fantasty games, so I recommend the game to all FF fans and newcomers as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this game!","review":"My husband and I hadn't played Final Fantasy games since the old Nintendo versions, but we bought this when we bought a PlayStation 2 for our son for Xmas. Wow! Have these games changed! They were fun before, but now they are visually amazing too and still incredibly fun! We have stressful lives, but for a few minutes (which can easily turn into a few hours) a day we can travel to distant lands, gather treasure, fight monsters successfully, spend money at all sorts of shops, and quest to save the world -- all without getting out of your PJs! Where else can you do all this over a period of several months for 50 bucks?? We'll definitely buy FF 11 when we are done with this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVED IT","review":"I have heard over and over that people found this game to be too hard to play. In reality, it was the easiest, more enjoyable game I have ever played. The battle system was wonderful. You can avoid fighting if you want to, you can change the number of people who do fight (and who appear on your screen), and you can have a sort of \\"mini-army\\" where you can automatically have your party members fight for you as you walk around.It was EXTREMELY realistic, and I loved it. I never felt like anything was wasted or annoying (except the chocobo thing)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst in series","review":"Except for the gambit system which is the best thing about the game this one's a dud folks. Graphics are dull and blurry even though its true 3D, FF X2 looks much better. I can't say much for the story which comes of dull and depressing that complements the awful textures you see in the game. The level up system is a joke. Everyone has the same skill trees so you end up with a group of communists that can do it all. Then you have the hunts. You trudge virtual miles to get a weak reward.

When this game came out. Every one said this was trash. I didn't believe them. I was a FF freak. I bought this, and wow. They were right. The battle system is a joke. I can go to a Buffet and set my characters up to fight. and come back and i would have won the fight. The graphics are crappy then FF X. In FF 12 they look like plastic people. THE CG looked down graded. The voice acting was trash, I hated Vash voice and the other characters. I think they rushed this game to fast.the character look like a little boy toy model.This game was badly design.I think they rushed this game to make money from people no matter how bad this game is. they knew FF fans would buy this.

Music was pretty horrible most of the time and the character depth was none, and so few cut-scenes.Seems like Square is doing all those games that are so focused on graphics and battle mode. What i like most about FF is the characters, music and storyline and this game failed in all of them, i think.There was definetly fun parts to this game, but there wasnt exension to it, you found cool places and some things happened and then all of a sudden it was all over and you had 400 hours left only to fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Disappointment","review":"I played final fantasy X and found it to be the best game I ever played but this game came very short of expectations. Final Fantasy X had an excellent story and X-2 was fun although not strong material.In this game you might as well take time to do the side games. Going through the game you long deseperately for the twist that never happens. It is like a book that goes on and on where the ending disappoints a lot. The character Vaan is one useless main character who works like a side one. The point of Final Fantasy is the story and gameplay. The story is pointless.The gameplay is better than X though. The live fighting mode gets rid of the most annoying part of X and all Final Fantasy Games. The Weapon system is good although I didn't like the license thing better than sphere system of X. The summons are pointless however. This game could have been great if Basch was the main character and the twists were left for later in the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Final fantasy 12... by george lucas?","review":"While I enjoy the fact that FF12 has a new system... No sappy love story, better voice overs, and a more engaging battle system. The plot so far, granted Im not finished, has been lifted off star wars it seems...

I could never see the attraction of Gary Glitter even in his 20's he looked fifty and believe it or not he was a mega star in Europe and the women loved him. This album is great if you remember the songs originally and want to be part of a nostalgia trip. Like it or not most of these songs represent the glam scene in the UK 72-74, the songs weren't even good then but Gary Glitter was never meant to be taken seriously, it was a fun period in pop music,which was camp and over the top. Don't analize them enjoy them for what they are, great party songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ROCK AND ROLL","review":"Gary Glitter is not always recognised by his name yet almost every one has tapped their toes to his music.

You will soon find out that Cadex wants a small fortune for parts, that is if you can find anyone locally to repair it.

I have other nailers that don't require tools & several that never have jammed. This has finally gotten to the point where I am prepared to toss it & go for the less expensive, more reliable & more easily serviced Bostich.Judging from all the other writeups & reviews I would say my experience is unique.

After hours of trying to install the drivers, both the one included on the CD and the update on the Microtek website, I finally gave up. The computer would recognize the scanner if I was using Photoshop but not if I was using it as a stand alone. Big problem since the Digital Ice feature (the reason I bought this scanner) only works through their proprietary software. I compared the scans in Photoshop with others I had done with an inexpensive HP All-In-One. There was basically no difference. Not wanting the headache of endless time spent with tech support, I packed it up and sent it back.

This failure is after numerous contacts with their tech support and repeated downloads of drivers, but for some reason it will not load the \\"scanner finder\\" - obviously a critical component.

Having any sort of padding makes bike riding much more comfortable no matter what type of bike it is, but I don't know that the gel padding in these makes a huge difference over regular non-gel padding. I did find the shorts themselves to be very comfortable though. They are much lighter weight than another pair that I have, and also less constricting (no the other ones are not too small).

Annie Dillard once again captured every exciting aspect of writing in one of her works, and she managed to contain it all in little over a hundred pages.Dillard is one of the best American writers of our time, and this book proves it. It is worth ten times what you will pay for it.If you have any passion for writing, you will love this book.If you would like to get inside the head of the great Annie Dillard, you will love this book.Buy it, check it out, borrow it; read it somehow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry is abundant, sincerity is lacking","review":"My title just about sums it up. Annie Dillard uses very cute metaphors and word choice to convey her relationship with writing, but the whole thing fails to ring true. Her claims that she hates writing are contradicted by her sickeningly happy, cloud-borne tone; her metaphors are interesting but fall apart when examined as actual metaphors for writing.This work seems like an author with a contract trying to fill up 100 pages with as many ways to state \\"Writing is hard\\" as she can. She succeeds in fooling many of her readers into thinking she is saying something interesting or sincere. But I read her pretentious pontifications and I'm not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gertrude and Virginia Write a How-To Book?","review":"Wonder what it would be like if Virginia Woolf and Gertrude Stein collaborated on \\"how to\\" book for writers? Well,wonder no more...meet Annie Dillard and her book \\"The Writing Life.\\" While this book is supposed to inspire writers and offer useful tips on becoming writers, it instead drowns in overly-smug images, metaphors and useless information--like a \\"stream of consciousness\\" textbook! After reading it, I got the feeling that one sometimes gets when one doesn't understand a modern painting--\\"Well, then YOU must be too stupid!\\" Picking out the pearls of wisdom on writing through the flowery prose isn't worth the effort.

I had hoped to glean some rare look into how to write skilfully from Dillard's writing. This 111 page book took me three days to read (normally I would have finished in 30 minutes) however I wanted to absorb each gem of knowledge, and so kept reading intently, taking breaks hoping it would get better the next time I picked it up. Most writers seem to spend an inordinate amount of time doing anything to avoid writing Dillard seemed to spend most of her time avoiding writing about writing, and if that was not annoying enough - I wanted the good stuff - the time she did spend on the writing life was so depressing that if I was reading this book in hopes of becoming a writer I'd have probably gone a slit my wrists.

I agree to most of the theories, especially the chapter on spending. If most people lived \\"below their means\\" as this book recommends, they wouldn't be forced to get that paycheck doing something they don't truly love for a living. Happiness is found, in part, by doing something you enjoy for a living. However, the chapters near the end regarding food and housing, are a bit on the radical side to me.

My problem is the author's self-righteous tone; although she begins, promisingly enough, by saying that \\"simple living has nothing to do with your level of income,\\" she soon makes it clear that she will brook no slaggards, and that the leaner your existence, the better your person. Amy Dacyczn, the founder of the Tightwad Gazette, is pretty hardcore on the subject of paring down to the basics, yet her books are written with good humor and an awareness that she is, indeed, on the fanatical fringe; she is much more tolerant of the fact that people march to different drummers, something Luhr preaches but does not seem to really believe. If you enjoy being lectured, Simple Living will give you several days' worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book, borrow it","review":"The author spends too many pages chatting and not enough giving solid advice.

It was written for you and will, no doubt, help you simplify your life tremendously. However--if you are an average american--perhaps with a college degree and a family and a car that is more than three years old--think twice before buying this book. It has a lot of practical advice--don't get me wrong--but it is so common sense that most of you already do these things.

I plan to keep it and reread parts every so often. I especially enjoyed the section on holidays. However, the whole first part of the book relates to finances and investing using examples that worked in the 90's but could never work today in this market and economy.

'Honest Work' and 'Pretending to Care' are amazing both musically and lyrically. 'Something to Fall Back On' has a similar theme to 'Pretending to Care', but is more pop-py.'Johnee Jingo' is a strong song -- preachy, and yet appealing. 'Hodja' and 'Mighty Love' are just fun, fun, fun.Some of the other tracks like 'Blue Orpheus' or 'Lost Horizon' may or may not grab you. But six of the tracks are amazing.The only thing I don't like about this album is that a couple of the songs -- 'Miracle in the Bazaar' and 'Lockjar' are so different from you other songs that it detracts from the \\"album\\" feel. Still, all sounds on the album come from Todd layering his voice, so that's a unifying aspect.Still, the good songs are some of the best songs ever written. Get this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminder of when music was fun!","review":"Todd Rundgren seems like one of those guys who, like Prince or Billy Corgan, started out as a kid making eclectic, weird, wonderful music in his basement or something. It's almost like Rundgren is the perfect blend of scientist and engineer, or a master cinematographer who directs his own movie; he's creative and technically phenomenal at the same time.This album has that sort of duality in spades. Beautiful songs like \\"Pretending To Care\\" could have been recorded with standard instrumentation (and indeed, there's a pretty good cover by Jennifer Warnes on her \\"The Hunter\\" album), but Rundgren seems almost bored by the idea; he seems to be making music for himself.Though that can lead to some odd or indulgent passages, this album proves that such creativity is infinitely more exciting than the by-the-numbers production of most of today's albums. Listening to this album again (I had lost my vinyl copy years ago) reminded me of a time when music was a lot more fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME EVER!!!!","review":"I bought this game for my eight year old cousin, but the entire extended family (three generations) ended up playing it for hours, and I'm going to have to buy one for myself now!

This book does have few useful tips, but it gets lost in all the hype. It is primarily about newsletter and e-mail advertising. It also goes into the history of the Ziff-Davis company.Basically, if you can find this book for around $10-$15, it may be worth a purchase, but anything above that is a rip off.

This is an absolutely essential collection, even if you already have some of the songs in your collection. The selection, sequencing and particularly the sound are superb. Also worth noting, most of these are in stereo. Back when this was released, in 1988, stereo was still the preferable format, unlike the current trend which is to issue the way the original singles were released, i.e., mono. Regardless of that, I'll take the stereo versions anyday, even with the extreme separation.This is a classic collection of 60s soul.

Having been a pastor for over 25 years I can only say I wish I had read this book sooner. What is significant about this book is that it lays out a clear vision of what the mission of the church should be. The book offers a number of excellent ideas though it is not so much a handbook on how to do ministry as it is a vision of what the church should be about. If I were to give a young pastor starting out in the ministry only one book, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heard great things...","review":"I've heard great things about the book.

Ok, some of the short patter may be a bit dated and insensitive, but the overall performance is one for the ages, with Sinatra being in excellent voice. My biggest regret is that I wasn't there. Oh, and the fact that this DVD is out of print and going for ripoff prices on the used market.

Only on the later efforts Falling Into You and Let's Talk About Love did she get better in assembling albums and getting them right.

I had to go out and buy my own - she was phenominal. Her appealing, powerhouse of a voice make these beautiful, emotional ballads sensational. My favorite song on Celine Dion would have to be \\"Nothing Broken But My Heart\\" right before \\"If You Asked Me To.\\" Both of these songs sound really beautiful with the kind of music that was out during the early '90s. I also strongly like the Peabo Bryson duet, \\"Beauty and The Beast\\" and the gospel/dance song \\" Love Can Move Mountains\\". All of the other songs are beautiful classics along with my favorites.

I got this album, her SECOND English-language recording (her first was Unison), the day after my birthday (January 9). This is Celine at some of her best, more old-school than the presumably modern likes of Let's Talk About Love (which rocked the house too). Every single track on the album is worth listening to many times over. On some of them you're likely to be moved to tears even if you think you cannot cry.

(And as a side note, the version on this soundtrack is the full-length version, not the much shorter radio edit.)There isn't a bad band or a bad song on here, but I think the best part is that it is such a perfect representation of the mood and music that was prevalent in the early 90's. And although I dislike the classification as the Pumpkins as grunge, this is a great introduction and overview of the genre. Two other bands that helped shape the grunge movement, Hole and Nirvana, are absent, but I don't think that the soundtrack would be any better for their presence.Skip the film if you wish, but this is an essential album for anyone who grew up in this time period (especially if you hail from Seattle), and a good bet for any rock fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album ever!","review":"Every song fits in perfectly, how anyone can give this album less then 5 stars is amazing!Comning from a big Pearl Jam fan, that have heard all their music, I must still say that both these songs are two of their best!

Thank heavens that Amazon allowed all the songs to be previewed first. This album was intended to be a gift, for someone who is not familiar with the \\"Grandma Got Run Over\\" or the \\"Hippopotamus\\" song.

More unusual numbers include I saw Daddy Kissing Santa Claus and Santa Claus & His Old Lady. Make sure the kids aren't around when you play that one.

I especially like I Want a Hippopotamus - that's a great novelty song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wacky family fun","review":"My family used to own this CD when our adult sons were younger. Then we moved and it got lost somehow. I had to buy another one because now I have an 8 year old. Our family tradition for many years has been to drive around on December 23 with homemade construction paper awards and present them to homeowners whose Christmas lights deserve an award. Playing Dr. Demento's wacky Christmas tunes as we drive around is an essential ingredient. It's like a Greatest Hits of silly Christmas songs, and appropriate for the whole family."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Cure for Christmas Commercialism...hilarious too!","review":"Laughter cures stress, and the holiday season is probably the most stressful time of year. So a collection of side-splitting songs, about Christmas yet, is a great way to laugh at and with holiday spirits old and new. Dr. Demento gathers all the greats here: songs mocking the commercialism associated with Christmas (Allen Sherman's \\"12 Days of Christmas,\\" Tom Lehrer's \\"Christmas Carol,\\")plus funny holiday ditties from Elmo & Patsy, Three Stooges, Spike Jones and others. Then there's \\"Green Christmas,\\" Stan Freberg's retelling of Dickens' \\"Christmas Carol\\" from an advertsing perspective. It is a golden smackdown of the holiday advertising ethos he helped create and destroy from the inside. The album makes me miss not only Christmases past, but radio past and the classic Dr.Demento radio show I enjoyed in my youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas CD","review":"I bought this cd to go along with the book \\"I want a hippopotamus for Christmas\\".

They also feel really cheap, but strangely they were not cheap. Granted, he has pulled them back a few times in the last week and he has done the typical one year old banging, but what kid doesn't do this to toys, and what kind of company doesn't make toys to withstand this type of playing. I'd say if your kid is past the banging, abusing toys phase and you have only hard wood floors in your home, then these are the cars for you, but if not check out K's cars. He also got those for Christmas, and those are much better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"This CD is one of the best all-round Verdi opera records of our time, made by the strong Metropolitan forces, the old-timer Verdi expert James Levine and soloists as good as Ferruccio Furlanetto, Michael Sylvester, Vladimir Chernov and Metropolitan Verdi heroine Aprille Millo. There are several excellent Don Carlo CDs, and therefore it is not an easy task to choose, but if you really like the sometime agressive, sometime beautiful orchestra sound, the dark bass of Furlanetto, or perfect record quality, then this is the version you are looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Collection","review":"Charles' masterful sides for ABC, Atlantic, and CBS helped change the face of popular music and this CD goes a long way towards proving the case convincingly: \\"Georgia On My Mind,\\" \\"America The Beautiful,\\" \\"Born To Lose,\\" \\"Hit The Road, Jack,\\" \\"What'd I Say,\\" \\"One Mint Julep,\\" have influenced most every musician alive. \\"Anthology\\" leaves the listener hungry for more from Charles' legendary \\"Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music\\" CD, but fortunately, Rhino has released that (with bonus tracks) as well. \\"Anthology\\" is the most economical, all-inclusive collection of the output of one of the most important artists of the 20th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Great Stuff But...","review":"will there ever be a true anthology of Ray Charles music? The man was so prolific and merged and melded and blended and crossed so many boundaries. (Ever hear of \\"I'm Moving On\\", probably his earliest \\"country\\" tune written by country legend Hank Snow?) This package is probably the best of the compilations and for me with \\"Busted\\" and the best \\"America the Beautiful\\" rendition I know of, it's enough. But consider it does not include \\"This Little Girl of Mine\\", \\"The Night Time is the Right Time\\" (later covered by Creedence Clearwater Revival), \\"Drown in My Own Tears\\", \\"You Don't Know Me\\". Those are not just \\"filler\\" songs but songs whose mention conjure up this great artist's name. Still for the money this is a very good compilation and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Facinating but uneven","review":"At its best, this Ray Charles retrospective has some of the best stuff you're likely to hear. Listen to such classics as Hit the Road Jack, Let's Go Get Stoned, Unchain My Heart, Don't Set Me Free, I Don't Need No Doctor, Hallelujah I Love Her So, Busted, One Mint Julep, I Got a Woman, You Are My Sunshine (thankfully not delivered in the stupid traditional fashion), America the Beautiful and, of course, What'd I Say. This brings out why Ray has been dubbed \\"Genius\\".My only problem is that sometimes this collection will lapse into SAP. Songs such as Georgia On My Mind, Crying Time, Cry, Here We Go Again and Born to Lose are all pure, unadaultered SAP. I am sorry. And his cover of Eleanor Rigby is ...good, loads better than Aretha's anyway, but you're better off with the original.But the soul outweighs the sap, and Ray was a true genius at his best.

My textile-mad friend who is a spinner and knitter was more interested in this aspect. I enjoyed seeing how the scientists deduced the origin of these mummies, not just from textiles but from historical documents, the records in ancient cities in the area and carbon dating, paths of migration - they certainly have to know a lot in order to develop the understanding of these ancient people. For me, it is interesting that the ancestors of the Scots were also the ancestors of these mummies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A ten star book! Thought-provoking and beautiful.","review":"These mummies, although almost 4,000 years old, are almost as alive as they once were in the mighty vastness of China's ancient deserts. Anglo faces in an oriental land, makers of colorful and intricate wool clothing (AND Tartan Plaids!), people who knew the art of mummifying with sand, wood and salt to a degree even greater than the Egyptians -- this book gives a lavish presentation of a newly unearthed and fascinating mystery. Makes me want to hop the next plane/Land Rover/camel to this ancient and inhospitable land to view the beauty and mystery given up so recently by the desert sands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good if you're interested in textiles","review":"If you are purely interested in the lives, origins and other facts on the mummies you will be disappointed and find yourself doing a lot of skim reading. Barber is a textiles expert and this is the main focus of the book. If you are interested in how the mummies lived I would rate this book a 2, if you are interested in what they wore and how it was made and how this relates to their origins then it's probably a 4 - some nice photos though...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating from beginning to end","review":"Whether you're interested in history, anthropology, geography, genetics, textiles,or the general human condition, there's something here for you.

It's very rare that a decent archaeological book is readable to the masses, that I don't have to set down in fatigue.It's a nice break to look at that area in the way of textiles instead of who invented war chariots and who was fighting who, I prefer information on daily lives, even if it is a guestimate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"It is beutiful to look at, but it contains very little actual information and lots of uninformed, poorly thought out speculation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent,well-written summary,prehistory of western Asia","review":"This nicely written book by Barber starts by analysing the fabrics associated with mummies found in the Tarim basin of western China. In providing the context of her research, she gives one of the clearest outlines of the prehistory of the western Asia and eastern Europe over the last ten thousand years.

He was greedy and selfish and a cold blooded killer. He killed his brother-in-law ferchrissakes! All the family had left to bury was a hand. He kept killing off more and more and taking over their business ventures. He really got off easy in the end but then F'd it all up in an Arizona drug ring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sammy da Bull","review":"This was an interesting read. Read it for an Orgnized Crime class. There were some funny incidents this \\"former\\" mobster was involved in. Peter Maas did this book some justice, by laying the text in layman's term. Easily understood, the life of this Bensonhurst raised Sammy Gravano...Who was the underboss tht turned his back on John Gotti, the underboss who got away with 19 murders and the \\"former\\" underboss who just got arrested on drug charges in Arizona..Makes you wonder, will the Government ever stop making deals with the devils?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Live the Bull","review":"Fantastic book written by Peter Maas. I think I read this book once a year and it is always a great read.Peter Maas delievers a story that flows superbly and makes the reader feel like they are there on the streets of NY with Sammy. A must read for anyone.I am waiting in eager anticipation to see Joe Pesci play the roll of Sammy the Bull in the next best, if not better, mob film since Goodfellas."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ranks right up there with \\"The Company She Keeps\\"","review":"This book really gives you a look inside the darkness of the underworld. The woman's version of this book is \\"The Company She Keeps\\" by Georgia Durante. If you like mob books, both of these are an excelent account of life in that world. They tell it the way it really is."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAMMY THE RAT","review":"Underboss is a great book for people interested in knowing more about the cosa nostra. Sammy tells about is childhood days involvement in crime to when he first became connected in the Columbo crime family. And how he brought down his close friend and boss John Gotti in the Gambino family. You learn the their rules and family structure as well. I think is Sammy the Bull was a real man he would serve his time in prison because when he became a member in la cosa nostra he swore to play by the rules, the most important is you don't rat. Sammy does also lie about most things to make himself look good, like when he gave his reason for becoming a rat. I also recommend: Mafia Dynasty by: John H. Davis and Donnie Brasco by: Joe D. Pistone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Big Bad Bull shines.","review":"Finally, an account from the other side of the Gravano/Gotti epic. This book is extremely interesting, and covers one of the most elusive and successful mafia hit men ever. A true tough guy, and during the Gotti rein, the only mobster the boss ever feared. If you know your Mafia history and have read hours of transcript FBI wiretaps, than you know this book is accurate, and a must to complete your collection. The book is also great for being able to give more insight into the Gambino family history. Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"GRAVANO IS NO RAT","review":"I WORK AT A BOOKSTORE AND I AM ALWAYS LOOKING FOR GOOD NON-FICTION BOOKS, PARTICULARLY MAFIA-RELATED BOOK AND I HAVE READ AND RECOMEND SUCH BOOKS AS \\"GOTTI\\" BY JERRY CAPECCI AND \\"GOOMBATA\\" BY JOHN CUMMINGS, BUT AS SOON AS THIS BOOK ARRIVED IN MY STORE I KNEW I HAD TO READ IT BECAUSE IT TOLD THE STORY FROM THE SIDE THAT NOBODY WANTED OR EXPECTED TO HEAR FROM. THE WAY THE BOOK IS WRITTEN KEPT ME TURNING THE PAGES NON-STOP.

My impression is that Sammy is attempting to make himself look like a victim. His side of the story just seems like fiction. This was not a gripping or believable version."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAT","review":"This is a story that was told by a man who was a sell out just to save his own skin. He told the FBI anything and everything that they wanted to hear. This book tells the tale of mafia life from a person on the inside, but who is to say that the information that is being given is the truth. The book reads well and seems interesting and exciting for those who do not know what mob life is really like. The book is filled with false facts and incorrect information. It seems odd to me that people are supporting a man that has admitted to nineteen murders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cacophonous Rant","review":"Perhaps the publisher or Peter Maas was trying to do something new to appeal to the public. By selectively editing interviews this book is written in the prose of Sammy the Bull's slang and jargon, fragmented sentences, non-sequiturs, and poor train of thought. I didn't finish the book. To all others, in my humble opinion it's not worth starting."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read","review":"A great read for any mafia buff. I am always looking out for new books that cover the American Cosa Nostra. This is a great one, and from the mouth of one of the highest ranking members of all time.Many other books don't get into the life of Sammy Gravano. The reasons he had for turning on John Gotti. This book really gets into the background on his decision."},{"rating":"2","title":"Betrayed Underboss played a good hand at getting back.","review":"So what if the guy ratted out John Gotti and a whole lot of other made guys? If you were in his shoes what would you have done? I dont know myself. Since killing the boss is a big time no-no without approval from the syndicate and is a death sentence he had no other options. He was gonna die either way in or out of prison if he had stayed with the mob. There is no real honor anymore in this lifestyle (if there ever was any) from what I got reading this book. Im sure the other bosses wouldnt have minded Sammy killing Gotti, but its tough to rule a family while in prison even though its been done and is being done today. I like how it explains his early life, his stint in the army (which he actually liked) his return to organize crime and rise to power and later turned govt witness. Ole Sammy out of a twist of irony got ratted out himself years later in Phoenix. We all reap what we sow."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lot of Sammy's Bull","review":"Peter Maas is a very skilled writer, and has produced some excellent work. However, this work is hampered by Mr. Gravano's largely self-serving slant on everything. He attempts to convince the reader that he is essentially a nice fellow who just happens to have killed nineteen people along the way. As a reward for his testimony against John Gotti and several others, Gravano served just three years in prison. While those against whom he testified may have been reprehensible characters, one has to take into serious question Gravano's motivation for doing so. Similarly, his motivation in producing this book must also be questioned. Although there are a few interesting elements, this appears to be little more than an effort to cash in on his notoriety, one more heist (albeit a legal one, for a change). Little Sammy - Lots of Bull!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought I was reading fiction.","review":"I'm not the fastest reader in the world, but I flew through\\"Underboss\\". What an amazing account of life in Cosa Nostra. Youkeep asking yourself, \\"Is this real?

This book points out that there are no winners in a life of crime. Gravano holds nothing back when telling his life story as one of the most prominent modern day mobsters. You will not be able to put this book down. It is so well written that you will feel like you are watching a motion picture.Peter Maas has a special way of keeping you at the edge of the story at all times. You will learn that being a mobster is not something these wiseguys would do over again given the choice. The book has a real way of putting you at the seen of the crime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Familiar. Same old stuff,","review":"I think Peter Maas is a good writer. It must have certainly been a big job for him to make sense out of whatever Sam Gravano fed him for this book, probably in the form of taped recordings or paper notes. Overall, it's not the writing that bothered me, but like others have said, it is the \\"I was a victim\\" stance Mr. Gravano takes. After all, he didn't go \\"straight\\" just for the sake of wanting to live a clean life, did he? Seems like he just wanted less jail time. If you like Mafia related stories, I guess you'll like this one. Numbness set in for me though after reading many of the same old things that you've read in the news and I just couldn't get excited about it or feel empathetic for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic biography....a must-read.","review":"Maas did an exquisite job of presenting Gravano's story without all the hokey, Hollywoody glamour that is often given to mob stories. It is laid out on the table, as was....no fluff, just the facts. While the book was long, it was far easier to understand the information than it was to read it in the papers and hear it on television during Gotti's trial. The book exudes Gravano's bravery in stepping forward to finally do what is right."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real eye-opener into Cosa Nostra!","review":"Even though Sammy \\"the Bull\\" Gravano is the ultimate \\"rat\\" of them all by giving up John Gotti, his biography is a stunning eye-opener into the everyday life of being a gangster in Cosa Nostra and the Gambino family. When you read the book, it makes you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action with all the killings, betrayal, \\"omerta\\", etc. that's associated with the Mafia. Regardless of whether you think Gravano was a snitch or hero, this IS the book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really great book.","review":"This true account of the man who went from mafia to FBI to bring down Gotti is a real treat.

Figured I'd at least warn others."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERATED & OVERPRICED","review":"The Mango Season by Amulya Malladi is an overated overpriced book. I found it boring and goofy. Why all the glowing five-star reviews? I have no idea! Save your money and check this one out of the library if you insist on reading it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Something was definitely missing","review":"This book was an easy read, the characters were easy to follow and identify but I just felt cheated after reading this book.I hate to compare books of similar themes; however, For Matrimonial Purposes by Kavita Daswani was a much better book.Mango Season seemed so repetitive. I often found myself wondering why Ms. Malladi mentioned Nick, the great american boyfriend, page after page without really giving him life. At one point I was ready to throw the book after she mentioned yet again how great he was. Enough already! We know he's great, tell us something else.The recipes were a lovely Like Water for Chocolate touch. If you can't find the ingredients in your local market, try the internet.I felt cheated after reading this book. Something mentioned at the bottom of page 224 really ticked me off.I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are looking for a frivolous, quick read that is at times quite boring and redundant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing pleasent about this book","review":"Looks like the author was in a rush to write something. Probably the 1st book was good and she wanted to encash on it. I kept going through this book for any thing interesting: story/expression/narration etc. Very boring. The author tries to portray a typical orthodox south India family and has failed miserably. In India there is much more to \\" The mango season \\" than this bitter pickle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner from Ms. Malladi","review":"This book introduces us to Priya, who was born and raised in India and then left for the US to attend college. Once in the US, Priya meets a man, falls in love, gets engaged and has to figure out how to break it to her parents. Priya heads back to her home land and things get more complicated. Priya's family is a mix of interesting characters, some you like and some are more difficult to understand. This was a quick read for me and also an enjoyable one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get some!","review":"Better than expected. A small amount will add dramatic heat to any dish. Quite happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this toy","review":"I got this toy for my daughter when she was 1. She loved it and played with it all the time. We used it for learning the names of the colors and matching the balls to the color coded rings. I brought it out again when my son turned 1, and he also loved it. It is a favorite during playdates, too. He is now 2, and she is 5, and while they both still play with it on occasion, we now play differently with it. The balls seems to be indestructible, so you can bounce them on tile (or wood) floors and they will bounce really high, and the kids can chase them. An excellent gift for a one year old, will last through several kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Me a Pound if You Love Pound-a-Ball!","review":"My kid got this on her first b-day, and immediately whacked those balls through w/no prob whatsoever. If the balls were any smaller in diameter, they would be able to be hammered in so quickly that the kid will not get the whole cause-and-effect lesson. Should be in the toy hall of fame. Parents with vicarious frustration: grab that hammer and let loose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Many Problems Here","review":"I had so many problems with this that I through it away. Buy another pounding toy. The problems were as follows:1. The top part and the tray aren't connectedat all. The top just sits on the tray, which creates storage problems and makes the toy unstable.2. You practically have to be a body builder to get the balls in the holes. I could hardly do it, let alone my small children.3. The balls don't stay in the toy well and go everywhere.Don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck getting the balls through the holes!","review":"This toy is good in theory, but terrible in practice. The holes on top are way too small to accommodate the balls without some major banging. My 8y.o. can do it, but my 5 y,o. can't, so forget about my 1 y.o. ever being able to play with this by herself. And that major banging that's required? It's LOUD! It drove me so crazy hearing my 8 y.o. hammering away (she was the only one who liked this toy) that I'm returning it to the store.There are much better ball toys out there. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not well made","review":"My son loves this toy and has used it for a year and a half. (He got it at age 1.) However, I would recommend that you find a similar toy by a different maker. This one gets dirty on the inside without a good way to clean it, and the balls break in half after a while. I finally threw it out today because it is filthy and there's only one ball left!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for CP kids","review":"My son has CP and this is one of his favorite toys. We've had it for about a year and he never gets tired of it. He plays with it almost everyday. It's great for CP kids, teaches them to use tools (the hammer) and they can play with one or both hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pound It!","review":"Kids can pound one ball or two or three or all the balls at once or one or two at a time! The ball travels down and you can see it move."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fun For Little Toddlers","review":"My son got this for his first birthday and has loved it for the past 4 months. He learned very quickly how to place the balls along the top and hit them with the hammer. He squeals while he watches the balls roll through the mirrored maze inside... it's very cute.The only problem I have with it is that he's figured out how to stuff all sorts of small toys into the holes on top, including his fisher price little people animals. They can get into the toy, but I have to take a screwdriver to open the back and get them out. I do wish it unsnapped easier to free trapped toys, but the upside is that it's very durable and hard for a toddler to destroy."},{"rating":"1","title":"way too hard to pound.","review":"This toy requires you to POUND the ball really hard. I'm not sure I want my 1 year old to learn to hit ANYTHING with a hammer that hard. I'm putting it away (it was a gift) for a year and then we'll see. I'm super bummed b/c it looked like it would be so much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No fun hammer toy","review":"We got this for our daughter because she liked to bang things. Well my husband and I have trouble hitting the balls into the holes let alone our 10 month old. It falls over easily and is just over all poorly designed. The only saving grace is that she likes the balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this toy for my grandsons when they were 11 months and 8-1/2 months. Three months later they are still uninterested. The balls are very difficult to push through the holes. Even when I help them, my grandsons are not interested in watching. I suppose, as with most toys, some children will be entertained by it while others are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfull","review":"This hooks get a low rating from me. They are to painful to use. Once you grip the bar/dumbbell etc, and wrap your hands around the hooks, they cut in to your hand making it impossible to lift anything heavy. This defeats the purpose of the hooks in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's All About True Friendship","review":"If you're a \\"girlfriend\\" then you've got to get this book. Randi, Umi, and Michelle know each other inside and out and probably better than they know themselves. Their friendships have sustained a lot but as soon as one of them speaks their mind hurt sets in.The question is will the friendship last through the hurt? We all have \\"relationships\\" like this and it's interesting to see one actually played out on paper. The book is beautifully written and is straight from the heart. Jacquie Moore did an excellent job. I can't wait to read her second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't quite fit the 60GB.","review":"Everything about this case is great, aside from the fact that they don't specify which size iPod this case fits. I have a 5g 60GB iPod Video and bought this thinking it would be fine... but since the 30GB is slightly smaller, this case must be for that model. It's not that bad, the holes are slightly unaligned on the top, nothing too hindering, and I'm hoping I can get it to stretch a little bit. The slip-in screen cover is really nice and doesn't slip. The belt-clip and lanyard are great add-ons and I can't imagine going back to having an iPod without them. A great buy if you have the 30GB version."},{"rating":"1","title":"College Performance","review":"Don't expect a high quality recording: this is the original (and only recorded) version of Cyrano peformed back in 1958 by the Yale Dramatic Association. The recordings come from the first generation analogue copies of the lost master tapes.Perhaps an interesting show, but a little bit of a chore to listen to.The CD also contains extracts from Shire and Maltby's follow-up ay Yale, Grand Tour."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a joke, right?","review":"The reviews for this \\"book\\" led me to believe it was an actual work of authorship. When I received the volume, I discovered to my chagrin that it was apparently put together by a computer, one with an inordinate fondness for exclamation! Points! Worse, it has bullet points, like the dumbest of how-tos. I made several good-faith attempts to read this collection of alphabet letters, but was stymied every time by its incoherence, lack of narrative structure, inability to present a focused and consistent voice, questionable scholarship, and all-around painfully amateur quality. I would love to read a coherent, literate history of Confederate (and Union) spying during the Civil War, but this. Ain't. It. Those positive reviews must have been friends and family; I can't imagine an objective outsider having anything good to say about this lead balloon. I wish I could get my money back!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spies and Spy Masters of the Civil War","review":"I had found one chapter of this book on line and used it in my Civil War Unit in U.S. History. I was delighted to find the entire book and have been really entertained and enlightened by it. It adds a deeper dimension to our study.There is so much information--many spies I already knew about but there were many I had never heard of. I also like the added information in the newer edition that tells what happened to the spies after the war was over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant reference","review":"I am very satisfied with this spy review book especially with the way it is organized. The book is not a narrative, meaning, a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth what you paid, I like it","review":"I'm not a junior player, I play 1-2 times a week for almost 6 years now. Lot of shuttlecock I used, this is one of my favorite (BTW, for some reason I do not like Yonex one, their area is in racket, not shuttlecock).The prices is good, the shuttlecock is good, I used 1-2 for 1 man's double game at my level, if play with junior you'll need more."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality","review":"These birds are really good. We have been using them for about 3 month and still look like new. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last long for consistent fly","review":"I gave it a try, but it does not work that well. After a few smashes, the feather tends to be messed up and the birt slows down significantly. Overall, it is slower than Victor Green No1. Playability is not as good.I will not buy this again.But for the very beginer, it is not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this item and also the Yonex Aero Club 3 Badminton Shuttlecock. Both have about the same price. I would give the Yonex 3 stars. The Yonex has a better flight and longevity. The Victor, you can see the birdie wobbling during the flight and the quality is an issue. A couple of the birdie did not even last for one or two rally, this is terrible! For a double game, we could easily use 3 birdies or more. I wouldn't recommend it. For the same price, I would say go with the Yonex Aero Club 3 instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"I bought two of these tubes and what a waste. The birdie would not last even for a couple of good shots. A big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Poorly Made Shuttles","review":"Don't expect these to last. When many players bring their shuttles to the court, you can evaluate which ones you can play with and which ones you can't. Unfortunately, Victor shuttles couldn't last a single game without getting twisted and broken feathers.We put them aside and used DNA shuttles. I wanted to return them, but I still have 6 left, and would not be fair to the seller. I would describe this item as defective and unusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"good value","review":"birds take a beating and hold up well for many hours of play.

It is the worst of all that is out there. Buy only Aeroplane black bird or Yonex brands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond my expectation","review":"Can only compare this to Aeroplane black label. It flies better than Aeroplane black label. Do not understand why people complain a game cost 2 or 3 birdies. It always 2 or 3 birdies for a game, no matter what brand I use.

How they keep making them is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor product from a trusted name","review":"A major reason I bought this product was the APC name. I know their battery backup products are very good, so I thought this monitor cable would be also (after all, I figured it would be difficult to screw up a cable). I was very wrong on all accounts. I plugged in this cable and noticed ghosting of all images. Text became harder to read, and my eyes became tired very quickly. I replaced the cable with the one that came with my Dell LCD monitor, and everything was perfect. I would NOT recommend this product at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought an $80.00 book before I bought this one, because the title made me believe that I was getting all the info I needed in one book.

She has an extremely powerful voice, that is sexy and exciting and everything in between. The arrangements are terrific, and stand out on their own. The uptempo numbers on this album will make you want to dance, thanks to Barton's hot musical treatments and the ballads will make you shiver. I can't wait until these two do another album.

Not boring like many Benny Goodman CD of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"For every Barbie fan","review":"I finally read this book after buying it a few years back, and I couldn\`t put it down-rare for a work of nonfiction. LOTS of good Barbie stuff here, including her influence on our art and culture, but what got me was the detailed and well-researched history of the doll. I\`d never heard the full story of how Ruth Handler based her on the Lili doll, for instance. And toy fans and collectors will be fully absorbed by the history of Mattel, the growth of the African-American Shindana toy company, the origin stories of Ken, Midge, and Francie, Barbie\`s evolution to a working doll in the 80\`s...just so much. It\`s an objective look at this famous icon, but one can sense a certain affection for Barbie on the author\`s part. Also intriguing: a section on B. and eating disorders, and artists who utilize her in their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm a scifi addict, but this one...","review":"The book became a rapidly escalating hard read.

Ficton is fiction, especiallty about space travel with many different species of aliens. It takes a special person to write about this material and David Drake is not. I will not read another one of his books. Even though this is fiction we still want the characters to be somewhat believable. The main character is all the superheroes rolled into one.

Another helpful feature is Porter's discussion of Verbal Aspect (Aspect involves the \\"viewpoint\\" of the author versus the \\"kind of action\\" a verb portrays), which serves as a succinct introduction to the relevant concepts and issues.I recommend this volume to anyone wanting to investigate the Greek texts of the NT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Song!","review":"Satoshi and Kelli Ali's collaboration on \\"Up In Flames\\" is perfection. The music is dark and heavy progressive trance, while Kelli's vocals and lyrics are strange and gritty as usual. It makes for a fierce combination. The 12\\" mix is really keen, while the David Morales mix tries to smooth out the edges a bit. John Digweed's Bedrock mix is nice and long, putting his trancey spin on the track. Anyone who loved the Armand Van Helden mix of \\"Spin Spin Sugar\\" will surely be eager to have Kelli laying down vocals on another killer dance track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated, too many parts","review":"This product was purchased for a 79 year old brother for his birthday.

Toshiba's rigamarole about it being a \\"Super (Honeycomb) CCD\\" sensor can't escape the fact that sensor size and number of pixels is the bottom line and the tiny sensor in this camera is a big step backwards.This camera also regrettably sheds wireless networking, but does have optical zoom and marginally faster responsiveness. However, if you're looking for really clear video, keep shopping. Haunt eBay for an old stock IK-WB11A and you'll probably be much happier.

It is very intelligent and highly readable. What's unique about this one is that it breaks down the complex \\"meta-language\\" doctors use about Cancer into information that anyone who isn't a doctor (or scientist for that matter) can actually understand! It really helps level the ground of communication and understanding between a doctor and patient.To boot, while Ms. Silverander comes off as very intelligent, astute and level headed, her tone throughout the book is also very human and actually quite sweet.

Yes it is a story about living - really living - with advanced breast cancer. But it is also a story about living with any serious illness. More than that, it is a story about taking control of one's own health and well-being. Without any bitterness about medical mistakes that were made and without any preaching, the author shares her experiences and provides inspiration. Embedded within the text is another wonderful story of a family coming together to support one another on a journey to wellness. This book is written from the heart and reads more like a gripping novel than a non fiction account. It is easy to lose sight that the book also introduces a promising new medical approach for cancer patients and other health matters. I am buying copies of this book for friends and loved ones, both for the story and the practical possibilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Treatment, With a Complementary Approach Deserves Your Attention!","review":"I read this book to gain insight into what it is like to live with advanced breast cancer.

This book stresses the importance of being involved in one's medical decisions and challenges patients to educate themselves from a variety of sources.

I agree with the reviewer who recommended L'Occitaine. Kiss My Face seems to have really gone downhill. I think I am going to give this entire 6 oz. tube to my coworkers. On a more positive note, this item is cruelty-free. Still, I think you can find a much better quality moisturizer with incredible scents in the same price range with the ShiKai brand.

Without question, it is the best book that I teach to my freshman level English class in terms of student engagement. It challenges prior knowledge, stereotypes, and opinions and broadens a student's sense of self and the world around him. Compiled from hundreds of hours of audio footage, the book captures two radio documentaries (\\"Ghetto Life 101\\" and \\"Remorse: The 14 Stories of Eric Morse\\") paired along additional footage.

I've had friends and family that have lived in poor communities with drugs and gang violence, but nothing to the extent of the conditions at Ida B. Wells. Hopefully this book will bring awareness to the poor communities not only in the south side of chicago, but throughout America.

Not because it proposes any grand plans for fixing the problem, but because it gives the reader a view into a world rarely, if ever, encountered by most Americans.LeAlan, especially, has a gift for conversation that will leave readers asking \\"Why has this been allowed to happen?\\" In a country as prosperous as ours, no one should have been left to fend for themselves in this manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our America : Life and Death on the South Side of Chicago","review":"This is a very heart-wrenching, brutally honest insight into everyday lives in inner-city projects.

It's still my favorite song on the album, so intimate and romantic.But the whole album is a joy. Whoever came up with the idea of pairing these two singers was a genius. Louis's roughness is the perfect balance to Ella's smoothness--in fact when I hear Ella sing solo, I keep waiting for Louis to chime in to make her that tiny bit better.

Such is the case here. Alone, Satchmo's voice resembles sandpaper at best. Ella has a wildly overrated voice but her tone is sweet and clear, and the emotion is always near the surface. The pairing offers a perfect point/counter-point, the two-faced nature of love if you will. What really sends the project over the top is the material itself, these are standards that became standards because they are great. Most notable of all is the restraint.

Get it and you will never forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for Everyone!","review":"No matter what your musical taste, it's hard to imagine that you won't love this combination. Ella & Louis are, of course, the standards by which all other jazz vocalists learn and are judged; the songs are the brightest gems from the jewel box that is the great American standard songbook; and oh, by the way, the accompanists are the redoubtable Oscar Peterson trio.

Hunt weaves a good story, one that is relaxed and attenuated by a meandering plot, one that ultimately satisfies only superficially. One can read the notes from above for information about the plot if they are interested, and it is a good story as far as a story can go. But it isn't much of a \\"mystery\\" -- even in the end. There's no point in guessing who the culprit is, because there isn't enough information on which to base any speculation. In the end there is no surprise, because there is no suspense leading up to who it might suddenly be. There was a glaring typo \\"alter\\" for \\"altar\\" and numerous run-on sentences, but otherwise the book is well edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational family fun!","review":"Durable, simple and fun game that is suitable for grandkids and adults alike.

The game itself is fun, but the quality of this particular product was terrible, in my opinion. Everything appeared well packaged until I opened one of the plastic-wrapped sleeves of dominoes. Quite a few were chipped or had other very visible imperfections and almost all appeared dirty or scuffed. It looked like someone had already been using these dominoes (and not treating them very well) for a long time. Looking at the other shrink-wrapped dominoes I could see that they were all in this condition. I would have been mortified to give this as a gift.

And this author is simply an opportunist who feeds into the bitterness because many investors can't come to grips with the reality that they were idiots.Look at the reviews of this book. How astonishing that Wall Street was trying to shovel their junk to the public... how scandalous. My eyes have been truly opened to the dastardly machinations of Wall Street.

Gasparino obviously has some keen insights into how the game is played and he takes you behind the scenes at some of Wall Street's most powerful institutions, getting to the heart of what drives relationships and the deceptions of the go-go 90s, including self interest and old fashioned greed.

The moral of the story could be surmised in one sentence, and then the bulk of the supporting evidence should take no more than fifteen minutes to digest. Wall street analysts got paid based on the amount of banking business they brought in through their biased research, which is bad.

It's Glenn Gould AND Bach- what more can I ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review for readers unfamiliar with the","review":"Amazon's editorial copy says \\"Glenn Gould was this century's greatest Bach player, so these legendary recordings are self-recommending.\\" Puh-leeze.I like Gould--a lot, actually--but that statement is like saying \\"Thelonious Monk was the 20th century's greatest jazz piano player, so this album of jazz standards contains definitive versions of these tunes\\". With Gould, like with Monk (when he plays tunes he didn't write), you are going to get a highly idiosyncratic version of any given piece. Marketing writers can be so lazy and/or intentionally misleading, and once a viral meme like \\"Glenn Gould is the greatest Bach player of the 20th century\\" or \\"Eric Clapton is the greatest blues-rock guitarist of the rock era\\" gets rolling, it's impossible to reign said meme in.Most people on this page know this, but there may be a few who take all the reviews here--editorial and customer-generated--at face value."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST Recording of Bach's concertos EVER","review":"Gould is the best. Afer listening to many excellent recordings of the BWV 1052 concerto--including very good ones in period instruments by Pinnock & The English Concert, Koopman & the Amsterdam Baroque Orchestra, etc.--I have to say that this is absolutely the best recording of that concert in existence. The recording of the BWV 1055 is one of the most moving I've ever heard. Gould is absolutely amazing. His mastery over the piano is the stuff of legend, and there's something to be said about the use of the piano for interpreting these concerts. As much as I like the use of period instruments...the depth of expression you can achieve with the piano has no comparison. And in the hands of Gould, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pianistic Genius","review":"For all of Gould's eccentricities, these are without question the finest versions of Bach's concertos one could ask for. Of course, if you are a period instrument fan, you would avoid this anyway. Authenticity not withstanding, Gould brings to these works a penetrating sense of understanding, lyricysm and startling keyboard mastery. There are many other fine versions in the catalog, such as Perahia, but if want to hear Bach done to perfection, Gould is your man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius Recording","review":"Being a great fan of Bach and Gould I was delighted when I found this cd conducted by Leonard Bernstein. Bach is my favourite composer, Gould is among my favourite pianists and Bernstein is my favourite conductor, so my expectations for this record were huge. I'm glad to say that I wasn't dissapointed although the sound quality isn't the best at times. The performance is absolutely magical and I'm surprised that no one has reviewed this cd yet. No need to go into detail about the music, but if you like Bach you will love this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best so far I've ever read","review":"The Coldfire books are magnificent.

C.S.Friedman is a genius!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking...

I found myself just stopping right in the middle of a book to marvel at the complexity of the world. I've never reviewed a book worth five stars, I'm usually a pretty harsh critic, but this one is worth ten. It's amazing how Friedman writes such good stuff. Friedman's my favorite author, I've never read anyone who can top her. I just have one question for the people who gave this novel one star. What book did you read?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I'll admit I was reluctant to read it at first, and without a little pushing from my sister,I probably wouldn't have. But then having started it, I couldn't put it down. It completely pulled me into a nonexistant world that suddenly wove itself around me.Imagine a world that can feed off of your fears, and animate them so that they feed off of you.The basic outline of the story is a group of humans-immortal and mortal alike- journey into the unknown lands to retrieve the memory of one of the humans. The ultimate heroes of the book are Damien and Gerald Tarrant. I found myself rooting for the evil Tarrant more than Damien, the priest because Damien is so caught up in his thick headed church beliefs that he can't see beyond them. That fact really was annoying. And what a scare it is to realize that the Hunter is not the most powerful and evil being in existence on Erna! I can't wait to get my hands on the next two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect book for Sci-Fi/Fantasy fans!","review":"Mankind has developed the power to travel beyond the stars, to new galaxies, with new planets to colonize. Erna is one such planet, peaceful and tranquil. The only problem is that Erna isn't a \\"normal\\" planet-it has the fae. The fae responds to the will of the creatures of Erna, causing evolution to occur at an astounding rate. Then humans came, with their own thoughts and fears. They wrecked havoc upon the delicate balance that the creatures of Erna have created. Many of the colonists die from their hidden fears-vampire, succubi, and others plague them. Humankind sinks into the Dark Ages.An adept is attacked, her power to \\"weave\\" the fae stolen. A warrior-priest, her assistant, and a dark evil over nine centuries old must now aide her in recovering her \\"sight,\\" but the end is only a beginning...Wheel of Time fans will especially enjoy this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a Kind, it deserves more than five...","review":"The Coldfire Trilogy is my top favorite. It is in a class beyond my other favorites, which are the Shannara books, Tad Williams', Goodkind, and Melanie Rawn's Dragon Series. I'm mentioning these because I think they're great, and a lot of other people do too, and the fact that this is better, should mean something. The sequel to this book, entitled When True Night Falls, is even better because you get to know the mysterious Gerald Tarrant more intimately, and understand the nature of Erna. I don't usually read SciFi, because it's too technical, but Black Sun Rising is just such a wonderful blend with fantasy and horror and tons of adventure, that it's very readable. Still, I understand that it might be a little complex for people who are TOTALLY SciFi or fantasy illiterate. Try it anyway, and I think you'll be in heaven when you realize there are two fat books after it."},{"rating":"2","title":"starts fast and winds down...","review":"I hadn't read any of Friedman's books previously, so this started off as a pleasant surprise. The opening is fast, gripping, and delicious: atmospheric and encapsulating many interesting directions that it could go.Behind the prelude, though, is a more standard modern epic fantasy. The mix of SF and fantasy is nice and nicely handled, reminiscent of Marion Zimmer Bradley's Darkover series. Friedman writes well and the text has a nicely lush quality to it.That's a lot of \\"nice\\" where perhaps some more risks should be taken. If there is a problem with this book, it is the pedestrian plot and the characterization. While the characters are not as irksomely cardboard as some big sword-and-sorcery books, they are not very deep, mostly puppets to jerk to the tune of the author. There are some holes in the plot that are a bit annoying.Still, overall I liked this effort, but it took some work to read it cover to cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best fantasy book I've ever read","review":"I feel the entire concept was spectacular. I would love to see a movie made from this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawwwn","review":"Normally, I always Finish books. Not this time.

He just met her and now he's grieving because he was so in love with her...? It's is just all over the place. I decided to read this after some other reviews from people who said this is their most favorite series ever. Well, now I know that they havent read any other series. Pass it on by."},{"rating":"1","title":"booooring","review":"I will first admit that while I like the fantasy novels I've read, I'm not well versed in the fantasy genre as a whole or its conventions. I bought this book because it kept coming up in my Instant Recommendations for Guy Gavriel Kay books, and he's my absolute favorite. I swear I wanted to like this book. I tried to like this book. I read as far as I could -- about 3/4 of the way through -- before I finally gave up and cast it aside. I never give up on books, but I'm a characterization junkie and these cardboard cutout Action/Adventure stock characters had absolutely nothing going for them. Their motivations were sketchy at best, and these walking cliches never grew into anything other than what they were on page 1. I respect Friedman for trying to create a world that was unique, but I believe her ambition outstripped her reach on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wished I didn't have to sleep so I could finish it...","review":"One of the best books I have ever read (and I read a LOT). The author has come up with an extremely interesting and original world populated with characters that are real people- not just standard \\"Villain\\", \\"Hero\\", \\"Heroine\\" types. The characters show the complexity of how people are so thoroughly you feel you are traveling right along with them. This was a book that thoroughly captured my imagination and left me torn- if read it as fast as possible to find out what happens then it would be over that much sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and Beautiful","review":"This book is a departure from most sci-fi/fantasy novels in that the world that the characters live in is one that seems almost overwhelmingly evil. The fact that people seem to live somewhat normal lives in what basically amounts to a nightmare world gives the series a hopeful and poignant edge that makes it truly unique. The uniting of two anti-heroes who are motivated by completely separate forces is my favortie aspect of what is an overwhlemigly excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie script?","review":"Ok, first off, I hate when the characters think to themselves, I can take it if it is only a very small amount, but the author really doses the reader with italics of the characters thinking to themselves this or that, almost like a movie. It's as if the author was just looking for a movie deal with this work. I read all three books, by far the best part is the beginning of the 2nd book telling some history of the world she has created. Much more time could have been spent in world building, and much much less in how the characters thought or acted. Also, if you are looking for epic battles etc... look elsewhere. The only thing epic about this series was the cliched interaction with the characters with each other or themselves. I read the whole series only because once I start a series, it is very very hard for me to abandon it...wish I had never started it."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars..I think not","review":"I do not know why this book got so many 5 star ratings. The world is original, yet too much attention is given to mind power, while the so called \\"magic\\" is just too complicated.The action in the story is void of any creativity at all, and the book is simply too long. It did not grab my attention at all, and I don't see how it could have grabbed anyones.Save your money for something better...this book is a complete waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a pastiche or is it for real?","review":"After reading the first few pages I was convinced this was a send-up of all those pompous, 3-volume, Lord-Of-The-Ring-wannabe fantasy tomes, chock-full of cliches with at least 3 adjectives to any noun ... alas, Friedman is dead serious.Well, I'll grant this: he's created the apotheosis of this genre.Save your money for something better than a nauseating rehash."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"This whole series of books makes me wish I never learned to read. There is no unity in the world that the author tried to create. The reader never finds anything important about any character or situation in the books. Your left going, \\"OK, I guess if you don't get out much there was some action.\\" What's the point of fantasy if you feel you could have as much adventure walking out to get the mail? Really don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"if only i could give this book a zero","review":"this book was so horrible when i finished it i through it away and when the second book was released i couldn't even look at it. All i have to say about it is do not i repeat do not buy this book it would be a total lapse fo judgement on your part if you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolutely amazing series!","review":"Friedman has createrd a masterpiece with this trilogy, which paints a vivid world with fantastic characters and an absolutely brilliant definition of \\"magic\\". Boundries of good and evil are crossed, I found myself cheering for both ends of the spectrum as the two main characters interact. There were some parts that were a bit hard to follow, but overall it all made sense in the end. This series must be read by fans of Sci-Fi or fantasy, who like a healthy dose of darkness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Sun and Sequels","review":"Friedman has built a complex world with a very original view of magical realms vs science. Not the typical science fighting magic story usually portrayed. Her weakness is in character development and storytelling. The plot is strong, the characters are good, but the telling of the story lacks the quality of authors such as Eddings and Jordan.Good entertainment value and I will probably read it again in a few years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic prose, a bit dragging","review":"Altogehter, a pretty strong effort -- the first book of Friedman's I've read. She writes some elegant prose, which I can certianly appreciate, however I found Black Sun Rising to be about 100 pages longer than it needed to be. Friedman need to take to heart the axiom that cutting is a good thing that makes the remaining work stronger.Tarrant was a treat, though Damien, I felt, was a bit hollow, almost cookie-cutter good-type-rebel.Frankly, my biggest problem with the novel was the premise -- I really don't buy this group of people taking off into the forbidden (?) region and risking each of their lives to help a woman regain a few memories. It seemed a contrived reason for sending the protags off on a quest, and not a convincing one at that. Had Friedman been able to craft a more convincing goal, originally, I would have rated this much higher.All the same, worth the read, though I wasn't inspired to go out and buy the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read!","review":"The coldfire trilogy is one of the best series I have ever read.

I love the creativity of an alternate world with differing powers that fae represent. However, the protagonist barely seems real, made up words to discribe communities and things baffle me, and discritions are flat. In addition, characters and perception meander so much, there is not a thread I can grasp onto.It is good so many are enjoying this book. However, I regret purchasing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Evil","review":"Friedman gives us an evil character you can like in the form of Tarrant. When most authors write out an evil character they simply tell us its evil. We see the evil of Tarrant from the word go when he tortures and kills his own beloved family for immortality. Awesome start to a good series"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book I've Read in a While","review":"C.S. Friedman did a sectacular job on this book, hitting many areas within Science Fiction as well as Fantasy. This book appeals to magic lovers and science lovers alike, of which I am both.

He is too eccentric to be an artist and too unsteady to interpret Bach. Yes, I'll admit the Second Partita is stunning and exciting- even intense- but his playing is just ugly. He cannot even compare to Rosalyn Tureck, whose interpretations of Bach embody a lifetime spent in the service of art. Aesthetics, don't waste time on such an anti-romantic idiot. He has neither the insight nor the passion in his smug prudery to really create profundity."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Self-Centered Mockery","review":"Bravo to Mr. Townsend for his understanding of Gould's penchant for making a mockery of serious music performance. This was a pianist who totally confused speed with technique, a lack of emotion in slow movements with authenticity (human emotionalism was not a hair's different in the l8th century), and self-serving egocentricity with creativity. These are performances, like all his performances of Sebastian, that are strictly linear, moving only horizontally, but without height or depth. It is Bach that is purely one-dimensional-- fast foward -- whereas those of us who not only play but who understand Bach know that he is multi-dimensioned on every conceivable level. Listen to Rosalyn Tureck (whom Gould justifiably admired but poorly imitated...his staccati are monotone compared with hers), and you will see the difference. But, if you really do like Bach when it sounds little different than Czerny at high speeds, then stay with Gould. That would be your level."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good survey","review":"This book provides a very good review of the latest research (as of 2004) in some of the important and more practical areas of formal verification.

If you leave the batteries in the camera, they are drained in a day. I finally figured out that the best way to go about it was to keep a separate bag with the batteries in it and put them in the camera before I use it. This is very annoying because then it wants you to re-set the time when you start it back up again. Not good for close-ups or low light. (I tried to use it to photograph my jewelry but got poor results.) Also, it does not have a zooming lens. For everyday shots of my family and friends outdoors or indoor with a flash, this is an OK camera. Still, I have found that you can get a much better product at a comparable price in the 35mm format, which you can now get \\"developed\\" and put on disc at most major film development outlets.

Until that time Bach was played with such impeccable austerity and intellectuality that literally became a shock to listen a very young man -23- challenging all the musical conventionalisms and old precepts which turned around the conceptual steadiness and serious formalism at the moment to play Bach at the piano.Gould made an incisive breakthrough and showed that the formality and the Dionysian spirit may habit together, without those bitter presumptions or austere poses.He impregnated the Goldberg variations with Mediterranean jubilee, effusiveness and radiant greenness. And this posture influenced a whole generation in all fields.So those Goldberg carry on its own trademark. A historical reference by all accounts.Indispensable collection piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not as good as the later recording","review":"This is Glenn Goulds debut recording and it is understandable why he became as famous as he did. There is no doubt that this (at that time) young man had all it took to play even the most demanding pieces, but sometimes he neglects the the feeling and soul of the music.

The only other recording of WTC I that even comes close is Vladimir Feltsman's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach at his best","review":"That Glenn Gould hums with the music on all his recordings is well-known.

I would recommend ALL Glenn Goulds Bach recordings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to a more conventional recording first.","review":"I highly recommend Gould's recording of WTC books one and two with the caveat that his performances reach the peak of the unpredictable and can be rather traumatizing to the uninitiated.Glenn Gould's interpretation of The WTC is a manifesto of his musical opinions, saturated with absolute confidence. Gould sees Bach as a sibling to be rivaled and conveys his ideas, from the sentimental to the vulgar to the insane, with perfect clarity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody help me understand this.....!","review":"I really don't get it. Except for the Goldberg Variations (which are excellent), every other recording I have heard of Gould's is to say the least shocking, this one included. I cannot believe how disastrous this CD is. There are a few moderately OK pieces, but a by far most of them sound either like a nervous breakdown or some other kind of exercise in contortion. I am sorry, but I just don't understand.

Sorry Glenn, only one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"For fans of Gould only","review":"One wonders, while listening to Gould's rendition of the venerable Well-Tempered Clavier, whether one is hearing more of Bach or of Gould?His highly personal performance - as articulated and \\"refreshing\\" as it sometimes is - should not by any means be the recording of choice for someone just getting acquainted with this masterpiece, or for one seriously interested in Bach's work: Gould's approach is far too idiosyncratic.There are many other recorded versions of the Well-Tempered Clavier (books I and II) on the market: Andras Schiff, Vladimir Feltsman, Jeno Jando, Frederich Gulda...; many of these offer Bach delivered in much more pianistic - and much less eccentric! - terms, than Gould."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glen Gould sings Bach's WTC","review":"The rendition of the music itself is fine. The problem is that if you listen closely (or on headphones) you can actually hear Glen dramatically \\"Tumm tum TA tumm\\" -ing to himself as he plays (especially on the second disc), which is infuriating in and of itself, and then exacerbated by his less than melodious voice. The net effect is that it ruins the CD.

I honestly don't understand how anyone can consider Glenn Gould to have been a genius. I'd say that talented and quirky is a more accurate assessment.I'm a classically-trained pianist, and the music of the Baroque era is my specialty. His interpretations are downright goofy, and his playing is rather clunky and machine-like.But the worst part is that he sings and hums along with everything he plays in his weak, raspy voice. Even if he had a great voice, it would still not be welcome during the PIANO performance. This is The Well-Tempered Clavier, NOT The Well-Tempered Clavier with Raspy Vocal Solo (or any vocal solo, for that matter).My advice; don't waste your money on this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUZZY MATH","review":"Since buying CBS Records, Sony has quietly repackaged many of Glenn Gould's recordings so that the consumer effectively pays more money for the same amount of music. The Well-Tempered Clavier is a case in point. CBS sold the complete WTC (Books 1 and 2) on 3 CDs, while Sony sells them on four CDs as two separate volumes. Sony used similar ploys to \\"stretch\\" or otherwise dilute the English Suites, French Suites, and Keyboard Concertos - in each case, Sony seems to believe that less is more. That's less for you, more for them.Five stars for Gould's performance, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"Gould's performance is deadpan to say the least, but this is not what really bothers me; he hums very loudly in the background of almost every single piece. I could understand the occasional breathing or foot pedal pickup by the mics, in fact this can even enhance the experience as a reminder that the piece is a malleable performance art, rather than just notes on a page. However, deliberately humming along off-pitch (while the delivery itself lacks any discernible artistic input besides automatism and tempo alterations) in a professional rendering is inexcusable and makes it very difficult to listen to.I sincerely don't understand how anyone who listened to this for more than 3 seconds could have given it a good review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary But True","review":"After reading all the stories on returning soldiers killing their spouses I wanted more information on the \\"whys.\\" Do we teach these soldiers to kill and then not help them when they need it the most?

I don't detect any flexing at all when I sit in it and lean back, and I'm about 180 lbs.The only flaws I can find with it are minor:1. the base arrived with some of the chrome paint chipped off near the feet areas.2. I have to re-adjust the height occassionally--like once a week. Not sure if I'm accidentally hitting the lever or it's just slowly sagging.UPDATE 1: after 2 months, a part of the seat broke off, resulting in the backrest not staying up. I've uploaded a picture of the breakage. Flash furniture support sent me a replacement seat in a timely manner.UPDATE 2: after 1 month with the new seat, the plastic broke again at the same point. I can no longer recommend this stool. This is obviously a design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Metal Stool","review":"The quality of materials was fine but this stool was hard to sit in.

Purchased for my teen to use at his drafting table. He loves it. Nice swivel, with stationary feet (rollers wouldn't work well on top of carpet). Note that it is meant for small to average sized adults - a generous backside would appreciate a somewhat wider seat. Perfect for what we bought it for, though, and the price was right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too cute!","review":"Bought this for my craft room, wanted something fun looking, and with a backrest.

This however is not the case.Both times the chair broke the piston that moves the chair up and down busted. The first time within a week and the second time after the warranty expired. (figures)In the picture the seat appears to be made of metal, but is not. It is made of fairly bendable and potentially breakable plastic. If one were to sit back in it without care the back could snap pretty easily. The painted plastic also scratches without being rough on it at all.Major Disappointment. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfy Chair","review":"Actual tractor seats may have a similar shape as this chair seat, but different proportions. I found it ill-fitting and extremely uncomfortable: the side ridges dug into my thighs, the chair forces you to either lean back or forward, and the seat is so slippery, that I had to wedge my feet under my drawing table to not slip off. Also, the back pops off if you try to move the chair with one hand under the back and another under the seat.Yes, I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived Broken","review":"Product arrived broken out of the box. Easy return through Amazon. Not willing to try it again. If the product was broken before use, not sure if it would hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"The chair is attractive, but that's about it. The back rest offers no support and isn't even high enough for a person of average height to lean back comfortably if it did support his or her weight.The mechanism that sustains the chair's height failed after one day of use, and I am currently waiting for a replacement part. I would just return the chair, but the shipping cost is deducted from the refund. Being that it was around $60 to begin with, I'm not going to bother if all I'll get back is $10-$20.Aesthetically, the chair's \\"bucket\\" seat is awkward. The ridges for your thighs are deep and cascade to the back, making you slide back. Since there's no real back support, you have to overcompensate by leaning forward more.Don't buy this chair. Pay a little more and get a legitimate, well made, comfortable chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"incomplete Package","review":"The chair came, everything is fairly straight forward and simple minus the small detail it did not come with any of the screws to put it together. So I have 4 pieces to a great bar stool that I'm sure if they were put together would be quite useful. I can't find any way to contact the company to get the screws so this could very well be my own short coming or just a lack of knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great camera for the money and the market","review":"When looking to get my first digital camera I was looking at the Nikons and Olympus digitals.

I use this camera at work and for personal use, I appreciate the direct USB connection and fast transfer speed. I found the controls easy to use and battery life was better then I expected.Given the rate of progress in these cameras and with digital photography I believe that I have a camera I can use for several years even if its outdated in 6 months. All in all a very good deal and a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this camera!","review":"This camera is very simple to operate and takes great pictures! They are very sharp and the color is great. It doesn't seem to eat up batteries like some other cameras I owned. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the LCD screen is kind of useless in bright light, and sometimes there is a delay between the time you press the shutter button and when it takes the picture, but I heard that happens with some other cameras too.

It will make it easier for you to handle. Pressure treated boards will be quite heavy after you've added the end pieces.For easier handling, you may want to cut 1\\" x 5\\" handle holes near the center of the boards (leave 1-1/2\\" of material on the outer edge). I say near the center because you should temporarily afix the end pieces on the lumber first and then determine the true center based on weight. Then you can cut your handle holes. Otherwise, the boards will not be balanced when carrying them.If this doesn't make sense, just cut the handle holes about 1\\" from board center toward the heavier end piece - that should take care of the weight balance. You may want to sand the handle hole edges for a smooth handle finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Qualilty Ramp Kit","review":"This kit makes up a real nice pair of ramps.

If they make one more anime about Japanese high school student reincarnations of ancient warriors with elemental super-powers, I think the world might explode. You have the hot-headed main character with light powers (so obviously, his ongoing enemy will have shadow powers, duh), the niave and spunky girl character, etc. This anime also pulls a big no-no by having two of the main girl characters purple-haired so you can't even tell them apart. The only reason I'm not giving this show 1 star is because there are some cool moments during the battle scenes. One of the enemies is a giant black dot and before you can make jokes about how pitiful the budget must have been, you appreciate how cool the darn thing looks as it cut through buildings, swallowing people up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like having your time wasted?","review":"Wow, very disappointing.

If you have seen anything decent like Bebop, Trigun, Escaflowne, X - tv series, Evangelion, or Full Metal Panic then you will HATE this. Once you've seen anime that people actually took pride in making you will never be able to stomach the likes of 10 Tokyo Warriors. Don't waste your valuable time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched.","review":"Complete waste of time. The storyline revolves around \\"reincarnated warriors\\" who have a Great Mission to defeat a Great Evil while keeping up their high school lives, and so forth. Except there's never any real detail given about these past lives, or what makes them so special. The characters are all stereotypes, with pretentious \\"Warrior\\" names. ('Warrior of Mirrors', 'Warrior of Light', and it just goes downhill from there.)Calling the characterization 'cardboard' would be great praise. The art is terrible, the dialogue is worse--either sub or dub--and the plot is contrived. Even the trailers for other animes are terrible. There is a continutity gap between disc one and disc two that is never closed, which pretty much nukes any pretense this thing had to a plot.If you like pointless explosions and meaningless fight scenes, that may raise this DVD set above glorified coaster status for you.

I thought that maybe if I switched to using subtitles but it turns out that the original language script is just as bad. there is almost no background music.

I got/built it a few years ago. This version contained parts for both the SSG and the SS version (which is also available in its own kit).It is really more a three star kit but since it had the parts (not instructions) to build the SS version I gave it an extra star for value.

The first is that Glenn Gould takes a good tempo on almost all of the preludes and fugues, unlike on the first book. Dont get me wrong though, the first Well Tempered clavier vol. 1 recording is also one of my favorite recordings. The second reason is that he does a VERY GOOD job on bringing out the voices in the fugues of book 2. The third is that there is wonderful sound quality.

It is not ideal but the converters are available pretty cheaply here and elsewhere so it is not a major issue.Then all the sudden it just broke one day while it wasn't in use. The USB just stopped working after about 2 years. So now I am back to moving cables between computers or having multiple mice.

To ears trained on the later Romantics, Haydn can seem a bit simplistic and rhythmically boring. Not so in the hands of Mr. Gould.

The shape of the egg isnt as good as it could be, either. I am going to return my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on these eggs!","review":"I wish I would have read the negative reviews before purchasing - these eggs are TINY - they look like eggs from a sparrow or some other kind of bird, definitely not the size or shape of chicken eggs! They have a really weird smell too - almost like wet elmer's glue. I am returning them right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I bought this over a year ago for my toddler. The carton tore apart within a week. The eggs do not look at all real. They're little wooden ovals painted white, and they are tiny. This is a total waste of money, it's absurd they charge this much. The carton is not even as durable as a real egg carton. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"When my 2 year old granddaughter opened the carton she stuck one of the eggs in her mouth.They are very small and a choking hazard. The half carton looked like a regular egg carton size but the eggs are not. The eggs should be larger. The picture showed some large and some small eggs and the carton she received had all the very small eggs. When I ordered them I did not see an age recommendation or choking hazard lable. So my grandaughter gets to play with the empty carton. That was a disappointment for grandma to hear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"eggs are too small beware/worried grandma","review":"I bought these eggs for my grandson and decided not to give it to him. I feel they are too small. He is one of 11 grandchildren ages newborn to 9. The egg is smooth rounded and could easily obstruct an airway. I wish they would redesign it. I usually love their products but I feel this one is a safety hazard."},{"rating":"1","title":"egg carton","review":"The carton of eggs are very cute,the eggs are made of wood, but the carton and the paper that comes with it tore up the first day.

It is not made for rough play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carton not durable, eggs too small","review":"The egg carton is very similar to a real, cardboard egg carton, so it is not very durable. My 3 year old got this a few days ago and already accidentally ripped the lid off from it. The eggs inside are very durable as they are wooden, but they are smaller than a real egg size so they don't look realistic. They do not fit in the carton well because of their size - the carton is the same size as a real one, and the eggs are small and jiggle around inside it. I am very disappointed in this product and would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as expected","review":"The egg carton itself is not very durable. For a toddler this carton will not last long. The eggs appear larger in the picture than they actually are. The actual egg itself is quite a bit more pointy than rounded like a real egg. The size and shape of the egg was very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD that speaks to your heart","review":"Andrew Peterson is well on his way to being a beacon in Christian music. I bought this CD based on a couple of song samples and haven't regretted it yet. There are plently of songs with great hooks and thought provoking lyrics. There is a great deal of acoustic guitar work here but then we are treated to rich orchestrations to accompany it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I was first exposed to Andrew when he opened for Fernando Ortega at a recent concert in San Diego. His wit, clear sound and stylish guitar playing (Gabriel) prompted me to buy the CD. Lyrics are very cool. Happended to meet his wife, Jaime, (back up vocals) and two adorable little boys (that are touring with him) in the parking lot as I was leaving, and I'm encouraged by their commitment to touring and sharing their music. \\"Nothing to Say\\" stirs the soul with visions of driving into the New Mexico/Arizona canyons and getting raptured by God's majesty. \\"Shilo\\" is excellent. This CD is full of great songs! Check out his site at www.andrew-peterson.com. I love acoustic guitar and clear vocals. Find Andrew's vocals pleasent and sorta James Taylor like. If you like acoustic guitar and folk music you'll love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music For the Soul","review":"I don't know very much about Andrew Peterson but when I heard the song The Chasing Song I knew I had to hear more. Andrew Peterson has a voice that will bring you to your knees. Thoughtful and reflective lyrics that drive to the heart. Rich Mullins came instantly to mind the first time I heard Andrew Peterson. The song Rise and Shine has to be my favorite. Was it the fury of God's anger or was it the fury of His love. Wow! Words are hard to find to express that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh New Christian Folk Music","review":"I'm excited by this recent release. Andrew's music has the best of all of the elements that characterize the acoustic \\"new folk\\" style - insightful lyrics, wonderful stories, fresh acoustic production - sparse but nicely arranged, some of the finest vocal harmonies I've ever heard and an overall unique sound. Its hard to do an album like this without that element of sameness that settles in after a few songs. Surprisingly, the mix of music is quite varied and each song has a strength that makes for repeated listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I ordered this CD on the results of the other reviews only, and I am sure glad I did. It is crystal clear music, lots of good instruments too including a dulcimer in one song. Lots of acoustical guitars and piano. His voice took some getting used to as it is different, and I can't figure out how to describe it. Maybe like he is REALLY from Minnesota? Last and certainly not least, the words to these songs. They are perfect and the type that you can relate to in everyday life, ups and downs."},{"rating":"2","title":"best new christian c.d.of the millenium","review":"This is a powerful,energetic expression of the real faith of a real person. I have enjoyed this artist better than any other christian artist now on the market and I believe he is a gifted young man who will draw many to look to the mountain to see the majesty of Christ. Inspiring, uplifting and truly personal. I really like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I LOVE this cd. From start to finish, Andrew Peterson has produced a superb cd.It is a bit difficult to think of a contemporary Christian artist to compare him to. I've seen comparisons to Rich Mullins, and I'm not sure that I agree with that. The style is a bit folksy, but don't let that turn you away because the music is also rich and inspiring and quite beautiful. And in that regard, I would agree that he's like Mullins.This one is wearing out my cd player. Definately a good one to buy. Andrew Peterson is also great in concert, and I would recommend seeing him on tour if the opportunity arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Childlike Faith","review":"This song is great, because it reminds us to simplify our complicated selves in relation with God. We don't have to come up to His High and Mighty standards to be like Him. We just have to remember what it was like to be a child, humble ourselves before Him, submit our will to His, and He will be pleased with His little child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ths book is an edited version.","review":"This book is good, but has been heavily edited.I would recommend against buying this book, but instead buy \\"The Soul Of an Indian\\" Charles Alexander Eastman (Ohiyesa); published by University of Nebraska Press; ISBN: 0803267010.Ohiyesa puts his spirituality in simple words without getting bogged down in ceremonies by rote, and dogma.I HIGHLY recommend the writings by Ohiyesa.

And it makes me even sadder because I spent a whole semester analyzing these, and though my teacher brought out so many wonderful aspects of these inventions, he would then turn and play Glenn Gould, who never articulated any of the points we discussed in class! I realize that Glenn Gould was a great self-promoter and spoke as if anyone who opposed him was an idiot (which is a great way to make people think you know more than they do!) but in fact, it's obvious that he never bothered to look at a copy of CPE Bach's book on keyboard playing, or he'd be embarrassed at these interpretations. If you want to get more out of these, and really HEAR the interesting ideas in each piece, try Gustav Leonhardt's recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bulky, but good quality","review":"It's pretty decent quality but it's very heavy and very bulky....It depends what you want this thing for.....if you just want it for your truck or boat or a tool around the house it's great....but you're not going to enjoy carrying this thing around in your pocket"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"This book will help you deal with those frustatring solos that Yngwie does so fast. \\"Crying\\" is possibly the best transcription I've seen in a music book.

On my Panasonic A110 the menus seem to be extremely buggy, whether this is my player or the disk remains to be seen. If you're looking for a disk to show off the features of DVD, this isn't it.

It gives me so much insight about the Revolutionary movement in Macedonia at the end of the 19th century. it is a fiction but with historical figures and organizations involved into it, like the one of Goce Delchev, for instance. I was raised with the idea that Macedonia is a Bulgarian land, or at least it used to be- one land, one people, one faith, but the historical truth is that the circumstances outside of the powers of Macedonia and Bulgaria imposed that Macedonia grows up as its own nation, with its own identity and culture.The book is very interesting and involving. I have been reading it for days now, and I can't let it. It is an amazing story about amazing people and I would strongly recommend it to every one who speaks or knows how to read Bulgarian/Macedonian."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice but...","review":"This CD \\"Favourite Military Bands\\" is a good choice but I suggest that you also check \\"100 Military Band Favourites\\" that is a 5 CD BOX SET at a very low price.

It's much funnier, more creative, AND has more than 5 tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-joke wonder","review":"This is quite clearly only intended as a parody of Chant. The arrangements are incredibly simplistic (in most cases, one man singing melody, one man singing a third below him, and another a third above), and the songs consist entirely of the melodies of rock songs, sung extremely largo in an echo chamber. This CD was recommended to me by several of my musician friends; I was expecting so much more. It could have been *interesting*, watching standard chant arrangements be adapted to those melodies. Sigh. Well, at least I didn't blow more than $7 on it, though I'm beginning to begrudge at least that. Not worth a re-listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst applicator!!","review":"OK:) I don't know if Natracare tries their tampons before selling them, but they should, because the applicator DOES NOT WORK!! I bought these tampons after trying Seventh Generation tampons and being totally disappointed. I do like the fact that EVERYTHING is biodegradable but, that is the only good thing about these. First, the applicator being cardboard is NOT painless! However the worst thing is when trying to push the tampon out of the applicator it just wont go, and there is not enough grip on the applicator to be able to get a good hold so it gets very tricky:) I ended up pushing the tampon out of the applicator a little then inserting it. When I did get the tampon in it was never very comfortable and the absorbency was NOT good at all. It leaked fairly quickly and when I removed it there were areas that didn't even absorb. I wanted to like these, but will end up throwing them away:("},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach: English Suites, BWV 806-811","review":"Bach: English Suites, BWV 806-811 is a sublime recording with the amazing and eccentric Glenn Gould. I am a huge fan of both Bach and Gould so this is a match made in heaven. Sony Music has done an excellent job and the sound quality is great. The book-let is a bit thin but serves it purpose with several photos of Gould and a very well-written essay by Michael Stegemann. Gould's amazing ability as a piano matches with Bach's genius and I bet that Bach himself would have been pleased with his performance. This is easily a 5 star performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"The way Gould plays the suites is incredible. Particularly the second, the prelude of which is one of the most exciting pieces of recorded music I know. The speed and clarity of his playing, the precise individuality with which he asserts each voicin discourse reveal the staggering intellectual challenge, and, subsequently, the profound rewards of this music. I have listened to this constantly for the past three weeks and am continually engaged, both by the music as it is precisely delivered, and by the intelligence of the interpretation. Incidentally, I have not heard Rosolyn Tureck's Goldberg variations. However, I would disagree with the writer above who praised her Bach interpretations, on at least one point: Her Well tempered Clavier is utterly boring and uninteresting. It is soporific. Here again, I would highly reccomend Gould, whose interpretation is very inventive and exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony short changed me","review":"Persons, on that recording is missing the FRENCH STYLE OVERTURE BWV 831 as the old recording has it en disc # 2.

The Snow Goose selections are nothing but 20+ minutes of rather dull instrumentals. \\"Song Within a Song,\\" \\"First Light\\" and \\"Rain Dances\\" are all pleasant enough, but you won't be humming any of these songs when it's over.

I was extremely taken with the learned and well reasoned presentation of the information in the book. Unlike so many \\"neo-pagan\\" books, I found that this one presented an actual religion rather than a system for trying to work \\"magic\\" spells. The discussion of Asatru beliefs was very clear, and is enhanced by the inclusion of references. I found the lengthy bibliography and list of books suggested for further study particularly helpful.I'm very glad I picked up this book rather than the extremely lame book \\"Norse Magic\\" by Conway, which had been next to it on the shelf at the store.

The second one I got was better, but its about 10% less resolution than I'm used to with the Canon 200mm F2.8 and 35mm F1.4 (both amazing lenses). I always enjoy zooming into an image and being surprised by the hidden details I miss viewing \\"fit to screen\\", but this lens constantly disappoints me. Its never crisp; its always on the soft side. Lots of reviews claim this lens is sharp as a tack but this just isn't my experience with it. I wish it was.Perhaps I'm just expecting too much. The images are extremely sensitive to the slightest movement of the camera, so you must shoot as fast as possible. Stopping it down did not measurably sharpen the images.

It would be a good book for boys and girls.The Barn Burner is a book about a boy named Ross who left his family during the Great Depression. His father and he were arguing over whether or not Ross earned the chicken he brought home one night. Ross's mother angerly told Ross to leave.While Ross was on the road he ate anything he could find. He also ate anything he could find. One morning he woke up in a barn that was on fire. He was accused of burning the barn so he ran. He met up with a family called the Warfields. They provided him with a place to stay and eat while people we're searching for the barn burner. Ross tried to find the real barn burner during his stay at the Warfield's. Does Ross find the real barn burner? Read this book to find out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chase's Review","review":"For my history book project I chose to read the book \\"The Barn Burner\\" I think that is was a great book.

I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Melodic Rock Album","review":"When this album flopped in 92 it was like the death knell for the hairbands. Funny thing though, Warrant sorta got the last laugh cause they made a timeless record. It's just a good old solid melodic rock album(remember those?). Excellent songs like Machine Gun, Hole in My Wall, All My Bridges Are Burning, and Let it Rain. This record Sounds really good- very clear and well produced. Joey Allen plays smokin guitar solos throughout, especially on Quicksand. Metal Sludge punching bag Jani Lane really was(and probably still is) a good songwriter and a fine singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"Don't write this album off just because it's Warrant. When I first heard this I thought \\"Warrant has went heavy\\". This disc is peppered with great tracks like \\"The Hole in My Wall\\", \\"April 2031\\" (disturbing track), \\"Andy Worhol\\", \\"Bitter Pill\\" & \\"Let it Rain\\". Even the aggressive album cover and title shows that Warrant was experimenting and came out with some interesting & tasty results. Worth a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have been a Warrant fan from day one and listen to their music more than my other cd's (I listen to other types of music, too).Yes, this is more heavier than their previous albums - but, I tend to reach for this one more and more.:o)P.S.: Cherry Pie, Heaven and their other earlier songs are much appreciated by this fan, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"This CD is amazing, and highly underrated.

It really isn't.. it is brillant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Warrant","review":"I had to check the credits on this album to make sure it was the same group of people doing the songs as Cherry Pie. Sure enough it was the same band members.What happened? Cherry Pie / DRSFR had party songs, even a little top 40 metal. Dog Eat Dog comes off fairly flat and uninspired. I'd even have to say it sounds \\"dark.\\" Around this time the Seattle sound starting making its presence and I think Warrant felt they had to go in this direction to remain competitive.Why? Cherry Pie is such a great album. I had a hard time finding a likeable song on this one and usually turn it off after a few songs. Machine Gun wasn't too bad, but there really wasn't anything that showcased this otherwise very talented band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"I'm sorry if I didn't demonstrate my point good enough-April 2031,Andy Warhol Was Right,and maybe The Hole In My Wall and maybe Quicksand are grunge songs-I thought that some things I said would let people know that this CD has a few grunge moments(the tracks I just mentioned)but the rest is heavier,darker, and different from D.R.F.S.R. and Cherry Pie(D.R.F.S.R. and Cherry Pie were Warrant's first two albums,this album was their third record).Again,I'm sorry to not have demonstraed my point good enough(this is the reviewer Some Gravity,Amazon just would not let me post two reviews under my pen name so I thought that I would make my point under the kid's review form).

Warrant keep on delivering their \\"cheerleader rock\\" suitable for ice hockey games, but the only time it works is in \\"Bonfire\\".This release is a rather mediocre effort, in a genre that sure has played out its roll.

Beethoven's music is not the superficial music played here, without ANY heart. Where's the deepness of Beethoven ? Gould could reduced Beethoven's music to a mount of fast, precise cascades of notes, that's Glenn Gould's way, not as the music should sound, so, my advice, get this recording as a reference, if you already know the Sonatas played by other pianists, such as Alfred Brendel (he's a true Beethoven interpreter).

But Gould hated Mozart, and while some of his early Mozart recordings are quite nice, the Mozart recordings he did in the 60's and 70's (i.e., on these discs) were simply bizarre. And not in a good way. They are exhibitions in spite, and spite is not fun to listen to. Granted, some of the slow movements are played beautifully -- but there's more to Mozart than slow movements. The fast movements (i.e., two thirds of the music in the average sonata) are a horror.If you want to hear Gould at his eccentric best, buy anything he did with Bach -- or his Haydn albums, his early Beethoven sonatas (avoid Sonata No. 23, though), his Sibelius, Scriabin, Schoenberg or his Byrd & Gibbons albums. But stay clear of Mozart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for all tastes, but ...","review":"I must admit that Gould's Bach has never been my favorite Bach, but perhaps I haven't really listened to it with a capital 'L'.In this Mozart, the 331 Turkish March is absolutely amazing. He takes the tempo so much slower than most pianists play it. I'm a 'budding' pianist, and just learning this piece and really struggling with (especially) the octave work there. When I heard this Gould, the perfection of these passages is really astouding; I too thought the record but broken at first, but these definitely merit repeated listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad to disagree","review":"I love Gould's Bach recordings, but I HATE his attacks on Mozart's sonatas!

Why didn't he leave these works alone?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is not mozart","review":"By his own admission, Glenn Gould didn't like Mozart's music and he especially didn't like his piano sonatas. OK, fair enough. But then why record them and later write an essay explaining why he doesn't like them? Actually, who (except Gould himself) really cares whether he liked Mozart? What we have here is a supremely talented but off-puttingly arrogant show-off making fun of a revered composer and admiring himself for doing so. Yes, Gould can play the piano. His digital dexterity is nothing short of amazing. But it's not Mozart. It's not even seriousness musicianship. There is no single correct way to play Mozart. All sorts of interpretive possibilites are open to a pianist. (Witness Casadesus, Klien, Brendel, Barenboim, Schnabel, Uchida, Schiff, Richter, Kraus, Perlemuter, and others.) But Gould's travesty is not one of them. His is without a doubt the worst recording of Mozart's piano sonatas that I ever heard. If anyone disagrees, I would welcome a reply."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCARY !","review":"I guess I'd have to agree with those who feel that Gould was somehow ridiculing Mozart with this interpretation.

In my opinion, this CD should not be bought or listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humming is Horrible!!","review":"Seriously, I don't mind his unique interpretation, BUT, the humming is truly disturbing and creepy. I listen to Mozart to relax and his humming is so noticeable and strange that I feel as if someone has sneaked into my house and is creeping up behind me! HORRIBLE! He should obviously be putting that emotion into his playing and not wasting it on humming and singing while playing. I hesitate to call someone a master who cannot control themselves while playing. I will never buy any recordings from him again. Truly Horrifying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Porcelain-doll Mozart smashed to pieces.","review":"Mozart's piano sonatas are some of the best-known of his works, and among the most popular of all keyboard works.

Some of the tempos he chooses - in the middle movement of K.545 for example - are so innovative that the music at its most fundamental is wholly subverted. Also, he drags out the Alberti basses to such an extent in some movements that hidden voices emerge unexpectedly where previously there had only been simple chopped chords. The first movement of the famous sonata K.331 is in Gould's interpretation one of the most thought-provoking of all classical recordings. Gould's technical brilliance is nowhere more obvious than on this release, yet his musical intelligence is even more potently showcased here. An absolute must for any piano, Mozart or Gould lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. There is a baritone somewhere in this, however...","review":"I cannot complain about Gould's mastery of the piano, but ahh, his humming trademark. I find somewhat annoying that this recording exposes him so clearly humming along, sometimes almost to the point of singing, well maybe even tapping his foot, sighing and groaning.Some might complain about the fast tempi, his disliking of Mozart or other issues...personally, I truly enjoy Gould's Sonatas, however, do keep in mind that his always-present humming-along eccentric mannerisms are very obvious in this recording and can be somewhat irritating to the audiophile-inclined, especially if you're listening with very revealing headphones or even some speakers..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gould and Mozart...","review":"Anyone who is a fan of Gould knows his personal opinion of the Mozart sonatas. Listening to this interpretation of Mozart is about as entertaining as being in a room full of typewriters and screaming infants--both monotonous and completely irritating at the same time. If you're new to Gould go to his interpretation of Bach's Well Tempered Clavier or the English suites...if you want definitive recordings of the Mozart sonatas try Brendel, Eschenbach or Uchida. There is no denying Gould's genius...it just not found in this recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Handel Recording","review":"Everything about this CD is great. Roberta Invernizzi's voice soars. The musicians and the conducting is top notch and the sound quality is incredible. It sounds as though you're in the room as it is being recorded.

It looked like it had been abused. Not the amazon packaging, the manufacturer packaging. Sure enough, out of the box, no talking at all. And if yours does work, it probably will not for long. It is cheaply made. There is a comment made by one person that said that they were surprised at how big it is. Actually the opposite. This toy is made of hard plastic and is as wide as it is tall (only 5 inches)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woof!","review":"I only watched twenty minutes of this film.

Purchase at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hilarious!!!","review":"I watched this movie with my friend a few hours ago, and it was awesome. It was very dirty, racist, sexy, and my style of comedy. This is a movie within a movie where director Saint James St. James tells how 'Poolboy II' was deemed too terrible to release. Kevin Sorbo stars as a Vietnam Veteran named Sal Bando. After the war, Sal comes home to start his own pool-cleaning business. When his wife and son are killed, he goes on a one-man war against the Mexicans. I highly recommend POOLBOY: DROWNING OUT THE FURY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dolls! My Daughter Loves Them!","review":"I recently purchased a doll house for my daughter and looked long and hard for some dolls. These dolls are fantastic! I like the fact that they are \\"ethnic\\" and not just Caucasian. They are very durable and flexible and my daughter loves to play with them. I guess my only beef about the product would be that it had to come as a family and they all had only one skin tone. I am Hispanic but am very fair skinned and my daughter is mixed (Hispanic and African and American) and has slightly darker skin and very curly hair. I would have liked to be able to pick and choose the family members so that they looked a bit more like us, instead of a family that is all one race. However, overall I am very happy with this purchase and would do it again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"This family is the cutest!","review":"I bought this family for my daughters for Christmas and they are adorable. They have square bodies though so when the clothing falls off, they are not easy to get back on. This afternoon I lightly glued the pants in place on all the dolls with Liquid Stitch (that is for hemming clothing and is non toxic). I hope this works as it will make play time more fun if my children are not endlessly adjusting clothing. Otherwise, I think they are perfect and so far accompany the Plan Toys stable and pets sets. So much fun! We are eagerly awaiting the furnished Chalet house!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great choice.","review":"I bought these for my niece along with a toy house and she loves them.

It's sturdy, heavy-duty, and appears like it will last for a long time. The scoop size is decent but not as big as older scoops.The one drawback for me is lack of click. The scoop doesn't click! Maybe that's because it is built so well. I don't know. But I wanted my click.

And as I started reading the first book, I couldn't believe how vivid these were. Sometimes DJ Randall sounds a lot like me. Through her experiences, Snelling is able to go through all the mixed-up feelings of a normal horse-loving teen and sort them out. The girl is deeply religious, and she longs for a horse of her own. Her dream of one day jumping in the Olympics sounds so like mine, that it is impossibe not to like DJ Randall for how close she can be to yourself when you are going through some of the same feelings. Highly reccomended.

I recommend that if you buy Gould, only buy Bach. I'll refer just to the first piece, Sonata Op. 2 No. 1 which could not have been worse. The first movement is much too slow and there is no musicianship at all. I have no idea why he made this recording. He HUMS while he plays! He's demented! The second movement is preposterously slow, though most pianists tend to play it that way. It's so slow that you cannot follow the beautiful melody line. It's a joke.

What makes things worse, there is little or no cohesion or musical dialog between the piano and the violin (my CD-set, a recent Sony release, lacks the gamba-keyboard sonatas). Laredo's tasteful playing is not enough to salvage the overall performance. I will not return to this set.I'm only reviewing these CDs in order to recommend the superb rendition of these sonatas by violinist Frank Peter Zimmermann and pianist Enrico Pace (Bach: Violin-Keyboard Sonatas).

Perhaps we may have gotten a good unit if we had tried again, but for me, two defective units in a row is too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back - poor AM reception, poor remote","review":"I am returning this unit because of poor AM reception (I listen to talk radio) and because you can't turn the unit on or off via the remote control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks can be deceiving","review":"Overall this product seems to be a good value. There are very few \\"boomboxes\\" that offer the functionality of this unit with digital AM/FM, Cassette, CD and MP3. Even with super saver shipping it arrived very quickly. However, the picture shown of this item is misleading....the unit I received looks very different from the picture on this page. Mine is silver (not black) and the design is much less sleak. Additionally, I paid for gift wrapping and I suppose due to the size they put it in a cloth gift sack rather than using paper. The problem is that with the boombox inside the sack which is inside the shipping box the sack got all dirty, it has a hole in it and is horribly wrinked....not at all worth the price of gift wrapping."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is badly mad toy guitar","review":"This guitar sucked and a I had a hard time getting my money back.

There was no blue, there was no cutaway. It was the exact same guitar as my sister's!needless to say i am very dissapointed and am returning this guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven's Fifth for Piano Solo","review":"This CD is top-rate. The recording quality is excellent. Some piano recordings can sound distant--not this one. You feel like you're standing next to the piano. Glenn Gould plays Beethoven's Fifth Symphony with flawless virtuosity, and he stays true to the symphony. The piano arrangement by Liszt captures the symphony's message, and you will want to turn up the volume and listen to every note. If you like Beethoven's Fifth and you like solo piano, this CD is a winner. Note that only the first movement of the Sixth Symphony is on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Book","review":"A truely inspiring read about men willing to fight any odds to strike a blow for the USA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly Superficial","review":"As an amateur naval historian, I've always been fascinated by the bravery of that first takeoff of a fully loaded B-25 at a time when the US was at such a low point in its 20th century history. Despite the advice of my Navy colleagues (especially one who journeyed to China in an attempt to recreate Doolittle's travels in China) I bought this product thinking that the reviews justified the purchase. Anyone who would seek an in-depth history of that mission and the courageous men who made that extraordinary mission, and who is accustomed to the depth and detail of professional military historians will be disappointed at the number of questions unanswered. Otherwise, it's a nice 3-hour read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and Confused Effort by our Heroes","review":"These musical geniuses really got turned around at the end of the decade. From flying high with the Byrds to gigging with a weak late 70's bar band, these guys sound like Gerry Rafferty reborn on this Spinal Tapish collection of forgotten late 70s-early 80s pop. Where's Dennis DeYoung's over-the-top vocals to complete the debacle?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated in Farlington","review":"When the package arrived at my house I felt like a little kid on Christmas morning. In all the years of my adult life I had never felt anticipation like I did that day. I whooped and hollered for the kids to come in from the yard. Much to my unexpected disappointment, both me and my kids alike went to bed crying that night. We could not connect the ball with the paddle but my son ended up in the emergency room with a black eye. He was not alone though. His younger sister was in the bed next to him with a dislocated shoulder. Needs a more descriptive warning label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The substance and content of the story was real but the acting boring. The plot at times was hard to follow.

If you like movies with no believable characters, plot or point - this is the film for you. It is great to have gay people of color making films but does it have to be crap? This movie is one step away from being bad porn. SAVE YOUR MONEY. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It just wasnt good","review":"Typically I don't critique. That just isn't my thing, but this movie is a bit of a fixer upper. Plot is flat and so are the leading characters. They clip in and out of scenes, event leading to an answer to the many questions that may pop into your head will always be cut out at the last second, and the emotional connection between Rag and Tag is so undeveloped that it's actually hard to tell if/when feelings actually occurred. The movie had prospect, but failed in the carry out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse version of \\"Beautiful thing\\"","review":"The title of my review is expressing my feeling I had after I had finished watching \\"Rag Tag\\".Rag and Tag are two friends, best school mates (same thing in \\"Beautiful thing\\").At some point they are being seperated. Then we meet them 10 years later. And then we watch another part of the movie, and another one and then we can see them making love and...back again to another part and the end.The plot itself wouldn't be so dull, if the director took care of some important details. Which? Actors. Pictures. Sets.Acting in some parts is soooo wooden that a spark would set the whole thing on the greatest fire of all.O.K. it is a low cost film, but it cannot justify such simple things like changing the skin color of one of main characters - first both boys are black, then one of them (in the 10 year gap) changes his eyes color to blue and bleach his skin...wth???Set. No difference between now and then. 10 years is not 10 months.Bottom line? I was expecting much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible size for price paid!","review":"This Garfield is the size of a beanie baby and costs $40! ABSURD!

It looks just like the logo that you see on the game screen at home. Therefore, during the day I will say that the tiny holes make it difficult to read, but at night it looks identical to the screen on the game. Fun stuff, easy to put on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Nancy!","review":"This album is so wonderful I can't say enough good things about it! Nancy has a beautiful, wistful voice that just draws you into the songs. The reason this is her ultimate CD rather than the new You Go-Go Girl one is that it includes her duets with Lee Hazlewood. These are so haunting (especially Some Velvet Morning) and beautiful that they add a whole new level to Nancy's music. Of course, her solo stuff is just as enjoyable. These Boots Are Made For Walkin' would be worth the price of the cd alone, but nearly every song on here is worth owning. The duet with Frank is so totally adorable. Nancy is the best . . . I'd love to hear some new recordings *hint hint*!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NUMBER ONE NANCY COMPILATION","review":"\\"HIT YEARS\\" is a wonderful cd.All of NANCY\`S BIG hits are included and some of her other hits. These boots are made for walkin\` is a ground- breaking record,and NANCY follows the same path with How does that grab you darlin\`? and her duets with Lee Hazlewood are just wonderful! Her hits like \\"100 Years\\", \\"Good time girl\\" and \\"Drummer man\\" are beautiful and though and sensative at the same time. \\"Hook and Ladder\\" is a nice song. One of my favorites indeed. It ought to have been a hit for sure. I recommend everyone to buy this cd. If you don\`t know Nancy well,this cd is the right one! Kristian Grimeland"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent compilation of Nancy's hits","review":"Since you never hear her music on the radio anymore, except for \\"Boots\\", this is a great opportunity to again hear Nancy's hits, and her duets with Lee.

Nancy why aren't you singing anymore? I wasn't around in \\"the hit years\\" - but I know that with this kind of an attitude and style, your music is timeless - and a comeback would be more than appreciated. Great CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"B O R I N G","review":"After listening to this CD, I wanted to return it, because of all the songs on this CD, there are probably 4 of them that I found worth listening to.

I'm being generous in giving it two stars.."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song&a great last name","review":"without her pops she wouldn't have made it.her voice is along the lines of Cher,Madonna,Jennifer Lopez,Yoko Ono,etc.. you know the voices that have no tone.Boots is alright but is OVERRATED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Short","review":"It was too short to work with my bass clarinet.

My old wolf mask was rotting and needed a replacment, The picture they show on here looks kinda close to my mask so i ordered it. I got the mask and was not happy. The colors were pretty far off from the picture. I called to complain and they took my number and said they'd call me back in a few minutes. Never happened. The problem mainly was that the mouth color on the mask is Brown and their is weird brown around the eyes. Barely any silver hair on the mask and the sides and back of mask is Black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible fitting earbuds...","review":"I can only guess the attraction to these earbuds are the colors. They fit lousy and am constantly having to adjust them. Even Apple's earbuds that come with their Ipods are better than these. I'd send these back if the packaging wasn't such a hassle.

These things are incredibly poorly designed and/or manufactured. Avoid. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable, inexpensive, a steal!","review":"Take it from me, these are tough. I abuse earbuds like no tomorrow, and the last time I got these, they lasted me over a year (before they got stolen.) They probably still work. Average life of earbuds for me is around 3 months.2 years later, I still can't find any that match these in quality for the price, and be durable. They look nice, fit decently and comfortably, and the price is low. The sound is decent, not fantastic, but certainly not bad. Seriously, unless you're really picky, these are the best earbuds for the price. And going into college this year, they're exactly what I need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was unpleased with this product","review":"I have had another set of Sony headphones for about four years but the wire became exposed so I decided to get a new pair.

However, the ear buds don't do into the ear as much as I thought. I guess I think of ear buds as the ones that go into your ear and not rest outside of it. The pictures could be better to show the side angle of the ear buds. I can't knock them, but I wish there had been a side photo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music_listener","review":"This item sucks. Don't buy it.

Otherwise they are light & comfortable. I tried the ear buds that went all in ear(skull candy) but found you can't hear anything else. Even chewing gum is a problem. So I like ear buds like you get with an ipod. Good for the price if you don't need a heavy bass sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginning Greek","review":"This book is not for beginners. It is more advanced. The CD's that come with it do not follow the lessons and are in Greek. If you are a beginner, you do not understand a single word of the CD.

The book is incredibly boring. Certain aspects of population numbers are repeated into the groud. Nothing I saw (although I didn't finish the book) was very interesting, and I didn't learn a thing that might have improved my hunting ability. And althogh it has a very nice cover, WATERFOWLING HORIZONS wouldn't make a nice coffee table book. The inside pictures are small and lacking clarity not to mention they're black and white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimaginative repeat of older, better books","review":"I was disappointed at how little information was added to the world of waterfowling with this book.

There was no perspective between past, present, or, as the title suggests, the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"It&#65533;s in the Bag","review":"This book is a must have for handbag connoisseurs and girlie-girls. Beginning with the super-chic, boldly colored hot pink cover featuring a Louis Vuitton Damier bag, the book is beautifully illustrated with examples of the full spectrum of 20th century handbags from vintage Hermes to Kate Spade canvas to exotic art pieces. The text is comprehensive and intelligent, highlighting the origins and evolution of the purse, yet it is entertaining as well and never too staid. The book has a sense of humor.Readers will learn the history of Gucci, Hermes, Louis Vuitton, Prada, and Coach, and learn about memorable bags such as the Kelly bag named for Grace Kelly. It's a handbag lover's dream book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great brand, not their best product","review":"While you get the convenience of taking just one capsule a day for man vitamins and minerals, this isnt their best product. i suggest taking their super immune blend. you need to take 8 capsules a day, but you get so much more!!! and its super high in antioxidants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beethoven Liszt piano transcription of Symphony No.6,op.68 by Glenn gould","review":"I was sceptical of hearing a piano transcription of a Beethoven symphony,regardless of the pianist. I believe the original recording of the piano transcription of the Pastoral by Gould was in 1968, by the CBC for a radio broadcast. I am not a recording engineer and I know nothing of sound bits or dynamic ranges, I can only say that I was overwhelmed by the sensitive interpretation and the sound quality of this much-loved symphonic work. The closing movement, with the Shepherd's Hymn, is brilliant. In my opinion this is Glenn Gould at his absolute best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Remarkable GG Recording...","review":"This is a gorgeous recording wherein GG captures the realization of a gestalt--i.e., an overall unified aesthetic concept of the work of art from beginning to end: the individual movements are not considered as separate from the unity of the piece as a whole. The maintainence of an overall unity of vision in conceptual space-time is something which only a genius of GG's stature can achieve. To disparage his time scale as \\"too slow\\" is to utterly misunderstand his artisitic vision: this is what separates critic from cretin.By the way, if a complete set of Liszt's piano transcriptions of Beethoven's symphonies is desired, Leslie Howard's on Hyperion is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple wise advise","review":"Oddly enough one of the best pieces of organic food advise I have heard that this book seems to drive home is read labels as if you were reading a medication prescription, and know what is in the item you are buying, whether it is food, clothing, cars, furniture. Then stop and ask yourself if you really need the item or simply want it. Less is best and thinking as if you lived pre WW2 helps because this was an era where people grew more of their own foods, wore clothes out, repaired items rather than toss them out and buy a new item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever, but not very funny","review":"This album was my first exposure to Firesign Theatre after hearing about them from many friends. A \\"best of\\" collection seemed a good start. Alas, I was disappointed. While some of their wordplay was quite clever, none of the first CD was *funny*.

I've read several of his books and come away from all of them with the feeling that something essential was missing. Reading a Bentley Little novel is kind of like watching a movie that is nothing but explosions and car chases. What he lacks in prose and writing talent he tries to make up for in scenes of shocking, grotesque violence that quickly become boring and mundane. The Ignored was last Bentley Little novel I read and it will be the last for me. This is probably the stupidest book I have ever read in my life, and I read a LOT of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignored because they can't be seen, or can't be seen because they're ignored","review":"Absolutely one of the the worst books that I have ever read.The only reason I finished it was to see how far the author would (could) go with his ridiculus theme.If you want to waste your money on a bad book, buy and read this author's book \\"The Store\\", which is almost as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a really horrible book!","review":"Lets see, was it the part where the \\"ignored\\" were invisible when they would start fights? Or maybe the part where the police didn't notice them when they broke into stores? Wait, I think it was where they raped women for casual fun and no one noticed that I finally gave up on this rotten little book, and Bentley Little.This is one of those \\"anti-books\\" for a younger generation than me. I enjoy Maxx Barry (which is why I think this lousy book was recommended to me) but simply couldn't find a redeeming thing in this book. Maxx Barry is light-hearted and CLEVER. The Ignored is dull, mean-spirited and pointless. I allow a great deal of room for creativity in writing and art, but sometimes you step back and say, \\"that isn't art.\\" This isn't a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreary little novel","review":"I found this novel, in a word, dreary. The main character has a dreary passive personality and deliberately leads a dreary life until he meets up with other \\"ignoreds\\" and they set out to commit one dreary brutality after another.

Mr. Little is right fine talented writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Character Wasn't Average - he was a Loser","review":"I couldn't finish the book so maybe the 2 star rating is unfair. I did not find the character to be average, I thought he was below average. He was a complainer, a slacker, rude and very insecure. Average people are not like this, they are much more tolerable and basically pleasant. I hated this character. The writing was very good, however, so I can't fault the author on his abilities. I just could not stand the character and to make matters worse, it was written in first person POV. I had to get out of that loser's head! I stopped reading after 2 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Yes, this one rocks!'","review":"Totally wild and new imagination by the author and one of the bes tbooks I ever read.

I loved everything about it, the beginning, ending, etc. The other reviews will give you an idea of what its about, but a lot of it reminded me of FIGHT CLUB (another awesome book and movie as well). What turned my attention to this book was the fact that I read an advanced readers copy of Stephen King's new book - ON WRITING (also very cool and sweet - check it out when it gets published). This book is truly worth checking out though, either purchase it or get it from the library, and when you pick it up if you make it past the 1st 30 pages, then you're hooked baby.

The whole story dragged on and on. I continued reading the story hoping that there would be some sense to it, but that did not happen. Maybe his other books are better, I don't know but I just don't understand how anyone could call \\"The Ignored\\" a horror book. The only reason I bought this book was because the ratings were good but I guess everyone thinks differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"As average as the bland characters within","review":"A fascinating premise with loads of potential, however, a very uninteresting development of plot and characterization. The worst thing about _The Ignored_ is not that it really was such a bad horror novel, but that Bentley Little has ruined the concept for every other horror novelist with more talent and devotion. Very poorly executed - like an episode of The Twilight ZoneAnd the redundancy? Page after page after page of being reminded exactly what the diagnoses are for this lot of losers that Little chose to leave as stagnant and boring card-board cut-outs of every American breathing in the here and now.I'm just sorry I bought it instead of borrowing it from the library. I suggest you ignore this book and move on to better novels. What little faith I have left in Little will go toward a second chance - I hope that his novel _The House_ is better than _The Ignored_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most provocative book I've ever read!!","review":"This is a book which touched not only on the horrors of being ignored, but also touched my soul with the depths to which the main character was ignored. The everyday events which Mr. Little uses to portray the horror of slipping into nothingness helped to bring home just how realistic such a plight can be. We have all been ignored. Some more than others. I feel this book will touch those who feel the lonliness in their everyday lives, and the people who are happy, full-filled, and content will find this to be a useless waste of their time. I myself have only the love and companionship of my children and husband, therefore I found myself in the pages of Mr. Little's book. A very terrifying proposition to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!","review":"Apparently, this is one of those books you either love or hate. I loved it! Brilliant, perceptive and thought-provoking, it's not for the slice-and-dice crowd, but any educated reader who isn't terrified by the implications of this tale has no soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ignored","review":"I am a very big Bentley Little fan but this was not one of his best works.

The ending was very far fetched without any attempt at an explanation."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would have been best w/fewer pages","review":"I'm always looking for something to scare me... This isn't 1 of them... I read this a few years back, when Mr. Little was a virtual unknown, except in England, I believe and his books were hard to find... Now they're being reprinted for the masses. He just spent too many pages on the book.. I would have liked it more if it didn't have so many pages, going on & on & on & on & on..........."},{"rating":"1","title":"As average as the bland characters within","review":"A fascinating premise with loads of potential, however, a very uninteresting development of plot and characterization. What was the worst thing about _The Ignored_ is not that it really was such a bad horror novel, but that Bentley Little has ruined the concept for every other horror novelist with more talent and devotion. And the redundancy? Page after page after page of being reminded exactly what the diagnoses are for this lot of losers that Little chose to leave as stagnant and boring card-board cut-outs of every American breathing in the here and now.I'm just sorry I bought it instead of borrowing it from the library. I suggest you ignore this book and move on to better novels. What little faith I have left in Little will go toward a second chance - I hope that his novel _The House_ is better than _The Ignored_.

I bumped it with a few family members the first 60 days (but I bet the ball has 1 hour of bump time before I used it for an actual game). It lasted two hours and the air hole popped out...so I cannot pump it up with air anymore. The ball is toast. Everyone loved the ball. Maybe I got a lemon. I will order a different one next time as Amazon only gives you 30 days to return this item. So I'm stuck tossing it in the trash and starting from scratch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volleyball","review":"This volleyball is barely over 30 days old and no longer holds air.

Better than the low end balls you'll find in a retail store, but not by much, especially not for the price. I've played beach volleyball for 5+ years and this is not a ball I'd pick to play with. Looks like I'll be ordering the official AVP ball for a few dollars more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"First, the ball took a week to reach me in Afghanistan. Because of the hostile environment (mountains, sand, barbed and constine wire, rocks, dry heat) The ball has held up well, in fact, it went through the barbed wire, has a huge gash and hasn't lost air yet. WOW!! completely worth the money. If these army guys made more $$ we would get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imperfect, not round.

You have to wait for a 2sec delay after you push the shutter button on the remote for the camera to fire. There are other remotes for Canon DSLR's that are right at the same price and give you the option of firing with you click the button or to have a 2 second delay. Trust me having both options is way better than being limited to just one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon Wireless Remote","review":"Being new to the world of digital cameras I was excited about being able to take a group picture without having to leave one person out to take the picture, or having to run to get in the picture within the timer count down. This product not only will allow you to take a remote picture, but will also allow you to set a 2 second delay, which is not mentioned in the listing. The 2 second delay allows you just enough time to hid the remote before the shutter releases. This makes for great pictures. You are limited to taking pictures within 16 feet so long as there is line-of-sight between the wireless remote and the front IR sensor on the camera; in my case a Canon 7D. I recommend this product to amateurs and professionals alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple, but cheap . . .","review":"I like the idea - I like how compact it is.

The only drawback is that unless I'm pointing at the camera a specific way, it doesn't work... and I mainly wanted my remote for self portraits so I need to learn to work with/around that. I haven't tried pointing it at the camera and drawing it away (since there is a 2 second delay) so maybe that'll work.

She certainly had the voice, the right inflection, the material, the producer (the great Billy Sherrill in his prime) and the husband (all-time legend George Jones). Current \\"country\\" singers today can't hold a candle; I would only deduct one star because if I was doing the compilation, I'd have included less 80's-period stuff and more of the 60's/70's material that's missing...like \\"There Goes That Steel Guitar\\", or some of the Christmas LP original songs, or better, some of the more obscure duets with then-husband, George Jones, like the classic \\"We Believe In Each Other\\"...but no matter, most of this is REALLY GREAT stuff from a really great traditional country singer. Looking forward to her estate finally giving permission to release all of those very solid LPs from the 1970's (so we can finally hear songs like \\"I L-O-V-E-Y-O-U\\" again). Here's to the REAL First Lady..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This boxed set shows a legendary country star at her best.","review":"Tears of Fire the boxed set by Tammy Wynette shows the late legend of country music at her best. From the heart-wrenching emotion of the self-penned 'Til I Can Make It On My Own' to the tongue-in-cheek playfulness of 'Another Chance', the entire set is a winner. The three CD set contains songs from the early sixties to the mid eighties and includes a twenty-six page book of extensive notes and pictures that put the songs in historical perspective. There are also duets with George Jones, Emmylou Harris and others that highlight the versatility of the First Lady of Country Music. There is some filler in this boxed set and not all the included songs are classics -- but the set is a must-have for any fan and anyone who enjoys the best that classic Country Music has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas gift","review":"I purchased this set for my mom.

It has lost most of it's suction power, and the brush bar is scraping against the plastic bottom plate causing plastic shards to come off the bottom. Now, you get to experience the lovely burning smell, and eventually the scraping will render the vacuum completely useless. If you do have the unfortunate experience of owning one of these - the HEPA filter gets clogged very easily, you have to take it outside and beat it against something and use a dry paint brush to 'brush' out the folds to get the dust out. IT's really a pain to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's okay...","review":"I was excited to try this vacuum because it was bagless. I don't really like to give a bad review, because I don't really enjoy negativity, but for all of the people who have given this good reviews, probably didn't have a good vacuum before it. It loses suction rather fast, I have to vacuum over certain things a million times before I finally just reach over and pick it up with my hands. It does terribly on hard floors, it spits everything back at your feet. And we have huge area rugs in the living room and office, and the vacuum does not work at all on these rugs. I actually have to tilt the vacuum up in the air a little bit in order for it to not get stuck on the rugs. The nice features of this vacuum are that it's bagless, and you don't have to buy any new bags, but you make up for it in buying new filters and such. And the self propelling action on regular carpet is wonderful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great vacuum overall...one major con.","review":"I've had this vacuum for a little over a year and haven't had a single problem with it. I'm always amazed by the people who state that they use a product once, hate it, write a poor review of the product, and then continue to use the product for another year or more.This machine has done a great job pulling the dirt out of all my carpets and rugs. My only complaint about this vacuum seems to be an ongoing theme with many others who buy this product. Cleaning the dirt and dust out of the collection chamber is dirty and frustrating. Luckily, I have a big plastic dumpster in the garage that works perfectly for knocking dirt off the main filter and screen. I've found that if you wash, yes actually wash with soap and water, the filter and screen; the filter will last for about a year.Overall, I think this is a pretty good vacuum with the exception of dealing with emptying the dirt and dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst vacuum I've owned (by FAR!!)","review":"My wife and I have been through FOUR of this vacuum in the past 18 months!

Each of the 4 have been great out of the box, but haven't made it beyond 8 or so uses. Two of them broke (one on the handle, and the other on the bottom wheels), and the other 2 just literally died! The one that just died is still smoking as I write this. 5 years ago, you used to be able to buy an AWESOME vacuum (i.e. Phantom) for $150...now it seems that you must spend $300+...so be it...but NOT with Hoover!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HOT,HEAVY,LOUD,DIRTY, NO SUCTION","review":"this thing gets HOT, it is LOUD, and you must empty it before you use it EVERY TIME or it will have NO suck, it is dirty to empty you open the top and dump it over a trash can and no mater how hard you try dirty dust and dirt goes EVERYWHERE ooh yea you haft to scrape the screen with your nails and NEVER FAILS while you are emptying over the trash can the filter always falls into the trash can this vac SUCKS it is totally heavy"},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but too loud and cost too much","review":"I don't like this vaccum.

The hose doesn't fit properly into the back of the machine so I am constantly having to get my screw driver out in order to fix. It's now broken so that it will not sit upright anymore. The hook broke off when I caught the edge of the table as I was pulling the vacuum backwards. It wasn't a hard bump either. It's very heavy too and hard to move around on the carpet. My upstairs and down stairs is hardwood flooring. It's never done very good with picking up debris off of the hardwood floors. It's just been a really big disappointment as a vacuum and I am now in the process of having to go buy another vacuum.

If you don't like the bagless option, then this isn't for you. I like it because my vacuum never smells like a \\"dirt bag\\". I take the whole dust container outside once a week and bang all the extra dirt out of the filter then wash it down. I haven't needed to buy a new filter yet! I have the secondary filters though and they don't cost but a few dollars at Wal-mart.The cons I have found are the hand tool. The brushes didn't seem to work very long.

Then, you have to dump the cannister, tap the dust off the paper filter, then wash both the paper filter and the metal screen. They say you can only wash the paper filter a couple of times, but I've washed mine over two dozen times (just be sure to let it dry). Not sure how CR could rate this a good vacuum....The hose doesn't stay put in the holder, and this causes additional loss of vacuum.

So, I told the repairman that he can just throw it in the trash; comparable to what other previous Hoover vacuum owners have done.READ ALL OF THE REVIEWS.DO NOT PURCHASE THIS VACUUM.DO NOT PURCHASE ANY PRODUCT FROM HOOVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Story, poorly written","review":"I love LeRoy Butler. He is one of my favorite Packers ever. I have heard his story on tv and through various internet articles, so I thought I would purchase his book, as I purchase most Packers books I come across. His story is very inspiring. Although, to be quite honest, the book is pretty poorly written. It doesn't flow very well, I thought I was reading something I wrote in middle school. He spends 2/3 of the book on his childhood and then briefly touches on his career at FSU and Green Bay. I am not disappointed in my purchase, but it could have been written better.

The whole album is utterly, fluidly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most Beautiful CD's ever...","review":"I know this CD gets bad reviews because it didn't push the Dead Can Dance sound any further, but it is simply too amazing to dislike. I own a few Dead Can Dance albums, from different points in their career and Spiritchaser is by far my favorite one. The Native American style drumbeats and vocals (and Lisa Gerrard's beautiful voice) make this album great. Drumbeats that almost make you want to dance, guitar and synth lines that compliment Lisa's stunning voice...it all makes for a classic album. This being Dead Can Dance's last album, it was a good way to sum up their excellent career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritchaser?

The demon girls are totally naked through the whole film, and even that became a little weak after a while. It just needed a few things, like more full-frontal, more acting, more plot, more money, more script, and more direction. Then we'd have had a hit on our hands.

I was not expecting a block buster, but something which could at least be followed, The ending was disappointing and left me waiting for the next scene in the movie.

Chapters 1-3 were about spiritual direction in general--interesting and informative, but I found myself feeling impatient to get to the \\"group\\" part. Consideration of groups began with Chapter 4 and was worth the wait. The author presented a clear, sound model of how to organize and conduct a spiritual direction group and included readily understandable examples and verbal illustrations. I especially appreciated her relentless emphasis on the role of God in spiritual direction. My only reservation about her recommendations was that she seemed to underestimate the importance of discouraging spouses and close friends from being in the same group together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definitive interpretation of Schoenberg piano works","review":"While other pianists dabbled at these fine pieces, none other than Glenn Gould provides the definitive interpretation of Schoenberg's piano works. Thoroughly studied, Gould presents the serialism clearly and presents the dimensions of the revolutionary works.By detaching yourself from the tonality of traditional tonal music, and immersing in the world of Schoenberg, the shape and lines of the music will gradually become clear. Gould is perhaps the greatest advocate and messenger of Schoenberg's distinct language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad At All","review":"This is a good cheap single i must say.

Write Bros is one of my old go-to classics, especially in blue and recently purple. I'm writing about the green to point out that green ballpoint ink in general seems to be VERY hard to perfect; I've noticed many green ballpoint pens don't stack up to their counterparts in other colors. This pen is, sadly, no exception. It's ever so slightly goopier and less attractive than the other colors. The blue, purple, and black are all superior ink quality to the green. I give this pen a 4 instead of a 5; I'd give the other colors a 5. This is, however, the BEST green ballpoint pen that I've found (most are far, far goopier or don't write vividly enough), so I still give this one a high rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst pens ever","review":"I bought this box of pens to make the $25 free shipping requirement.However, I highly recommend that you purchase some other cheap box of pens or cheap item instead of this one.The ink will barely come out and the pen is extremely rough to use-- no glide action.The only positive thing was that the ink is the color green."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For the most part, I found this book to be very disappointing.

I bought this book expecting to learn about about walking in the Spirit/being led by the Spirit. But this book devotes only a single chapter to those subjects. Another concern I had about this book is that I felt it wasn't biblically based. My recommendation is to skip this book.

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Continuijng to surprise","review":"Again I was surprised that I enjoyed this book. I had read the reviews for the second book and was again cautiously pessimistic at what was to come. With that said I must say that I enjoyed this book just as much if not more then the first one. I enjoyed the pacing and story. My only criticism is that on the dream sequences the author is much too descriptive for my liking. Other then that I like the world she created and the characters as well. If you are a fantasy reader that loves to love the main character then this might not be the series for you. He is definitely the central character in the story however he is not an archetypical fantasy hero. He's kind of an uninteresting character thrown into an interesting situation. I find it entirely very interesting though. I think the author is at her best with this story. The story might not be as enticing as the Farseer Series but her writing is topnotch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This story has no redeeming value at all. The primary character is portrait as a Fat Slob who cannot do anything of significant. Not only is his life a waste, but this story is a waste. Do NOT buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest Mage - Rock On Robin!","review":"I have a 3 hour commute each day, and survive that by audio books. I am so excited to hear Robins work that I can't wait to get on my way each morning. John Keating is a gifted storyteller and Robin must be happy with his treatment of Forest mage as well as the rest of the series. What I am most in awe of is Robins swift arrow to the bulls eye of being fat, and how the world looks at you. As one who is overweight, and has been for most of my life, this work has stirred me.The story is fascinating to me, with rich, real characters, and a stunning world of magic and misery.You rock Robin!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a complete waste of time... And I actually enjoyed the first one","review":"This has got to be one of the BIGGEST BORE I have read in many years. I actually have read her Farseer series and enjoyed it (til the end) and enjoyed the first one of the Soldier Son trilogy.But I agree with \\"AKA - Diary of a Depressed Fat Man\\"'s review.This is absolutely one of the worst books I have read in ages and I tell you with all sincerely to skip it and pick up something else. I couldnt stand reading through it after 3/4 of the way in and just gave up. Not going to read the final book. It is that depressing.I started on Way of Kings instead and that is so much more satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"AKA - Diary of a Depressed Fat Man","review":"I consider the \`Assassins \` series one of the top ten fantasy series I've ever read, and I've read a lot. Therefore it was with keen interest that I picked up the \`Forest Mage', especially after reading the first book \`Shaman's Crossing'.This book should have been titled \`Diary of a Depressed Fat Man'. Yes, I like complex character development - it's one of the reasons why the Assassins series was so good, but give me a break! I stayed up till 2:30am finishing this book, not because it was so captivating but because I couldn't believe it wouldn't somehow get better and justify the time I wasted reading it.Let me save you the time:He gets fat.Everyone hates him.He discovers that he has magic but doesn't know how to use it.He is still fat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nevare never does anything","review":"If you enjoy books about characters who have a million and one problems, but never seek out solutions for them, CONGRATULATIONS! Forest Mage just might be the book for you! Imagine a man who is slowly being overtaken by a controlling magic he does not want . Is being impinged upon by an unwanted personality who makes him do evilly evil things! Any other writer might make their main character fight their own fate. BUT NOT ROBIN HOBB! And we love her for it! And don't worry, even if Nevare seems to be making an attempt to turn his life around, take a deep breath and relax. Because he won't. He'll have sex with a Speck instead and then complain about it later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely Dissapointing","review":"Though I read the whole series, I didn't particularly enjoy it. I'm not sure what kept me going, but I think it was my loyalty to the author. I'm a huge fan of her other series, including Liveship and Assassin/Farseer.This series could have been written by another author. The characters were too few, and too simple. One of my most favorite things about Hobb's books are that her characters are so dynamic. You can relate to them, they change over time, and there are so many. While technically this world is as creative and as original as her others, I didn't find the overall reading experience pleasurable. Most of the time I was bored or irritated with the characters and storylines.If you are a fan of Hobb and looking to explore this series, I'd say you are better off missing out. If you are new to the author, PLEASE FOR THE LOVE OF GOD start with another of her trilogies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than the first","review":"The first book had the small benefit of leaving hope that a plot would eventually start to evolve or at least characters would become interesting to the reader. After the first 100 pages of the second book in the series it's obvious that this is going nowhere. Beware the 5 star reviews who admit \\"its slow, but...\\"Its tedious...period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"Every time I pick up a Robin Hobb book, I seem to lose days of my life. I just finished Forest Mage, and somehow read the 700+ page book in less than 3 days. Don't tell my boss.I was very sad when I finished the Farseer, Liveship and Fool trilogies. Luckily, the Soldier's Son books have brought me right back to the vivid worlds of Hobb's imagination. (No, the Soldiers Son books are not in the SAME world as the Farseer ones were, but the world is just as imaginative).Forest Mage, the second book in the series, follows Nevare as he travels home from the Academy to Widevale for his brother's wedding. He expects a happy reunion, in much the same way he expects a happy and promising future. Afterall, he survived the Speck plague and defeated the Tree Woman and severed her power over him.Or so he thought.No doubt about it, this book is tough to read, because Nevare's suffering is brutal. But you won't be able to put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It just gets better...","review":"I have read everything that I could find by Robin Hobb, and this latest installment is great! I don't know of another sci-fi authoor who can weave a story with such complexity and still allow the reader to care about the characters involved. Forrest Mage is full of suprizes, as well as explanations, and I can't wait for the next book to come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired, Tedious, Boring","review":"I loved the Farseer series. It is in my top 5 of all time. This however, disappoints. It is boring, tedious, long winded and has a main character that is hard to like, not through any fault of his own. I did not like and unfortunately, will inspect all of Robin's works in the future more closely before buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"She walks where many authors fear to tread . . .","review":"\\"Forest Mage\\" is a refreshing exception to the usual fantasy book formula. The narrating character is wonderfully and believably imperfect. The plot revolves around challenges to and changes in his psyche, detailing his internal journey of self-discovery rather than relying (as so many books do) on a clear-cut good-versus-bad conflicts. I imagine that people who only get a thrill from reading a constant stream of fight scenes may find this book a little slow, but those who take an interest in a character's internal development will have trouble putting it down. Though, I must add that once you adjust to the pace, there is plenty of action and suspense to enjoy, with a touch of horror for spice-- I found it quite gripping.Robin Hobb has once again demonstrated her masterful skill in creating complex and fascinating characters, and everything from the storyline to the setting reflects this. An excellent read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Diary of a Fat, Stupid Man","review":"I agree with G.R Johnson's review with one addition of the characters total stupidity. I have never wanted to smack a character so bad in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forest Mage","review":"Another good story from Robin Hobb. Charactors so real they leave you frustrated with them.

It was more ameteur romance and it took forever for anything to happen. Basically I read 700+ pages to really only get excited for the last 6. I will still read the last one though and I still love Robin Hobb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sobfest the second.","review":"I Love Robin Hobbs previous books, but this trilogy does nothing but dissapoint, sure the writing is still wonderful and Williams style is essentially unchanged. However the main character is just so unlikable. He is whiny, melodramatic and annoying. This made it really hard to get in to the book because you just don't care whats going on. All of the genuinely likable characters seem to throw themselves in the way of the often well deserved troubles of the protanginst. All in all the books well written imagary and well rounded characters just can't save this book from its protaginist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not enjoy.","review":"Nevare was the least likable character in the book. Arthur W. Jordin, in comments to other reviewers, keeps telling people to become more familiar with western history, as if the world of Nevare is real. Get real Art! This is FANTASY. And not very good. I'll keep slogging in Renegade just to find out how it all ends but will probably just skim it. There were other more interesting characters in this book that could have been developed to make it a good read (Epiny, Yari). Actually, Nevare was portrayed as a poor stereotype of a female from some misogynist novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely awful","review":"This had to be one of the most relentlessly miserable and depressing books I've read in a long time. Absolutely nothing good happens to anyone and it spirals into one disaster after another with nothing to redeem it or any of the characters.

The first book takes a little effort to get into, but the second one is strong from the first page. This prolific author deserves praise and attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unfairly underated","review":"Very underated by most reviews I've read. If you like Hobbs, you'll like this. Although it is not action packed throughout, she makes up for it in stunning detail and riviting story. I've read nearly everything she's put out, and never even knew about this series until I dug a little deeper in her website. I'm glad I did, because the story of Nevare Burvelle is one I will always remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing continuation of the story","review":"I am a huge fan of the earlier books that Hobb wrote, when I discovered this series I immediately bought both books.The first book seemed to drag a bit for the first 60% of the book, but I soldiered through it, giving the author the benefit of the doubt that it was setup for the larger story. I started the second book glad that we got all the setup behind us and could move forward - how wrong I was.This book was a challenge to try and get through, and I have no intention of buying the third book, I've been punished enough already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough with the FAT already!","review":"I greatly enjoyed other series by this author (e.g.the Farseer series). But this series has been a big disappointment. I thought the 1st book was OK, and hoped the Forest Mage would break free. However, this volume crashed and burned for me.I do not understand the author's equating obesity with magic. Maybe it will all come clear in the last book, but I won't read it so I won't know. It sure seems like she has some kind of obsession with weight....This book was hugely depressing and I cannot fathom how anyone can say they enjoyed this book. I lost interest in Nevare early on and the story just got darker and more depressing, as well as having many obscure plot moments (what was with the spinning top thing that somehow related to the Plains folk magic? Weird.)Once I find an author I enjoy, I generally trust them and buy future books without much thought. However, I'm afraid I will check the reviews very closely before I buy another one...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one - should be 100 pages long...nothing happens","review":"You go into this book and you think a certain event is going to occur that moves the story along. You think it will happen in the first 100 pages, but, at the very worst by the end of this book.But here, it doesn't. Maybe this event will happen in book 3.Meanwhile, 500+ pages in which 400 of them serve no useful purpose in moving the storyline along. This is a Classic Filler middle book of a trilogy.

(She assumes that all effiminate men are gay and that all gay men are effiminate, - I had to laugh to myself as she said this and I butched myself up even more than normal!)The book has some annoying stereo-types, like all gay men are great dancers (I'm not), but since it's clearly tongue-in-cheek and a quick read, it's great for a few good chuckles to any one, gay, straight, male or female."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's worked wonders with hundreds","review":"I'm an ESL teacher and I've used this collection for over 3 years to teach adults.

It hurts to write with a normal pen and a normal PDA stylus is agony. This pen has been the only product I found to solve the problem. The only problem I have found is that the pen is getting harder to find. At least it is still online. Hopefully Papermate isn't giving up.

HOWEVER, the clip part is made of cheap stamped 'metal' and quickly was bent out away from the barrel of the pen. Small needle nose pliers couldn't really return it to the right position.

With succint and vivid detail, he describes the introduction of sod as a building material, and gives the reader a feel for how it might have felt to live in such a building. This book is illustrated in his whimsical, somewhat abstract style which is sometimes reminiscent of cave drawings. This makes an excellent (and unromantic) complement toDandelionsand could be a precursor toOn the Banks of Plum Creek (Little House).

They teach a country style waltz. The moves look like country line dancing and waltz meshed together; it is laughable. The second video is very short and useless; it teaches about 5 moves. The first(primary) video teaches a lot of moves, but only 3 of them are worthy of being used in a real ballroom(as opposed to a country bar). The teacher is monotone. He also attempts to teach proper form; that attempt was so bad that I had to spend extra time to erase his instruction and re-establish my development prior to his \\"assistance\\". Most of the steps are nearly impossible to learn as his partners long dress is often blocking vision of his feet. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"I have to agree with the other review, about the poorness of this video. The man has little to no form, and in most steps just looks like he is walking...not dancing. In addition, at the start of the video the make the point to say that many beginners suddenly drop on count one to start their rise...this is exactly what the girl does in the video. Their posture is awful and their frame is horrible. I find it hard to trust she even knows most of the figures well. If you want a good American Waltz video look at [...] or something, these are professionals who are teaching. While this video might be good for very beginners, it is certainly not for someone who knows something about waltz already. Even if you are a beginner, I would suggest something different. Start with good skills, don't learn something wrong and then need to relearn it again in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on Surgical Pathology","review":"One of the best book I have ever encountered on the Surgical Pathology.

It's a really good guide for beginners. It is full of pictures and there's a glossary at the end of the book. The only thing is, the pictures, the models are a bit old, so they might not inspire you enough for sewing. But don't care about that part, you'll sew the patterns you buy, anyway. :) The book is spiral-binded, which makes it easy to use when you work from it.

With the exception of explaining the mechanics of the sewing machine, this book covers very little on how to use a patterns, different fabrics, how to place a pattern on fabric or any of the elementary basics needed to sew anything. It is very much a waste on money, and I strongly urge those interested in learning how to sew either purchase a book like \\"The Complete Guide to Sewing\\" by Readers Digest or talk to your local fabric store about sewing classes.

The projects after the techniques were outdated and uninspiring. Clearly, projects from the early 90s - one \\"shirt\\" that was more like a hospital scrub had a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle toy in the pocket. While I'm not the coolest most hip person, I would not make the shirts, elastic waist skirts, and elastic waist pants that are shown in this book.

I received it as a gift to help me navigate my new sewing machine. I am truly a beginner, and have found that this book is a great resource.My only complaint is that the design and projects are extremely dated. I can't imagine anyone making the clothes in this book, and even the home decor projects look old. I have made only one project for practice--a pillow--and don't anticipate looking to this book for design ideas.I also have the SEW (Sew Everything Workshop) manual which includes more youthful projects and is generally more \\"fun.\\" Still, I'd recommend buying \\"Sewing 101\\" for the excellent technical guidance.

Katie and Tyrone soon discover the first of several clues planted by Shenanigans and with the help of Linda and the children in the studio audience, recover the bat just in time for Tyrone to participate in the Dinosaur baseball play-offs. Linda Arnold's compositions are delightful and her troupe of actors put on a captivating show.

Having a third grade child, I don't know how accurately he could do that. Even in the end, when she realizes that her actions have hurt many people, she does not directly apologize to Roger, the student she has hurt the most. I have been a children's librarian.

Color Harmony 2 is an absurdly shallow and garish overview of one of the most sacred realms in art (and the human sensory experience): color. The author has the arrogance to make ridiculous statements about color--\\"rules\\" that we are expected to believe without context or proof.

Don't buy this book if you are interested in the art form itself. This book is actually a collection of poems, and only one poem is about bodypainting.

As someone else mentioned in another review this book reads totally unlike ANY war memoirs I have ever read. It seems to be simply a disjointed and poorly written collection of fictional scenes to make the point that war is bad and Germans did lots of bad things to the innocent Russian people. That's fine as far as it goes but it shouldn't be passed off as a non-fiction book about WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Hell with this","review":"Dreadful. It is almost a wonder Mittlemann fought for Germany and wound up living in England and not the Soviet Union, for there is no mistaking his sympathies are with Marx and Lenin. Too often the book is punctuated with long speeches given by soulful Soviets on the merits of Bolshevism, all of which seems dated and silly in today's light. It certainly raises the question when this book was written, because few if any today would be caught singing the praises of the corrupt and inept politburo. Curiously as well, there is little fellowship that Mittlemann feels to the men of his unit, which is atypical for those who walked in harm's way. To Mittlemann the Wehrmacht stumbles and bumbles its away to annihilation, and it is only through his cunning and luck that he manages to make it through. Oddly the reader is left with no feelings for him. Like Hans Schmidt's SS Panzergrenadier, this is a frivolous polemic masking as a memoir"},{"rating":"1","title":"stay away from this one","review":"It's a ridiculous book, the worst I've read on WWII. Herr Metelmann, according to his own account, spent most of the war patting Russians on the shoulders, making friends, admiring the Soviet Union, and avoiding combat at all cost. The book sounds very false, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through Hell for Hitler","review":"I have read two of the reviews for this book with immense disappointment. I was lucky enough to hear Mr. Metelmann talk about his book and his experiences in the war and to suggest that because he does not talk about gun specifications he has fabricated his account and that the book is fiction is a disgrace. He is now a committed pacifist, mainly because of his experiences of war and his upbringing in Hitler's Germany. He wrote his extremely moving account of his experiences as a result of talking to young people in England about his life so that they would have a better understanding as to how a civilised country like Germany could have behaved in the way it did during WW2 in order that it won't happen again. This is an important book, compulsive reading and acts as a great tonic to the blood and guts of many modern histories. It ranks with Guy Sajer's \\"Forgotten Soldier\\" as a brutal yet deeply humane description of war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Website Offline.","review":"The company is bankrupt according to the shining stars website.

The tone of the book is all over the place - sometimes conversational and sometimes very academic, which makes it hard to read. There are not enough sample problems in the text to demonstrate even a small selection of the questions at the end of each chapter. The answers to the odd questions are sometimes strangely wrong (i.e. for a problem about Anna and Bob, answers were given for Bob and Al. Who's Al? At least the numbers were right.) There are no answers to the even questions. There are no solutions in the book and a separate solutions manual is not available even for the odd questions.I gave this 2 stars instead of just 1 because some of the relativity examples are different than the typical explanations in other books, which gives students more than one explanation to learn from. But this is a skinny book that seems to cost quite a bit and lacks in several areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"A learning tool that takes a step in the wrong direction.","review":"As a physics student using this book as a main text, I found it of little help as a learning aid. While Dr. Harris does do a wonderful job explaining the Schroedinger equation he does a very poor job at relaiting it to applications and explaining anything else. His writing style is inconsistant, going from conversational to lecturelike often within the same paragraph, and overly complex. Most explinations are overly analizied and the same material can be found using fewer words in other texts.The problems that go along with each section of this book are also very poor. It is very seldom that the problems from a section actually correspond to the section of the book they are said to. The lack of in text examples, and especially the lack of complete work on the few examples there are, as well as the lack solutions to answers also makes learning from this book very difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most inefficient learning possible","review":"This subject doesn't need to be hard, but this book makes it as hard as possible. It makes the student hunt for the needed information to work the practice problems. This makes the time spent doing homework very nonproductive. One may attempt to justify this approach as forcing the student to developed problem solving skills. This argument is just bunk! The best way to teach problem solving skills is to give the student as many tools as possible and then giving them the chance to practice. This technique is well proven. That's why it's used for all math classes up through differential equation and linear algebra. If math texts were written like this book, very few people would get through algebra let alone anything more advanced. If your instructor is good, you should be OK, but if you need to rely on the book, you're if for a miserable experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's The Firmware, Stupid...","review":"It's nice to have 3 discs in the machine at once, but this machine has very limited programming options, the remote control IR emitter is weak, and I frequently get the universal \\"NO\\" symbol (a red circle with a red line through it) whenever I try to do *anything*. This is the first DVD player I've bought, so maybe they are all like this, but I hope not.

Who knew that Gould could infuse this work with such passion? The Ravel alone is worth five stars.

One of our biggest disappointments was the title song. We have hadNo!for a while and the raucous \\"Bed Bed Bed\\" is one of our children's favorite \\"go to sleep\\" songs. The one here is a gentle lullaby, and lacks the musical irony of the original. The remainder of the songs have some of TMBG's quirky sense of humor.The book was also somewhat of a disappointment. The \\"stories\\" are merely the illustrated lyrics to the songs. Some of the illustrations are entertaining, but as a stand-alone book it is rather week. The songs are not very 'sing-along'able, and the stories themselves read as the lyrics of songs rather than stories. When read with the CD, the pacing is out of kilter. Some songs have a ton of words on a few pages, while with others, we found ourselves turning the pages rapidly just to keep up with the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"My TMBG kid...","review":"My 3 1/2 year old son LOVES this book and cd!

Doherty decided to spend the bulk of his story decribing how the psychic warriors were chosen, trained, and deployed and not enough time developing the plot. Doherty did a good job researching and creating the concept (in this case, soldiers who can use their minds to wage war), but the plot borders too much on the fantastic.Here's hoping that the sequel to \\"Psychic Warrior\\" takes off early with a great plot and saves this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very entertaining and good read","review":"I have read several of his books loved some, didn't like others.

I am 40 pages into the book and its awful. I can't believe the copy write is 1997 because the stories all seem to come from the 1930's and 50's. What was the author thinking? Couldn't she find some 80's or 90's women to share their child birthing stories? I couldn't at all relate to the women in the book.

Seriously if you try those you'll never turn back, they're worth searching for online.The thing I don't like about these Paper Mate pens is that they bleed every once and a while.

I am currently reading this story to my young infant while she enjoys the beautiful colors and the rhythmic sound of my voice reading the poem while at the same time it is equally enjoyed by my 3 year old as he learns about all the exciting changes that autumn brings.

There were hardly any liberal democracies in that age, so companies did deal with left wing and right wing dictators. Most American, British and French companies did stop dealing with him once it became obvious that he was worse than your average banana republic dictator.As for the post W.W.2 \\"collaborations\\", the U.S. actively pursued Nazi war criminals.

Gould released them seperately on vinyl for Columbia in the 1960'a. That recording, as included on this two CD set, is very special.Particularly, Opus 118 #2. Gould kind of draws out the inner voices of these intimate Brahms piano pieces like no other pianist I have heard.

A leather case and a slighly cheaper vinyl case. We have one for our s230 and one for our s410.The vinyl case is actually a bit nicer -- navy blue rather than black, a nice metal label rather than cheap printing on leather, it's a better fit for the s410 too (Canon moved the wrist strap attachment in that model).Either one is quite decent, nicely priced, and really essential.

Some of his writting is too cynical, some is just plain wrong, and some so contrdictory as to be silly. His chapter about the Justinian code is ridiculous because the Justinian code is the wave of the future, a code subject to abuse, a threat to the left and right in Europe who model the European Union's proposed constitution after it, etc. I read the chapter twice to see if i missed something or that Cantor must not have read his own material because it was just plain dumb.There are many books about this subject matter, thousands in fact, but i wouldn't waste my time with this book which is more like a Reader's Digest for Cliff Note readers about Antiquity.

Like many other reviewers I thought the book was remarkably poor. In addition to factual errors and tendentious interpretations, the book is incredibly poorly written. I thought it might be suitable to teach at the undergraduate level, but in fact it reads as if it were written by an undergraduate, or a very gifted high school student. At times it seems as if portions of the book weren't finished and the sentence-long paragraphs that appear in it are the remains of the outline the author wrote from. I'm saddened, but not surprised, that Cantor wrote a book like this. What does surprise me is that his editors published it in this form. Frankly, its an embarrassment.

First of all the flimsy box containing the guitar had nothing around to protect the plywood \\"guitar\\" and was shipped in a huge over sized box with nothing inside to protect it from anything. As cheap as the guitar is made and with no protection I am surprised there is as many good reviews on this guitar. I bought it because it seemed safe due to all the raving how good it was for a cheapo...I was VERY upset at the material this was made from. I am being nice giving it a 2 because it is play able for a kid or something.. but NOT for a serious musician. Actually..

This guitar seems pretty nice out of the box. Sounds good, and the action is not as high as people have been saying. All told, I'd say it is a pretty good guitar for the price. I was about to downgrade it for not having two knobs for the guitar strap...then I remembered that acoustics only have the one knob at the bottom. If you are looking at a good beginner's guitar, this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"Just got this guitar yesterday. Will be used as my beater backup. Have played it for about an hour and for the money, I cannot imagine getting a better deal. Clearly, when comparing it to my Seagull there is a huge step down in components/quality, but....the setup is surprisingly good and the sound is more than adequate for me. I've discovered no significant flaws, though a change of strings is probably advised. Overall the guitar I received was good-to-go straight out of the box. Well worth the money, an excellent starter guitar or worry free back up, and the flat finish definitely works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product.

Her prof said he was glad she didn't get a low end wal-mart special. Good beginners guitar. She'd found one on the web ordered it and it turned out to be a child sized one. She was in a panic for a guitar so we found this one on the web and had it shipped one day. It didn't show up at Fed Ex when it was supposed to. We called back and Amazon shipped another one One-Day which got there barely in time. The original guitar order showed up four days later which she refused. Amazon handled the return nicely and waived the one day shipping charge. Very happy with the customer service. Not so happy with the shipping.

I was able to adjust the action down remarkably far, further than I originally anticipated, and I have not experienced any of the frequent tuning issues mentioned before.

I read the reviews here and was very optimistic. got it and started playing and sounds decent there was just one fret that would buzz everytime i played it. but around 2 months ago the fret buzz started getting worse and worse. it started happening on more and more frets. my high e string now is almost entirely unplayable. i dont know if maybe the dry colorado climate has anything to do with it, maybe i got a defective one, i don't know, but its definitely aggravating. it was a good guitar to learn on but i am in definite need of an upgrade. i would enjoy playing my high e string."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's great, but the strings vibrate too often","review":"I was quite surprised to see how large the box this guitar came in from amazon...nothing was wrong with it, just interestingAny who, I just gained interest in playing the guitar but I have no clue with I am doing; I'm just strumming the stringsI just need to find some good tutorials to teach me the stuffthe build quality is decent, it uses those cheap printers to print a wooden patternthe strings when tuned are great, but wow do they vibrate"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good tone, smooth action, quick delivery, great price!","review":"I just received this guitar about an hour ago.

Have it tuned, doesnt make near the sound when playing chords that you hear online. I have friends who are professinal musicians and I am embarrassed to bring this over to have them tune it.The first and the 6th strings have a horrible rattle/vibration to them.

The strings were so far from the neck that it would have been very hard and frustrating to learn on this, and there was buzzing in the first and second frets.

This one had good reviews, so I gave it a try. I knew it wouldn't be anything amazing, but still expected, based on the reviews, something a bit better than I got.It's very light, with a flimsy feel to it, enhanced by the matte finish ... it really DOES look like a balsa-wood airplane. The high action hurt my fingers, so I immediately swapped the fairly heavy strings it came with for a lighter set of Martin steel strings, and noticed a further deterioration in the already only so-so tone. It stays in tune quite well, but no matter what I do it just sounds ... cheap.If you're an absolute beginner (or are buying for a child who will probably get bored with the guitar in a few months) and don't want to spend much, this may be an ok 'first guitar', but a more experienced player will want something better. Something that I am now saving my pennies to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"It's a very good quality guitar(For it's price), and it sounds great. The only problem is that the strings are much higher up on the fret board then a normal guitar, so that makes playing it more difficult."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating Buzzing Noise","review":"The title itself explains pretty much. When I first received the guitar, I thought it was flawless. It wasn't so expensive, had a simple design and had a decent sound. But after three days of playing, I started hearing some buzzing sound and the buzzing noise got even worse after a week. It's the lowest string at 1st and 2nd fret where the buzzing noise always occurs. It's so irritating that I'll have to go to a local musical instrument store to check with the professionals. The only reason I'm not returning this guitar is just because it is cheap. That is all for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"this for my sons who plays guitar quite long now. they love its great and loud sound, more than their 2 first guitars they're using for years now.. packaging is great not to be broken, so it came perfectly in good condition. and it came just in time they promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I couldn't be more pleased with this guitar.

I wasn't sure if the novelty of trying to learn the guitar would wear off quickly so I got this guitar for it's price but have been playing and taking lessons on it ever since. The best part is you won't feel so guilty when you leave your guitar lying around catching dust, if after awhile you realize you don't play the guitar much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very high action","review":"I will trust the experts that this is a 5-star guitar. I just started playing. But, be warned, the action on this guitar (or at least the one I got) is very high. Apparently \\"action\\" is the term for how much pressure you must apply to the strings in order to push them down. I also bought an electric guitar, and the action on that is much lower.A benefit of having a high action guitar is that my fingers are going to be really tough. Suggestion: practice the E chord each day until you're about to cry (which takes about 5 minutes your first day), and within about two weeks you will have developed the calluses necessary to actually play the guitar for extended periods. Tip from a friend: don't play right after a bath or shower, when your skin is weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it!","review":"I absolutely would NOT recommend this guitar, unless you just feel like wasting your money. First off, it comes with an awful, obnoxious sticker on the pickguard, which is nearly impossible to remove. Also, the action on it is low, which causes a really annoying buzz when you play the low E string and A string. The only thing this guitar could possibly be good for is firewood."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am disappointed","review":"I was looking forward to receive that item for a week.

Out of all the guitars that I looked at, this one looked like a quality good priced guitar. I made the right decision.I have played the guitar quite a bit over the last two years, and it has kept its nice beautiful sound. It doesn't have the 'twangy' sound that many cheap guitars seem to have--even with the original strings. The guitar seems to always stay tuned, which I know is often a quality that is lacking in cheaply priced guitars. I rarely have to go back and re-tune the guitar.In addition to this, the guitar has a beautiful finish that I have found to be pretty durable against hard and sharp surfaces.Overall, I am still extremely pleased with the guitar and would recommend it to anyone.

The next time I tried to use it, the thing wouldn't even turn on, wouldn't charge - nothing! Microsoft support was no help, thankfully the store took it back. Its certainly the most fashionable 360 headset, but probably the least functional (no mute button!?! I realize I could turn the thing off if playing a game I'm not chatting in, but then I risk having to hear gamers scream over surround sound, which means the whole house has to hear it as well - not pleasant). The headset isn't really adjustable in any significant way, which was an issue for me, because the mic was always visible in the corner of my eye, and I've got elephant ears.All in all, it looks pretty sharp (especially with a Halo 3 360), and maybe at $30 I'd be able to overlook the missing features and performance issues, but this is not worth the suggested price.

I plugged it in to the USB charger that came with it. Nothing. No lights to indicate it was charging. So I plugged it into my PC to see if it was a bad USB port. No dice.

Combine that with twisting and pulling and i believe there is a high risk of failure.You may have better luck than I, but I wanted to warn others. I am typing this with one hand because of the stitches.

I typically use heat shrink tubing as much as possible since it's a very permanent insulation and tape has never lasted too long and especially comes undone in heat and over time. I found that this tape was rated really highly and cost quite a bit more than my $1 rolls of tape from radio shack or Home Depot. I learned a valuable lesson; quality tape is much better than economy tape. I didn't think there would be a big difference but there is.

In 3 DAYS, I have yummy, crunchy, super healthy sprouts to add to my shakes, my salads, my sandwiches, or just a big bite of green goodness.

They are very informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior Design Makes This The Best","review":"I had a mason jar sprouter with the screw-on lid in the past, but this one is better. The design allows water to drain away below the sprouts, keeping them moist but never saturated. No more slimy or bitter taste from spouts stewing in water at the very bottom.

Granted, it takes awhile to get used to the speech with English words not having any endings but that was the easy part. Not only was the book fragmented, it was confusing and totally without merit.

Having said that, I feel that b/c of the intensity of the dialect, I had some trouble adequately distinguishing the female characters from eachother. This is a novel by a young Scottish author, who is (I assume), writing outside mainstream UK establishmentarian literary circles.

However, I found that refilling the pencil took so much force that I was afraid I'd break it. Even worse, the eraser is useless, due both to the design and the material. If I could find a replacement eraser that was taller & better, this would be a much better product. If I have to carry this plus a separate eraser, it's not really saving me much.Oh, and the highlighter isn't a marker. Maybe I'm stupid, but I assumed it would be.

When I received this pen, the highlighter did not work, and I found it hard to load the 0.5 mm lead into the pen. When I first took the pen into the field, the lead would break into small pieces and make writing hard, and the tip of the lead pencil would constantly come undone inside the pen. I found it extremely difficult to keep up with the movement of the field crews as the pen required constant maintenance. The black pen finally failed and I no longer use the pen. I also found it extremely difficult to reload the 0.5 mm lead. If you are looking for a durable, long lasting pen, for outside work, this is not a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"A quest for the perfect fast multipen","review":"Well my pen did work. I think how it uses \\"gravity\\" to switch between pens is neat but its also slow and awkward. I want a multi pen that is faster to use than using two pens.

Then push the release button. Hold horizontal, Rotate again and push the plunger to get a different pen. To many steps for me to fast enough.Also the \\"highlighter\\" is more of a bright orange ball point ink pen. Not one of those soft tip ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Pen","review":"Nice concept, but just doesn't work well. The orange highlighter is practically useless and worked so poorly that I asked the seller to send me another one to replace it.

It took us to places we wouldn't have otherwise gone and that I'm glad we didn't miss. For instance, without this book I would have had no idea that there were hot springs in the area (Hot Creek) or that the Alabama Hills would be both beautiful and interesting. The photography in the book is fantastic and it's just beautiful to look at even if you never intend to go. My only complaint is that the author didn't say more about the Little Lakes Valley. It was an absolutely spectacular hike, although I had to hear about it from a stranger at a campground. The author mentions it briefly, but in my opinion, it's a \\"can't miss\\" area that she should have said more about."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide to tourist spots in the area","review":"Just what you want for a travel guide.

On the contrary, the songs have fun beats and solid synth hooks. There are no sweeping textures or multilayered pieces; Adult. writes songs that are direct and minimal feeling like music from some formulaic stage of electronic music that never actually existed. The vocals, as one would expect, are dispassionate and robotic though more distorted than the norm in this scene. \\"Hand to Phone\\" is perfect for the dancefloor. \\"Minors at Nite\\" is a bleepy, analog stomp. Other standouts include \\"Pressure Suit\\" and \\"Dispassionate Furniture\\" (nice title).The album is highly recommended for fans of electroclash and industrial but probably not for techno/Ibiza pinheads. I think there would be an odd appeal for fans of punk too. If Devo were still making music and had a girl lead singer, they'd likely sound like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest techno albums in 2001!","review":"If you're not interested in simple laid-back Techno or Dance Pop reminiscent of the 80's New Wave, you might throw away this album. But if you're, you should check it out.Detroit-based The Adult manage to combine hilarious & sarcastic pop sense of Devo with simple & agressive beat-juxtaposition of Detroit Techno perfectly in this album. The Old-fashioned synthsizer melodies and the cynical voice of Nicola Kuperus remind me of Devo and The B-52's. However, the sound is basically much more sophiscated and palatable than the old stuff.I'm sure 'Resuscitation' is the highest quality of homage to 'Old School' Techno in the 21st century. Bloody good..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"Don't bother with this piece of junk. It only shoots about 2-3 feet. Makes the laser pointer a joke. This thing is terribly disappointing.Click the fire button and 5 seconds later after lots of motor noise it finally pitifully shoots the missile. Where is the stealth in that? Not only that but I couldn't reload the missle on the last site that had just shot, had to shoot the next one to put the missile on the previous site, etc.Its great that it moves quickly around and up and down, and the laser pointer feature is nice, but overall it is extremely disappointing due to its firing capabilities.

Also there seems to be some sort of error on the chapters index."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the edited edition","review":"While Fitzgerald's approach in his book may be inspirational and novel, as other comments have indicated, the book is a poor excuse for professional writing. Grammar errors abound. Errors on every single page make it difficult to accept that this book was taken as seriously as the author takes the subject matter (\\"pure\\" sailing). If you value the English language and writing (or rather editing) as a profession and means of communication, you'll be disappointed with the presentation of the material in this book.Furthermore, diagrams would be extremely helpful along the way in this book, but the complete lack of any visual aids furthers the feeling that the time devoted to this book was inadequate.Be aware that you are buying a first draft of a potentially great book.

They are: \\"I Just Sit There,\\" \\"I Told My Girl To Go Away,\\" \\"I Would Marry You Today,\\" \\"My Best Friend's Girl Is Out Of Sight\\" and \\"Pammie's On A Bummer\\" ...And they are pretty funny, in a painful, \\"The 'Sixties were so kooky\\" kinda way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware! Don't Lose Your Dongle!!!!","review":"The software is wonderful, BUT...I have (had) the premium edition ($1,200+). During a recent move, through no fault of my own, my dongle for the software got lost. They told me that I would have to pay another $1,200 to replace it. I'll do my designs in Illustrator from now on and will never do business with that company again.In this era of secure digital registration, there is no reason to require a hardware security device.To Glass Eye; you've just lost me as a customer, and as many other people I can advise against buying your software."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just can't follow it","review":"I have had this product for 5 years. Every time I try and do something with it, I just can't. I find the instructions to be confusing the layout on top to be wanting and the learning curve to be incredibly difficult. I can never get it to do what I want. I can't find anything when I'm looking for it! I want to do a simple art nouveau panel for a kitchen cabinet and I can't figure out the simplest things like setting my margins. I really want to use it because there are so many features I like. I really think it's laid out poorly and I'm good with computers! This was the biggest waste of money for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheated","review":"I had been using the demonstration edition of this software for quite awhile and finally decided to upgrade to the standard edition for $150.00. What a colossal waste of money! It DOES NOT give you anything more for the money than the free edition does. How disappointed I was when I finally realized my mistake! Don't waste your money unless you are going for the big and most expensive version! Buying the Standard Version is a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"These boots are so versatile!","review":"I love my boots. I purchased them initially because they look very comfortable. THEY ARE! They have proven to be very versatile. I have worn them with jeans, dress pants, and even with a skirt to a funeral. They were well worth the money I spent. I have worn them several dozen times and they are still scuff free. I have received several compliments on them.Only suggestion I have to those who are thinking about buying them, go down 1/2 size. They stretch out a bit and now I have to wear thick socks inside the boots so they dont clunk around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discouraging","review":"My father fought from North Africa, Italy, Southern France, Austria and finally Germany. He was wounded 4 seperate times. Received Silver Star, Purple Heart and Bronze star. His 19 year old half brother was killed beside him. All that being said, he and his comrades that I interviwed almost never took these mindless Nazis prisoner. The stories that they personally experienced of their Nazi crimes were beyond human comphrension. I am disqusted that anyone would think of these creatures in any terms but the horrible instruments of a maligant society. I am upset when I read these glowing comments on this herrondeous organization. These same men in my fathers outfit had respect and soldier to soldier consideration for the regular German Verhmacht. This movie does little to show what they were really about, which is Death and destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"This looks like a winner ( sic ).","review":"All I had to do was take a look at the jacket to formulate an opinion.Two of the photo's are from WWI ( both widely familiar ), left to right, an infantry advance in Flanders, circa 1917, and the remains of a German skeletal corpse in the aftermath of Verdun 1916. The third photo is of a torch-light victory extravaganza, that were commonly held throughout 1933.This is how the producers of this junk present their \\" product.\\"But inside, in 60 minutes, they are going to broaden your horizon on the subject of the Waffen SS. Sure!Avoid this kind of throw-away. If the conjurers' of this stuff can't even locate a real Waffen SS action photo for their cover ( which afterall is the beginning of attracting your money ),do you trust them to say something expanding inside?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter rubbish - do NOT waste your money! (013)","review":"They should be sued for saying it is a colour production, it is not. The only colour is on the cover, along with the photos that have nothing to do with the Waffen-SS. I could go on and on about the errors but why waste my time and yours? Whatever you do, don't waste your hard or otherwise earned money on this rubbish. Honestly, after over 60 years since the end of the war, and we still get stuff like this. I couldn't even sell it after I'd watched it, I ended up giving it away.A disgrace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time and Money on This Cr*p","review":"Another slapped together video that foisted upon the public by a cynical and opportunistic publisher. There really is nothing worthwhile on this disc. The historical research is nonexistent and thus the content minimal. Virtually no real images of Waffen SS troops. An absolutely horrid product. If I could give negative stars (-) below zero I would have done so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of space","review":"Standard-issue rip-off.

Loved them all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time","review":"Before Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt and George Clooney, there was Troy Donahue.At long last, Mr. Donahue's career and legacy are being honored in what I consider some of his most famous films--Parrish, Susan Slade, Rome Adventure, and Palm Springs Weekend. (Somehwere in between, he also appeared in My Blood Runs Cold and A Distant Trumpet).A bit of Trivia---Carroll O'Connor has a bit part (and I mean 'bit' part) in Parrish; Palm Springs Weekend was written by Earl Hamner, Jr., who, as you all know, went on to development a little gem called 'The Waltons'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Every Penny","review":"Today I received the box set of Romance Classic Collection(Parrish/Susan Slade/Rome Adventure /Palm Springs Weekend). When the movies were first released in the theaters I was between 13 and 16 years old and madly in love with Troy Donahue. I had his pictures plastered all over my bedroom walls. At the time I didn't know there other actors in the movies! I was too busy looking at Troy. The movies are beautifully done. Old fashioned love stories with beautiful music and scenery. Except for Palm Springs Weekend which is a light weight comedy. (Jerry Van Dyke stole the movie)Troy even sings the title song!Not a great singer, but who cares, he's Troy Donahue.I highly recommend these movies as well as A Summer Place to anyone who loves loves stories the way they are meant to be. After seeing these movies I'm a teenager again madly in love with Troy Donahue."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT CLASSICS!","review":"They don't make movies like these anymore.

This is Kimi OKUMA(Mr.).I have recently purchased a DVD which is a set of well known good old American \\"boy meets girl\\" movies.

It really recalled me of my old highschool days.I think this set is very well made and convenient to buy (in set)! Price is really reasonable, I think.Thanks AMAZON.Cheers,Kimi"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Trip Down Memory Lane","review":"I was a pre-teen when Troy Donahue was the hottest heart throb around. I, along with my girlfriends, were crazy about him. My parents would not permit me to see his movies, thinking that they were too racy for my age, and I would have to rely on reports about the movies from my friends. I felt very hard done by, and always felt that I was missing out. After seeing the movies in this collection, the only one I really love is \\"Rome Adventure\\". That film is worth the price of the entire collection. It makes it even more fun to watch knowing that Suzanne Pleshette and Donahue were romantically involved at the time. Overall, I give the collection two stars. The quality of the films is perfect, the delivery was prompt and Amazon is an easy way to safely buy films and other items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Troy's Birthday is January 27.","review":"How great that WB is releasing these movies on his birthday.

When this one arrived, the packaging was very impressive and the unit itself is very solid and well built. Definitely high quality. It came with plenty of cables (2 pci express, several sata, etc) in nylon sleeves for easy cable management.The install was very easy and the noise dampening gasket was a nice touch. The PSU is running flawlessly now for a month in a rig that has been built for major media creation and video editing with high end graphics and multiple sata hard drives. The system is a heavy configured system and this Thermaltake doesn't even blink - the power output stays very stable.I am extremely happy with the performance and abundance of power from this great Thermaltake PSU and highly recommend it for any upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"only for the way obsessed","review":"I love Sylvia Plath. I think she was a brilliant, insightful writer with an incredible sense of craft. I adore The Bell Jar, her poetry is amazing, and I have read biographies on her as well as her letters home, and I am now reading her unabridged journals.BUT... I found Johnny Panic to be tedious. The stories seemed to be lacking Plath's biting humor, and the journal excerpts were edited, and felt stilted read out of context.I was dissappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good work from a versatile writer","review":"A reader of Plath's journals and poems will find these stories fascinating because they cover many of the same themes. Ted Hughes supplies a useful introduction, although I take issue with his belief that the stories in this collection somehow deflected Plath's genius, which should have been devoted more often to poetry. I think he is wrong. Plath was a polymath and all aspect of her work support each other"},{"rating":"1","title":"Published for the sake of publication","review":"I imagine that it's fairly hard to make a diary interesting and most of the diary excerpts found in this book seem to be published just for the sake of publication rather than for the actually content. I've read other diary entries by Plath outside of this book that were very interesting, so keep looking if you want to know about Plath (Wagner-Martin wrote a wonderful biography, however). The stories weren't interesting. I couldn't get into any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Star review simply for what it is","review":"This is a dope, dirty, dusty, grimey, deep beneath the underground hip hop album. I usually write long reviews filed with a wealth of knowledge about the album but havnt had alot of time lately due to making my own music. However, everything LoDeck has put out is worth copping and checking out. He's to the point, has a lot to say, and not afraid to say it. He's got a cool accent due to the fact he moved to the states at a later age. Adds a lot to his music. The beats are from some dope underground producers mostly prior to listening unheard of by myself. I have no studied each of their discographies and am excited to hear more. Cop this and his other 2 albums especially \\"Postcards From The Third Rock.\\" It is the most straight forward album and best engineered album he has put out and will rock your ears off. It is all produced by super producer Omega One. LoDeck- Can't wait for more material from this foreigner.~~E-RokSteadY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty little blue patch guy.","review":"Well, if you're looking for a 3 foot ethernet cable, this one'll catch your eye.

I'd recommend it for sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Flying","review":"This book reminds us to think about our faith in the most ordinary of circumstances. Even those who have only flown a few times should be able to relate to the parallels the author draws between the experience of flying and the role God plays in our lives. This isn't just a \\"feel good\\" book. The author reminds us of what God requires of us, as well as what He gives us. Any Christian reading this book will feel refreshed, renewed, and resolved to practice his or her faith in everday situations as well as in crises and in celebrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book of meditations for flyers","review":"I loved these meditations! I am preparing to lead a study tour to Israel, and many of my travelers are facing their first international flight. I plan to purchase each of the participants this book! Thank you, Dr. Scott, for your insight, your wit, and your gift for sharing faith. I heartily recommend this book for seasoned travelers and for first-time flyers."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Zealand adventure","review":"Although I'm 20 years older than the targeted teenage age group that this book is directed toward I still found it entertaining. The integration of well-researched facts about New Zealand makes it clear this author has done her homework and even though I've spent many months in New Zealand I learned a lot of new things! The storyline ties suspense and mystery together with the message that taking the moral high-road really is the best way, despite how things may seem on the surface. Highly recommended for teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another depressing femdom story","review":"What is it with writers of femdom? Just like Grant Antrews, G.C. Scott, seems determined to protray dominant women in a sad light. Perhaps it is the British style that is throwing me off, but I do enjoy my BBC. No, I think instead that the reader is left beliving that no matter who dominant this femdom may be, our main male character will evidentually overcome her (or another man will) and shown her the \\"true role of women\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and Unsafe","review":"I gave this book 1 star only because you cant get less than that.I read this book and as it went on became more and more annoyed. It is unrealistic to the point of laughability. For example: Every woman effotlessly had multiple orgasms under this hapless twit of a main character's minimal attention, and the Domina lounged around at home in skimpy leather outfits constantly.The safety issues concerned me as well. People who have no clue about bdsm might think \\"Oh, Ill try that!\\" and do one of the VERY UNSAFE things he had in the books....ie; hitting someone full force across the stomach...leaving someone alone, in bondage overnight, leaving someone with their arms, wrists, etc bound behind them overnight.This person obviously has no clue and really ought to just go write something where people wont be able to Hurt Themselves from mimicing his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good morphology; Definitions, not so much.","review":"This is a good source for morphology. It could use better explaination on the way the words are listed, they're a little confusing. The definitions are very limited in content.The reason I chose this lexicon over others is the fact it includes words from all greek text editions and not just ignorantly following only the so called critical text from Nestle/Alands and UBS. Most all modern scholarship lists Nestle's and ignores Scrivener's et. al.I do recommend this book but only for the morphology, not the definitions.In all fairness, so far the definitions that are listed are mostly accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Made","review":"Clock is cheap with no glass and crooked as well.

I found the Nightingale Floor to be pretty exciting, leaving me a little breathless. The pace is slower in this book, but not because it is less interesting. I still hate to put it down and am as anxious as ever to find out what's going to happen next. As another reviewer pointed out, it takes place primarily in the winter when people are snowbound. I suspect this is just setting us up for the last book, which I anticipate being pretty exciting. If you read and enjoyed Across the Nightingale Floor, you owe it to yourself to continue the journey through this next book. I'll review the last one when I've finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grass for His Pillow","review":"I totally loved Book One. Book Two, Grass for His Pillow was a complete disappointment.

The cabinet is steel and the most of the pieces are riveted together. However, several of the rivets were lose or broken, and the fit of the steel pieces was bad. The door is attached with a piano hinge, but the fit to the cabinet is poor and cannot be adjusted.There is a shelf in the top of the cabinet that in a picture looks like a shelf for an iron, but it impossible to fit a normal size iron on it.I would not recommend this product; it gets 2 stars because it can actually be used even if it irritates me every time.

Photos of the equipment were helpful to understand how disk screen, eddy current separators, etc would work.Huge sections of MSW engineering did not even exist when the 1970's textbook was published, so be cautious of which edition you are being offered.

Of all my books on tango, this is my favorite, and becomes the favorite of most of my friends in the tango community once they get their hands on it. Part guide book, part instructional manual, the authors shine when they relate their stories of the very human and touching nature of this dance, particularly from their personal perspective. I highly recommend this book to those just curious about the subject, as well as to tangueros around the world who will laugh and cry with the authors as they relate their stories of the temptation to tango!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Easy Read","review":"\\"The Temptation to Tango\\" is an excellent introduction necessary to anyone contemplating to venture into this art form of moving meditation.

If these are representative of Canadian films, then they got work to do. This is the type of stinker that would come on Showtime or Cinemax late, late at night. The plot is thin. The S/M background is not titillating or alluring. Jason Priestley plays a weak-willed guy who could barely speak. His eyes and chest hair looked nice, but notice that the main actress strips down and he never does. Like horror movies, the villain takes forever to die. Don't waste your time on this unless you like movies that are thin on almost every aspect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canada fights at the South Shore","review":"Canada's war effort is very much in the shadows, even in its own country, where Canadians know about Dieppe and little else. South of the 49th parallel, nobody knows about Canada's war effort. This book, part of Mark Zuehlke's series on the subject, casts a perfect spotlight on the Canadian effort to hold their D-Day gains and move inland, with all of its horror, heroism, and heartbreak. Mr. Zuehlke does outstanding research and tells the story in a highly readable manner, and his writing cannot be extolled too highly. A most recommended book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canadian Army After D-Day","review":"This book tells of Canadian forces battles to hold Juno beachead after D-day. It is based mostly on interviews with members of the Canadian Army still alive when Mark Zuehlke researched this book. As such, it has flaws, but tells a part of World War II not well known. Recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book to support suicide prevention for all readers","review":"As a survivor of suicide, support group leader, crisis intervention specialist and teacher, I strongly recommend this book. It is suitable for any age group when properly supported by adults comfortable with this topic. Since 1980, the suicide rate has doubled for 10-14 year olds. Dialog must begin early and Garland offers us a wonderful opportunity to do just that without promoting her personal point of view. By reaching out to her readers to discuss this sensitive subject, she models the behavior that they may choose emulate - reaching out to others. Well done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIGHLAND RAMP CHAMP TELESCOPING RAMPS","review":"I received the ramps in 3 days with Super Saver Shipping . Can't ask for better than that. They are perfect for any loading need. I am going to use them mostly for loading my Jazzy motorized wheelchair into the back of my Buick Rendezvous but also I am going to have the heavy gate/ramp taken off of my lawn mower trailer and use the ramps to load my mower with them because they are a lot lighter and easier to handle than the steel gate that is on it. Also they can be separated into 4 parts to cut down on the weight which is crucial to me since I suffer from polyneuropathy, a disease that causes burning and excruciating pain to the feet, legs and back.

If they smoke,drink or even talk back she kills them and says she has sent them home.

It isn't exactly completely original, but it's different enough from other horror-comedies that it feels unique. The acting really isn't that bad, especially for a late-80's horror film. Angela in particular is a memorable character in the horror genre. And the comedy has some wonderfully offbeat humor. Oh yeah, and there are some interesting kills as well!

But sometimes I am left wanting explanation or justification and there is no supporting information. It doesn't appear that the author has any special experience or education with child development or any related discipline. It mentions that she has a tween child, but if this is all information only from her own experience, who is to say it is the best or right or ideal way to do things? And if her tween is not out of her tweens yet, then we have no idea if she is even successful! So I am going to look for a book that may be a bit more authoritative. Another reviewing someplace said that good parenting books for tweens are few and far between and I have to agree.

This book, by Robert Timberg, does a nice job of introducing McCain to the voting public, much of which knows little about this presidential candidate. Timberg's book is short - you can read it in a day - but it is surprisingly deep and well-researched. Timberg's judgement of McCain is positive, although not gushy. You will come away from this book not only with a better understanding of Senator McCain but a better appreciation of his positive impact on our country."},{"rating":"2","title":"John McCain: An American Odyssey","review":"An excellent objective account of John McCain. I was looking for as unbiased book on this presidential hopeful as possible. I found it in this book. Although somewhat biased myself, I appreciated the candid remarks about his renegade attitude and well publicized short temper. I firmly believe that this book will help one form his/her own opinion of McCain rather than attempt to lead you in one direction or another. If nothing else, after reading this book, you will surely walk away with an appreciation if not admiration for what John McCain went through as a 5 1/2 year POW in Viet Nam."},{"rating":"1","title":"John McCain and the Doubletalk Express","review":"An especially revealing passage indicates that McCain does not practice what he preaches, hardly a surprise.

My GPS device only works intermittently. Directions recommended are wrong. I was told to turn on a couple of streets that didn't exist in my neighborhood. The GPS doesn't show my accurate location on the map. It doesn't recommend most efficient ways to travel. Everything is just difficult, and the program/GPS unit simply doesn't work properly.

The GPS unit works very well once it is locked onto the satellites.However there are a few problems. The biggest is the route feature. If the turn is sooner than the route said it should have been, the program thinks you have made a wrong turn and will take a while to catch up to where you now are.

It's apparent that Bolton is not their favorite singer. But I think he does a fairly decent job on these covers of some favorite older songs. Some of my favorites included Reach Out I'll Be There, Knock on Wood, and Drift Away. The last selection on the disc, White Christmas, is probably my least favorite and seems somewhat out of place on this disc. All in all, Bolton does a good job in these remakes of songs from the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delerium- Epiphany","review":"Great video of Delerium in concert, I wish the crowd attending get more into the music instead of looking verey stiff."},{"rating":"1","title":"This price, both used and new, is absurd.","review":"This two disc compilation is beautiful and moving just like the art of capoeira. I would certainly purchase this, but not at the expense of reason. It is a shame that price mongers take advantage of enthusiasts, who wish nothing more than to partake in the cultural experiences of Brazil from the convenience of their homes. Often, people who can't afford to make the trip personally or have local access to music or artifacts within a reasonable distance go through platforms like Amazon to buy things at \\"fair\\" market prices advertised through the net and television.

Who knows maybe at some point it will click for me.Update 6/2008:When I get in a grove they work well, but they are still a bit awkward at times. One thing about them that I don't like is that they are a bit challenging to sharpen if you want a single smooth bevel.

They must be mixing something else into them as the consistency is a mixture between glass noodles and rice noodles. Amazon, please offer some decent noodles via the prime program.

Furthermore, calling many of these tunes \\"reggae\\" is stretching it.My advice: Buy the DELUXE version of THE HARDER THEY COME. You'll get the only Johnny Nash tunes you need (including the original, remastered version of \\"I Can See Clearly Now\\" - yeah!), as well as the cream of late-60's to early-70's reggae."},{"rating":"1","title":"His biggest hit is in a different version!","review":"Incredibly stupid of SONY to put a DIFFERENT version of I CAN SEE CLEARLY NOW on here rather than the ORIGINAL Version.

These are more for the professional user although usable by anyone, they are on the pricey side, but in my opinion, well worth the money.

The murderer was fairly apparent half way through, but not because of any clever clues. Once the murderer was revealed to the dunder heads in the script the logical working out of clues was non existent.At one point the inspector went down into the cellar with a suspect to view the electrical fuses. While there he points out that the suspect was very near the place of the murder. Of course the murder took place upstairs on the second floor. (The first floor to Brits.)

Phil Parnell lends his soul to \\"You Saw It All\\" and Shingai Shoniwa's husky voice works to great effect on \\"I Miss You\\" and in a duet with Dani on the marvelously complex \\"The Audience.\\" \\"Suddenly\\" and \\"Leave Me Now\\" are more of the sublime house that we crave, while jazz, replete with squelches and noise that only Herbert can manage, is the order of the day on \\"I Know,\\" the reworking of \\"The Last Beat,\\" and \\"On Reflection.\\" Another wonderful album from Herbert -- he just keeps getting better and better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing release.","review":"This cd is very disappointing.

Virtues: good info on the region, OK maps, OK trail info, good energy. Vices: the author seems to think that mountain biking is done on dirt roads. Almost all of the rides are on roads, and there seems to be a concerted effort to not talk about the famous single-track rides--most of the ST's listed are out-of-the-way oddities. If you want to ride classic single-track, this book is next to useless. Cosmic Ray's book is much better.Two months later: I reviewed this book after I bought it and before I went to AZ. Even then, it was clear that the book is almost entirely about roads and rarely about single-track trails. Now that I know the area, I am appalled. Bennett literally directs you to ride fire roads while ignoring the world-class single-track trails that run right around those same roads! Inexplicable.

After seeing the amazing quality and value I came back and bought another two pots and recommended them to my friends. I have a large family and very often cook big quantities that require the use of stockpots and this pot is by far the best pot I have ever used. The heat is distributed evenly, the handles are firmly riveted and look like they can never fall off, unlike some of my other pots (even Farberware). The tight fitting lid fits other Farberware pots in the Classic Series. I own the 6 quart, 8 quart and 10\\" skillet and the lids are all interchangable.

I am on the 'front-line' which is all the way at the bottom of the totem pole as a customer service rep in consumer long distance. I started working at AT&T in February of 1997 and everything that Leslie Cauley wrote in this novel-happened!!! I kept nodding my head at every turn of the page and remembering everything that happened. I decided to work for the company because of its name and in my 8 years I can't believe what has happened and how quickly it has deteriorated. Thank you Leslie Cauley for writing a book that the public (and customers) can read how fudged up Corporate America really is!!!! With the SBC merger Ms. Cauley can write a sequel to this book and hopefully call it \\"A New Era: The Triumphant Return of AT&T\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"End of The Line","review":"As a retired AT&T; employee, I found this book very gripping in describing the downfall of this great company.To me, the infighting, big egos, reckless decisions and irrational decisions made during the Internet mania of the late 90's makes it clear what happened.Anyone wanting to know what caused the downfall of AT&T; should read this book.Well written and a fast page turner to see what happens next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannot hang up on this book!","review":"In a very rivetting account of one of corporate world's best known icon, Cauley narrates the rise, growth, and fall of AT&T along with the personality struggles that shaped the board room politics in key events. Of course, the benefit of hind sight is in ample use in this book, but it still does not diminish the intensity of the observations and the quality of captivating narration. Lesser known \\"stories\\" such as the motivation for introducing female telephone operators are interspersed within the account at relevant portions of the book, and makes for very informative and interesting reading. While indirectly describing what a leadership should not do, the book is not to be seen as an academic critic of the failings of the corporarion. In fact it is far from academic (though very well researched). An excellent read. Informative. Engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"End of the line for one of America's Icons","review":"How did the Big Bell collapse? This book gives you the answer. From the government break up of the monopoly to the sheer ineptitude of its managers this book shows what happened to AT&T. With a solid business model and great strategic options this company was destroyed through egos and debt. It is very well written and gives an excellent glimpse at where telecom and multimedia are heading. Everyday reaffirms the truth that these two will have to merge. This book shows why that is and even though AT&T was unable to pull that off the sense of the company was dead on.

She has written original material that is profound and yet accessible at the same time...a mixture of the familiar and the unfamiliar. THE JOURNEY by Nancy Krebs should be heard by everyone who enjoys a good story in song. Every song on this album, which traces the Church year, draws the listener into a spiritual vignette, and all of the songs are performed beautifully, with simple arrangements so the emphasis remains on the message. And the messages are deep and very moving. Every time I listen, another song becomes my favorite. I love this album. I hope that Nancy Krebs doesn't stop here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE JOURNEY will take you to God-singing all the way!","review":"I must admit that I was not a big fan of \\"religious music\\" before listening to THE JOURNEY. However, Nancy's songs are so insightful and accessible that I find myself constantly listening to the album. Because each song has it's own flavor, varying from meditational to country to calypso and so forth, you don't get bored of listening to the entire album in one sitting. The messages, images, and biblical insight that Nancy imparts through her lyrics are profound and inspirational. The fact that Nancy wrote all of the songs, sings all of the songs, and plays the varied instruments as well, is a clear sign that God has given her many talents that she is using in His glory and honor. As you take this musical journey with Nancy, not only will you discover how close Nancy is to God, but you will also discover how close God is to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't even give it away.","review":"This product was purchased for work.

The book says it's written for novice programmers-- I'd take that with a grain of salt. If you haven't programmed before, C# can be a difficult place to start, and this book won't really make it much easier. But if you have had experience with VBA in Excel or other programs, or if you are in an experienced VB programmer, this book will ease you into C# without undue difficulty. Lots of quizzes and exercises, so you can check your progress as you go along and apply what you are learning. Only one chapter on the .Net Framework, and only one on Web programming, but these topics are dense enough that you would probably want a separate book on each topic. So, one can't really fault Jones for only touvhing lightly here.

I don't know whether this is an isolated incident or not, but I can't recommend for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, but what do you expect for $100?","review":"Sounds OK. No remote control. Designed to be used with JVC unit. From an audio viewpoint, it does fine.From a functional viewpoint, it will play 5 CD's, but with no remote, it's necessary to walk over to the unit and change the program, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reebok Men's NFL Hoody","review":"Extremely happy with this product. Quality product. My husband loved it. Fast shipping. Overall good experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ink was dried out!!","review":"I love these ink pens normally and they are hard to find in the stores anymore so, when finding them on Amazon, I was excited to get them. Once I got them....I started to use them and each one of them would dry up after a few minutes of writing. I tried almost the whole box and the same thing. I let them sit in room temp also for a while and tried again. The same thing happened. I think these had been sitting on a back shelf for a very long time and the ink dried up. Will not be purchasing from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mariah's First Two, in One","review":"Mariah meshes the songs of \\"Mariah Carey\\" and \\"Emotions\\" on this one stellar recording. She can move an audience, she can sing, look good for TV, and do it all acoustically. The only original track is her classic remake of the Jackson 5's \\"I'll Be There\\". Bottom Line: Melts two of the reasons Mariah Carey is a living legend into to one. Not essential for the casual Mariah listener."},{"rating":"2","title":"GO GIRL!","review":"Mariah Carey's Unplugged CD is the best CD that I have. I love all the songs and she accually sang them without making her voice go up and down. But that high note gets me sometimes..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best works!","review":"This album is from the good old days when Mariah still sang beautiful songs with her beautiful voice. It's a great live performance and very pleasant listening experience. Especially \\"Vision of Love\\" and \\"I'll be there\\" are fantastic. Why only 4 stars then? Because first of all it's very short (only about half an hour) and secondly, well, not every song on this album is really that fantastic. Still, it's one of her best albums and highly recommendable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It did what it was supposed to do...","review":"When Mariah Carey decided to do this concert, there was a lot of talk about her simply being a studio creation that was not nearly as talented as she was made to seem. She hadn't really performed live at that point, and with the Milli Vanilli scandal still pretty fresh in many people's minds, having an artist prove themselves was more important than ever before.Well, she did that. She came out, and sang many of her big hits, and managed to show that she had promise as a live performer. Though I can't say I prefer any of these versions over the studio recordings, each song sounds good in its own way, and you can hear she is having a good time.This is not exactly an essential recording by any means. If you just want her version of \\"I'll Be There,\\" you'd be happier with a greatest hits collection. However, if you are a hardcore fan, or are just curious how she sounded live, this is a good album to have."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS THING ISN'T VERY GOOD.","review":"THIS CD WAS SOOOO DISSAPOINTING, AND I GOT AS THE FIRST CD I EVER OWNED AT THE TIME. I MEAN, COME ON, HOW PATHETIC, ONLY 7 SONGS? THAT IS DEFINETLY A WASTE OF MONEY & NOT TO MENTION TIME!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mariah Carey Is Terrible!!!!","review":"People, stop with this Mariah Carey is the best singer to grace the earth malarki! When she sings, it is not pleasant to me. For each his own I guess, but when you have artists like Celine Dion, Whitney Houston, and Martina McBride out there, what possesses you to get all excited about Mariah and say she's the best singer in the world? I mean, Christina Aguilera can sing Mariah Carey under the table any day of the week. Could she not? Mariah's studio music is bad... and her live \\"unplugged\\" bunk is too. A friend of mind gave me this CD so I didn't waste any money on it. And it's not a music CD anymore, it's a nice coaster on which I sit my Celine Dion coffee mug. The fact of the matter is that Celine undoubtedly is the best vocalist out there, and to even mention Mariah Carey in the same manner is just ridiculous. If you want a live CD that won't make you bleed at the ears, I suggest any of Celine Dion's three live CDs. Get real, people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Mariah","review":"This is Mariah back in 1992, at the early stage of her career. Unfortunately there are only 7 songs on here totalling approximately 30 minutes, but then again this is an EP! Personally, I prefer her in an acoustic setting such as this, a lot better than with all the synths. Also of note on this album, is a cool cover of The Jackson Five's \\"I'll be There.\\" No Mariah Carey collection is complete without this album...don't be put off by the low number of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I told You","review":"I said Mariah Carey had the voice, and this proves it. She showcases it on her greatest songs of that time. Mariah Carey really is a superstar. The only reason that it gets 4 stars is because where is the new material? I'll Be There is a cover, and other than that, why should anyone buy this as aposed to her Emotions and self-titled CD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Sounds Great","review":"Mariah sounds really good in this recording. I only gave it 4 stars because of the amount of songs on it. Only seven!The Highlights of this CD are Emotions, Someday, Make It Happen and I'll Be There"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful voice and inspiring songs","review":"Mariah Carey is at her best, with songs that inspire and motivate you. Her voice is outstanding. Some are older songs but still terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER","review":"I never thought I could love any recording as much as I loved \\"Travelin\\" but David somehow manages to keep \\"upping the anty\\" with his take on all things spiritual. I had an immediate emotional reaction to this latest work (And Then It Is Morning) that just seemed to zero in on what I needed (was ready) to hear. My favorites are Lean On Love and his rendition of Just Because! The true joy was seeing him live and in person. There was a meager turn out but he sang with the same committment/humor and passion as if there were thousands. I'll never forget that! What a gift he is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love All David's Music","review":"This David Ault CD sounds different than the rest. It seems to be a little more sophisticated in its tone. But then he'll turn around and surprise you with a remake of Respect Yourself that is just downright fun. I still love his One With The World the best but I gotta give this man 5 stars for all his work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not any more.","review":"This is the fifth in this Stan Kraychik series. It seems Grant Michaels has been going downhill. This issue is just boring. I won\`t read the next one(\\"Dead as a Doornail\\"). Enough for me. Sorry Stan. You used to be so fun..."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was ok","review":"Did not enjoy this book as much as I was expecting to, judging from the nice cover. \\"Boston\\", the main character as nicknamed by another character named Cozy Dinette, is just plain nosey and gets himself involved in a myriad of nonsensical situations - I even started to hate him - I wouldn't like to meet him. The storyline drags on, but the novel DID have a decent ending, which kept me from giving this book a lower rating. The author's writing style kept me from becoming too intrigued at any point, and I had no problem putting it down. It took me about a month to read it when I could have read it in about a week. Key West is a much nicer town I feel than this book pictures it to be as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"tiny and a waste!","review":"This is ridiculously small, I love Haba toys and am not at all thrilled with the tiny size of the ice cream, the pear or the apple...bummed about only one in the package, as well as the lolli pops. incredible waste of money and shipping. I know my son will like em anyway, so I will keep them but not happy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"lively bellydance music","review":"This is the perfect CD for an ADD hyperactive bellydancer...the music is Middle Eastern, rich, lively, and the rhythm changes so often that it never gets boring. I absolutely love it! Along with the fast moves, each track has a short section of slow moves nicely played with either a violin, ney, or oud. Otherwise, be prepared to be breathless at the end of the song. It is definately a feel-good CD - puts a smile on your face."},{"rating":"1","title":"old lousy movie","review":"Stupid story line, poor photography and bad acting. Supposed to be erotica but really misses the mark badly. There is not ones redeeming quality to this film.I think I saw it for free but I realized early even for free it was not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip-Off","review":"This is a review of the DVD. It is possible (but unlikely) that the on-line version is better. I am sure the movie was a great movie when it was made and still would be BUT they cut out all the things that make a Sylvia Kristel movie interesting. It should be rated PG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and Switch","review":"This seems like a well made light, though not much better than a similar light costing $4.99 that I also purchased through Amazon. The frustrating part of the purchase is that I decided to buy it for the strobe function, as the website description says \\"a durable machined aluminum body with Hi and Low settings and emergency strobe function\\".Alas, there is no strobe function, or at least none that I could detect after reading the instructions and fiddling with the light for minutes. Maybe I'm missing something, but usually I find the descriptions fairly accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"This small book has some pretty funny covers but a lot of lame ones as well. It is just OK"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best-kept-secret","review":"Although I've always listened to \\"off the beaten path\\" bands like Sonic Youth and PJ Harvey... I had never heard of S-K until the New York Times had a long Sunday article about them back in June. Three weeks later I've purchased their entire studio catalogue and am still in the process of digesting and appreciating this very talented and unique band. I won't echo other reviewers' well-thought-out comments, but will share with you the question that comes up most when I listen to these passionate, finely-crafted and performed songs: Why is this band not appreciated more?"},{"rating":"2","title":"rock n roll","review":"this is such a great album i had to flip on my computer and write a little review. Carrie Brownstein is my new guitar hero! this album is powerful smart and cutting-edge, i think it can be appreciated by fans of indie rock AND fans of popular music. this is tight, well designed music written and performed by people unpoisoned by the oppressive boy-band-and-kid-rock-mtv scene. oh yeah, and did i mention it is really rockin? this album has more integrity, musically and otherwise, than any album i have bought in the past year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Rock and Roll Fun","review":"They rock, they play fast, hard and well, they have tons of 'tude (in that and practically nothing else they are like Jason and the Scorchers), they are nobody's victim, they assert their independence, their uncertainties and their confidence in every cut, and they are great to dance to -- for whatever age. In other words, the music that Sleater-Kinney produces is everything that has been best about rock since Elvis took the stage on Ed Sullivan years ago and, rooted in sources both black and bluegrass, reinvented popular music. And if that's not enough to sell you on this CD, Sleater-Kinney and their record company price CDs at considerably below the ridiculous stratospheric numbers most companies and performers are demanding today. Buy it today and strike a blow for rock and consumers everywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift for collectors","review":"I purchased this lp for my son's girlfriend who collects lps. Actually for my 50th birthday, all 3 of my sons gathered at one son's house for an X-box weekend (that is what I told them I wanted for my gift) while there, we brought up Amazon on my son's big screen and I told them I wanted to buy them whatever they wanted from Amazon and this is what my son's girlfriend chose so I think it is probably pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I own...","review":"Sleater Kinney's latest evolution comes in the form of three wrathful furies who condemn certain aspects of the music industry (and day to day life), and put these thoughts to peppy, sneering acoustic punk laced with bitter, funny lyrics.Every song on this CD is a keeper. From the hard-hitting, hilarious opener \\"Ballad of the Ladyman\\", to the tense, repressed \\"Was It a Lie\\" to the silky sounds of \\"The Swimmer\\", this CD always holds your interest.The guitar work is intricate as ever, the drumming so precise it's almost artistic, and the vocals are as beautiful in their pure emotion as ever. If you are like me, and you like to sing into your hairbrush, and you purchase this CD... let's say that you are doomed. :) \\"All Hands on the Bad One\\" is probably a bit more rockin' than \\"Hot Rock\\", but it certainly doesn't suffer for it.Combine smart lyrics, monster hooks, and furious percussion and what do you have? A winning band. Who knew?"},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing new here","review":"Well, it may be premature, but after one listen there was very little to grab me. Amazing to say it, but their sound, so vibrant and refreshing over the last couple albums, is starting to sound a bit stale--while I admire the purity of their indie/punk aesthetic, they needed to take a stylistic step forward here, and didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thrilling return to form","review":"After several days listening, I'm still giddy! Harder and catchier than \\"The Hot Rock,\\" this one has plenty of nice shouting, and pretty melodies, too. And it works really well as an album-- every song is engaging and interestingly complex, and they all sound good together. Even if none of the songs grabs you immediately with quite the same force as the best tracks from \\"Call the Doctor\\" or \\"Dig Me Out,\\" you may find yourself listening to the album over & over again... and liking it more each time."},{"rating":"1","title":"cacaphony","review":"if your ears could smell crap that's the sensation you'd get. I can't understand how anyone can judge this mouseketeer, garage band done by middle school kids whose parents bought them instruments 4 weeks ago for Christmas, as deserving a record label and a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slater Kinney is an alternative cliche","review":"Want some cred? Just name-drop Slater Kinney. It seems about all this band is good for these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"These caterwauling apes need their Motrin","review":"Gimme girls who're demure for boys who are fearful of getting an earful! Or even better, just play that Eminem single again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid rebound....","review":"This group's first two discs were both excellent and I felt that they slipped a little with \\"The Hot Rock\\". Its good to see that they've bounced back here. \\"Youth Decay\\" is as powerful as anything they've ever done. \\"Lady's Man\\" and the title track are great and don't overlook \\"Was it a lie\\" which shows their song writing evolving. Sleater Kinney reminds me of the Clash and makes me wish I was 16 again, like I was when London Calling came out. Here's hoping these girls become that big."},{"rating":"2","title":"More fun with a rock album...","review":"...than I've had in a hell of a long time. Perfect balance of great chops, sharp songwriting, humor, & power. The drummer is amazing. I don't even listen to much recent music, since most of it is pure scat, but I picked this up & was immediately delighted. The title track is a punk classic. Time for a new rock & roll age, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pyramids and stars have a lot in common...","review":"By accounting for the precession of the equimoxes, Vidler has made some amazing correlations between pyramids, mountains, and stars. Maybe even more amazing is the hard-to- believe but hard-to-ignore notion that our ancestors who built the Great Pyramid, whoever they are, were telling us they knew a lot more about astromomy than we have ever given them credit for. Well-written, lots of diagrams and excellent color pictures. This book ties together some of themes that Zachariah Sitchin has discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbound And Entranced","review":"This 96 page biography of Siouxsie & The Banshees features many fantastic full page photos of Siouxsie Sioux and a discography as an appendix. Published in 1989, it only covers the period from their punk beginnings to the 1988 album Peepshow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Elegant","review":"This tableware has a neutral ivory background, with an appealing, simple floral design around the edge. Colors in the border design include blue, green, coral-pink, and yellow. It has a countryside feeling, but the simplicity of the design gives a look of sophistication as well. It would be easy to work other solid colored pieces into this set (serving bowls, platters, etc.) as the range of colors in the design allows some flexibility. It is a lovely set for everyday use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undistinguished melodies pleasantly played.","review":"For all the five stars awarded by other listeners, I would expect unforgettable melodies. There are none. Despite the new age marketing, this is actually electronic pop that did not drive me away as much as never compelled me to listen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mehdi Meanderings","review":"I can't believe the amount of praise for these recordings...I am unable to hear what others claim to find in this music. Some have compared him to Yanni. While I find Yanni to be a musical genius, Mehdi's works seem disoriented and rambling. I find no inspiration in his melodies, and his intrumentation is unimaginative. His percussive accompaniment sounds like...keyboard loops. I had great expectations when I first listened to Mehdi's music, so I'm greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good effort","review":"This album is very good. Not as good as Mehdi's 4th album, but totally worth the purchase.His songs are very melodic and upbeat. No depressing dirge music here. I'm always humming along with these, whether at home or at work. Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music for yoga and snogging","review":"Mehdi makes nice instrumental music, but I don't find it as as compelling as most of the rest of the reviewers on here. (...) I found the music of Amethystium more visceral and compelling. I found Chimera by Delirium, while not strictly instrumental, more engaging. This is the music I hear when I go to my favorite sushi restaurant. It's good music; it's not necessarily music I need to hear anywhere other than my favorite sushi restaurant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strikingly familiar....where have I heard this before?","review":"Oh ya, it was inside that elevator at the embassy suites...Or wait, I think it was the background music in that 90's soft-core porn movie on Skinomax the other night.....Actually I got it now...it was playing over the ending credits of that movie my wife was watching on the Oxygen network.....No wait, it definitely was the music that that horrible magician used in his act at that small Reno casino...Now that I think about it, it was the music played by that German guy with a mullet during the fund raiser on PBS......No no no, it was the intro music on the instructional video that came with our electric dog clippers...Either way, I'm definitely NOT going to ever ever ever buy, or willingly listen to this, the musical equivalent of agent orange."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title \\"Instrumental Dream\\" says it all","review":"I purchased this album after hearing it on the radio and I instantly fell in love with the powerful melodies and rich textures. This composer pours his heart and soul into this music and it definitely shows.I have since purchased all of Mehdi's remarkable CDs and they are all truly amazing yet pleasantly different. this is one truly gifted composer and you will find yourself reaching for his CDs every time you go through your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Musical Composition to relax to.","review":"This is an excellent cd. Well worth the price. One gets the feeling that this is a labor of love and he has poured his all into making this music.Bravo and congratulations! Waiting for a concert now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Drums Distract in Instrumental Dream","review":"I couldn't help but hope that the drums would stop throughout the music so that I could hear the instrumentation. But alas the drums take the \\"Dream\\" from the \\"Instrumental.\\" About the time the instruments seem to be winning, enter the drum machine. I was looking for something a bit more flowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album I've heard so far this year...","review":"I don't care what anyone says... This is definitely one of the best albums I've heard all year. I am so used to buying CDs that only have 1 or 2 good songs that this is like a greatest hits CD. It starts with wonderful Piano / Flute Combo and ends with a Beautiful Piano Ballad.All of these tracks offer a nice and unique musical experience. Instrumental dream raises the standard for all CDs in this genre of music and what more can one ask for???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Want music that you'll love forever? Mehdi is it.","review":"I have had this album for almost a year now and I still reach for it more often than almost all the other CDs I purchased back then. Great in the morning while getting ready for work or in the car while driving."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...where have you been all my life?","review":"This artist is absolutely amazing and this album is definitely proof of that. I am a die hard Yanni Fan but this is pleasantly different and all the songs are unique works of art. This is one of those rare finds that you feel good about whenever you decide to play it. I went to soothingmusic.com, Mehdi's official site and listened to sample after sample. The feeling that came over me was one that I rarley feel with music and I just wanted to hear the samples over and over again.If you like great instrumentals and want to get an album that's worth every penny then look no further because I promise you that Instrumental Dream by Mehdi is it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring.","review":"While I was in the process of ordering some CD's by Tim Janis and Phil Coulter, some images of this CD popped up on the screen. On the basis of all the favorable reviews, I ordered a copy. Unfortunately this recording leaves me unimpressed. I have heard it said that most of the music written by Puccini and Andrew Lloyd Weber is a variation on just one theme. More so with Mehdi. Each track seemed to be very much like the next: rhythmic noodling with lackluster melodies. Obviously there are a lot of people who like Mehdi's music. For me is it unispiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a pass on this one","review":"I had to force myself to keep reading this book to the end. The main point of the book is to let your kids follow their own interests and be who they want to be - I'm not sure I needed to read a book to learn that. I expected this book to be based on research, but very little (if any) of the book referred to studies. Instead, arguments were laid out as fact, when in truth I personally found the book to be nothing more than the author's opinion (and unsupported at that). The book read like a long, fluffy, trite magazine article. Examples (\\"case studies\\"??) often included instances of modeling and plastic surgery, which, while may be commonplace in the author's Beverly Hills neighborhood, are not representative of my neighborhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pen!!","review":"I don't normally comment about something so simple as an ink pen, but this pen is probably the most comfortable writing instrument I've had the pleasure to use. I searched most of the local big box stores where I live and didn't find them readily available and was quite pleased to see them listed here on Amazon, and ordered two boxes!! Thanks Amazon!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper Mate pen","review":"The one dozen Paper Mate ballpoint pens (9530131) I ordered and received from Amazon have a serious defect. If the pen is not used for several days the ink leaks past the ball and leaves an ink blob at the tip. When beginning to write a nasty blob of ink is left on the paper. Previous similar Paper Mate pens that we purchased (not at Amazon) didn't have this defect. This purchase has been disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives you a lot to think about","review":"Very informative but written in a documentary style so don't think you'll be sitting down for a leisurely read. This is heavy stuff if you love songbirds. Fifty percent of all songbirds die each year, most during migration - the rest through habitat loss, predators, etc. That's the heavy stuff; but you'll learn so much about their songs, survival techniques, and so on. Extremely interesting but not an easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The tone is easy for non-scientists to absorb, and any with a love of birds will find it most accessible","review":"If you don't want to plough through the latest research on birds to gain insights into what's being discovered about their habits, then SONGBIRD JOURNEYS: FOUR SEASONS IN THE LIVES OF MIGRATORY BIRDS is for you. It comes for a Cornell Lab ornithologist and science writer who surveys songbird migratory habits and winter locations, using the four seasons as a foundation for exploration. While much research is reflected in SONGBIRD JOURNEYS, the tone is easy for non-scientists to absorb, and any with a love of birds will find it most accessible.Diane C. Donovan, EditorCalifornia Bookwatch"},{"rating":"2","title":"Songbird Journeys: Four Seasons in the Lives of Migratory Birds","review":"What a beautiful read! Miyoko Chu describes the spectacular yearly cycle of songbird migration in language both concise and lyrical. A perfect book for nature lovers, especially for those who focus on the avian world."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy to follow","review":"i really enjoyed this book. i've read lots of dream books that are kind of hard to follow. this one's easy to read, funny, and insightful. it answered all the questions i had about symbolism etc. i definitley recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good follow-up to Tree City Legends","review":"Denizen Kane has been one of my favorite emcees since I first saw him on Def Poetry, and he does not disappoint. \\"Patriot Act\\" is a killer song, and the first half of the album is easily five stars. It seemed to me that production was lacking in the second half, however, and that forces me to bump it down just a notch.My only problem with Denizen is that he tends to repeat his lyrics in different songs, leaving less room for total originality. Other than that, however, he's a wicked emcee; his beats are on target, his lyrics are strong, and his ability as a rapper is unquestioned."},{"rating":"2","title":"House the way I like it....","review":"Very much in the spirit of the Naked Music \\"Nude Dimensions\\" collection, this disc is clearly rooted in the r&b/funk family of house music. Mellow enough to listen too, groovey enough to keep your toes tapping, \\"Inspirations\\" strikes a great balance that seems to elude most house compilations. While reminiscent of \\"Nude Dimensions\\" in tone, the tracks on this disc are not as slickly produced, and consequently sound truer to the more barebone roots of house music. A definite recommend. (also in the same school of discs - Harry the Bastard \\"Club H\\" volume one and NiteLife volume 3 by Miguel \\"Migs\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesnt get better than this!!!","review":"There is not much to be said about this cd. Its simply amazing. Right from the start up to the worst point of this cd, the end of it, the music is soulful, with a strong vibe taking the listener far far away.............Buy this cd now that you can (I have the feeling it will soon be collectible), and it is guaranteed to deliver much more than you would except from a cd.LIFE AT ITS BEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great watch for the price (the best on Amazon from this seller). The rate for regular was a bit high, but I noticed expedited delivery would only be a dollar or two more--so I took that option. It actually came the next business day from Texas to Pittsburgh, so I was quite happy. It might have been packaged a bit too safely... :) the package was huge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy from anywhere else, other than Amazon.","review":"Only the genuine F-Action can be found on Amazon or major retailers, the booklet inside has 4 pages, if yours doesn't take it back it's not the real thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Addition","review":"I felt blessed to be able to find this hard-to-find CD. It is definitely a beautiful addition to anyone's spiritual collection. The product arrived sooner than expected. It was neatly wrapped and no damage to cover or disc. I would definitely recommend to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Awkward, ill-written, poorly plotted. Gratuitous early adolescent (American) sex. Cliche characters, wooden dialogue, dumb plot. Give this one a pass or you will regret wasting your money on it; I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bone chilling excitement","review":"The use of the English language is spectacular in this poisionous comedic drama. It grows and resets the story in perfect rythms to make the reader envious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Starts promisingly but ends with a thud.","review":"In \\"Bad Chemistry,\\" Kate Baker is a former cop, now turned social worker, who has married Joel Baker and moved toWashington, D. C. Kate's husband suddenly disappears under mysterious circumstances. The book starts out well. Kate is a sympathetic and smart character and we root for her to get to the bottom of Joel's disappearance without coming to any harm herself. Unfortunately, the books goes badly off track at the halfway point. Kate becomes Nancy Drew as she runs around interrogating anyone who might shed light on what her husband has been up to. The ending of the book is not believable and the conclusion is unsatisfying and pointless. This is too bad, since the book had promise that was ultimately unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary Krist has stolen part of my life...","review":"Where to start...this book was simply a waste of time. The characters were empty stereotypes. The plot was transparent. I wanted more detail. His presentation of Internet technology was awkward; he is clearly out of his depth. Ditto for his presentation of the pharmaceutical industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of the Year","review":"This book combines the best of both worlds. It's smart, and has lots of interesting things to say about its characters and about modern life. But it's also an impossible-to-put-down thriller. Krist writes from a woman's perspective with amazing accuracy. This book is moving, funny, and exciting. I found the ending just a little puzzling, but it was a relief, I guess, not to have everything tied up so neatly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A realistic heroine solves an unusual mystery","review":"Two aspects of this thriller set it apart from the average. First, the heroine is believably fallible. She makes stupid mistakes, trusts the wrong people, and lets her emotions control her thinking. How could I not care about the fate of such a familiar character? Second, the crime she uncovers is an interesting twist on the typical techno-biological plots. As an added bonus, Krist writes clear, effective prose that is a pleasure to read. Kathleen T. Choi, HAWAII CATHOLIC HERALD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with TRUE crime","review":"I usually read true crime, but all the hype on the cover lured me.

While most books about visual design talk almost exclusively about esthetic principals and elements, this book looks at the meaning the viewer derives from visual layout and design. While esthetics is important in design, photography, and art, the meaning being conveyed is also extremely important.This book is a bit of a heavy read - it is, after all, a textbook - but I knew it would be when I picked it up, having just read Van Leeuwen's \\"Introducing Social Semiotics: An Introductory Textbook\\".

I picked up a refill pack at the store but it was almost $4 just for the blue refill. Thankfully I came over to amazon later that day and found them for more than half off. I saw another reviewer comment that the ink in his refills was poor/dried out, I have not experienced this and it seems to perform just as well as the original black ink that came with my pen. Amazon was priced so well I stocked up, I may not need more refills for years to come. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The ink is dry!","review":"I bought a Zebra F-301 ball pen in Hong Kong and I loved to use it!

Hmmm. I found Thou Art That to be JUST mindblowing ENOUGH. The ideas were cogent and thought-bending. I enjoyed the breezy tone, but didn't feel like anything was getting skipped. Honestly, I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Joseph Campbell puts things in such vivid perspective. It is good to have him helping us with images and metaphors like he does. While readers wouldn't stand for the likes of French Philosopher Paul Ricoeur on the subject of Myth, Campbell guides the bulk of general readership into the density of this complex subject making it seem so simple. And that is why this book is so powerful. Though I did my doctoral work in Ricoeur, I loved persuing Campbells \\"Thou Art That\\" as a bit of light reading that encourages me to keep my head when I'm forming silly conclusions based on conjecture rather than myth and reason. Powerful, plainly written, a must read for any aspiring student of theology, philosophy, and interpretation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditto on the Caveat Emptor","review":"This short collection by the prolific, Joseph Campbell is disjointed, incomplete and misleading. That's probably due to the heavy handed editing mentioned a previous reviewer. The selections are skewed heavily toward traditional western religion, particularly, Christianity.Most of Campbell's followers understand that his religious inclinations were more in line with Eastern religion and philosophy. Campbell did not believe in a personal God and made that fact well known throughout his life. Yet the editor appears to go out of his way to imply that Campbell had some sort of bedside conversion or Christian revelation just before he died. Ridiculous! It difficult to imagine just how this editor was able to arrange this work. There are many great books written by Joseph Campbell, but this is not one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"This would have been Campbell's next book","review":"This volume is the next natural subject in the Joseph Campbell library. If you go back through his previous books, audio tapes, and video programs, you can pick out the themes that are displayed so righteously in this little volume. Kennedy did an outstanding job editing the talks, brief essays, interview, and discussions into a seamless thesis that begins and ends with the same statement evident throughout: The western problem is the misreading of religious metaphor as historical fact rather than connotative of a mystery that transcends human thought completely. Bravo to the Joseph Campbell Foundation for crystallizing a lifetime of brilliant thought and scholarly analysis into a truly life-affirming philosophy by a wonderful and engaging teacher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely","review":"Joseph Campbell is always a miracle. Even though this volume is very small, the ideas in it (as always) are huge. One of the things you should know about Campbell is that you can spend an hour comteplating the implications of just one paragraph. There's a rythm to reading his work; read a page or two, put book down to say \\"Whoa!,\\" pick up book and start again.Joseph Campbell challenges us to get unstuck from our metaphors to see the truth they contain and express. After 9/11, this is more important than ever. During his life, Mr. Campbell described the misinterpretation of \\"The Promised Land\\" as one of the great tragedies of our time. It is read by people \\"who are stuck to their metaphor and don't realize its reference.\\" If you want to know what that means, buy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip-off of Hot To Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. With The Soul","review":"The title of this book bears a strong resemblance to the recently published book, How To Dot. Dot. Dot. Dot. With The Soul.

I would suggest that readers review the above book and compare the similarities.J. HansenNew York, New York"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Encyclopedic Knowledge of Mythology","review":"Joseph Campbell is a brilliant thinker with an encyclopedic knowledge of mythology. THOU ART THAT, however, is filled with dense material and is not an easy read without some prior familiarity with Campbell's work - such as his TV interviews with Bill Moyers.I am also beginning to read books by some of the Jesus Seminar scholars and I find that Campbell's writings are somewhat similar while his interests are much broader in scope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless wisdom from the master of mythology","review":"With typical erudition Joseph Campbell unpacks what it means for religious narrative to be 'myth'. In so doing Campbell reveals the impulse that lies at the heart of all religious traditions, taking the interested lay reader from the particular to the universal in a way that few scholarly writers seem able. And in our day of resurgent fundamentalism the need to transcend the literal sense of religious narrative and rediscover the power of metaphor has probably never been so acute. For this reader the author's treatment of the Jesus story, although stimulating, proved a little light on detail and development. If Campbell has one weakness it is his tendancy occassionally to generalise with too much authority from too little data. Nevertheless this is a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never an Outage with Tower of Power","review":"I've listened to just about every recording Tower of Power has ever made and T.O.P. is the second best in the last 15 years, the best being \\"Rhythm and Business.\\" The tunes comprise Tower of Power's brand of funky R&B, with some jazz riffs here and there and good horn arrangements, as usual. There's little lead guitar for fans of such. Since Bruce Conte left the band in 1979, there hasn't been much of that, darn it. (Conte briefly returned to the band from 2006 to 2007.) Moreover, there really isn't a classic tune on this album, but all of them are fairly good; and there are many -- 14 tracks. Wow, I thought the CD would never end! The best of Tower of Power was definitely in the 1970s, but this disk is worth while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for ESL Students","review":"My adult student from the Philippines said this was just the kind of book that he needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excels at Mediocrity","review":"This is neither a satisfactory product nor a helpful organization. The company is a study in mediocrity. Their website, although newly redone, ultimately isn't helpful at describing products or distingushing between products, their salespeople hardly know their product, their technical support are unhelpful novices. The better news is that the product somewhat works. On clean print, the product did scan well. Practice helps but you still need to concentrate on a perfect swipe. I was suprised that it scanned very small print and even worked with fast swipes. Ultimately between the futzing around with trying to get a perfect swipe, incomplete dictionaries, frequent pen reboots, I decided to return the product. In its present state, this pen is only good for a narrow group of uses. I am hopeful that a future generation of product will scan with less effort and have a complete dictionary.

Moody, though I know he is well respected in the Christian community. I did hear that he was one of the people who discovered and taught \\"Christ in you the hope of glory\\". The problem I had with this book is that it seemed to contradict that understanding and the title. Seemed like the usual legalistic self-effort to clean up ones flesh. I could be wrong though and I will not judge Moody based upon this one book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love California's oaks...","review":"this is a magnificent book. I just cannot get over the glory of the native oaks and this book captures that glory well. It covers all native species with a nice amount of detail. The photographs are beautiful.

The book even provides information on parks and drives statewide where mature native oaks can be visited. I have had this book for many months now and it is one I continually pick up again and again. It inspired me to plant several native oaks at home and take inpeccable care of the one large oak (treasure) that came as an added bonus to a beautiful old home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and useful","review":"If you are used to books with line drawing of leaves that make it impossible to use as a reference, then you will love this book.

Though, I am curious as to why she chose to co-author a novel, because for me, this was a very welcomed change of pace.Don't get me wrong, I voraciously devour all of her descriptive tooth achingly delicious words, but this book felt different and more evolved and maybe a little tamer on the metaphors.I think a little change is always a good thing; her fans are getting older, after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"I am a long time Block fan and found that this book just lacked the imagination and poetic language as her other books.

Her stories abound with detail about what ordinary day-to-day life was like in those times.

The stories include a touch of the supernatural, romance, danger and political intrigue, stinging social commentary, and enough head-shaking humorous moments that will leave you laughing out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful (accurate) work of historical fiction","review":"Judith Merkle Riley consistently writes wonderful and accurate historical fiction. This latest work lives up to her high standards. The strong female hero adjusts her behavior as well as she can to fit well within society's conventions, making her believable and sympathetic. Throughout her travails, she remains true to character and delightfully down to earth.Ms Riley's portrayals of Cardinal Woolsey, Henry VIII, and other notable figures of the day entertain and intrigue.

Mudslide is kind of fun but is super lightweight and gets annoying after a while. Overall a really solid album..not as good as the first two, but still up there and better than most of the junk being pumped out by lesser bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Tea","review":"This tea is one of my very favorites.

After writing with one every day for several months, I found that it stopped working. Theres a built in 'power indicator' kinda thing that reminds me of a thermometer. Well the black colored 'temperature reading' of this thing has been steadily going down for months, is now at 'zero', and this pen won't work at all. What's up with that?! For almost 25 cents per pen, you think they could at least make a quality product that wouldn't stop working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Unisex Design.","review":"The Bic Cristal Stic Ball Pen (Medium Point) is far too manly and uncomfortable for a woman's soft, delicate hands.

As a consumer who has much experience with the older models of pens, I was expecting much more technological features in this pen by a trusted brand - Bic.Needless to say, when I received my pens I was ecstatic to try out this new version.I was very disappointed when I discovered that it is only any good at writing. Not only did it not have a voice-activated hands free function, but it wouldn't write in different colors, in different thicknesses, and I couldn't even calibrate it to efficiently write in cursive! Buyer beware - this thing is useless for signatures unless you have been properly educated the old fashioned way to sign your name.You get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!! Not Mac Compatible!!","review":"I recently bought these pens only to find they are not made for macs.

I don't know if it was all that tequila we drank but we both went a bit crazy ordering various items. The next day we awoke to find ourselves in bed, together, naked, with my thong spinning around the room atop the ceiling fan. We were both pretty embarrassed. We've not spoken in the weeks since then, but did manage to be cordial at the weeding in which we were both standing up in. The day after the wedding I received one of my Amazon boxes (you don't even want to know how many I received since that one night) and was shocked to find a box of Bic Pens. I realized now, I thought I was ordering a Big Penis. These was was too narrow for my intended use (I tried). They seem to write fairly well, though. Repeat, it's not a big penis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work on birds.","review":"These pens are fine for writing on paper, which is great if your life is so friggin' boring that you write on paper. I bought these so that I could draw on some small birds that I caught out in the woods behind my house. One was a cardinal. I think the other one was a sparrow but I can't be sure. When I tried to draw on them, the birds kept making a huge racket and getting all upset. They hated these pens. One got loose and flew all over the room, all freaking out and making noise. It scared my mom and knocked over a lamp and broke it. And all because of these stupid pens! Also the ink just doesn't work on feathers. You'd think that someone at BIC would have the common decency to put some sort of label on the packaging warning people of this defect. Horrible product. My mom says I should make them pay for the lamp, but they probably couldn't even write me a check because their pens are such a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"Do not microwave the BIC Cristal Stic Ball Pens for use as handwarmers.

The product arrives with neither instructions nor warnings about appropriate use.

When I first started learning I was just using the amp's overdrive and that sounded just OK. After getting the zoom pedal I found that I was practicing a lot more simply because it sounded so much better! There are 40 preset effect and after playing around with them I figured out they are modeled after a lot of my favorite tunes... thus I practiced even more! Also, part of my practice routine is to do some finger exercise drill with different scales and a metronome... kinds boring.

WHEN I AM PLAYING NORMALLY AND THEN STEP ON THE FOOT PEDAL, THE VOLUME IS AT LEAST 10 TIMES LOUDER. IF I SET THE EFFECTS VOLUME TO A COMFORTABLE LEVEL AND THEN TURN IT OFF THE NORMAL SOUND IS SO LOW I CAN'T HEAR IT. I LOOKED THROUGH THE MANUAL BUT FOUND NOTHING REGARDING THIS VOLUME ADJUSTMENT.

It has lots of interesting snippets about how certain statistical operations have come into being. The writing is clear and the anecdotes are informative. I would have like a bit more technical detail, but I can certainly understand why the author chose to make this more accessible to a general readership. Perhaps an appendix at the end of each chapter would satisfy the number crunchers.Overall, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady is Great!","review":"This is a terrific book.

This is the only book I have ever read that could seduce the innumerate into the love of numbers and mathematical reasoning."},{"rating":"1","title":"More biography than explanation","review":"A bunch of mini biographies of statisticians, along with sort-of descriptions of why what they did was important. I say sort-of because there was often not enough for me to really understand why what they did was important. I will certainly accept that the difference between parametric and nonparametric statistics is vital and has real-world implications, but this isn't the book to explain why, and maybe such a book would have to be a textbook. To me, the book hung awkwardly between \\"popular\\" and \\"science,\\" and I would have liked more on the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding for a narrow audience.....","review":"I have given several copies of this book away to my statistician colleagues, as it is an outstanding overview of the development of statistics in the twentieth century.It is not particularly technical but it probably would appeal only to statisticians, students of statistics, and others interested in the impact of statistics on the advancement of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories of the statisticians","review":"I am statistically semi-literate. I work with numbers all the time, but not with very much statistical sophistication. This book did nothing to enhance my understanding or use of statistics. It's a bunch of stories about statisticians that Salsburg has known or heard about. Yes, it's interesting to hear more about folks whose names I have seen before. But I learned nothing about statistics in the process.This is an example of popular science writing that has no science in it, it's been dumbed down so much. I am sure that this is the book that Salsburg set out to write, but it seems like a crying shame.If you already know statistics, this may be some interesting professional gossip. If you don't, why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"needs equations","review":"It is really enjoyable to read about some of the personalities behind the development of modern statistics, but the complete absence of equations is really a problem. It feels like only half the story is there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"This is not a statistics Text book, but a history of how the \\"science\\" of Statistics came about, it focuses mostly on the players, not so much the music, and as such it works extremely well. In my mind the most important topic covered is the discussion of the possible evolution of statistics. It is a sad fact that most people focus on what they know and the strengths of that knowledge, not what they don't know and the weakness that this creates. This is true not only of the lay person but the professional also. It think that is essential to understand the history of the how and why we got where we are if we are to fully appreciate what we are doing, This volume, although no exhaustive, does a high highly commendable job in this respect. Recommended for lay person and statistician alike, but particularly to those statisticians who can't shut their egos down long enough to realize that all we know are simply propositions that have not yet been falsified."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected based on other reviews","review":"This book was not what I expected at all. It's hard to describe the short comings of this book. The book is neither very technical, nor does it provide enough interesting information to laymen. With a background in science, I was expecting a more technical treatment of Statistics and its history. However, I do have to give the author credit for making his intentions clear in his preface. Unfortunately, in my opinion, the statistical topics are covered so superficially as to make them meaningless to the layman. In the end, the book ends up being a series of biographical vignettes about the figures that had a hand in the development of Statistics and its role in Science."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for both mathematical and non-mathematical","review":"This book is a wonderful depiction of the history of Statistics and its great contributors.

With the default canon strap I could only hang it on my shoulder and hope it didn't fall off. I would spend a lot of time just carrying it. Those days are a thing of the past.The strap is small and fits better in the bag than the default strap and is just less bulky. I put this on a Canon 40D and had some of the same problems other reviewers have mentioned. It will NOT fit in the right hand strap hold on the 40D.

First off, I will say that I am not a prude by any respects. But Blanche Knott has found a way to compile everything that's screwed up about human arrogance and ignorance into a compendium bursting with banality. Racism, homophobia, bigotry, misogyny; all things that people were oppressed, persecuted--even killed--over and someone (namely Blanche Knott) had the audacity to profit from this. Nice. Don't forget the Jewish jokes, Dead Baby jokes, even the disabled. I guess that de-evolution is ON THE RISE, and apparently profitable, too.

For someone who never owned a stand-alone DVD player in the past, remote control may be a little confusing at first but you will be pleased that you can choose audio/subtitle track with a click of a button.While I'm satisfied that this player can play most titles including ones some people seem to have trouble with (Saber Marionette J discs to name a few), it does not seem to like the certain layer changeover in Rurouni Kenshin #5 disc.

Stick to watching the trailer.Only watch this if you have Amazon Prime for free viewing.Horrible movie, with only a few redeeming scenes.Look elsewhere for good Korean movies.Fans of disaster flicks such as 2012 and The Day After Tomorrow will be disappointed: the bulk of the movie focuses on a bunch of characters, before the disaster hits at the end- almost like a bad Godzilla movie.I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buggy blu-ray mastering","review":"I rented this movie from Netflix and had to load it 3 times to get the menu to work right.

Ok, I'm going to get technical. At the armhole shaping on the body it says to bind off 2 sts, but on the sleeve shaping it says to bind off 5 sts. How could those pieces be sewn together and still lay properly? And, although my gauge was spot on, the finished sleeve was simply too small for the body of the sweater.

Additionally, the low number of ingredients means that you won't be stuck in the kitchen preparing a meal for hours; most of the dishes can made ready for the frying pan or oven in about 15 minutes. Still, the best aspect of the book, for those of us embracing a more low-carb lifestyle, is that each recipe lists how many serving the recipe makes along with how many calories and carbs each serving contains.

The interior wasn't non-stick, and I almost always had a thin layer of rice crust at the bottom. That, or the rice would be soggy.

The manufacturers must be aware of this, as the instructions state: \\"If you experience sticking, try spraying with a light coat of cooking oil before adding water and rice\\"-- it doesn't work, nothing seems to help; it only increases the amount of rice burned in the bottom of the pot.Also, when it's finished steaming and the light goes off, it's still using the electrical power source, so you need to remember to physically unplug the cord, otherwise it continues to consume electrical power.To clean, it has to be soaked, at least over night, using soapy water, then scrubbed.After struggling with this all year, I'm happy to say I got a new Krups rice cooker this Christmas, and can't wait to throw this into the garbage!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great product for occasional rice cooking","review":"It is a decent rice cooker for occasional usage.

It sprays foamy water all over the place through the vent-hole in the lid, like onto the counter, the floor, the side of the cooker, you, and anything else nearby. The directions that come with it are for the larger model that has a \\"warm\\" cycle, so I can't tell if this cooker turns off automatically, but it doesn't seem to. It always burns the rice even though I turn it off as soon as the water quits spraying all over the room. Also, the recipe booklet that comes with it, \\"Yan Can Cook\\", doesn't have anything to do with this cooker. Most of the recipes, in fact, don't have anything to do with ANY cooker, and involve stir-frying in a wok or using an iron skillet or saucepan, and don't even mention a cooker/steamer.

Great entertainment.I don't honestly know if everyone will experience some sort of spiritual benefit or healing as a result of listening to these chants, but the artist says she has, and I can report that I have, as well. It was also pretty amazing to wake up one morning and realising that I had been singing \\"Om Mani Padme Hum\\" in my sleep, or at least that it came to my consciousness as soon as I woke up!If you're in any way a fan of chants or world music, you'll almost certainly love this CD.

I cannot stand the sound of ANY of those things voices - I though my ears were going to start bleeding. The jokes were lame and the whole plot seemed like it was just pulled out of someones butt. I asked the 2 kids I was watching how they liked it and they said that it was not as good as they thought it would be.

I'd never pay the full price for a kettle or a Chantal kettle, no matter how pretty it was. But this kettle is very pretty and on sale so I did buy it. I'm glad to read the other reviews . . . mine never whistled when it was boiling. Or it would whistle for a couple a weeks after a descaling, but stop mysteriously. This is a problem as I always left the room while the kettle came to a boil. I dropped the kettle on the floor after almost boiling it dry because the whistle didn't work. That bent the whistle and I've never gotten it to whistle again. I haven't looked into returning it for repair because I'm not sure that if it was repaired, I'd trust it to whistle. I still use it from time to time, but it really isn't safe because it doesn't whistle and the spout won't stay open when I pour water from it.It a lot of money for a kettle with a whistle that wont operate properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, poor performance","review":"I bought this high end kettle thinking I would get a reliable tea kettle. Although it is beautiful, the handle gets extremely hot and requires a pot holder to pour the water. The tea kettle gets stains from my gas burner and this requires extra maintenance. Lastly and most disappointingly was that the kettle leaked from the pour spout only 1 year after I purchased it. For the price I paid, I thought I could get at least 7 years out of it.

Well, the design is a mess. It's hard to lift the lid out of the little area that's allotted for that, and the handle becomes super hot when boiling water since it's connected and not isolated from the rest of the pot, so you have to use the little slip cover they provide or something else (of course, this doesn't occur to me the first few times using it so I've slightly burned my hand handling it). Above all, the most disappointing part for me was that when the water is boiling, the kettle DOES NOT MAKE ANY NOISE! I was highly anticipating the 2-tone harmonica whistle to gently call me to the readiness of the water, but no. The kettle just keeps boiling and boiling the water and makes no noise. How disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"For decoration ONLY","review":"I bought this kettle for looks and that is all I got. It gets so hot as to be unusable and I had to make myself a little sleeve to put on the handle to even hold it. The finish has not held up well and even though I use commercial stainless steel cleaners and polishes it still looks horrid.

I suppose since faeries aren't real-world creatures, there can be different interpretations of precisely what a faeire is, but this book doesn't conform to what the general interpretation is: a WINGED creature.

Macro work and landscape/waterscape shots near the ground are so much easier with the angle finder on than without. I have also used it when doing portrait work to get a more flattering angle without having to kneel or stoop over the whole time.Now for the negative. It fogs up much easier than the normal eyepiece, which makes seeing anything a challenge under some conditions. And the big one for me, especially with macro work, you loose some light when using the angle finder.

When I first put the angle finder on the mk III it fit ok however the second time it was very loose and i found it difficult to use and lost many good shots of a group of shore birds until i took it off and discovered that the springs were very loose. I pushed them back into place with my finger which improved the fit but any adjustment and the adapter loosened up again. Others have reported this same problem. The optics seem ok. I would recommend this for a static set up but not for any dynamic subject. Note, the box that contained this product is labeled made in china.

The book is short on real information and contains massive ammounts of repetition e.g. much of the info in the IP routing section is repeated in the IPX routing. The writing style is dry with very little effort is made to convey understanding and many of the diagrams are utterly meaningless even with prior understanding of the point that is being made. Typical of this is the fact that every single time a diagram includes a connection to the internet the public interface of the router/proxy is shown as having a private address (172.16.x.x.) and a note is included saying that for the purposes of this diagram 172.16.x.x is to be regarded as a public IP address range- why not just make the diagram accurate!

Second, it has a filtered top to eliminate smell. Finally, it is easily transferable; you carry it just like a bucket out to your outdoor composter and everything in it easily slides out.

Maybe for a single person or a house that doesn't cook much, this would be an OK size? I also find the material a bit too fragile. I chose this over some plastic models for durability's sake, but I dropped the lid onto the base from about an inch up and it chipped in 3 spots.

If you have a single fly...Well, let's just say it took about a week for this to become a maggot fest and now, even though I have no food scraps anywhere in my kitchen anymore, I'm having trouble winning my battle with flies. So, basically, this has just become a useless decorative jar in my kitchen and I still have to run my food scraps down the to composter right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"handle is a poor design","review":"The rest of the reviewers do not lie. The handle is a very poor design. I was rinsing out the bin this morning and it slipped right off the handle and broke. I'm contacting the company now and would not purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it Says","review":"This product is great for keeping compost in the kitchen. The only improvements I would make to the product is to secure the handle better to the pot. I would not carry the pot, when full, by the handle because it is so loosely attached. This however is not a major issue when sitting on the counter. I never smell the compost in the pot, until I take the lid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive and convenient.","review":"Better than a smelly pan sitting on the counter. With the liners it is easy to take to the backyard composter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking, but fragile","review":"This is a good looking composter. It worked well for us for quite a few months. However, it is heavy and the handle is not safe. The kids usually take it to the compost. Today, the handle detached and the composter broke on the walkway. Needs to be redesigned. I'm thinking stainless steel. Don't like the idea of fingerprints. But, better than breaking easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not fit base","review":"The lid on this crock does not fit the base correctly meaning that there is plenty of room for odors to get out and flys to get in. It looks like it should fit but I think the lid has a slight warp meaning it only fits on one axis, and each time I use it I don't want to spend time spinning the lid around until it fits correctly. It's a simple thing but it makes it useless. One word - disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gnats...yuck!","review":"I was really disappointed in this. It is very attractive and would be very handy except for what is to me a big problem. Like other reviewers have stated, it attracts gnats and nasty little crawling bugs. The filter does not keep insects out. So for me this is worthless and I going back to my covered pail on the back porch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but flawed","review":"Got the red one as a gift and LOVED it. It looked like a little fire hydrant on my counter. However it has two MAJOR flaws. #1 small size: it is so small that when cooking the average dinner, it could not handle the produce scraps/peels. #2 Handle design. The handle constantly slipped off the container, until finally it slipped while I was carrying it across my patio, and the whole container shattered.This item lasted me about 2 months, and I would recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so easy","review":"I was very excited to get and begin using my compost keeper. It looks great - the color is very bright and gets a lot of attention. It does not smell and since I live alone and do not cook every day, i can go a week without removing the compost. However, it's not that easy. The lid does not seal easily. It requires two hands to try to close and tighten the lid and it is also hard to take the lid off. It also attracts fruit flies and who likes those? I was pretty frustrated when I found the exact same compost keeper at a retail store for less than half the price.It's almost easier to just keep your compost in a freezer bag in the fridge or freezer until ready to compost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"stainless steel is better","review":"This worked fine for us except for the lid, which could have been tighter. Then one day I was emptying it out in the yard and the handle slipped off and it fell out of my hands and broke, due to it being made of ceramic. So we bought a stainless steel one, not breakable, tight fitting lid, and a handle that won't come off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks aren't everything","review":"Like many other reviewers, I bought this particular compost keeper because it is nicer looking. If I were reviewing this for looks it would get 5 stars; however, there is a \\"lip\\" inside the pail so when you try to empty your kitchen scraps, they hang up around the lip and don't come out. Now you have the choice of using your hand to scrape everything out or rinsing the keeper in your sink to try to get all the scraps out - neither is a good option. It also stains badly (not that it's a major issue because it's on the inside but it is definitely unsightly). So ... if you want something that looks nice, buy this one; if you want something that is functional, look at one of the others on the market. I'm almost hoping this one will break so I have a reason to go buy the stainless steel one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good solution","review":"This product was recommended and seemed to fit what I needed. However, it caused an ant infestation. I would skip this product and get something with a lid that seals completely so that you have no unpleasant, unexpected visitors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid breaks too easily, capacity too small for practical use","review":"This is made of heavy stoneware that is too fragile. I have granite countertops and members of my household have dropped the lid on the counter (not from very high either, like 2 inches) and the thing broke immediately. I superglued it back together, but it is too easy to drop when your hands are wet given how heavy it is, and it has broken 3 times in the year I've had it. It's also too small to be useful - when I make a big salad for 2 it cannot hold all the scraps, and I end up putting half of the peelings into a paper bag next to the compost bin which defeats the whole purpose (neatness) of buying it in the first place. Now that the lid has broken again for the 3rd time, I'm throwing this piece of junk away and buying a larger, stainless steel one. Don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"best composter bin","review":"After being a life-long composter who regularly used a smelly rubbermaid bin for my family's compost collection, I have been thrilled to have this compost keeper! My husband & I use it daily as we keep it under the sink. Neither of us has noted any odor leakage, bug problems, or similar issues with other compost keepers. I've even gotten another for my mom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it.","review":"I originally spotted this item in a cute specialty kitchen store in a small town, but didn't buy it then because their price was a little high. When I got a Visa gift card for Christmas, I figured why not splurge. Well, I was happy to find the same product here on Amazon for a much lower price. We've had it on our countertop right next to the sink since the moment it arrived. It looks really cool, and we haven't smelled even a hint of odor from it, despite having put both meats and vegatables into it and leaving them there for up to a week. Good product. I am glad I got it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but poor lid fit, not the size advertised","review":"My last Norpro product (3 qt Ceramic Compost Keeper, Blue and White) ASIN: B0037NYU6Chad a great fit. Unfortunately this new one not only has a very poor fit - it is exactly the same size as the last (3 qt) even though it is advertised as 1 gallon size. Had to replace the old one because I dropped and broke the lid (and no repolacements available).I tried putting a rubber band under the sealer band but the lid still rattles -- there is still about 1-2 mm gap between the seal and the jar. I even tried putting the new lid on the old intact jar -- same results.Basically extremely poor quality control and advertising from the vendor that is 'unconcerned about truth' at best.I'll use this one until I have problems like others reported - then probably have to go to a Brick and Mortar store instead of online to make sure I get one with a correct fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT as Advertised !","review":"The item listing states in its heading and in its discription that it is a GALLON size container. I\\"d like the Norpro people to let me know..... How do you get a Gallon (128 oz.) of liquid in this container ?...Since I was only able to get Three Quart (96 oz.) into it. Maybe the Norpro people can send me more detailed instructions on how to do it because they were not in the box. ** However, in all fairness it is a very nicely made product ! !

No filter. Would like you to rectify this issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Composter","review":"This is the perfect size for my counter. The top seals completely and the filter works to keep any odors from escaping the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"handles","review":"I compost dead mice and dead insects mainly in the Countertop Compost Keeper. I toss them into the dirt later, dead mice make a great soil enhancer for asian vine roots, be sure to burn the dead mice.If you don't dump the Compost Keeper constantly, you'll have a big fungus build up. The handles on this are really badly designed, as I was carrying a full Compost load of organic grease to be used on my bike, the Compost Keeper handles snapped right off. I also compost human waste to mix in my edible garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and poor design","review":"As other reviewers have said, the composter draws fruit flies like there's no tomorrow. Also, my house guest picked up the lid to place it on top of the bucket, grazed the handle on the side of the container, and the lid cracked in two places. Now it is unusable. Actually, I'll be returning it because that is pathetic. I had the thing on my counter for about an hour. It is not durable at all. Very cheap ceramic. It does look very cute on the counter, though... Big disappointment..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This compost crock looks good on the kitchen counter, gives off zero oder, is easy to carry out to the compost bin, and is easy to clean. Should have bought it a long time ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No tight seal means fruit fly infestation, at least in Colorado","review":"I just moved to Boulder, CO where composting seems to be the norm. I don't mind putting my food in a bucket instead of the garbage disposal, but I do mind the fruit flies that come seemingly out of nowhere when I began doing this. I bought this Ceramic compost keeper thinking it would solve the fruit fly problem. It did not. This product does not have a tight seal on the lid and consequently it allows fruit flies to enter and feast and breed on my rotting food until I make a trip out to the compost pile. Pretty disgusting. Other than that, it's okay..looks nice, washes nicely in the dishwasher, doesn't smell. If there is such a place with no fruit flies, it would work just fine there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster container","review":"This container has several issues that warrant mentioning.1. it is heavy to carry2. There is no way it holds a gallon, maybe 2 quarts (false advertising!)3. The handle come off all the time which is not ideal when carrying it!4. The inside has crevices where food gets stuck making it difficult to get clean between fillings5. The supposed \\"charcoal\\" filter is worthless, as odors still permeate the kitchen.6. The quality of the ceramic is substandard, it chips easily.I've owned my for just a few months and it looks like it's been through a war. Wouldn't bother with buying another of these!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Colorful, cheerfull canister","review":"This small composter is perfect for the kitchen counter.coffee grounds,small veggie waste, and lots of small things fit inside beautifully.If I can figure out how to send a viedo I will.

Thanks, ronnie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works without smelling!","review":"We ordered this product simply to house our organics so that we weren't throwing too much away and it helps us do exactly that. The charcoal filter in the lid is perfect for keeping the smell in the container."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't Contain the Fruit Flies","review":"Fruit flies galore! No matter how often you empty this little compost bin, you're going to have fruit flies in your house. It looks great, but it doesn't work well in your house. I retired mine after about 4 months of use. You would be better off taking your compostable waste to your outside bin every time. Waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for us!","review":"My husband gave me the red version of this for Christmas and I love it! It's perfect for our needs. We fill it up and take its contents to the compost pile on average twice a week, sometimes more and sometimes less. It looks very nice on my counter. I have never, ever smelled it, and I have a very sensitive nose. We have not had any problems with fruit flies or other pests.I see that other reviewers have had trouble with the handle, and ours occasionally pops off as well. Our solution to this was the same solution I use to keep it clean: instead of dumping scraps straight into the keeper we line it with a plastic grocery bag. This is a good way to re-use the bags (no need to bother buying commercial liners), and that makes it very simple to carry the bag to the compost pile and dump out, instead of the keeper. No worries about breaking a dropped ceramic keeper, and also no need to scrub it out every time!I definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality is obvious","review":"I purchased this saw to replace an off-brand 12\\" sliding miter saw. The difference is in accuracy and quality is amazing. The saw performs as you would hope.Pros: Design, Usability, and overall QualityCons: The side reading scale. It is just different, notreally a bad thing.I have only used this saw for one project thus far and it performed flawlessly. I laid 800 sq ft og Brazilian Cherry flooring. The blade held up through the entire project and the cut quality was exellent. Though it is now due to be sharpened.This saw is in my humble opinion a well made and well thoughtout piece of equipment that performs extremely well. I will buy another one when the required."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Jay & Amazon","review":"I originally ordered a Bosch 12\\" miter-saw and waited over 2 months for it as it was on back-order. I guess the good magazine reviews sold a lot of these saws. I was not happy about waiting this long. But now am glad that I did.While I was waiting I checked out other saws here. I came across a couple of Jay's reviews and went to the local big box store to check out some of the options. Well, the Makita is by far the best saw out there. I suppose if I had got the Bosch I would have been happy with it simply because I wouldn't have known what I was missing.After contacting Amazons customer service department and expressing my dissatisfaction with the 2 month wait we worked out a deal were I changed my order to this saw, got 2 day shipping, all for a great deal. ($350 total) I feel sorry for all of the people who waited for the Bosch and missed out on a much better saw like this Makita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dual Slide Saw","review":"When our new house was built the contractor had this saw and he set it up in the garage to do his work. He told me that I could use it whenever necessary so I did use it quite often. When the time came to purchase a dual slide compound miter saw there was only one choice. Excellent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different but still worthwhile","review":"I agree with one reviewer who states that this doesn't sound that much like the first two albums which were unique. I disagree with the rating he gave though, as there are still elements of the first two, and it's Snips and Spedding after all, and they have produced a very enjoyable rock album. I'll admit being apprehensive on first listen but it grabbed me right away.

The video moves so quickly & the letter sounds are not very strong or reinforced. When it asks for the child to touch the picture that begins with a certain letter it does not even give the child any time to do it. After the first ten minutes my daughter lost interest. After paying twenty dollars for it, I will turn it on again for my daughter & hopefully she will get something out of it.

My daughter hates it and turns off the television anytime I put on this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheesy but Useful Phonics Video","review":"If your child can get past the tacky animation, this video has some valuable content. It teaches letter sounds, short vowels and sounding out three-letter words. The songs are catchy and really help reinforce the material. My three year old sings the songs throughout the day and after two weeks of watching the video almost every night, is already sounding out simple words. We also make words out of his magnetic letters to help him practice pronouncing words. The major drawback of the video is that it goes through the material very quickly, so your child will have to watch it over and over to get the concepts. Fortunately, this does not seem to be a problem for many preschoolers who don't mind repetition.

Ms. Atherton writes part mystery, part gothic, part romance and part ghost story with just enough of each element to make for a very entertaining story. She is a very descriptive writer and evokes both the place and the person well enough to use your imagination and in the right spots and her use of dialogue is very natural. Her third novel, Aunt Dimity's good deed, is however, beginning the show the classic mistake of most new writers, in that it is a bit overwritten. She takes you down a few too many paths but she brings most of it together in the end and gives you a happy, satisfying crowd pleasing ending besides.

Unfortunately only 20 minutes long, this track is an absolutely beautiful work of art. Heavy disintegration only halfway through the track leaves the loop barely clinging to life at the end - perhaps the best representation of the meaning of Basinski's work.Go into these works with an open mind, and take the time to understand Basinski's purpose in creating the Disintegration Loops.

I was completely disappointed. One and a half pages or so to explain what happened just didn't cut it and it was a little unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now You See It","review":"What started out as promising and gripping turned unbelievable and flimsy by the end. That he'd receive a note from Jhensen that just \\"fell\\" out of his folded shirt was highly implausible to me. This and the fact that there wasn't nearly enough character development of Jessica to have empathy for her situation, made it very disappointing as it began to wind down. I wanted to understand her better so I'd know why she'd do this to someone that loved her and that she supposedly loved, but I thought the last chapter was a complete copout, by both Jessica and the author. To make what she did look okay and acceptable and even a little noble, when really all it was was weak and selfish showed a lack of character all the way around.

But after the first few chapters of the book, we're basically just living inside his head. I don't feel that is compelling enough to write an entire book about. By the end of the book (and thus, finding out the entire story), I was actually miffed that I wasted my time and money on this thing.I bought this book after reading all the praise for it on Amazon.com (and in People magazine). I just wasn't impressed. I have read many books over the years and though this one had an interesting concept, the execution of it was horrible. After doing some investigating, I noticed that most of the people on Amazon that reviewed the book had reviewed only this book. Makes you wonder if they're somehow connected to the author.

It is a great accomplishment of Britney Spears. Don't Listen to these people that have rated it so badly. The album is even Better.

Rock on Britney!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"I have never listened to her new c.d. and already I know that the c.d. is the worst. I hate Britney Spears.

She will and is not ever a role-model. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazed","review":"When I first heard that Britney's first single off of 'Britney' was going to be \\"I'm a Slave 4 U\\", I thought, 'That sounds like it'll be awful.' I mean, I was seriously disgusted by a song where the title says that you're a slave for someone.Then, I heard it...and I didn't like it immediately, but the more I heard it, the better it sounded.So now I'm here recommending this to everyone reading. This song is probably one of Britney's most innovative, creative, and funky songs...along with one of her bests. So, get this CD today and listen to the song over and over. You'll really enjoy it. I know I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried to but.....","review":"i tried to listen to it again and again, hoping that i can write something good about this single but.....sorry, i'm not sure i'm listening to a song here!i never really into brit, but i do like some, a very little some of her song, we'r talking about song, right?may be she's trying to give something new to the world, she might want a change, she might wanna get some MJ spirit inside her stuffs but sorry, brit, u did it again, wrongly!i was thinking of giving no star for this one, but i think i can give one for her effort of making changes, but still, brit, vocal is the key to long term success, so, keep on polishing urs! no offence!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Britney Gettin Funky","review":"I am a huge fan so I bought this single because I buy all of them.

I'm sure that \\"Britney\\" will have other songs that are amazing like this one. I'm glad that Britney has finally tried some new producers other than Max Martin! THe Neptunes are amazing.

It has the main track and insturmental version and a new track called inteminated. Britney has showed maturity and ease as she pants get it get it. It's a whole different Britney from the one who first shocked America with her revealing school girl outfit. She's not a little girl anymore she's a women. She may not be that innocent but she was born to make us happy. I applaud Britney for choosing this track {Which was written by the NEPTUNES} she is breaking away from the typical stuff. Instead of a MAX MARTIN written one. This was a huge risk and she pull it off again. When her album is released in a week, the world will rediscover Britney Spears. I think she'll do it again.IM A SLAVE 4 U: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This has got to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard.

Basically, I admire the way her voice sounds on a few songs, but I'm a Slave 4 U is not one of them except when she's talking and not singing.I'm no real fan of Britney, but I think she is actually quite a good artist, and when I heard that she had released a new single I thought that I might like it, since I like her new albums better than her old ones. But when I heard the song, I could not believe that Britney Spears could actually sing like that. For one thing, the song doesn't have much real melody. I admire the meaning underneath the suggestive bits, but Britney is such a pure and innocent girl, and I really think that she should stop singing about sex if she wants to maintain her image as The Saint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh dear.","review":"Is it me or is Britney Spears just getting worse?When I first heard this song I turned off as it really gets on my nerves.The music is grating and not even a very good beat.If you took away the music it might sound slightly better.Except this is one of those airbrushed over artists who can't actually sing like a little teenybopper anymore because their voice is different.If Britney Spears ever sung this live(which she hardly does and when she does it sounds awful)her voice would be disgusting.So instead she plays the music and does a dance routine.I observed her so called dance routine on a music show and it wasn't any thing classy.She was basically stepping around the stage in her horrible clothes.I would suggest to avoid buying this as you'll probably come to regret it.Tape it off the radio or something.It will save you money on a below average song."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRITNEY PLAYS SEXCARD/CAN'T SHE LEARN FROM DEBBIE!","review":"Britney Spears is back....yes back with her first single from her self-title CD \\"Britney\\" (how original).Now Britney plays the sex card with \\"Im A Slave 4U\\", though the song has a good dance beat and good hooks it is just pop disposable garbage.Britney should learn from her pop star predecessor Deborah Gibson formerly Debbie Gibson that playing the sex card does NOT help ones career(...)However with Britney she keeps trying to push the envelope especially with this video, and a wardrobe only a gypsys mother could love.(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"wake up","review":"I wish I could give this no stars .I didnt buy this album i was forced to listen to it in the dark room of a photo class , and from listening to this song i can warn you this is album is (...) , not saying her other \\"songs\\" arent , but this one sinks to a new low as she trys to reinvent herself,i guess thats what you call it when someone somewhat tollerable finds out she can make more money buy dressing (...) and makeing music that is equally horrible.

Yes, he employs a vocal style many of you are familiar with...but think of , lets say, Strokes boy Casablancas himself...a sexy voice makes up for a weak song...(sometimes,also ask Iggy)but a whining wail can destroy a great song...The Shins write great songs, some of you enjoy this type of voice, some of you won't.I did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than the first album","review":"Too many that sounds like sacrilege.

It sounds like pop-alt.country-folk. I may be way off. Nonetheless, the songs on the album are great. There is really no drop off between songs, although my favorite has to be \\"Gone for Good\\" if not for the lyrics then for the pedal steel guitar. Of course music is all a matter of taste, but if you like good, laid back music with a pop sound then try it out, you could do worse..

I am an avid Shins fan, and this album didn't dissapoint me one bit. The melodies are fresh and enlightening- and James Mercer's voice is comforting in spite of some dark lyrics. Some are political, some are of course about love. Pink Bullets is by far the most original song I have ever heard. From the constant strumming of acoustic guitar riffs to the sweet harmonica that comes in at just the right time. I have listened to this song over and over and can't seem to get tired of it! That's when you know you have found something special!This album is full of worthy songs, funky CD art and is totally worth the 15 bucks. Heck, I would pay 30. Maybe even 50. Can't wait to see what else they have in store this coming year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly an Excellent Album","review":"This is my first introduction to the Shins and I'm just blown away by how cool they are. Their songs are catchy and addictive, the lyrics understated but true, but the pace of the album as a whole is what's truly remarkable. So much music these days has this manic energy about it, but this album moved foward gently and actually made me feel better as I listened to it. It's peaceful and yet fun. Can't go wrong with this buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chutes too Narrow, CD too great","review":"If you enjoy Indie music or well sculpted lyrics, get this album. Its amazing. You get hooked from the first track, the amazingly catchy \\"kissing the lipless\\". Then you have their single track, \\"So Says I\\" which is upbeat Indie bliss. \\"Young Pilgrims\\" is probably the best song on the album as a whole. Its mellow and slow, but there is so much vocal variety that you don't care. The Shins have crafted a truely magnificent album in \\"chutes too narrow\\". To sum it up in three words, I would have to say \\"buy it now\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great from start to almost immediate finish","review":"This album blows my mind at how much awesome can be packed into 10 oh so short songs. Every song is great (with the exception of 'Gone For Good' which has this weird Country feel that bugs me most of the time). It's hard not to give this 5 stars and the highest reccomendation possible, but there's just a few little things that I don't like. I'm probably the only person with that problem though. Definitely get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"feelin' groovy","review":"a rather addictive little fun-loving collection of songs. At times this band is spirited, evoking elements of beach rock, or trippy spaced-out stuff from the sixties. Then I feel hints of The Judys and later Grandaddy. All-in-all they deliver a surprising blend of joyous sounds to love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak.","review":"For many years I've believed that if I have any interest in hearing an album, that's reason enough to buy it. I knew I should have been wary of this one because I didn't like this band's debut, but I gave it a try anyway. It's been a long time since I've bought an album that was such a chore to listen to. The first time I put this on, it confused the hell out of me; not like The Velvet Underground and Sonic Youth did the first time I ever listened to them, though. It's not that I \\"didn't get it\\" or anything; there's nothing to get here. This is just a pop rock band, and a boring one at that. I completely understood what this band was all about right from the first second I put the album on; I just can't understand what's so remarkable about it. If I want to hear \\"lush, well-crafted pop,\\" I'll listen to 'Pet Sounds' or 'Revolver.' These guys suck, and this album is a total snooze fest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"It sounds too similar to the first album. The bass player isn't as good on this one, however"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely HORRIBLE !","review":"The lyrics make no sense. The singer has no concept of feeling or emotion or what it means to sing in key.The music lacks emotion and is dull. It's just ambient noise at best. There is really nothing inspiring about this music at all. I suppose this is what \\"modern\\" music is all about. But it does nothing for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those albums that you just happen to fall over","review":"I found this album as a suggestion via Amazon based on my tastes of other albums (Wilco, Franz Ferdinand, Modest Mouse).At first I was not impressed at all. Then after I listened again, \\"Saint Simon\\" jumped out at me. So I listened again, and again... that song enveloped my heart. It was the reason I listened more. And then \\"Kissing the Lipless\\" started to form into a more beautiful piece.This is one of those albums that as you listen to it, it ages gracefully like a good wine.I hate listening to albums that are so frilly that you instantly love them. That is not indicative of a good album. You want something timeless... and this my friends is it.This album wins my vote as one of the best albums I've come across in a long while. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"You know it has to be great....","review":"when you open up the liner notes. Come on, any cd that has a cut-out liner has potential. A big fan of bands like Neutral Milk Hotel, Decembrists, all the way to Flogging Molly and Sondre Lerche, I was intrigued by the lyrics- the music makes them everything they could be. \\"Pink Bullets\\" is an amazing work, and probably the best song on the cd- though \\"Gone for Good\\" is terrific, too. Actually, every song on the cd is well-worth whatever you spend, so check it out. Very seldom do you find a band or a cd that has a consistently good album without a downside- take advantage of an artistic rarity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophomores soar","review":"One of Amazon's favorite CDs of 2003 and now one of mine as well. At only 33 minutes, it's barely an album, but if you can find a better set of ten songs, you should cling to it like grim death. With witty lyrics that name-check Sir Thomas More and a song that starts with the singer witnessing an exposed ankle and \\"react[ing] like it's 1805,\\" the album is funny, far from ordinary, sing-along-able, and wonderful. It rocks and rollicks its way into your head and once it's there, you'll never get it out. Their first album is also worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indie Lover? Own this album...","review":"I didn't think that they could beat Oh, Inverted World, but they did. The Shins are so original, and have such beautiful poetic lyrics.

Amazing album, own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close your eyes and enjoy","review":"I had the pleasure of not knowing who the Shins were this September 2003. They were one of the first acts on the stage the last day of the Austin City Limits Festival. I am always grateful when I can see a band before I guy their polished, produced cd's (and troopers for waking up at the crack of 10:00AM while playing until 2:00AM the night before). They blew me away. They were probably my favorite act. Besides their unpretentiousness - even for musicians - their songs were great. Lyrically well written. Musically elegant. Simple with a great flow. Throw in great chemistry with all of the members and you have the Shins.It's just nice to see something that is what music is really all about. Just some people doing what they love. Not like Justin Timberlake or your other dime-a-dozen, overproduced, sorry excuses for musicianship.Thank you Shins!!! Good luck in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"lame and tame","review":"It has that garage band sound with lame and tame singing that leaves me limp. Where's the get up and get at it?

What a mistake. I promptly sold it to the local \\"exchange\\" store and called it a loss. It's not exactly bad music I guess, but not what I was looking for. Every song is acoustic guitar driven and just boring.

There are a few minor moments of musical worth on this album, but ultimately, most of this music isn't anything your 12 year old brother who just picked up his first acoustic guitar a month ago and has just begun strumming some standard chords couldn't write with little trouble. The adulation this band have received is really puzzling to me. Do people just like the idea of listening to something that sounds completely unprofessional and talentless? The novelty of knowing that anyone could have made it? Does that make it easy to identify with or something? That they're just a bunch of guys having fun?I really don't know what else it could be, because these songs really are some sub-par compositions with little or no melodic/harmonic value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic indie pop at it's best","review":"When I first heard this album, I was a little let down. It didn't seem quite as groundbreaking as oh, inverted world. But I listened to it over and over again and each time it became more beautiful. The melodies are entrancing (although there isn't a real strong song that catches you, like caring is creepy or new slang) and the lyrics are a lot easier to understand on this album, which is good since james is a lyrical genius. This is an amazing album, albeit a little more tame than oh inverted world, but that isn't necesarily a bad thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Album... BUY TEN EVEN!","review":"This album is truely amazing. this album is far beyond a mere fallow up to their first album (oh, inverted world). This album shows tremendous growth, the music is far more complex musically and vocally. The disc is a rather short listen at only 35 min, it leaves me wanting more... maybe thats one reason i love it so much. Anyone familuar with thier first album will find that this album offers a variety of new sound. It seems to me that this album maybe the result of the bands experimenting; even though the album is a jumble of various sounds it flows really well and is moderatly continious. This is one of those albums that i especailly enjoy listening to with headphones, turn the volume up and lose myself in it. This album will not dissapoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than oh","review":"the shins are one of my few favorite groups. both albums are brilliant but this one stands out. if you are new to the shins listen to oh inverted world first, then buy this one. you wont regret it. the songwriting matured noticeably. there aren't much better songs than saint simon"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"The first time I heard this album I wasn't sure about his voice.

Parachutes by Coldplay, Bends by Radiohead, and Ready to Die by Biggie.I heard The Shins on the soundtrack \\"Garden State\\" and my exact reaction was \\"eh\\". Then my cousin gave me both Inverted World and Chutes Too Narrow.This CD is very similar to Parachutes in that every song is good. You can pop this one in as you go to bed, or if you are doing work or something. It is also a good CD to just sit down and listen to. Sort of a similar sound throughout the whole album like Jack Johnson, but every song is pretty catchy and makes you want to keep listening. This CD also strikes me because whenever I am walking around, I find my self singing one of their songs. I just cant get them out of my head. These guys kick ass, get these two albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome alternative rock!","review":"I bought this CD as soon as it came out.

I was hoping for a little more twang to this one. This comes off as more of a Violent Femmes meets Oingo Boingo meets Supertramp album. It still gets four stars. 3 stars for the music and 5 for the lyrics. Check out the fourth track and 'Gone For Good'. They both get five stars for music and lyrics. If your a hard core country/western fan like myself, go out and get something by Slobberbone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, and not in a good way","review":"There's nothing really terrible about The Shin's album, but there's nothing particularly challenging either. I can't listen to this album without thinking of the praise that's been heaped upon it, and I just don't hear it. People refer to the influences from the sixties and the band's unique take on it, but I don't hear anything that any number of bands haven't referenced before. The most striking influences I hear are all early nineties and mid-eighties: Material Issue, Modern English, etc. The record feels as though the band members sat around playing music for each other saying, \\"We should do a song like this one!\\" The lyrics are self-consciously clever, the album's sole grace, but not on par with Jarvis, Morrissey, or Rufus.If you're an avid music fan over the age of twenty-two, you've probably heard this done before in many permutations. Otherwise, I guess this just might be your thing. To put it bluntly, it bored me."}]`),x={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:C},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},B={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",B,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",N,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,O)):b("",!0)])}const G=d(x,[["render",W],["__scopeId","data-v-337b85a6"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/23.md","filePath":"quotesmag/23.md"}'),H={name:"quotesmag/23.md"},R=Object.assign(H,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(G)]))}});export{j as __pageData,R as default};
