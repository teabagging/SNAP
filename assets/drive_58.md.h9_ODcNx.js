Santana is just going for the money here, too bad. This Cd is rife with commercialism. It must be on the Arista label instead of Santana's own label, Guts and Grace, due to the poor quality of the content. Santana's guitar still sings like no other, but the collaberators are no where close to his level of greatness. Hopefully Santana makes enough money on this Cd to enable him to start making real music again. If you are a Santana fan, save your money.

That's my opinion (and I know it's right) so if you don't like it, I'm sorry. I truly am, because that means that you like Britney Spears and I really feel sorry for you. You are a loser. That's that. So anyone with any sense, do not listen to Britney Spears. It is damaging to your mental health. If you listen to Britney Spears, your brain will begin to atrophy, leaving you with the intelligence of a flea. I'm telling you this for your own safety, because I care. So long"},{"rating":"1","title":"IGNORE THE HYPE - HIS AGE SHOWS","review":"There is far too much praise for Santana's album. After his first release, Smooth, I loved him too, but ever since he has failed to deliver. Why you may ask. It's because of his duo partners. Rob Thomas consistently ranks amongst the top of the charts with Matchbox 20. Pairing with Everlast and Eagle-eye Cherry has seen his releases not make it back into the Australian top 20, and this is the same place where those artists have generally been found. I was very disappointed with the rest of the album, and the second star only comes because of how good Smooth is."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED","review":"DUDE, THIS CD WAS LIKE A REAL DOWNER YOU KNOW.

From Dave Matthews sexy groove to Lauryn Hill's rap - it's all here, baby! There is literally something for just about every musical taste. Mr. Santana complements each piece with his virtuoso guitar playing - then they move all out into the traditional latin music. Best of all is the infectious joy of music that is shared by all the artists. In reading the liner notes, you also realize that hidden within the music is an underlying universal spirituality. Que Rico!"},{"rating":"2","title":"santana going strong","review":"Carlos Santana is a legend in the truest sense of the word .

There is the more traditional Santana world music sound, and the artist duet sound. Both are good, however, fans who only know the CD from the mainstream single \\"Smooth\\" are definately missing out on a lot more musical depth that is present here. Of the songs that do not have the help of any outside artists, (De La) Yaleo best showcases Santana's salsa influences and world music sensibility. Most of the duets are quite good, especially Put Your Lights On with Everlast, which has a downbeat mood to match the lyrics of the song, Love of My Life with Dave Matthews, which sounds very much like a Dave Matthews Band song guest starring Carlos Santana on the guitar, and Corazon Espinado with Mana, a great rock en Español song. Overall, the entire CD is good, and worth owning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't stop playing it!","review":"I'd heard and liked his music before (I'm 55 now!)but I hadn't really paid attention to him...until I heard the #1 song a few weeks ago.

Santana was alright too -- nothin like that guitar!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The album's message is spiritual harmony born of diversity.","review":"If those who review Santana truly know who he is and what he's about, then you'll understand that he isn't stretching to reach a younger demographic through commercial strategy for his own gain. He doesn't need that. That's not his purpose. Any lack of attraction to Santana by the younger generation is as a result of the lack of exposure given to this caliber of true music and offered to the masses. This isn't the typical brainless bubble-gum pop that one finds littering the airwaves. As a piece of music, it is a work of art born of collaboration ( as all of his albums have been through his fusion of world musics). The album's message is spiritual harmony born of diversity. If you don't get the message you probably don't get the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva Santana","review":"Excelente, a toda la magia conocida de Santana, supo bien en este disco, mezclar su característico sonido con otros más modernos, así como arriesgando a sumarle a su soul latino, toques de bossa nova, árabe, blues, rap, salsa, mas y mas soul, obteniendo un resutado formidable. Ritmo, fuerza, armonía, virtuosidad, arreglos perfectos, un disco altamente recomendable y que pinta para clásico. Grandiosas actuaciones de los artistas invitados. Sin desperdicios"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...and there is a hidden track!","review":"Unfortunately, I wish Santana would stick with the straight ahead latin stuff and not try to do something for everyone. Every song on here with the exception of the songs with Lauryn Hill (which is HORRIBLE) and the song Maria, Maria (which sounds like something Boys II Men would do..yuck!) are welcomed. Love of My Life (with Dave Matthews) is wonderful. Starts out funky and grooves right in to the latin sounds. Yaleo, which has been a concert favorite for years finally appears on an album. Smooth, is a nice Cha-Cha groove. (similar rhythms of Guajira and Oye Como Va).YES >>> There is a hidden track!!! It appears after \\"The Calling\\", which is track 13. It starts at 8 minutes into the same trach number. The song is called \\"Days of Celebration\\".If you have never bought a Santana album, this would be a great CD to pick up and then buy his other CD's. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fresh New Santana","review":"This album is a great blend of Santana's latin influence and contemporary collaboration. I especially like the tracks with Dave Matthews (sounding very Sting-esque) and Everclear. A prime example of its balance is the exuberence of Africa Bomba picking you up after the somewhat dark Put Your Lights On. Although somewhat transparent in its attempt to reach a broader audience, this is the freshest Santana album in some time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural","review":"Awesome CD by Carlos and all, wouldn't it be nice if Michael Bloomfield were still around to participate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but \\"guitar shop\\" playing irritating","review":"Well I do like this CD because of some strong songs, but Santana has always come across to me like a teenager who has learnt a few riffs and can't stop playing them loud and fast. There's no invention or feeling in his playing. He'll always be second tier to players like Hendrix, Clapton, Van Halen. Several of the tracks sound like he over-dubbed the guitar leads, long after the main song was finished, so they seem redundant. But enjoyable nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes profit outta other artist's singing talents","review":"Santana seems to make money from the sales all because of his featured guest's singing talents. All he seems to do is just play the electric guitar while ruining the song when there's no vox.Even though the songs are good due to other artists, don't waste your money on this album and put more change in his pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Santana \\"Supernatural\\"","review":"Very disappointing! An artist of Carlos Santana's caliber does not need mediocre guest stars to make a satisfying album.

Consider this a sellout for the youth market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to snuff","review":"Very briefly...for me, this album just did not measure up to the early Santana albums. All of those great, dark Latin rhythms and energies just don't show up in this collection of pop tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supernatural","review":"Highly overrated.

But this is a great one.Who are we to demand Santana to continue to be the one who pleased us in the 1970s? Supernatural represents today's Santana. And we should judge on its merits alone, instead of comparing today's Santana with Santana a quarter of a century ago.Supernatural is a great CD. And the man behind it is (Carlos) Santana."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was a Santana fan back in the 70's, and greatly enjoyed his music. With all the Grammy hype, I eagerly bought and looked forward to this CD. How DISAPPOINTING. It was not at all what I expected. Everyone likes \\"Smooth\\"...but in my opinion, that is the only song on this CD worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shameful Sell-Out","review":"For an artist whose career has been characterized, in my view, by a consistent dedication to the quality of his music, this piece of drek is a huge disappointment.The Amazon reviewer got it right...this cd is a blatant attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator. And in the current abysmal musical climate, the results are predictably bland and uninspired. The best song on the cd is the utterly mediocre duet with Rob Thomas, and it goes downhill fast after that. No wonder it was so sucessful at Grammy time."},{"rating":"1","title":"HAVE SOME RESPECT","review":"I can't believe that such a well respected, and talented band would stoop to recording with ROB THOMAS. While this may be the pinnacle of Rob's career, I would consider it the low point for Santana. The fact that it has become so popular is sad. Santana has almost betrayed its roots as an inspired and ORIGINAL jam band of the late 60's and early 70's. \\"Supernatural\\" lacks almost all of the bands former jam inspiration and has resorted to good marketing and the naivete of the listening commutity for success. If anyone wants to hear real Santana...uncorupted, check out \\"Live at the Fillmore '68\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything today is overrated anyway...","review":"I really like Santana, but this album doesn't do much for me. Just adding some of the newer artists such as Everlast and Dave Matthews and the God-awful Lauryn Hill, doesn't mean you should run out and buy this. Let the fifteen year olds buy this album because their favorites are on it. Carlos is good, but this album just sort of confuses most REAL Santana fans.

If you want hardcore Santana: Santana 1, Abraxas, Santana 3, Caravanserai, and Love Devotion Surrender (with virtuoso John McClaughlin) are highly recommended.

However, this is a GOOD album not his best work. A couple of rap intros, and some Clapton in the background but the meat of the music still contains the latin rythams and sweet guitar riffs he is famous for.

The fact that it is up for a Grammy leaves me speechless and in shock. 'Supernatural' sounds just like the same stuff Santana put out 20 years ago. I am not saying that he is not an incredible guitar player, it is just the same ol' stuff. 'Smooth' with Rob Thomas is the ONLY good song on there; every other song makes you hit fast forward, especially that one with Lauryn Hill (what were they thinking! ). For die-hard Santana fans, this album may please you, however I strongly recommend that anyone thinking the album is full of songs like 'Smooth' should spend their money on something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album that allows Santana to expand his artistry.","review":"Reading all of the various reviews I get the feeling that most people feel that while this is certainly a good album, it is definitely not his best.

If you really want to hear Santana, stick with the older albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely listenable","review":"I've been a Santana fan ever since I was turned on to them in 1984 and consider Carlos & Co (and the various permutations of the band) one of my all-time favorite atrists. I was disappointed with SUPERNATURAL from the moment I listened to it. There is little on this album that is not re-manufactured pop, and it in no way highlights the exceptional musicianship or band interplay that Santana is known for. Songs like \\"Maria, Maria\\" and \\"Turn Your Lights On\\" are about as far from the classic Santana sound as one can get, and the entire collection of songs has the tired \\"let's-try-to-write-a-hit-single-and-make-some-big-money\\" kind of feel.If you are seeking Santana at their pop best, check out \\"Zebop\\" or Beyond Appearances\\" instead. If you want Santana at their very best, buy the first three albums and the \\"LOTUS\\" live album as each of these four are masterpieces. Avoid SUPERNATURAL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Real","review":"The fact is that without Rob Thomas, this would have been another overlooked Santana album. Since Matchbox had waited so long to release another album, people were willing to buy this to get a fresh track from Rob. \\"Smooth\\" gets 5-stars. Most of the rest gets 1-star. Average: 1-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rap, pap, shmap, some red-eyed guys... Where's Carlos?","review":"If you really love the good old Santana just don't spend your money. That's shame for the great misician. Black Sabbuth sold their souls for r'n'r. Carlos did it for rap and money. So sad..."},{"rating":"2","title":"HE LIKES IT! HE REALLY LIKES IT!","review":"This was the first CD I had bought of Carlos Santana's and I have got to tell you, \\"WOW!\\" This was so awesome, I have no idea where to begin. The thing I liked most was the lyrics. They really meant something, instead of just going off endlessly like some other artists."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble Music","review":"Absolutley the worst garbage to hit the musice industry since ricky martin, the backdoor boys, and n sick. what next..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly over-rated - Please do not buy this travesty","review":"This cd is way over-hyped. It's trite and the lyrics are unbearingly predictable. It's commercialism to the max. and any integrity is totally watered down to appeal to a broad mass of pseudo-spritualists. It reminds me of Madonna's album which was supposed to be about enlightenment and her discovering spirituality. Oh please..This cd is a sell-out and is to spirituality what Britney Spears is to pop music.This cd makes me want to vomit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just read the credits and get sick ...","review":"I fell for the hype and I have regretted it. If you want to listen to Carlo's sublime riffs you are much better off listening to his old albums. The lyrics on this one (although not by the \\"icon\\" himself - he just cashes in big time ..) make me think of either some guy that never got off the LSD trip he took once back in the 70's or of someone who suddenly found out he suffers from an incurable disease and - too late - decides that life is all about love and light and \\"Whoo-aohaha hey lala\\" (yes they sing this ..) - It's simply too much ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre Album","review":"The first point I will make is that Carlos Santana is an amazing talent and one of the best guitar players to ever live...but this album is just a marketing strategy designed to use Santana's style and musical credibility and mix it with an MTV-friendly sound and thus sell millions of records. As we all know it worked like charm. Yet this album is a mediocre musical accomplishment. Santana's style and the style of whoever the guest artist is does never really congeal into one in any track of this album, save a few exceptions. And it is a real shame bacause Santana's talent and a few fresh ideas is all you need to a great record. No necessity to invite every trendy MTV performer to play with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music Amalgams are dicey products","review":"I can imagine some record producer telling Carlos Santana to use a variety of recording artists from several music disciplines to boost the audience appeal of this album. Santana took this advice and created an album that appeals to no one in general. I liked 2-3 tunes very much but I find that I must skip over the majority of the disc as it is not something I find a delight to hear. Carlos Santana was not a rapper and I don't find the fusion of his work with rap to be of value. I would have preferred that he take one genre and built an entire CD around it rather than jam several into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old guy, same old solo!","review":"Who awarded this \\"Album of the Year\\"? One great song doesn't make one great album. He's still playing the same solo 25 years on. So what's the difference - marketing! If you want the real thing, buy Abraxus."},{"rating":"1","title":"Various Artists CD- Santana deserves no credit","review":"The songs on this CD are all very repetitive. The lyreics are repeated over and over and each song sounds the same. The small amount of good touch in these songs are produced and prformed by other. This is the worst Santana CD I have heard. I would expect more from Carlos. Fans of Santana don't buy this or you won't be a fan for much longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece. Alive And Vibrant.","review":"It is an experience to listen to Santana's \\"Supernatural,\\" winner of 9 rightly deserved Grammys including Best Album Of The Year. This is excellent work from an excellent musician. Carlos Santana once again shows us his musical genius with songs that reach into you. Every song is full of richness and detail. \\"Smooth\\" is a genuine masterpiece and one of the greatest of all love songs! I'm still not tired of hearing it! This is Latin rock at it's best. Santana's work here is alive and hyper, romantic and moving, inspiring and brilliant. \\"Love Of My Life\\" is another excellent track here that embodies what a truly romantic song is. Mana's contribution, \\"Corazon Espinado\\" is alive and vibrant and \\"Maria Maria\\" with Wyclef Jean is richly detailed in all it's corners. Santana returns here with an unbound energy that splashes on a rich canvas of sound and beauty. Who cares about Korn! Latin rock, now THAT's music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial Radio","review":"Although Santana is a good guitar player, the only reason this CD got air play and won loads of Grammys it didn't deserve is because (a) lots of pop stars to grab the young audience, and (b) the guy has been doing this for 40 years, and the Grammys are awards reserved for washed up veterans who try to mount a comeback, or for new bands that will only have one good song (the Oscars do the same thing: see Topsy-Turvy). The songs are an unrealted mess, in which each track was made for the sole purpose of selling CDs, not because of any musical value."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 and a half stars is what I want to give it.","review":"Is this Santana or a bunch of other artists. It seems they took the commercial safe way out on this one - thinly disguised as contemporary cultural melange. Pugh. Santana by himself has more soul and integrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why, Mr. Santana . . . why!?","review":"This album is just another great example of how pop and top 40 music is taking over the woorrllddd!! I'm fifteen years old and have liked Santana ever since my parents played it for me. So, when I heard all the talk about his new album and how great it was supposed to be, I thought to myself, 'Hey! Maybe I should go out and buy that!' So I did. Oh dear. I look at the track listing, and EIGHT of the thirteen songs are \\"featuring\\" another artist. Weeeee! It's too bad that those songs aren't any good. Most of the songs that have gotten air time on the radio sound NOTHING like Santana, and a lot like they should be on the featured artist's album. I give this album two stars for the songs that aren't featuring anyone, like Yaleo and Africa Bamba. If you want good music, get Abraxas or Santana or Moonflower. If you want stuff that sounds like everything else out there, buy Supernatural!"},{"rating":"2","title":"supernatural","review":"It is a superb CD. I enjoyed the variety of sounds, especially Maria Maria ( a fantastic vocal), also Migra, an Arabic tune written by the famous Rachid Taha. Santana guitar playing is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maria Maria grows on to you","review":"Maria Maria is the highlight. The more I listen to it the more I like it. Just can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana continues to grow and get better.","review":"Too bad to all of you who say \\"Bring back the old Santana\\"...and \\"Bill Grahmn (whoever that is) would roll over in his grave, blah blah.\\" Santana, the musician, continues to grow and get better, giving his all to his art and sharing it with us. I remember the same level of criticism leveled at Miles Davis every time he would expand his horizons. \\"Bring back the 'old' Miles!\\" Hey y'all, get over yourselves and let the consumate, and consumed, artists do their things. Rock on, Carlos! This album is another step on your journey and thank you for bringing us along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rebirth of a classic","review":"Santana combines his masterful guitar with today's hottest artists.

Viva Aulán, Viva Santana!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mistake on my part","review":"Okay, I admit, I should have known I wouldn't like this CD. I only knew a couple of the older Santana songs, so I guess I wasn't really familiar with his sound. But, I bought this one anyway.

However, your new fans will forget you as they have been forgeting their other idols shortly. I was Santana fan. But I'll never buy any new Santana's album again. I don't want to be disappointed as well and waste my money. Enjoy your new status of MTV star and new fans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great introduction to Santana","review":"I've heard his songs on the radio for 20 years, but never bought an album until this one. There are many \\"guest\\" appearances by other artists, so each song is very different, reflecting that artist's talent combined with Santana's guitar work. Mellow yet rocking at the same time. Long tracks, great to listen to in the car, very satisfying. I'll probably check out earlier Santana releases now that I've gotten my feet wet with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is great!","review":"\\"Smooth\\" makes this CD worth getting all in all. Even if you aren's a Rob Thomas fan you'll love this CD. Santana included a number of great other singers on this CD too. They include Everlast, Eric Clapton, Lauryn Hill, The Product G&B, Wyclef, CEE LO, Dave Matthews, Eagle Eye Cherry, and Mana. Maria Maria is another great song, considering it has the guitar playing of Santana combined with the singing of the Product G&B and being produced by Wyclef. They were right in giving him so many Grammies. I would buy a copy if I hadn't already gotten one. Believe me it's worth getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"True magic, by all means","review":"Santana, I would say outdone himself, but his endless ability for creativity will never die, this is a true masterpiece of his gift.

Go and buy Abraxas instead. I'll give Supernatural two and a half stars based on the Santana-only tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Santana was the first album I bought and have followed his music ever since.

Like he wanted to make some money fast.If you know Santana, you would know that he is a very good musician, but this album does him no justice. I wouldn't invest the money in this. It's just not worth it. Sure it sells, but so do BackStreet Boys. I wonder who are the type of people buying this music and thinking it's so wonderful. I feel sorry for them. Invest your money in a past Santana cd instead, you'll be infinitely more satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Move Over Backstreet Boys!","review":"Remember Santana? Really hot in the 70's. Played at the original Woodstock. Well, he didn't really make it until this year when pop stations began squeezing his tunes between Brittany Spears and N'Sync. Now I think he's hosting Nickelodian's Teen Choice Awards with that other Latin hunk Ricky Martin.

Don't post a review if you haven't heard the CD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No big surprise","review":"After listening to this cd,I found it no different than other Santana cd's over the past 20 years, other than the parade of headliners.In truth, when Tom Coster left the band,Santana's weakness in composing was sorely exposed, and we got an endless series of surupy, uninspired pop music.I believe Carlos' intentions are sincere,but extremely naive about the power of music to transform lives.However, we are living in decadent times with nothing really to inspire people. I believe he has missed the point that art inspires, not juvenile lyrics or gimmicks.Carlos needs to get back to that premise, and what he has learned from Miles Davis, Wayne Shorter, and John Coltrane, for they will not be forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"I fell for the hype and I have regretted it.

No more, even with your magnificent work in the Latin numbers on this CD, once you introduced the modern artist (and I use modern artist loosely), the album went from 5 stars to 2 stars! I guess you needed the money, otherwise you would not have sold out to attract the younger dollar, but then again, it is all about greed isn't it?

He feels special now because of his number one album and number one single of 1999...WELL WHO DO YOU THINK CAUSED ALL OF HIS SUCCESS? His success is all from the souful song-writing and lyrical stylings of Rob Thomas. No other person could have written such a gorgeous, touching song; Santana tries to play up to Rob's standards but fails considerably. The only reason to buy this album is to get the full version of \\"Smooth.\\" However, I do not recommend doing so because by buying the single, you help Billboard sales and the only thing missing is some of the terrible guitar playing of Santana. If you like \\"Smooth,\\" buy matchbox20's album \\"Yourself or Someone Like You\\" and wait with me for their new album early next year! I gave the one star for Rob Thomas only! Long live King Rob Thomas :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Santana Never Left, but its Great to have this Document!","review":"What a long wait to hear Santana on \\"record.\\" His live shows are great, and I suggest you see him this year!

I must say that I am extremely disappointed with it. I have enjoyed Santana's music ever since Woodstock although I am not a hard-core fan. I can only listen to one or two tracks before turning it off. I have worked my way through it four times, but cannot find much to rave about. The straight Santana tracks are OK, but the collaborations are drivel (even Clapton). Maybe I just do not understand the current music scene. Neither genre on any of the cuts finds anything new or innovative in the joint effort. They just seem to be singing(?) or playing at the same time. It is oil and water to me.

It isn't a classic, but there is something for everyone and it all sounds good. But come on, his best cd ever? Yeah right, everyone who liked this one should listen to his first three albums (Santana, Abraxis, Santana III). This cd is very good, especially Yaleo, Love of My Life, and Wishing it Was. But listening to Jingo, Black Magic Woman, No One to Depend On, etc. will show you how great Santana can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural Sound","review":"This album was the first album of Santana's that I bought. It was a little risky for me because I'd only heard 'Put Your Lights On', but I went ahead and got it. I've been very pleased with the purchase since then.The CD contains 13 songs and an extra cut of mixed genres, which adds to its appeal. It combines some excellent Latin music with some of the best rock guitar sounds I have ever heard in my life. It is the one CD I can get everyone in my family to listen to without complaint because of its mixture of rock, pop, hip hop, and Latin. The guest artists only add to its appeal by contributing their excellent musical talents to the spectacular ones of Carlos Santana and his band.Of Note: '(Da Le) Yaleo', 'Smooth', 'Corazon Espinado', and 'Put Your Lights On'"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos kicks here!","review":"On this album the great Carlos Santana proves that he does indeed still have it.

It has not left my CD player since. I can honestly say that I grew up listening to Santana. I was not even a glimmer when he was making it big but I think that Black Magic Woman and Oye Como Va were some of the first songs I heard as a child. Now, I am at the age and feeling the way my parents did 30 years ago, loving the Rolling Stones, Grateful Dead, and Santana. Well, I can honestly say once you are great, you are always great. Santana proves that here. He belongs in the category of legend as far as music is concerned. I applaud him for taking acts like Dave Matthews and Wyclef to attract the younger audience. This only makes my generation buy the album and realize that maybe they should have been listening to Santana as a baby too! Don't buy this album because of Smooth, buy it because it is by Santana. You know it has to be GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"OOOOOh I love it!","review":"I just love that song \\"Smooth\\" featuring Rob Thomas! I love the latin feel to it.

If you can't write your own style of music (i.e. Aerosmith, Rolling Stones, Def Leppard (New Album), Great White (New Album) - All of which have newer music and great tunes) and release it when it may be out of it's time, then you aren't true to your fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Overated","review":"My apologies to all of you who may worship this CD but there is much better stuff out there. With the exception of the incredibly-overplayed single, \\"Smooth\\" this album is an absolute bore with nothing but a smattering of light Latin pop tunes. THIS IS NOT ROCK! If you are rock fan, then don't bother buying this. The Red Hot Chili Peppers put out a fantastic album this year (Californication) and should have received more awards than they did; as should have many other artists. The Recording Academy is a poor judge of music and always likes to make Grammy night a one-man show. If you have not bought this CD yet, then may I recommend that you do not. Don't get sucked into the Grammy hype; buy what you know is truly good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive musical crescendo for the 1900's","review":"Finally the only 90's album that impresses ! A must hear for all those like me who're still stuck on to the 60's and seventies. There're peices which can be remnicental of the jazz days, the blues, the classic rock and for once rap too ! Guitar work blended excellently throughout all the places and a definitive Carlos 'Devadeep' Santana signature on each one of the popular music trends of the century. Coming so, in the last year of the century, truly amazing culmination of the musical creativity of 100 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"SANTANA IS THE MAN.","review":"I'M SO HAPPY THAT SANTANA'S TIME HAS COME...

I have a lot of respect for Santana, even if was not a great fan oh his previous albums. But this one definitely smells too much the marketing stuff of the big production firms. Use the brand (the name and the sound) to sell something new. I knew the famous hit, and I didn't like it. Just a matter of sound. When I heard the album, I was feeling miserable. There is no inspiration. It really is a sad success. I definitely feel more comfortable with goa experimentation.

Regarding those who don't like that Santana has incorporated some 'new sounds'... presumably wanting Santana to stay the way he was in the 70's ...

The next morning it still sounded new and fresh and live and uuuhh, Sooo great. This goes to my top 20 CD's on my deserted island list. Carlos and friends (clapton, matthews, everlast, thomas, cherry) and all that worked on this album have made this a masterpiece.Just when I think there is no more great music out there, Supernatural comes along and brings great hope and message with it. Bravo Carlos. I live in Austin, Texas and can not believe that I missed his concert in Alamo Dome a few weeks ago, I am so disappointed to hear about this one (Supernatural) a couple of months too late. But for now, your music will be in our ears, hearts and souls. You are a LIVING MUSIC LEGEND.If you love someone, listen to this album with him or her. I did (with her)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, but...","review":"Rap (Track #6 - Do You Like the Way) does not belong on an album of this calibre. I was surprised that Carlos Santana would add this type of music and try to \\"mainstream\\" his work.I've been a long time fan of his and throughly enjoyed his other compliation works with other performers, but maybe I'm just getting old, but rap is definately not called for here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super.

Four tunes (Yaleo, Love of My Life, African Bamba and Smooth) are exceptional and worth the price of the album.

They are not bad from a technical perspective, but they don't really groove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial clap-trap","review":"I'm extremely glad that Carlos got the recognition that he so belatedly deservs, at the Grammies and with the buying public in general, but for \\"Supernatural\\"?

It's unique, but unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"a unique band; in a bad way","review":"The style of the Hold Steady gets old really fast; the singer doesn't even sing, he only talks while guitar goes on in the background. That sounded fine to me on the first song, but then I listened further and soon was getting bored with the repetitive nature of the songs. THe only song that pulls off this style is \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head\\" by Gorillaz, which has narration more than singing. Cake also is kind of more narration than singing but only slightly. Anyway, the Hold Steady are an awful band who will probably fade into nothingness soon seeing that only 20 people have bothered to review it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I bought that last cd and it SUCKED!

His motifs tend to be about Catholicism, drug use, and street angels, and are good enough to be read and enjoyed separately from the hard-hitting music. (Speaking of which, I especially appreciated the excellent arrangement of the backing hard rock as the backdrop to the intentionally clumsy phrasing of Finn's vocals.)This is good stuff; bracing and original."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this qualifies as one of the best of the year...","review":"Then indeed it was a HORRIBLE year for music. This is one of the worst albums I've ever had the misfortune of having to listen to. The singer - better to call him a blatherskite - does nothing but mumblespeak nonsense. There are a thousand bands like this playing small venues and bars all over, yet THIS is singled out as one of the BEST albums of 2005??!? After this cd was over I promptly took it out of the player and flipped it in the trash. What a waste. That anyone could listen to this cd more than once confounds me. The singer is nothing but a poor man's poor man's David Lowery (minus any ability to write clever lyrics). It just goes to show that just because some people can turn on an amp, have cds pressed, and manage to get bookings doesn't mean you have any talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Pennsylvania","review":"Without a doubt, this is the worst trail guide that I have ever used. I have done two of the hikes and I am afraid to try it again. I have found distances to be wrong, landmarks to be wrong and even trail names to be wrong. On the first hike, I was lost for nearly two hours before I was able to locate a cut-off trail at a point other than the supposedly well marked intersection. On the second, my companion and I spent an hour looking for an intersection that was poorly described. Both hikes have also included rather unattractive segments trough parking lots and along logging trails. Last summer I hiked in Poland and found more utility in trail guides written in Polish (which I don't speak) than in this book.

If I thought writing chick lit was going to be easy, why did I pick up this book. In the end I mostly skimmed. Same old writing info as other books. There was input from many other authors, but since I read do not read much chick lit hearing from these authors did not exciting to me.

The perky 'ugly' isn't tongue in cheek, it is a rude obnoxious anthem to people who arn't as beautiful as D and C, although not hard, these girls are obvisously very blind themselves.

Ooh stick you- This is quite frankly a piece of crap. 2.) School's out- the new lyrics to this are absolute trash. D and C even say \\"the prom king and queen are just a couple of clowns\\". Do i detect a hint of jealously cos they could NEVER get in with the in crowd.As for \\"we can't read and we can't write\\". That's one thing D and C are right about- they look and act like air heads!. 3.) U.G.L.Y- The person who wrote this song obviously had D and C in mind when they wrote this song, so yes quite frankly it is one of the all-time worst songs of the year.

Blackout, their third release, may be their hardest album - which also means it's more hard-rock than their usual mix of styles.

You see, what made (hed) PE's first 2 albums so different is that there was a sense of sarcastic humor behind them; A bunch of 30-something guys making fun of the whole Ozzfest bunch. They did a good job of it. I mean, who is going to take a singer like MCUD serious? Com'n...this guy gets up on-stage and puts burning incense stick in his hair and dresses in dopey-looking coveralls. These guys had humor. \\"Blackout\\" has nothing.

THe CD is great but it is not up to the caliber as Broke. It seems as though they are trying to reach a larger audience by becoming less harsh. Broke had so much emotion involved (Jesus of Nazarareth) while Blackout has lossed the emotion and intensity. Dont get me wrong Blackout is an entertaining cd but it lacks alot of what Broke had that gained them respect among the hard rock community. I would recomend this CD however tell them to not expect what they got from Broke. On a sidenote they are must see live.

There are some wild turns.It's a beautiful book, and one also consumately energetic. The color plates show someone who has lived in Hawai'i through the modern evolutions of surfing. That he did it as a famed scholar is all the more amazing. This is a better book that Kary Mullis's autobiographical tome (*Dancing Naked in the Mind Field*) -- and were I asked, as a betting man, to wager on who's the better surfer, I'd settle on the esteemed Prof. Grigg in the proverbial New York minute.

Such details lend credence and strength to a plot that commands one's attention. It's a good read and I've just received delivery of two more McGarrity novels; \\"Tularosa\\" and \\"Mexican Hat\\".

The spree crimes are initially rural and simple, but the detection of the connections is not. Rather than lots of action, ex-cop author McGarrity focuses here on dogged police interviews, a skill rarely presented \\"on-stage\\" in thrillers. We see a new hard-nosed Kerney who persistently intimidates female witnesses--key to solving the crimes but somewhat unexplained. Conversely, Kerney's unusually well-developed personal history continues to grow, with surprising new family strains for this sensitive guy. The author spins compelling storiees with great pacing and always an enveloping sense of empty desert places and transient people. Kerney seems real, he has a life apart from his cases; I hope he doesn't retire!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read, but a bit depressing","review":"If it's a mystery, I'm prepared to enjoy my time reading it.My dad enjoyed another book by this same author and encouraged me to start reading Michael McGarrity's books. He said that if I tried one, I'd be sure to read more. He was right.Kevin Kerney is feeling the pressure to solve this killing spree and arrest a murderer. Written in a very realistic manner, Mr. McGarrity writes about the politics governing a search for a killer. The New Mexico he describes is very much like the state I live in.My only thought is that sometimes his books get depressing. I found this one depressing at times as well- abusive fathers, affairs and frustrating long distance relationships all add to the occasional darkness of this story. However, it is all written with a very true to life feel and handled with tact.I have read other books written by Michael McGarrity and plan on reading more of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I am fascinated with the issues of genetics and eugenics, and thought this would be a great book.

Not only are some of the world's most beloved operas included (such as the Barber of Seville and Carmen), but thanks to technology, this cd provides a great sound that pretty soon you'll believe that you are in an actually opera house.

I gained some inches and endurance, but eventually had major set backs like sitting out due to knee problems. I had an MRI done that thank God showed no signs of tears on any of my ligaments, but the pain and swelling has been there ever since I did this program in 2008. I never had knee problems before, but since doing Air Alert it all changed. Wish I had read reviews about this before I set out doing it.

Sato could have solved the problem advertised by Mirowski, but merely worked all around it without seeing it. Discusses the question whether it is legitimate to assume 'price as gradient of utility' from the standpoint of Frobenius' theorem (hitting a nut with a sledgehammer), but fails to apply similar horsepower to the Hamilton-Jacobi equation (discussed in the last pages). Therefore misses the main point: in optimization problems (Hamiltonian dynamics), price as a function of demand or supply ('price equals gradient of utility'), and utility itself, do not exist unless the Hamiltonian dynamical system is Liouville integrable (see my paper \\"The Futility of Utility\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Thoughtful Study","review":"The dean of living revisionist historians is at his brilliant, provocative best in these essays on \\"war crimes,\\" Allied terror bombing, Fascism, the draft, the American mass media's wartime love affair with Stalin, America's postwar \\"defense\\" imperialism, and more!

In some ways, this is pretty thin soup. A short novel, after all, and not by any stretch of the imagination a major novel, certainly not in the sense that Middlemarch or Ulysses are major. But I'd put this on a list of personal favorites. And there are certain second rate novels which for all their second-rateness should not be lost. Frederic lived not too long, accomplished not very much, saw not everything there was to be seen - but in this little fable of a Methodist preacher who never quite got the point, Frederic himself pretty much gets it right. Not a mean achievement for a lifetime, and so one not to be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!!!!","review":"I would love to recommend this novel. Frederic writes about realistic characters and issues pertinent to America during the 1890's with a touch of irony and subtlety. Frederic is somewhat comparable to William Dean Howells and Stephen Crane in that he was writing at the same time about similar issues. He incorporated techniques of both realism and naturalism, which blended into a unique style distinctly his own. Unfortunately, Frederic is currently a forgotten author. This is the only book of his that is now in print. Please read this novel and pass the word so that Frederic and his work does not remain forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Plain Rocks","review":"Recently freed from their major label shackles, Oleander sound better for it. Songs like \\"30,60,90\\" and \\"Off & On\\" rock harder than anything they've ever done and crackle with energy. Such enthusiasm pervades the entire disc and even shows on lower key numbers, like \\"Runaway Train\\" and \\"Fountain & Vine.\\" It's a shame that such a quality record wasn't released on a major label with more promotional clout. Regardless, if you like straight ahead no-frills rock, it's difficult to knock this.

The other songs are okay...but I dont think any of them will be radio worthy. The only other song I liked on this album was \\"Fountain & Vine.\\" It has good lyrics and this song is the most polished.

At a little over 2 hours running time, it is a feat just to finish.I saw this story on a Cold Case from A&E;, so I thought I would like watching this. It is interesting to note that this film was shot on location in Michigan, and even features real life sites, like the actual crime scene. But interesting trivia aside, this film sounded terrible with its initial dialogue and poor acting. It is a doggedly slow paced film, so the 2 hours feel like 4. What Cold Case managed to do in 1 hour with suspense, drama, and humanity (and commericals) this film could not accomplish if you gave it 3 more hours.If you are interested in the story then watch a true crime show, but leave this film alone. It is slow, poorly acted and written, and there is no sense of suspense after the first 15 minutes. Just awful sweet pea."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW! REALLY BAD.

The main question Blake seeks to answer is: why now? Why and how did the Harry Potter series become so popular and why now? He situates the books in historical context--easier said than done. There was much going on in English culture and education that contributed to the books' success. Beginning in the mid-90s, Blake looks less at the books' possible past textual sources and spends more time exploring the books' contemporary cultural sources. I'm currently teaching a university course with _Azkaban_ as a text and may assign readings from Blake's book as secondary reading, both as overview of what came before and as an example of how to read carefully and respect a text and its attendant complications."},{"rating":"2","title":"So that is why Harry is so popular!","review":"I would rate this as a tie for the most interesting book on this phenomenon of those I have read so far.

My overall reaction to the album can probably be best described as boredom. To me, the album just lacks energy and punch. Yes, parts of it may be lyrically strong, but that doesn't help much if it doesn't grab you musically. It's not a totally lost cause however (thus the two stars) with \\"Connections are More Dangerous than Lies\\" and \\"Whatever Lies will Help You Rest\\" being among the highlights.

I don't know if a lot of good pop-punk bands feel their sound needs to mature as they get older, but this just isn't anywhere near as good as their older stuff.As with bands like Midtown and The Starting line, the Ataris have lost the catchiness and spring in their step that was so evident in their early material and have made a largely forgettable album here.If you've never heard the band, buy \\"Blue skies..\\" instead of this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So Long Ataris","review":"I found this CD unlistenable the first time I listened to it and still dislike it.

However, I was initially skeptical about actually purchasing it based on all the negative reviews I was seeing everywhere. Eventually I decided to give it a shot and I'm glad I did. It is certainly very different from their last record, which I loved, and also very different from their other albums, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. So far my favorite track is New Years' Day, but that will likely change as I listen to it more. Overall though, I like it a lot. Definitely check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't live through the night","review":"I really hate to bash this since I've been a big fan over the years. I realize that you can't do the same thing forever, but you can't do this either. The fact that one lyric which repeats over and over requires the word \\"terrible\\" to be pronounced wrong in order to rhyme tells you everything you need to know. It's ambitious, and they were a great band so we owed them a listen, but this thing is really dead on arrival. If you really really liked them and want them not to give up completely you can give this two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely different...","review":"Thats about the best thing I can say about it. I love the Ataris, and truly believed that So Long Astoria was a huge step forward for the band. The songs and melodies were still pop oriented, but the lyrical content had obviously matured in depth. There are songs on SLA that actually make me want to cry - songs like \\"Unopened Letter to the World\\" are beautifully real, something I can identify with and be proud of. And then theres this... and the band is obviously going for a darker sound, but it seems they got lost along the way. Its like an album by a different band completely. Maybe that means Im not 'hardcore' because I dont believe in every single thing they release, but Im not going to sacrifice my feelings and opinions to belong to a certain group of fans. I really do hope Kris Roe (whos a great guy) reads this and understands what Im saying - You can evolve and make a new record without losing the heart, soul, and spirit of your band. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"Being an Ataris fan since the beginning, I was excited about their new album. I bought the last, and did not like their new sound but I hoped perhaps they would return to their roots with this album. I was wrong. No longer are they punk but alternative rock- completely different sound than the band I loved. I gave so long Astoria to my little sister as I will this one. I should have done a little more research but for anyone reading this and who liked the old, punk Ataris- this is not them. If you like the popular \\"Alternative\\" sound than this may be for you. I am just very dissapointed that I will never hear old Ataris sound that I liked again.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I've been reading and studying about the Korean War recently. I had bought this encyclopedia some months ago in anticipation of this. While I have read only a few entries in the encyclopedia, the ones I have read have all been very informative with good depth. As might be expected given the length of the book, there is a wide range of topics covered.As to format, there is a very useful listing of all the topic entries at the front of the book, along with a plethora of plain but clear maps. I might mention though, that the map on p. xxviii, intended to be a map of the Inchon landings, is actually a reprint of the initial North Korean invasion map. Also, under the entry for \\"Orders of Battle\\", one is directed to Appendix I, which seems to be missing. However, in an undertaking as extensive as this, these anomolies are minor.In sum, this book is a very important and useful addition to Korean War historiography.

I think that the ability that sets Madonna apart the most is not simply being someone who manipulates media well but in truth two things: One, she's not a big fan of TV or indulging in the media, beign a puppet to it in watching it.

I've seen these triple RCA barrels selling from a penny up to over $5. One thing for sure is that this merchant should be avoided.Why? In my single transaction with Cmple, I was bait and switched. I bought name brand cables and they sent me no name crap that incidentally also cost a penny apiece right here on Amazon.So, if you must extend your RGB, your first choice is to buy the proper length cable. These extenders do nothing good for your picture and provide another place for your signals to fail.However, if you must extend your RGB, keep the total length short, as over 15 ft. starts to damage your signals, and if you must buy RCA barrels, choose another vendor that doesn't have a reputation for ripping off customers.It's easy.

Introspective musings meaningless without an external frame of reference as played on a real hi-fi, thought car stereo merely muffled the lyrics but they seem neurotic. INTERIORS gone off the tracks. To the extent that lyrics can be deduced, one track appears to be about drug abuse cathartic power, another about incest or maybe pedophilia. A long-time truly fine artist has made a comeback after when she should have retired; CDs are no place to work out inner demons illogically. Even the backing band had to stretch the circle of fifths beyond tunefulness. Not accessible to these ears, and I hate having to provide this analysis."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of '03","review":"I bought this CD after listening to Rosanne interviewed on NPR. On first listen I thought, That's good, worth another listen. Now, after many times through, I won't even consider taking this disc out of the CD player. It took a few times through for the hooks to sink in, but when they did, they sank in deep...whew!This album is simply a masterpiece, and easily the best thing I've heard this year. Rosanne's own writing is strong and the covers she has chosen are a great compliment to the mood of this CD. I'd say the songs are thoughtful, evaluative, but I wouldn't call the album particularly dark or brooding. Loosing your step-mother and seeing the pending death of your father in the same year would make anyone consider the milestones their life had reached.Gorgeous voice, excellent writing, simple, understated and highly appropriate production work. You won't do any better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment from a major talent","review":"Roseanne Cash long ago proved herself one of the finest singer-songwriters in any musical genre. Despite a couple of good cuts, however, \\"Rules of Travel\\" is little more than an echo of such stunning earlier albums as \\"King's Record Shop,\\" \\"Interiors,\\" and \\"The Wheel.\\" John Leventhal's production may be too glossy at times, but it's often the only element that keeps you listening to the new songs at all. The numbers written by others are mostly formulaic, and Cash's own compositions lack the biting insights into the politics of relationships and making peace with one's past that have always sparked her best writing. The mild exceptions are the title track, which boasts a memorable chorus, and the lover's challenge \\"Closer Than I Appear.\\" On the plus side, Cash is in fine voice -- maybe her finest ever. Let's hope that the next album finds her back in top writing form as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rosanne's Triumphant Return","review":"After having followed Rosanne Cash for 23 years, I can say that this is an amazing recording. She has been missed for far too long. From my first listen, I was amazed at how John Leventhal has recorded Rosanne's voice with a feeling that hasn't been felt before. The content of the songs are filled with fully felt emotions that are rare in music. And the songs from other writers fit in seamlessly with her own songs. Besides her father, the guest performers on the CD blend their voices into Rosanne's to great effect.A must have for any fan of singer-songwriters. And don't let an anti-country music bias prevent you from buying this.

Granted, Romagnano's ways are a bit different and probably marginally better than the old ways of teaching math.

It scared us to death!!Needless to say, I spent the next hour cleaning soup off my ceiling, light fixtures, counter tops! It appears that the pressure release gauage didn't activate.

This has been a great money saver as I can buy dry, organic beans in bulk for a tiny fraction of the cost of canned beans.I was specifically looking for a pressure cooker that was very large for cooking big batches for freezing, easy to clean, durable and it absolutely had to not be scary to use. We've all heard th horror stories of pressure cookers exploding way back when. This pressure cooker is everything I wanted.

Because of the other reviews, my main purpose in purchasing this was for canning.However, after reading the manual, I learned that this CAN NOT be used for canning at altitudes above 3,000 feet -- which leaves out a lot of Colorado, New Mexico, Utah......Otherwise, I'm sure it's great.Update: A lot of comments to this post -- I need to clarify. You can use it to COOK (adjust cooking times for altitude), but not to CAN. Two different functions. Talk to your science teacher -- the higher the altitude, the lower the temperature the water reaches its boiling point, and therefore, the less pressure. To get to the appropriate temperature to kill bacteria for safe canning, you need higher PRESSURE at altitude. This does not reach high enough pounds of pressure at altitude.Cooking food at altitude -- good. Canning food at altitude -- poison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good as the old style!","review":"I was hesitant to buy this as it is so different from the Presto Cooker I've used for 40years.

The meat came out very tender. The flavor was wonderful.

I think once I get the 'hang' of how much steam should be escaping during the cooking process, EVERYTHING will taste good. This is certainly a time saver.

It took some adjusting to a non-rocking pressure regulator,but I'm o.k. on that now. The instructions were easy to understand. Only having it a short time, I am hoping it lasts as long as my others have. They all are presto and still work. They only need an occasional ring replacement.

Therefore, in the late 1980s the USDA published its recommendation to not use pressure saucepans (small cookers) for home canning.\\"Bottom line: A bigger canner, the kind studied in the 1940s, holds heat longer and that *may* result in significantly different required processing times. Then again, subjecting jars to an hour of the temperature generated at 15 psi near sea level just might kill every living thing in even the smallest pressure cooker.

My husband bought this for me for Christmas, and I was so excited to finally have one. Once I removed it from the box, I flipped it over to look for the \\"made in the usa\\" stamp, and imagine my disgust to see it stamped, \\"made in china\\". Boy that really ticks me off!

I'm replacing it right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it a zero.....","review":"I bought it for a mid-sized dog and it's one of the most poorly designed items I've ever seen....and what is so sad is that just a FEW minor changes would make it work. The \\"flip top\\" needs a screw base -- it just sits on the \\"tank\\" and falls off at a jostle, pouring water all over everything. The bracket is flimsy...a few centimeters on either side would hold the bottle in place much more securely; the tank falls out if I bump the kennel from the outside, much less when my dog actually tries to drink from it. And while the bottom portion DOES screw on, it's barely in place -- a half turn and water leaks all over. I can't imagine any dog that isn't very young or very tiny (and this holds a fair amount of water) who could possibly be dainty enough to use this without major spillage. Don't waste your money. The clamp holding the tank to the cage works....because when I come home, it's the ONLY thing still in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS!","review":"I spent hours researching this water bottle purchase.

But, water just drips out constantly, so the bedding is always drenched and the guinea pigs are always out of water. So, it is being discarded and I'm looking for a better bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice and quiet, but too messy!","review":"Heres the thing about these bottles. I bought it because it has a lever to release the water rather than the noisy metal ball most of them have. It worked perfectly for that. It was no longer loud and annoying when my buns got a drink. However, we noticed there was a LARGE amount of water ending up on the bottom of the cage every day. We thought it might be leaking but we never once saw it drip. After more observation we discovered that the lever released too much water every time they took a drink and most of it ended up on the ground instead of in their mouth. We tried putting towels and bedding under it to soak up the water but it was such a pain and the bunnies didnt seem to like using it anymore. So we switched to a crock the size of a small bowl and they seem to really like it. Its easy, there is no mess, and we are all happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rambo Rules","review":"This is a great cartoon to have in your collection. Not only is the voice of Rambo by Neil Ross (Lion-o of the Thundercats cartoon series) but it is a great action cartoon. the thing i like most about this series is that when Rambo fires his weapons actual bullets are being fired, not lasers as most other cartoons.

There's an error on the episode listing on the Vol 2 package: \\"Raise the Yamato\\" should be \\"The Taking of Tierra Libre\\"3. The episodes are in semi-alphabetic order on the disks, rather than the much more logical order that they aired.

She is also quite honest about her difficulties after moving to Switzerland. What makes this book a wonderful read is that she does not portray herself as \\"cured\\" after replanting herself in Switzerland. she discusses the psychological challenges that await her, as she tries to make a new family and also connect her old one, as her child from the improper union was adopted by another family .

Pionchet, his wife and Margaret Thatcher were all portrayed as buffoonish cartoon characters. Those trying to get Pinochet extradited were portrayed as lofty-minded, conscious-driven individuals.

They claim this is the author's art, rather than evidence of separate texts having been sutured together.Their reading is simply not convincing. The repititions in Genesis do not look like the similar repititions in other Near Eastern literature. They have a different quality, which is evident to any reader who is willing to look at the texts as historical documents rather than as some kind of lifeline to God.The documentary hypothesis lives. Kikawada and Quinn are forgotten by all but a handful of tenacious Christians.

Personally, I think that many of his others are better but that does not stop this one from being entertaining.The story concern Dr. Blood, an Englishman wrongly accused of treason against the British crown. Instead of being hanged, he is sentenced to slavery in Jamaica. He chafes under slavery and mistreatment, resenting the idea of being property much more than any of the cruel treatment he receives. During a pirate raid, he manages to escape and become a quite successful pirate himself. In his success, though, he cannot forget the Englishwoman (Olivia DeHavilland) who was kind to him or that she once bought him. Eventually, he manages to buy her from another pirate and seeks to redeem his name and his reputation.It is an engaging film. It has action, adventure, drama, love and conflicts of interest.

Although it starts out a little on the talky side, this swashbuckling pirate movie has it all: clean, crisp, innovative B&W cinematography, a thrill-packed plot, a nice mix of minature sets and on-location action, and -- of course -- two of Hollywood's most babilicious stars, the surf-dude-y Flynn and the ever-dishy Olivia De Havilland.

His combination of good looks, athleticism, and sheer personality brought back the swashbuckler in one fell swoop.

Finally, young de Havilland is the perfect match for Flynn; it's easy to see why they'd be paired in seven more Warner pictures.

The movie was almost faithful to the story except for the final events leading up to the final scene. Having said that, I enjoyed the movie and have viewed it over the years many times. Screen writers ordinarily take too much liberty with classical stories and lose the highpoints of the plots, in my estimate. Take for example the classic, \\"The Count of Monte Christo\\", a beautiful story, with dramatically written scences. However, as more modern movie versions are produced, the story departs further and further from the original story line. The Count of Monte Christo, never ended up with Mercedes, but only the version with Richard Chamberlin stayed faithful to that fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good swashbuckler","review":"This is a good, old-fashioned swashbuckler with corny lines and a fairly implausible plot but great fun for a cold Saturday afternoon when college football season is over (and you're not a basketball fan.)

The mechanics are similar to other fighting games and focus on combos and button smashing more than they should. Also, the changes that this game went through before reaching America's shores left it wanting. I felt cheated when I heard that the main character in Japan was *gasp* a female mobile suit pilot!! Could it be?! Wow!! And yet, when it hit America, we got Heero Yuy, a *male* MS pilot. Not that there's anything wrong with Heero, mind you, but a girl in a mobile suit was a more inspiring role model to me.

In fact, I'd say it's a worthless product for two reasons. First, the coffee does not brew out in a quiet steady flow, as it should, but sputters from the time it first starts seeping out. You are supposed to hear the sputtering when it's time to turn off the burner, but because it's always sputtering you have to keep opening the lid (making a mess) to see when it's done. Second, and most critically, it brews so slowly that the coffee begins to burn (evident in the smell and taste) before it's even finished. I'm using proper heat and I'm not over-packing. I've been using various moka pots for years without these problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is nowhere near the quality of Bialetti products. Steam escapes from the seam no matter how tight the pieces are screwed together. There is water left in the bottom container every time - it has never made a full brew.

It's just not a good stovetop espresso maker, no matter how cute the red color is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Russian Post WWII Saga","review":"I lived in Moscw for 6 months in 1977 and have been back 4 additional times since then so I feel I know the Russian soul fairly well.

Well, i was right, it did suck. But what really got me is that people had the nerve to say this record was better than the previous. Drew, your opinion doesn't count. You are an ignorant turd, and your useage of the words \\"Crybaby emo\\" and \\"Bubblegum pop\\" to describe music that is neither only adds basis to my analysis. New rule; no one with an IQ below that of a glass of water should be reviewing. That means you, drew.

This record though, is on my shortlist for 2005's WORST! They went from being a catchy punk-emo band to a \\"modern rock\\" disaster. I would do a rundown of good vs. bad songs, but they ALL SUCK. If i wanted to listen to crap like this, i'd but a record from seether or the all american rejects. They effin' sold out, no two ways around it, and i hope they enjoy playing shows for indifferent top 40 rock crowds who love you until Dark New Day comes out with a new record. DONT BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shows potential","review":"\\"Based on a true story\\" is no 5 star album, but I can't deny that it shows alot of promise. Unlike their previous record, which was a total punk-pop joke, TSL have matured and turned into real songwriters. At times, the \\"mature\\" listener may find themselves a little put off by the overall manufactured sound of BOATS, but it's easy to overlook with kenny's sweet, melodic voice. I couldn't really enjoy \\"Based on a true story\\" for more than two listens, and my guess is it'll (my copy) be up for sale within the next few days. I guess the easiest way to break it down is; Good Charlotte fans will give this 5 stars, while fans of The bravery and Coldplay will give it 1 or 2. It all just depends on what stage you're at musically. 2 solid stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a little time","review":"Yeah so this album isn't as instant as the older one but it really has a sound of a band who finally know what they wan't to sound like,before they could have just been tossed away into the pile of pop punk contempories but with this album i think they have shown a growth. Sure they havent exactly gone full circle and changed their sound but they have a lot more songs which require a little more thought that just catchness 'Photography' is the sort of song that would't go amiss on a Coldplay cd and 'Ready' has a dark broodyness to it that you would not associate with the Starting Line. But where they have mature songs thay also haven't lost their roots. 'Bedroom Talk' is a classic pop song as is 'The World'. Lyrically superior,musically superior and a very very underrated album."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"wow, this album is amazing.

The guys dropped their poppy roots and decided they need to \\"mature.\\" With their new found maturity, there was a road block. To keep this short, this album is lacking in every aspect. You get dragged through their \\"maturing\\" process and have to listen to songs that have no substance or any standing power.Maturity can be a good thing, but in the case of Based On A True Story, maturing was based on a boring story and dull music."},{"rating":"1","title":"They have matured like a down-syndrome man","review":"This cd shows no maturation at all. Most of the songs sound the same and they all sing sellout to me. Since when was it \\"mature\\" to sing about sex? Even animals do it.

I could understand if they would change from Punk Rock to more Alternative in a few albums but not so fast. I honestly did not believe anyone when they said that this was The Starting Line.

I know it's nowhere near as good as \\"say it like you mean it\\" (that was obvious at first listen), but at the same time, I don't totally hate it either. Some of the songs are awesome, like bedroom talk, which despite having sub-par lyrics, is actually very catchy and TSL-esque. Others though, are not. Autography gives me a headache, as do many others. The album seems to start off okay, With Making love to the camera and Inspired by the $ sign, but it falls about in weird places. Also, I found Based on a true story to not have the same ammount of replay value as SILYMI. After about 6 or 7 listens, I was pretty much done with it.

The picture on the cover is marked, yes, \\"serving suggestion\\", but does that mean I have to make my own sauce that actually sticks to the noodles like a glaze, as seen in the picture? What we get is just noodles floating in hobo soup. Gross.

I don't like the bowl soup at all. I'd say it's not miso soup but plain noodle soup and noodle tastes not very pleasant. There is no miso taste and preparation takes too long. Instant miso in packages tastes great and there is no way I change my preference. BTW the best bet on instant miso packages I found is my local Trader Joe's Instant Miso Soup.

I even added less water like reviews suggested and it didn't help at all. I've also tried Annie's Udon soup and it's gross as well.

(And yes, I did remove the packaging before consuming the soup) I had low expectations for this soup and it managed to fall very short of them. Fortunately, a few dashes of soy, squirts of Sriracha, and squeezes of lime allowed me to pinch my nose and pour the stuff down my throat.So, if you hate miso soup, and have a hankerin' for a plasticky aftertaste, Annie Chun's Miso Soup Bowl might just be your ticket to paradise."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like miso soup, don't buy this","review":"I really like miso soup, so I was excited about this quick meal that I could bring to work for lunch.

They must have got the idea that the U.S. Mint shrunk the size of the quarter, because it is almost impossible to fit the quarters in the slots.

It's almost impossible to insert quarters with just your hands. I found that it's not so hard when you use some kind of tool to help you, though.First, place the folder on a solid flat surface. Then position the quarter correctly, and push it in as much as you can by hand. Now find something to help you get it in the rest of the way without damaging it. I used the rubber-coated handle of a pair of pliers. Place the tool on the edge of the coin that's still sticking up, and apply pressure to force it into the hole.After I got the quarters into my folder, they looked fine. There was no noticable damage.

There is copious amounts of information on those who chose to utter blasphemy against the faith they were raised in (such as apostates from Islam, Hinduism, Christianity, Judaism, et cetera).The contributing authors include some big names, such as George A Wells on the topic of Jesus historicity, James Randi on the topic of hoaxes and frauds, and numerous other highly regarded experts in their respective fields.

My only complaint is that I think it should be a little more full. I need something that keeps my neck from resting on my shoulder and causing discomfort. This definitely does a better job than most but for my taste I would like to add to the filling and make it firmer. Luckily, I think I can. The pillow has zippers which allow you to remove (and consequently - I'm guessing ADD) contents. I have to look into it more, but overall I am very happy with the pillow. The neck area is a little smaller than I originally thought it would be, but I think it is designed to push the filling forward and better support the neck. If you have a big neck, you might have a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor version of a pillow with small neck area","review":"A couple other reviews mentioned the pillow wasn't stuffed enough; however, I didn't see any reviews mentioned the fit to the neck.

The back end is too thick, not enough \\"arms\\" for the sides of the neck, if you try to sit back in a chair with it, it pops your head forward because of how thick the back is.

For the last 20 years they haven't evolved a bit and I must agree with some other reviewer that this just a product, to get some money out from the old fans and make some new fans among the kind of \\"Britney loving teenagers\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could it get worse?","review":"I bought this cd hoping to bring back a lost passion I had with Bon Jovi long ago. Well, there might be only one word to describe their last effort : failure. It's my Life ends up sounding great (after a few listenings), even though it only brings back the sound from Slippery When Wet. The rest of the album completely lacks of musical dynamism. And hearing the guys talking about wretchedness knowing that they could each own a house in Beverly Hills also lacks in credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're not teenagers any more!!","review":"Bon Jovi is an example of old bands trying to keep up with the times, and as usual it doesn't work. Okay, I know they had a hit with the dreadful \\"It's my life\\" but I must say that I don't like this (modern) approach/production at all. The only decent songs on this release are \\"Two story town\\" and \\"One wild night\\" - the rest is just forgettable. When Bon Jovi released their much better \\"These days\\", I thought the band had matured, but now it seems they grow old too fast and desperately trying to appear young at heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Jon doing to his voice?","review":"Jon's voice is simply irritating on this CD, too twangy.

If you're a BJ Fan you'll like it, because they just do their typical stuff but if you expect experimental music or new influences in their music you'll be dissapionted. This album doesn't offer any surprises but good, clean Rock & Roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Like a favorite pair of torn blue jeans...\\"","review":"And no words speak more truth than those! I slipped right into this album and it fit; it was like seeing an old friend. I was skeptical that after several years off, they would not give the quality of the heyday 80's. I was wrong, to say the least.With lyrics that seem to have matured (along with me), I can relate to every song -- just as in the past. It was most definitely worth the wait.If you are a Bon Jovi fan, you will enjoy.Thanks, guys for a great one yet again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaack","review":"And they're back with a vengance! Great tunes, good times, and fun to be had by all. It's got exactly what you can expect from any Bon Jovi CD...good ol' rock & roll interspersed with a couple of power ballads that are bound to show up at a wedding or two in the next year. Don't pass this one up...toss it in the car, open the windows, put the top down (if you can), and crank Track 9 for a great time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi fans will be impressed","review":"This was a good move for Bon Jovi. Just when people thought that they disappeared off of the face of the earth for good they come back in full force. Like many of you I was anxiously waiting the release of this CD. It is well worth waiting for with tracks like The Next 100 Years and One Wild Night. You won't even miss the ex band member Alex Such from this at all. Some songs are like the old stuff and some are not. Great medoldic vocals from Richie Sambora as always. Go and get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as good as These Days","review":"I really like Crush, but i'm quite surprised how many people in the reviews didn't quite like These Days. i have been a BJ fan since 86', and Crush doesn't quite match up to TD in terms of lyrics and original melodies.But tracks like It's My Life and Just Older and One Wild Night are brilliant, and Thank You is a realy touching song, except for the \\" These Five words...\\" bit. Getting cliche. And it's a mystery why the tracks \\" Mystery Train\\" and \\"she's a Mystery\\" are on the album. Pretty weak tracks. And there is no classic Bon Jovi cowboy song like Wanted or Stick to Your Guns. Still, BJ's still the best band in the world !"},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Back!!","review":"This is a great return for Bon Jovi. I was a bit concerned that they would be rehashing years of music, trying to sound \\"new\\". Well, they sound \\"old\\" & that's great! It's the stuff you tap your feet to & sing along with. I really like \\"It's My Life\\" & \\"Just Older\\"...I think both really speak for where the band is in their lives, personally & professionally.If you're looking for a CD to pop in to dance around to, like you used to!, then pop this one in & have at it! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mature Bon Jovi","review":"Growing up in the eighties, I enjoy the sounds of good rock music. Bon Jovi shows great class and style in keeping their \\"sound\\" while allowing themselves to mature and intergrate the modern mood of music into thier current work.If you are a fan of Bon Jovi, then buy this album - it wil lnot disappoint you - but be warned they have matured and their sound has changed ever so slightly from their young 1980 days.If your not a big fan of Bon Jovi - but you are willing to experiement with something that isn't so bubble-gum as the mainstream currently is - go ahead and pick up this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi proving once agian they wont fade away","review":"Alright! BOn Jovi and the gang are back. This time with a new sound and a new attitude. The album starts off right away with the great hard sound of Its my life, which is destined to be played on the radio over and over again. The 2nd song Say it isnt so. Veers off from anytihng bon jovi ever did, soudning like a an alternative band and pulling it off quite well cause the songll have you singing along within minutes. Of course Bon jovi wouldnt be bon jovi without a love ballad and in enters Thank you for loving me, and of course he pulls it off fantastically, just like the song always on cross roads. Also song like I got the girl and one wild night show that the boys can still rock and create great rock songs thatll have everyones movin.

I liked it so much, that I took a chance on buying the whole album, not knowing what the rest of his songs were like. I was extremely lucky to find out that the rest of the album is just as good if not better. There is only one more song on the album thats sounds like \\"It's My Life\\" and thats \\"One Wild Night\\". It's not a bad song, but I don't think it has the same power as \\"It's My Life\\" The best song on the album is a ballad called, \\"Save The World\\". It is such a wonderful song that it's too hard to describe. A song that compares to it is, \\"Thank You Fro Loving Me\\", another strong ballad. To give you an idea of what these two songs are like, it is best compared to the song by Aerosmith from Armageddon(I forgot the name). The album as a whole is a great chance for Bon Jovi to make a comeback. It's well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"bon jovi rocks your world","review":"It was well worth the wait for \\"Crush\\", the first Bon Jovi cd in a few years. Songs like \\"It's My Life\\" and \\"The Next 100 Years\\" are proof the Bon Jovi still has what it takes to be one of, or in my opinion the best band, in the world. Jon Bon Jovi's voice is classic, and Richie Sambora guitar riffs are amazing. They cover all genres of music on this album, and do it very well. The lyrics to Bon Jovi's songs are, as always, very inspiring and meaningful. This isn't boyband fluff. Songs like \\"Thank You\\", a beautiful ballad, and \\"Older\\" show that these songs have substance. They actually mean something, and make you feel something. Die hard fans, and even those who are not, will appreciate the songs, and you'll be singing them on your drive to work, trust me. You will not be disappointed in getting this cd.

Great lyrics, good inspiration, great sound!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing for real fans!","review":"You can look at this album from two sides. One is if you're a real fan of the older Bon Jovi albums, from their first ones up to \\"Keep The Faith\\". This is what I am, too. (\\"Keep The Faith\\" is my favourite album) With that in mind I could only give this album three stars at best. They don't sound like they used to. It sounds a little like \\"These Days\\", and you can also hear out some of the ideas Jon put into his solo album. This album is too much mainstream! It doesn't have the class of \\"Keep the Faith\\" or \\"New Jersey\\" and all the other ones before that. BUT, if you just want to listen to some damn good rock music and don't care too much about Bon Jovi's history, you won't make a mistake if you buy this CD! From that point of view it's really worth five stars. As a compromise I'll give it four stars, but it's rather something for non-die-hard Bon Jovi fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, clean fun!","review":"I think this is a great cd for those of us who were around for Bon Jovi's first few.

The beat of the drum and the stringing of the guitars will have you clicking your fingers and tapping your feet. There are some slow ballads too which put you in the mood for some lovin'.BonJovi once again takes us on a energetic, youthful trip and makes us forget how much we've aged since he sold his last shoe and sang his first song.

At first listen the jury was out but after playing it 2, 3, 4, 25 times I can't get the smile off my face. Its so nice to hear such quality music again. The first song that really got me was Just Older, love the lyrics and the melody. Captain Crash and the Beauty Queen from Mars seems to be my favorite, I can't stop listening. Love the riff and the lyrics are so much fun. And how easy is it to picture the Captain and the Beauty Queen in your minds. There is such a great chemistry and tightness to this group, they sound like they're having fun. Such a refreshing album in this era of non-refreshing music.

Unfortunately, Crush is NOT a return to slippery when wet days, it is a modern pop-rock album. It is not dark and gloomy like These Days, but it does not rock like New Jersey/Slippery or even Keep The Faith. The lead single It's My Life is the most rocking track. Curiously, the 2 bonus tracks (Neurotica and I Could Make A Living Out Of Loving You) for Australian/Japanese versions are stronger than some filler tracks in the album. The second single to-be (Say It Isn't So) is catchy but does not rock hard. The best tracks are It's My Life, Just Older (classic Bon Jovi), the ballad Thank You For Loving Me and the final track One Wild Night. Some other tracks are okay and catchy (Say It Isn't So, Captain Crash) but the rest are just fillers."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Live On!","review":"I've been a fan of Bon Jovi since their first album came out in 1987.

They are hear to stay."},{"rating":"1","title":"more smarmy garbage","review":"These days, Bon Jovi's music appeals mainly to suburban housewives, and listening to the song samples here alone, it's not hard to see why.

Bon Jovi always had power in their sonds. Power in the words the music and ofcourse the dead-on singing by Jon. There songs have real power, like \\"She's a Ride on a Mystery Train\\" or \\"One Wild Night\\" or \\"Thank You For Loving Me\\" and of course \\"It's My Life\\".

All the tracks contain a melody of their own kind and do get the listener on the dance floor. You can't help yourself from setting your player on repeat on tracks like 'It's my life' or \\"One wild night'. The slower tracks like 'Thanks for loving me' or 'Mystery train' too create a liking in the listener.

With songs like Thank You For Loving Me & She's A Mystery they solidify themselves as one of the best ballad bands ever.

Just about anyone is able to pick this book up, read it, understand the arguments, and then realize when and where fallacious reasoning is used. My only problem comes with the exercises the book gives. While it is nice that questions and arguments are given where you are supposed to find the fallacy or determine whether it is a good or bad argument, at the same time, out of 28 questions, the book only gives the answers to four questions (in a given exercise at the end of the third chapter). It would be nice if a book that cost over $50.00 gave answers to all the exercise questions it asked, so that people like me, who learn easier by seeing the answer and question together, will have examples to learn and check answers. Besides that, its a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The objective turns subjective in the hands of these authors","review":"The authors fail at every turn to display an unbiased view of the world which every critical thinker does best to attain. Instead of being objective and raising questions in a philosophical way, they use their fallacy recognition to present an emotionally charged counter-attack. The authors are outraged at fallacious reasoners and even use emotional language in describing the view of one such reasoner as a \\"goody-goody idea\\". One might consider these authors unqualified to write such a book intended to promote objective reasoning. I suggest a more logical and unbiased work on the subject, such as _The_Art_of_Deception_."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good explanations, but bias abounds.","review":"Starting on page 97, the book talks about the \\"We don't ban cars\\" argument in regards to the gun control debate.

The author has eaten her way through an impressive variety of sushi, and her affection for her subject is evident throughout. However, the book is thin on practical guidance -- you won't find instructions on how to make sushi, or how to distinguish good sushi restaurants from those to be avoided at all costs. And it's dated: I haven't seen kobashira in a sushi bar for 10 years or so, after a contamination scare in Japan halted exports of this scallop. Still, the book is a pleasure to look at and to handle -- and I'm forever grateful to the author for introducing me to kohada."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant text and magnificent photographs","review":"While this is not the book for those seeking instruction in the preparation of sushi, it is a wonderful book for those who enjoy eating sushi and sashimi in restaurants.Mia Detrick describes the history and cultural context of sushi and the etiquette and tradition of the sushi bar so eloquently, that I could not postpone my next visit to one.

Excellent photos, especially for 1981. The text isn't terribly strong though, there's not a lot of content to it frankly.

Ritchie Blackmore is an awesome personality, his music, his lyric and his musically charismatic conquered the heart of the rock fans in the 70's and 80's. And now He joins Ms. Candice Night on this pretty medieval album. The result is a huge fascination...the trip to the old medieval time/renaissance era.

James Wormold is a single father with a teenage daughter who sells vacuums in Havana and still pines for his ex. Strapped for money he agrees to work for British Intelligence, a position for which he has no experience, eventually setting up a field office complete with real and fictional spies. The law of unintended consequences kicks in when fictional reports and actual events coincide. The book shifts from an amusing satire to thriller, but doesn't lose the comedic overtones.OUR MAN IN HAVANA will make you smile, is a fast read and has Greene's exceptional prose. Looking at the state of today's intelligence operations, in the US and abroad, things may not have changed appreciably; with Greene's depiction far closer to the truth than Fleming's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too silly to be plausible","review":"This is a well-written satire with some of the same ingredients that work well in other works by the great Graham Greene. But in this case both the characters and the action are too far into the realm of comics to be believable. [Of course you might say that Graham Greene knew infinitely more about incompetence and delusion in the Secret Service than I do, and without doubt that is true, but Greene's other similar books (e.g., The Comedians) don't go this far and look more like the truth.] The dialogue ranges toward the cute. The best parts are the conversations between Wormold and his daughter Millie. Those involving Dr. Hasselbacher are rather good also. At his best Greene wrote as well as Hemingway, but not in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not My Cup of Tea","review":"Well for once a Greene book didn't really appeal to me. I think this is meant to be a spy-comedy, but as usual I didn't laugh one single time! I think Greene had intended this to be a good humoured comment to a time which was very tense upon the cold war. Things like that just don't really appeal to me, sory Greene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Entertaining","review":"This was the first Graham Greene novel for me, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This book is a satirical look at the world of spying--set in Cuba just prior to Castro. The main character is a vacuum cleaner salesman who is reluctantly recruited to become a spy for British intelligence. The problem is that he is not cut out for the job so he just makes up his own spies and his own intelligence. That is comical enough until you find out the British and the Cubans both buy into his made up stories. What happens later is almost reminiscent of Inspector Jacques Clousteau. The ending is especially amusing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a guy I know","review":"I read this book lying on a beach in Mallorca over the course of two days. It's an easy and amusing read. I liked the main character Wormold. He's so laid back and lets events overtake him and take control of his life. Not unlike a few real life characters I know! Anyone who can \\"fall\\" into the role of a secret service agent and then believe he can fool them with plans of vacuum cleaner instead of a weapon is clearly off his head. What makes the character funnier is that he thinks that he will get away with it and it is an earnest attempt to fool them that he is doing something meaningful. There is nothing sinister in his deception - just a naive desire to please and get by in life as quietly as possible. As you will find out in this book, the quiet life is something that he fails to achieve.The only reason why it doesn't score 5 points is that it's a bit light weight. It's over all to soon. - Perfect for the beach though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Carre meets Fawlty Towers","review":"Still funny (and biting) after all these years, OMiH is a terrific read.

Wormold a vacuum cleaner dealer is recruited as a spy for a British secret - organisation in Cuba. He invents all his information to keep the government money coming for his daughter who has expensive wishes. Wormold turns in drawings of vacuum cleaner parts as part of an imaginary secret installation in Cuba and invents agents that all have to be paid. During the whole story nobody remarks, that he is all the time telling lies and still at the end as they know it, they can't do anything because he would show off the secret-agency. Good stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Of Merchant Kings and Vacuum Cleaners","review":"The reader follows a simple vacuum cleaner salesman that is living in Cuba, all set before Castro becomes leader. Jim Wormold is recruited by the British government to keep an eye on goings on in Cuba. However instead of reporting fact he reports fiction, making it all up as he goes along.

I tried this one last night. I thought it was pretty good. Really big noodles but the reconstituted veggies have a bit to be desired. They weren't awful. They were exactly what they are. The broth itself has a really good flavor. I had to add a little salt though, a little bland without it. It was a little spicy but not overly. Just enough to give it a great flavor. I will surely buy these again. It was the perfect thing for a light supper or would make a great lunch.

The taste is good, and it is enough to satisfy hunger...but as I said, it is \\"lite\\" not \\"hearty\\" or \\"filling\\".I say it's good for work because it doesn't require refrigeration, and it can remain in a desk drawer ready to save the day when there's no time for a more elaborate meal."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple and delicious!","review":"This Annie Chun's udon soup is very easy to prepare. I don't think the first step is necessary either. Just add the water to the noodles and dried vegetables, cover it with the lid and microwave it for about 3 1/2 minutes. Add the sauce packet. The noodles loosen up after you stir it. If you what a more filling soup, add meat/vegetables. My kids and I really love this soup! I just purchased more from Amazon, because it's a better buy here than at the grocery store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bland soup","review":"The broth is really bland and has no taste. Its one of the worst broths I have ever tasted. The noodles themselves are decent. Not the best noodles but not the worst so it gets 2 stars instead of 1.

Instead of spending 5 or 6 bucks to get add extra lipids to my arteries, I decided to try these noodles.The noodles were already cooked sealed in a vaccum bag. The dehydrated vegtables actually look like vegtables after you add water to it. Overall, I felt it was a pretty \\"authentic\\" Udon experience. I really enjoyed these noodles. Also, at 110 cal per serving ( there is 2 servings in the bowl ) its a not too bad for you. If you want something quick, great tasting, and not good for you, this is your item.The sodium is a bit high, but you can always control that with how much of the soy sauce you put in.

When I saw this on line with the better price I ordered immediately.Guess there was a reason it was on line, when I opened the packet of noodles they began to fall apart into small pieces. When reconstituted in hot water they turned into a thick gelatinous mess that fell apart when I tried to eat it.I tried to return or order a replacement and was told through the web I could not do this with food items, even if unopened.

Simplified, but effective plans and other diagrams complement the photos and text.In an age when so-called \\"star\\" architects do more talking than building, it is refreshing to see these monasteries, built with humility and a sense of aesthetic understanding that is so absent in the architectural profession today.I also recommend Lucien Herve's wonderful B+W photographs in \\"The Architecture of Truth: Thonet Abbey\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"Jaquese did an absolutly wonderful job writting this book.

For another such book written specifically for parents, look into THE FAMILY CLOISTER: BENEDICTINE WISDOM FOR THE HOME, by David Robinson (New York: Crossroad, 2000).

I hope that our over 700 yearly visitors could verify that when they leave us after their usual weekend or week long stay. Perhaps Joan's greatest gift is being able to find the beauty, the inspirational, the grace in every day events, places, etc...even in a Benedictine monastery..or ESPECIALLY in a Benedictine monastery. Equally challenging is to take a 1500 year old spiritual document and try to make sense of it at this time in history, in this culture, for us. Joan does a wonderful job, but after all she was a Benedictine prioress for 12 years, so she should know the life and be able to interpret it.

I was disppointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"meandering and poorly written","review":"This was the first (and so far the last) Clive Barker book that I've read. I was so disappointed that I had spent time reading this book that I considered throwing it away. Although promising at the beginning it became a true drudgery to complete. The story started out well but degenerated into ridiculous situations made worse by asinine dialogue. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly","review":"Simply a horrible book. Enjoyed most of the shorts in the Books of Blood series. Wasted my time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really don't get it","review":"I read some good reviews of Clive Barker, and thought this book would be a good start to reading horror. I was very dissapointed. I read the first part of the book, the Messenger, the concept of \\"the Art\\" made no sense to me whatsoever, and i decided this was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Fan","review":"This was the first Clive Barker book I've read. I was not impressed by anything - characters, plot, or writing style. It was laborious to read and would never be a reading recommendation I would make. The story is not especially suspenseful or compelling and there was no real empathy established with the characters though horrific things happen to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't get enough of it!","review":"In The Great and Secret Show: The first book of the Art, Clive Barker demonstrated amazing talent, from the paradoxical love between Jo-Beth and Howie, to Tesla's seeming Shaman qualities and the entirely separate meanings of Trinity. I found the book impossible to put down once I got past the first section, concentrating on the nation-wide battle between the Jaff and the Good Man Fletcher. Barker held my attention, as undevided as it could be, in the palm of his hand through the tragedy of the League of Virgins, the meeting and uniting of two people born for the purpose of continuing their fathers' life-long hate, and all the catastrophic events stemming from their meeting, until the final Show at the home of a famous comedian. I can't wait to read Everville, and greatly anticipate the publication of a third book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clive Barker is a genius","review":"I finished reading \\"The Great and Secret Show\\" last night, (Actually it was this morning because I couldn't stop) and I just can't take my mind off of it! I thought the Damnation Game and the Books of Blood trilogy were fabulous, but nothing could have ever prepared me for the brilliance of this book. Never have I had my breath taken away on such a regular basis or cared so much about any novel. I felt so sick and restless everyday at work because I could only think of getting home to continue this masterpiece! The Great and Secret Show is an experience I'll never forget, and it's visions of extreme beauty and dread will always haunt me and play in my dreams. I'll be buying Everville tonight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truely a unique book","review":"I read it years ago and rebought it because I saw the movie The Virgin Suicides. There is a part of this book that I was reminded of in the movie and truth be told, the book is better than I rememebered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I actually bought this book because of the great reviews. I was hoping for a gem. I had to actually force myself to continue to read it. I just couldn't find myself attached to any of the characters. I had absolutely no bond with the characters. Clive Barker is an excellent, beautiful writer. He is definitely gifted. I loved the concept of the book, but I just wish that the story was more developed. Mostly about what EXACTLY is the Art. I needed to know more about Quiddity, it's history, the Shoal, Kissoon. What exactly did Jaffe read in those letters to drive his ambition. Why did he believe those letters? I tried to get attached to the characters. Even the Good Man Fletcher. But something was missing from the characters. They lacked depth. Death boy was overboard. It's as if Barker is writing specifically for a movie. A \\"B\\" horror flick at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This was my first (and so far sole) attempt to read Clive Barker. I thought overall the concept was intriguing, however, I felt that neither the premise was explained very well nor were there any characters I truly cared about. Half of my reaction to the book can be summed up in one word, \\"Huh?\\" The constant shifts in perspective never let me identify with any character, so I didn't care about any of them one way or another. I was simply indifferent. My own preference lies towards stories with very believable characters and unfortunately this one didn't fulfill that for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story","review":"I love this story so much that I've read it multiple times. I just wish it was longer. Love all the characters and the emotions they go through. Believable pain, believable friendship, believable awakening of love. I want a friend like Chordelia, and I already have a funny, sweet, hungry husband like Frank. Like I said, the only downside is that the story isn't longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par","review":"Like other reviewers stated: this book has a good and uplifting message. The idea that a person's physical appearance doesn't deter them from wanting and finding a \\"soul connection\\" in our superficial world. And I enjoyed the author's narrative style of interjecting journal-like monologues from other character's point-of-view throughout the book. What I didn't like was the length of the story...around 100 pages...which I blame for the second disappointment, lack of character development and plot. There was a great plot outline in the story, but the actual tale was so linear and boring. It was like the framework of a great book was present, but wasn't \\"fleshed\\" out to my liking. The dialogue was a bit trite as well. No momentus revelations here folks. Nope, it's your plain and simple: \\"I like you\\" and \\"I like you too Frank\\" all the way to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great short story-poor novel","review":"Leaving Winter is a wonderful little story. However, it lacks character and plot development. Would have been much better in an anthology rather than a book of its own. I felt quite cheated by the brevity of it. Also, fellow readers, if you are looking for any descriptive narration of the love scenes...don't bother with this book. If you can find the book in the library, which I couldn't, get it there. If you are a fast reader, you will be able to complete this book in an hour or less. Not worth the price of admission."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS ALBUM ROCKS!!","review":"If you are GWAR fan (like myself)or you wanna get into them you must buy this cd...NOW!!!on the \\"discussion board\\" thingly on the bottom some kid says \\"go to hell!\\" sucks....Screw him! that is one of the BEST tracks! eight lock is probably my favorite though! if ur thinking about getting it u should! dont listen to people that say \\"that band blows,man\\". get it and judge for yourself. i personaly think any one with Real taste in rock/metal music will love this cd! also check out violence has arrived! thei BEST of all! im lookin forward to seeing them this halloween in louisvile!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GWAR AS DONE IT AGAIN!!!!!","review":"GWAR RULES AND ALWAYS WILL.

Why couldn't Nina Hagen just shut the hell up!!!???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Early American Locomotives.","review":"This book is a collection of engravings from the 19th Century, each with minimal history. It is an absolute gem , a cache of information about locomotives from before the era of manufacturers photographs. Engravings were used as illustration in sales literature and publicity material, and so a wide variety of locomotive types are depicted covering more or less 1800-1900. The accuracy of the engravings is superb-in some cases it is possible to scale from an engraving to determine pipe sizes, nut bolt diameter etc. For the price this book cannot be beaten."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the movie, but read the book... or book then movie","review":"This is based on Jan de Hartog's book: The Captain.

The acting is simply superb with a wonderful cast - William Holden, Sophia Loren, Trevor Howard, Oscar Homolka, Bernard Lee (yes, M from the James Bond films) and Kieron Moore. Directed by the reat Carol Reed (The Third Man, The Fallen Idol, Odd Man Out and Oscar winning for the musical Oliver!), this is a fascinating movie of stark stomach churning fear during World War II - and a spiritual/superstitious attempt to ward off all jinxes and emerge alive - through the shared love of a broken beautiful woman.Few movies will make you feel the jagged terrible fear in war and the desperation to be assured one will be ok.It's amazing that it's not been releaed on DVD - I'd certainly buy it in an instant. It's superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Average","review":"Those are just fair and well played readings of these symphonies.

I never really listened carefully when I ran across her work, but this CD made me sit up and take notice. She has a strong, unique voice and style. Her \\"Too White to Sing the Blues, Blues\\" is so much more than a novelty song. It is funny, it is bluesy, it is captivating.

However, despite this the pad now works fine and although not terribly easy to draw pecisely with (I guess this takes prectice and alot of zooming) I can see advantages over a mouse.

I am assuming it overheated like I have had happen with cheap 10$ blenders and the motor burned out, so I think it was poorly made and looking at the tiny motor and heap of plastic, probably 200% of what retail SHOULD be. I paid 40$ for this, I am not happy, I didn't register a warranty and don't see how I would keep trusting this company unless they offer to replace it when I call.

We ordered another one, and then the motor burned out. We bought another, and the gears broke just after the warranty was up. We bought another because there was really nothing like the salad shooter, and the gears disintegrated just after the warranty was up again. I will never buy another. I think they have engineered it perfectly from a marketing perspective, so that it breaks just after the warranty is up.

We had hoped this 'Pro' model would fuction like the standard size, but be sturdier and made better. We were wrong. The 'Pro' model is the same plastic quality as the standard model, just bigger. In this case 'Bigger' is 'Worse'. It takes more room to store the tool; it is noiser, and, being bigger, there is more room in the shredder and the shredder feed for whatever you are shredding to get stuck, and hence, wasted. On the noise side, it is in the category of 'power tool' - not as loud as a skilsaw, but louder than a sabre saw, for example. This is a tool I regret buying and I will replace it soon - even before it breaks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Professional SaladShooter","review":"This is the second Professional Shooter I have purchased. The size, motor size, and grating/shredding capacity is what brings me back. I like to buy things in bulk and shred them myself and this does the job wonderfully.

So thank you to Presto for this wonderful machine and I would whole heartedly recommend it!! The only reason I did not give a full 5 star (would have been 4.5 if that was possible) was because it is a little hard to hold and shred and the shooter doesn't shoot far so have to hold it over the bowl and press at same time can be a bit challenging.

Works fine with vegetables like zuccini, squash and potatoes. But I purchased it so that I wouldn't have to do all the slicing and chopping to prepare salads so I am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Presto Pro","review":"Purchased as a Christmas gift for my parents, they requested a electric salad shooter.

When it finally broke, I bought the Pro version because it looked like it had a much larger opening. Well, they say it will cut potatos, either in slices or crinkle cut. But you still have to cut the potato in half, so the chips you create are too small, in too thin. I just don't think there are enough uses, even for the larger food opening to make it worthwhile for most cooks. Unless you're making a salad for a dozen people, why pull out this machine to slice up 2 or three inches of a cucumber, or carrots.THe device still is great for shredding cheese, but not enough real world uses."},{"rating":"2","title":"We love it!","review":"Our food processor was great, but cleaning it after use was a nightmare.

All parts rinsed off easily and then we tossed them in the dishwasher. What could be easier? This is a HUGE improvement over our food processor. Now that we see how easy cleanup is, we use the SaladShooter for veggies, shredding cheese, and even slicing some of our favorite fruits.

The tracks all stand as close to pure 12-bar as you can achieve without actually aiming at blues purism. This extremely pallet massaging work could be from 1970 for its clear production and adherence to old delta forms.But what really got me about Cavalli is his voice. He has a light alto and sings every track with a laid back-but never detached-vibrato. Now unless you are Robert Plant or Burton Cummings or Rob Thomas, a class A set of pipes is rare. But Carvalli understands the art of great singing, staying a fraction of an inch back from the music, letting the music carry him.

She is careful not to present herself as a 'guru', but rather as another seeker on the journey who does not always get things right.Using personal anecdotes as illustrations, she largely succeeds in bringing home to us the notion that God accomplishes his purposes for our individual lives and for the whole world through both our strengths and vulnerabilities.

He is not merely trying to make us feel good in the dream (which he describes this world as) but to get us to choose between the dream and reality, which he bids us to awaken to with Him. \\"The Gift of Change\\" totally misses the point. There's nothing wrong with feeling good, but there are plenty of other spiritual paths available that can accomplish that.

So to make a long story short, this album is in my opinion the best Bon Jovi album yet!Bon Jovi Forever!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi Keeps On Rockin","review":"The new cd by Bon Jovi is a definite good listen. The cd shows that the New Jersey Boys have not lost their rock edge. Undivided is a great track in tribute to the tragic events of 9-11. The whole album is super - so be sure to give it a listen \\"EVERY DAY\\"!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderfull come back","review":"It's a wonderfull cd of the group.

THIS EDGINESS IS ESCPECIALLY APPARENT IN THE TITLE TRACK BOUNCE, AS WELL AS EVERY DAY, UNDIVIDED, AND MY PERSONAL FAVORITE LOVE ME BACK TO LIFE. A BON JOVI CD WOULD NOT BE COMPLETE WITHOUT A GREAT LOVE SONG OR TWO, SUCH AS YOU HAD ME AT HELLO. JON HAS ALWAYS HAD A GREAT VOICE FOR SINGING SLOW SONGS- YOU CAN FEEL THE PAIN WHEN YOU HEAR LYRICS. THIS CD JUST ONCE AGAIN PROVES WHAT ALL OF US BON JOVI FANS HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN-- THIS GROUP'S TALENT IS EVER EVOLVING AND IT IS NO ACCIDENT THAT THEY HAVE STOOD THE TEST OF TIME FOR OVER 20 YEARS, AND IT JUST KEEPS GETTING BETTER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi Bounce CD","review":"I absolutely love the new Bounce CD. Bounce is my favorite song of the bunch--very energetic. I think it is some of their best work yet. I love the heavy guitar in the new music and the way the lyrics are almost accapella at certain times. I find the lyrics of some of the songs also very sensitive and it makes them that much more appealing. Bon Jovi still my favorite since I first heard them in 1981. How much more dedicated can you be?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Bon Jovi fan","review":"This cd is a must have. I admit that I am a die hard Bon Jovi fan but fan or not this is a cd anyone can fall in love with. I think this cd surpasses all of my expectations. This is a cd you can leave on repeat and not get sick of it. Every song is different and unique. I just can't tell you enough how awesome this cd is. Go out and purchase it now. Also if you buy the cd you can get guaranteed good seats to Bon Jovi's next concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce - What Are You Waiting For?!?!?","review":"In a time a second rate musicianship and posers, Bon Jovi answers the pleas of desperate rock and roll fans everywhere with their newest album Bounce. This carefully orchestrated masterpiece takes the listener on a magical journey that explores/celebrates the energy and resilience of the human spirit.Tracks such as Undividend and Bounce not only echo this theme, but illustrate the incredible musical and lyrical talents of guitarist Richie Sambora and lead vocalist Jon Bon Jovi. Likewise the ballads laced throughout the album reinforce this powerful message and showcase the incredible range of the band as a whole.If you haven't bought it, you're missing out on the greatest thing sinced sliced bread. If you have bought it, sit back throw your feet up, and get ready to be blown away. Not just by the music - but the energy it exudes.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi is bouncing back again with BOUNCE!","review":"Bon Jovi's new cd BOUNCE is all that a Bon Jovi fan could hope for. There is hard hitting rock like the current single EVERYDAY which about living in the moment. There are ballads like YOU HAD ME FROM HELLO which is from the Tom Cruise movie. And there is good old storytelling like the song JOEY about a guy who is a little slow and how he has to make a life. All in all this cd offers a little bit of everything for every listener. I strongly recommend Bon Jovi's BOUNCE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi - Bounce","review":"An awesome mix of hard pounding rock and smooth ballads. Easy Listening and melodies that linger. Best song on the cd without question - Bounce!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Boys are Back!","review":"I LOVE this cd!The music is alive, and the lyrics meaningful. \\"Undivided\\" addresses 9/11 in a very positive way, \\"Every Day\\" is an \\"It's My Life\\"/\\"Sleep When I'm Dead\\" kind of get out there and live song. \\"Hook Me Up\\" kicks butt and takes names. The story songs are really cool too.Much edgier than \\"Crush\\", this happily sounds like a Bon Jovi record (Crush sounded more like Tom Petty, which is fine, if you're Tom Petty, but not good for Bon Jovi).Go buy this, you'll be glad you did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi Rocks!!","review":"I just bought this album today and, man is it awesome!! \\"Everyday\\" is the best song on the album!! It's great to see that this legendary rock group is still around. This is kind of a new sound for them. It's a lot of hard rock, but they sound great. I would recommend this to anyone who has been a long time Bon Jovi fan!! It's worth buying"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi-Bounce Back!","review":"This cd rocks!! It's one of the best they've ever done. I have each cd from their self titled debut album Bon Jovi, to Crush. Each song captures Bon Jovi's sensational sound. My personal favorite is track 3 -The Distance. This is a awesome, theatrical song, love the lyrics. Very uplifting. I highly recommend this cd. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi Bounces High with this One!","review":"As do wine, Bon Jovi gets even better with age.Even though this is not a 9/11 CD; the emotionsthat all Americans felt that day are best depictedon the first track, \\"Undivided\\". The rest of the albumcan be summed up with three words: faith, hope, and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you!","review":"I listened to it the first time and was a little taken back to times ago....a few months later I love the album and it has it's own sounds and distinctions.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It won't keep me bouncing for long","review":"Bon Jovi one of many long time rockbands are back again with Bounce a album that includes some classic rock tracks and some ballads as usual. Jon and Richie are writing most songs as usual but notable is that the Swede Andreas Carlsson from Cheiron is appearing on a few one's too. The Cheiron guys wrote the huge 2000 summer hit \\"It's my life\\" we all remember. However these songs are not as good \\"Misunderstood\\" and \\"All About Lovin' You\\" are songs that got some airplay but we later tend to forget very quicky. \\"Everyday\\" \\"Hook me up\\" and \\"Bounce\\" stand for the rockier tracks and songs like \\"Right Side Of Wrong\\" and \\"Joey\\" are notable ballads. But these songs are far from classics like masterpiece \\"Living on a prayer\\" or power ballad \\"Always\\". These songs will get played for a while to later be forgotten. As much as i like Bon Jovi i have to admit it was quite some time now they made any special albums, each album have some nice one's but no classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bounce","review":"Bon Jovi has streamlined into yet another genre of music. There latest release \\"Bounce\\" is a far cry from previous Bon Jovi Albums.Jon and writing partner Richie Sambora have written less songs together on this album than any other Bon Jovi albums in the past and it shows. There is a complete lack of any aggressive guitar playing on this record. It is clear that jon needs to get off his ego trip and realize that he and his fans suffer without Richie's musical contribution.(The bands fan club used to be :\\"Back stage with Bon Jovi\\") Now it is simply: \\"Back stage with Jon Bon Jovi) Jon has teamed with the likes of Billy Falcon on 3 of the tracks as well as Desmond Child on several others.Jon : IF IT AINT BROKE DONT FIX IT !ie;Slippery when wetBillChicago"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi had ME from Hello!","review":"This CD is amazing. From the first song \\"Undivided\\" which is about 9/11, to my favorite ballad \\"You Had Me From Hello\\" (which I wish Jon was singing to me!) it is just one CD that is a \\"must have\\". Bon Jovi keeps getting better with every CD. Their songs are so uplifting and positive, while totally rocking at the same time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Groovy Band","review":"This band never ceases to amaze me. Every CD they have put out is good. TO tell you the truth CRUSH was the first CD of their's that I bought. But since then I've listened to the others, and I have to say they are great. Everyone should listen to a little Bon Jovi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad songs of missing feelings trying to bounce you back","review":"Sad songs of missing feelings trying to bounce you back to life.The songs are sad but the singer always have a good voice andknows how sing and make music.I liked the ritm of Joey. Everyday is movie theme of Identify Bourne a remake of another movie of seventies.Open all night I liked the beginning I am sure I just heard thismusic before. The music instrumental is perfect in album.I missed those old songs with sad songs but happy music instrumental. And other with pop music. Like Saturday Night or Bed of Roses. The best song I liked was Never say goodbye.The ballad song I would like in Bounce is All about lovin youI like The Distance lyric and the music mixed with lyric of Openall night. Thanks for all people composers and musics of this album. I liked Desmond child co work in every album of Bon Jovi.I ever try to find some reason to love and live in Bon Jovi songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Year for Bon Jovi!","review":"This is an amazing Album, I have been a Bon Jovi from the 80's and I think this is one of their best albums ever, they have made the crossover from Slippery When Wet and they sound great. The songs are more mellow but also more deep and meaningful, specially with everything going on in the world. \\"Everyday\\" gives makes you greatful for being alive, and the ballads just makes you want to fall in love! This album is a must have and a keeper for any Bon Jovi fan! You will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BON JOVI RESSURRECTION","review":"\\"Crush\\" marked Bon Jovi's comeback not too long ago, and it was a successful one, now they've followed it up with this new release \\"Bounce,\\" and it's even better! I've never heard Bon Jovi sound so in form and reconnected to their roots, this album is phenomenal! Every song on the album is sensational Bon Jovi, they really went to work on this one and I am thoroughly impressed. I honestly didn't think they would beat the \\"Crush\\" album, but with this effort, they've left it behind in the dust. I truly believe that Bon Jovi is back and here to stay for awhile, so for those of you who don't like it, you'll just have to get used to it! One other thing, for those of you who have missed Richie Sambora's crunching, heavy metal guitar riffs like myself, they're back in a big way on many tracks on this album! Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild And Balladic","review":"\\"Wild In The Streets\\" Bon Jovi is back in 2000s form. \\"The Distance\\" is similarly styled as Creed's \\"My Sacrifice\\" but Bon Jovi's done better. \\"Hook Me Up\\" is another excellent \\"wild track\\" and classic Bon Jovi rocker \\"Bounce\\" makes me roar like I was in 1985. The only trouble is the ballads such as \\"Joey\\", \\"All About Loving You\\", \\"Right Side or Wrong\\" are so confusingly similarly styled to each other, though all are nice in themselves. Recommended for wide range of pop hard rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is such an awesome album","review":"this album is great. it is not fair, that bonjovi is not getting the airplay they deserve. i really love undivided. it really hits home(about 9-11) a must have album. bonjovi never dissappoints. been a fan since 1985."},{"rating":"1","title":"bon jovi in a wrong direction.","review":"the first two songs of the album are really good but then the album slows down with some slow boring jams ,in other words bon jovi is not like he used to be in 96."},{"rating":"1","title":"not bon.jovi sorry","review":"i liked 80s bonjovi but not the new stuff. the 80s songwriting was the best for this band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"The Album Bounce is very strong in the music sense. the songs Undivided, Everyday and The Distance show that. on the other hand Bon Jovi have very mellodic songs as Joey, You Had Me From Hello, & All About Lovin You. Richie & Jon's collaboration on this Album is just amazing! I would reccomend this CD to all the Bon Jovi lovers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce","review":"Never a disappointing album from the boys of Jersey. This album starts off with a great song \\"Undivided\\", this song both musically and lyrically is excellant. There was musically a lot more hard core stuff going on, lyrically however it was softer. The song \\"Bounce\\" is just a good old fun Bon Jovi song. The Bon Jovi roots are there with some modern sounding Matchbox20 like music mixed in. A definate buy.

If you are a long time fan or just like a few of the songs, it is a great album to purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi - Bounce","review":"I instantly fell in love with Undivided, Everyday, Bounce and All about loving you, I do however think there is way too much slow and middle of the road material. Bon Jovi should go back to the pre- Slippery days with a 2000 twist. I do and always will support the boys from Jersey!!! Great stuff!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Ready to Bounce","review":"Bon Jovi's new album, Bounce, is one of the best yet. With songs like Everyday, Undivided, and Bounce to let the world we've survived 9/11 and will continue to be strong and live our lives to the fullest. The ballads are typical Bon Jovi, straight from the heart. Jon's acting experiences have an influence on the songs Right Side of Wrong and Open All Night. This album proves the band's longevity and maturity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi - Bounce","review":"Having been a fan of Bon Jovi for many years the band just seem to be gettting better and better. Its good to see that they can still surprise their fans and also get new fans of all ages. You only have to go to the message board on BonJovi.com to see that the ages vary and with this album I think that the band have pulled another \\"rabbit out of the hat\\" the songs are fantastic, from the rockier ones to the ballads an all round excellant album. Buy and try it you wont be dissappointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This album is well worth any amount of money you'd care to spend on it.

It will surely not disappoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce Rocks","review":"Jon Bon Jovi and the Band have scored another hit record with the latest CD entitled Bounce. They have included an awesome mixture of rock and ballads in the 12 tracks. Once again the storytelling by Jon and Richie is right on track. Every listener needs to check out the tracks called \\"You Had Me At Hello\\" and the \\"Right Side Of Wrong\\". Both are sure to become classics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bon Jovi now #2 on my chart","review":"After several listens trying to get into the new Bounce CD, I have to say, I'm disappointed. It starts out really rocking & I'm getting excited & impressed, then I lose it. It's on the boring, repetitive side. Did you guys not have more material than this to choose from in the 2 yr. wait? \\"Everyday\\" is the best on this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce is awesome.","review":"Bon Jovi only gets better like fine wine. Every song is a hit. My favorites are Hey Joey, Everday and All about loving you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mix of tunes","review":"As a long time fan of these guys I was patiently waiting for this album, in the wake of 9/11. I got exactly what I expected. A well written collection of songs that range from heavy rock to deeply acoustic soulful tunes. I think every song on this CD features an acoustic guitar on some level. Overall I think this is an extension of the CRUSH album - a continuation of the evolution of this great band. I'm especially impressed with the writing on this one, well written songs that are not overboard in references to 9/11."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bon Jovi Music","review":"Bounce the new bon jovi cd in a few words amazing!!!if i was to compare this bon jovi cd to any other artist i could not honestly it is in my opinion the best bon jovi album ever bounce is like the beggings of bon jovi, it resembles the two first bon jovi albums . a little more rock and guitar than the latest really truely amazing! Bon Jovi's Bounce definatly Bounced on the charts with a vengence and will stay there for a while still to come garantee!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce back with Bon Jovi","review":"The new album Bounce by Bon Jovi will do just that; Bounce Bon Jovi back into the spotlight.

The album tells a story of sorts over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Bounce\\" rocks!!","review":"\\"Bounce\\" rocks! I love the way Bon Jovi has touched on the 9-11-01 tragedy and the optimism of our nation. I love the way I can relate to the songs in my everyday life. I think my two favorite songs are \\"You had me from hello\\" (what couple can't relate to this?) and \\"Undivided\\" because it could have been any one of our family members lost in the rubble. Bon Jovi unites America with good old rock 'n roll once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best of Bon Jovi...","review":"I've been a Bon Jovi fan since they began playing and I believe this is one of their best albums. I really like the songs but my favourite ones are: The Distance and Everyday among others. I strongly recomend this album to all-time rockers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi BOUNCED Back","review":"I am a long time fan and I have to say this is a mature Bon Jovi! When I heard Crush for the first time, I thought man they have reached the top. I am shocked at how the band has evolved on the new album. I would recommend this album to anyone who likes to rock ~ this is not for the easy listening crowd. The Distance is an excellent prodcution, very well done. Of course the single Everyday is a winner. But my personal favorites are The Distance for its awesome sound and Bouce for its upbeat ..um..bounce! I cannot wait to see Bounce performed live! I know it will be outstanding. So I guess my advice is to buy this album..and of course any of the previous ones but you already own those right?; o )"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stadium rock pure: \\"Bounce\\"","review":"Bon Jovi are back again. Two years after \\"Crush\\" and an extensive world tour the mainstream rocker of New Jersey have come back with their new (in the meantime) eighth studio album \\"Bounce\\". On their new album Bon Jovi play songs (similar as Bruce Springsteen does) about the terror attacks of New York and Washington.Bruce Springsteen plays more thoughtful and reserved songs, but Bon Jovi unpack their guitars and ROCK!Many songs on \\"Bounce\\" sound rough, strong and powerful and wake up memories of the Bon Jovi classic \\"Slippery when wet\\" of 1986: hard numbers, groovy mid tempo songs and wonderful hymn ballads. \\"Bounce\\" is pure stadium rock that can't be made better.So, I've given five stars for Bon Jovi's newest album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"~~Bouncing to bounce~~","review":"Once again Bon Jovi has shown how much dedication he has for his fans. When you hear the music on this cd it is almost as if he is singing to you. I have been a HUGE fan of the band for almost 20 yrs and I was so excited to add another GREAT cd to my collection.

Buy this CD you wont be sorry it is wonderful ear candy, you just cant get enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi's Bounce is a good cd","review":"This a must have cd for Bon Jovi fans but is also a cd that new fans will enjoy. It has some great rock songs on it like Hook Me Up, and Bounce. It also has several ballads on it. My only wish is Bon Jovi would have not had so many ballads on this cd. I also appreciate the Elton John esque songs like: \\"Hey Joey\\". All in all I think this is one of the better Bon Jovi cd's to come out since the 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUT NOT 5 STARS","review":"This album is the hardest album since 7800 Farenheit and I love that but there are TOO many ballads and mid-tempo songs that bring down the harder songs.

Richie's guitar playing is at it's best and Jon sounds incredible!! Everyday will get you up dancing - Bounce will have everyone signing. All about Loving you...well wonderful love song.

This CD is a must...not only for Jovi fans, but anyone who just wants to listen to some GOOD OLE ROCK AND ROLL."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi delivers powerful performance","review":"I'll admit, Crush wasn't one of my favorite Bon Jovi albums so I was skeptical about how good the new release could be. After hearing a few of the songs in New York I was suprised at how good they were. The whole album is great. It's a powerful dedication to the country that the band loves. Misunderstood, Undivided, and the title track are in my opinion the best on the album, but every track belongs here and combined they make this one of the better releases Bon Jovi have put out in a long time. This is a must have for every fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi still going strong","review":"If you have ever liked this band, hummed along to their tunes, or cranked it up - this album IS the perfect addition to your collection. The fact that they are still here, playing the music that they love, and rocking all those who go along for the ride....says Everything.This album takes you from Hard hitting 9/11 anthems, to why we fall in love, to songs that we will be singing for years to come.It's great to know that there are artists singing today with actual talent.You Need to Buy Bounce"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any fan!!!","review":"This CD is a great one a must have for any bon jovi fan. from tracks 1-12 you just cant stop listening to it! The song ( track 2) \\"Everyday\\" was a great song to promote the cd. I think they should have used \\"Bounce\\" another great track to headline it but you dont always get your way. But to my point any one who likes a nice version of rock must get this cd. If you like rock ballats you need this cd. If you are a fan of Bon Jovi YOU NEED THIS CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! What a powerfully emotional album!","review":"Bon Jovi made another hit with this one. Not only do I completely melt when I listen to Jon belt out those explosive lyrics, but Richie's solos are still nothing short of amazing. This album has it all, great song writing & great music. This is one album that I don't have to skip tracks; they all have me hooked. Although, imo, 'Bounce' is the #1 track to me. It has a great attitude that perfectly matches today's society. What else can I tell? Get this album now! I've got it playing all the time. Believe me, these guys can still rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi Bonces Back","review":"Bounce is the best Jovi album, \\"Bounce\\" is great, almost shocked me when I thought that Jon was going to use a 4 letter word in a song, but it's very up-lifting!! \\"Everyday\\" makes you feel great!! \\"Right Side of Wrong\\" is also great!! \\"Joey\\" is another song that makes you listen to it over and over!!

When you need it to pick up with a mid-tempo rocker, they toss you yet another slow ballad. What is it with bands that can't get out of the same grove time after time. I don't care how many albums Jovi has sold over the years, lemings are lemings and I'm sure a few will buy this album. Other than that, I don't see much success for Bounce. It just isn't very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative 1 star","review":"I can't believe sooo many people like this poo.

What a disappointment! \\"Bounce\\" is geared more toward fans of James Taylor and Barry Manilow than those who made them one of the biggest bands on the planet.This album should have been no more than a Jon Bon Jovi solo record as it appeals primarily to those looking escape to a quiet evening of sitting by the fireplace with a cognac in one hand and a good book in the other. Avoid at all costs!If your looking for a true rockin' CD with tons of great melodies, pick up Def Leppard's new disc, \\"X\\", instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bongiovi does it again","review":"Just can't get enough of John what's-his-name.

For that, I give it 1 star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go out and purchase BOUNCE!!","review":"Bon Jovi brings us another great CD to add to our collections. It's everything you expect from Bon Jovi and more. It has songs that rock and the ballads that make you melt. Plus some incredible songs that tell the stories of our lives.The title track BOUNCE is an awesome rock song that makes you want to take on whatever life throws at you. UNDIVIDED is a hard hitting, aggressive song that deals with 9-11 and reminds us how the tragedy brought us together. OPEN ALL NIGHT is a classic ballad that everyone(at some point in their lives) can relate to.With their usual positive, optimistic approach this CD will inspire you to live your life to the fullest EVERYDAY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything You Need To Know","review":"In one word, WOW! What a great album! There are both big loud rock songs and slow love songs.No matter which one of those tupes of music you like, you will like this album!Going from big loud rock songs to slow love songs makes a very enjoyable listeing experience.But the best part of this album is the use of modern technology into the songs, but the bandvery smartly tries not to over-use this.And if you are thinking about downloading it, DON'T! If you download it, you will not get to useAmerican XS, which gives you exclusive features and the right to buy concert tickets beforeanyone else.Not to mention the quality of sound if you download this album will not come even close to thequality of this album. They did a great job with the sound quality!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi: Bounce","review":"As soon as I put this CD on, I knew it would be different than any other Bon Jovi album before it. The first track, \\"Undivided\\", starts out with heavy guitars and booming drums. It definitely sets the mood of the album. The theme throughout is about picking yourself up, dusting yourself off and moving on with your life after 9/11. It rocks harder than any other Bon Jovi album and the ballads are beautiful. It's a very updated sound for the band. The beginning of \\"The Distance\\" sounds a bit like Creed. My favorite tracks are, \\"Love Me Back to Life\\", \\"Misunderstood\\", \\"You Had me From Hello\\" and \\"Bounce\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi bounces back on the scene with new album \\"Bounce\\".","review":"Bon Jovi's new album is, by far, one of...if not..their best. The boys from Jersey have not forgotten their roots on this one! There's a harder edge to some of the songs, but that just makes you want to listen to them more!

Bon Jovi has truly done a magnificent job of making music over the years, and \\"Bounce\\" is certainly not a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"BON JOVI ROCKS","review":"If your not a Jovi fan yet you will be when you hear this album.I can't turn this one off.

I can see at least 8 top ten songs from this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Jersey Rockers","review":"I thought the new CD was really good. They have put out another great set of songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce Takes No Prisoners!","review":"Bon Jovi's Bounce is this year's best rock album. The lyrical quality of each song is outstanding! It goes back to the story-telling roots of music and the heavy sounds of rock that music has been lacking for quite a few years now. Each song is a unique experience. From the heavy guitar riffs in \\"Hook Me Up\\" to the sultry sound of \\"Open All Night\\", this album has something for every rock fan. It's main bright spots are it's title track \\"Bounce\\" and the classic Jovi ballad \\"All About Loving You\\". Pick up this album. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce is Amazing!!","review":"Without a doubt Bounce is an album full of the type of music that Bon Jovi has always given to their fans. Very hard-rockin' songs full of hope and ballads full of love, Bounce has it all. If you are hoping a lot from Bon Jovi with this new album, you are sure gettin' a lot from it. I really recomend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"bon jovi bounces back","review":"bon jovi turns out another great rock record.12 tracks that are sure to please longtime fans and maybe even bring a few new ones into the mix.standout tracks are everyday(the 1st single),misunderstood,the distance and love me back to life.Bon jovi isnt too blind to realize that ballads will please many of the female contingent.so to satisfy that there are 3 included in this collection.Personally 1 or 2 is enough but they are decent enough songs that you really dont mind.If you grew up listening to slippery or youre 16 looking for a cool band to check out definitely pick up bounce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi - \\"Bounce\\" Review","review":"I have been waiting for this album since I heard they were recording it. I was so excited when I bought it. Like a lot of songs, I have to get used to them before I like them. When I first heard \\"Everyday\\" in August, I wasn't a big fan, but it grew on me. Then I heard more and I got excited for the new cd. I have all the other Bon Jovi cds and I am fairly familiar with their style and their past styles.This album to me seems more emotional and dramatic than past ones. The band has been around for nearly 20 years, so obviously their style has changed, grown, matured, and developed over time. Because a lot of the album was inspired by the September 11th attacks, parts were very serious but very uplifting, as the title of the album suggests, \\"Bounce.\\"Overall, I think the songs on this album have the same classic good rock beat that made Bon Jovi famous and made us all love them. Some took me a little while to get used to, and the style is different than in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not bounce","review":"I am really disappointed with the new CD. I thought the latest would be as great as \\"one wild night\\" and others, but it was just too depressing. Too many slow songs and not enough energy flowing. I hope the next is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi rocks with Bounce!","review":"Let me just say that I LOVE Bounce! My favorite songs are: Bounce, The Distance, and Undivided. Bon Jovi doesn't disappoint with their new release. I recommend everyone to go out and buy it as soon as possible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely their BEST!","review":"I love this album! Since the begining Bon Jovi has been my favorite band.. But this CD has got to be the best. Their music has grown with them and with their fans! From Richie's Guitar, to Dave on the Keyboards.. this album is by far a music listener's dream. And we cant forget John, bringing the emotion to the songs the way only he can do!! My favorite song has got to be Love me Back to Life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"throw it away!!","review":"frankly,i was excited when i bought it.Someone told me bonjovi are going back to their roots.heres how i review it-1.undivided-about 9/11.huge riffs,loud drums.good song.2.everyday-fast & good.3.the distance-o.k,4.joey-like elton john,5.misunderstood-pretty ordinary,6.all about loving you-fine,7.hook me up-very good,8.right side of wrong-rubbish song,9.love me back to life-garbage,10.you had me from hello-awful!,11.bounce-best song,12.open all night-dont wanna discuss that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Review","review":"Highlights: none, and that's the problem with this album. Don't get me wrong, all the tracks are good - just not great. Lowlight: Everyday. It sounded like they were just trying to come back to hard edged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many $#%@! Ballads!!","review":"If they had released an album of nothing but 80s pop-metal of yesterday, that would have been awesome compared to this. I was mislead horribly by the opening \\"Undivided\\" and the single \\"Everyday\\", two of the finest tracks by the band EVER, I mean these are my favourite BJ tracks out of their entire catalogue, but after that, this album just goes to hell and never comes back. Almost every song after is a ballad of some form..I thought I was finally seeing an album with a set of you know whats, but, what you got is slow, dopey ballads that really mean nothing. I'm all for ballads but what the..? TOO MUCH. I give the album a great big 2 stars because the title track isn't so bad, \\"Hook Me Up\\" comes close to being something I'd listen to again, and \\"Joey\\" is almost memorable, but meh! There's better music out there and there sure is better Bon Jovi out there. What does the future hold for the band? Who cares!? F this S, if you know what I mean! 2/12"},{"rating":"2","title":"THe Jerseys Boys did it again!","review":"The new alumb \\"bounce\\" it wonderful!

My top 5 songs in no particular order (as that order changes from day to day) are \\"Bounce\\" - What a rocking great song, I can't wait to hear this live. \\"Everyday\\" - Very uplifting song that is great to sing along to. My children who are all under the age of 8 absolutly adore this song too. \\"Undivided\\" - wow, very up song, love this one a real lot at the moment. \\"Love Me Back To Life\\" - This is just a beautiful ballad. \\"Hook Me Up\\" - The start of this song is just awesome I love the guitar work in this, very heavy ... reminds me of Metallica.Over all this album is fantastic. I would fully recommend it to long time fans and to the new fans of this awesome band this is a great opportunity to see what great talent has come from these guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounce Baby!","review":"If your a long time Bon Jovi fan or a new fan, you'll love their new Cd \\"Bounce\\"\\"Everyday\\", \\"Hook Me Up\\", \\"Bounce\\" and \\"Go the Distance\\" ROCKS!A perfect Christmas gift for anybody who enjoys good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bounc Rocks","review":"I have been anxiously awaiting Bounce and I wasn't let down at all. I really like all of the songs. It has a bit of a heavier sound than Crush but I like that and I think it is a great CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe the Best CD Yet!!","review":"For all you long time Jovi fans and to those of you who are new, this CD is a must have. Could be the best CD they have released to date. Great mix of Rock and Ballads. \\"Bouce\\" over to your nearest store and pick up one or two. Two thumbs up!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Great Bon Jovi","review":"Bon Jovi and his band have such a handle on what makes a song good. They keep pumping out good tracks. Also, they appeal to a wide audience, being heavy enough to attract some Metal and Hard Rock fans but reserved enough to please fans who like the lighter side. For all ages, except maybe the elderly."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great wake up ablum","review":"This album was a great wake up call and proved that Bon Jovi is still kicking and is still the best rock band in the world. It has alot off up beat songs that were magnificant. I gave this album 5 stars because of the feelings that the album gave me. It made me realize how much I have in this world. I am a great fan to Bon Jovi and hope he will never stop making music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Bon Jovi has never completely been a rock band. They've always had heavy pop inflences in their music, all their 80s songs have pop hooks beneath the \\"hair metal\\" loudness. However, anything from the 80s by them is better than this. This is complete pop and should be avoided."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New Album Awsome","review":"Ok this album has a great feel to it. They obviously tried some new things in it and most of it worked out great; but you have to get used to it if you are still very used to the older Bon Jovi music. It goes great after Crush and seems like its just a sequal to the great album that came before it. The songs are going to be great live with the hard sound they used on some of the songs like \\"Undivided,\\" \\"Everyday,\\" and \\"Bounce\\" just to name a few. I would definately recommend this album to anyone who is new to Bon Jovi music or just hasn't heard their stuff in a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!","review":"Bon Jovi is like a good wine, they just keep getting better with age!! The lyrics have depth, yet you can still rock with the windows down while you're going down the road. Great job BJ- keep 'em coming!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon jovi Bounces","review":"three songs on Bounce will definitely keep you bouncing. Hook Me up,Undivided and Bounce are great rockers that will have you on your feet.The Distance and Love me back to life will have you singing along.If you are a Richie Sambora fan this is a must have this cd is really guitar driven.also some great,heartfelt ballads,like You had me from Hello.Once again they have thrown in a mixture for everyone.They Bounce from heavy rock to mid tempo rock to power ballad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi, Bounce","review":"I liked many of the songs. This was somewhat of a departure for Bon Jovi. More hard edged. The most catchy tune was \\"Bounce\\". It will make for a great live performance. The only thing lacking was the lack of solo guitar riffs from Richie Sambora. \\"Everyday\\" was good. The slow stuff was very good as well. Overall, a very powerfull CD, shows versatility. Long time fans may want some back to basics stuff on the next one though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bounce = Ouch!","review":"Sometimes change is good. Bon Jovi blew it with Bounce. Instead of new material, they re-hashed the old. Do people actually run out of new song ideas? Jovi has. Two stars only because I like Bon Jovi. Very disappointing release."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Album!","review":"It's a excellent album!The songs that I liked more had been Undivided, Everyday, Bounce, Hook me up, Love me back you life, The distance and All About Lving You. One of the best album of Bon Jovi!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi doing what they do best","review":"Bon Jovi stays true to their typical style on their latest album, Bounce. One noticable change is Richie Sambora's heavy riffs on such songs as Undivided, Everyday, and Hook Me Up, to name a few. You are reminded that it's definately a Bon Jovi album, though, when you listen to the uplifting lyrics that Jon has to offer. Bounce fits great into any Bon Jovi collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BON JOVI ALBUM SINCE NEW JERSEY","review":"WITH GREAT SONGS LIKE EVERIDAY , BOUNCE , THE DISTANCE , JOEY , ETC.THE AMBULM HAVE POWERFUL SOUNDS , THE SAMBORAS GUITAR SOUNDS BETTER THAN EVER , TICO ON DRUMS AND SOME BEAUTIFUL SOUNDS OF PIANO BY MISTER BRYAN MAKES BOUNCE A HUGE RECORD !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Jovi ~ Bounce","review":"I was unsure of how I would like this new cd based on other fans' reviews. In my opinion Bounce would be an asset to your Bon Jovi collection! It will appeal to Bon Jovis' new fans as well as the Bon Jovi faithful. It is not a \\"traditional \\" endevour by the band, but a new style and sound which has heavier guitar by Richie, more keyboards from Dave which I think sounds great. Jons' vocals are strong and Ticos' drums resonate power. There is a nice balance between the power songs and the ballads. The journey Bounce leads you on is inspiring ,and leaves you longing for the tour! Enjoy the ride!"},{"rating":"2","title":"May be the best Allingham","review":"For me this one and \\"Police at the Funeral\\" are the best Allinghams.Which one is best is a moot point. I believe the \\"Pig\\" has stillmore originality, pace and fine irony.It's a delightfully \\"lean\\" book,everything she put in it is important for the story (and for the fun).She manages to create a story and an ambience that are both surreal (the odd aproach) and plausible at the same time.This was also the Allingham where I found Lugg to be genuinelyamusing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Newcomers to the Campion Series...","review":"First published over 65 years ago, this entry in Allingham's long-running Campion series didn't do much to enthuse me to investigate other of Campion's adventures. It starts with the detective attending the funeral of an old schoolmate, who was rather widely despised. Several months later, Campion is called to the country to investigate a suspicious death, and the victim appears to be the same schoolmate. Wacky antics and murky mystery ensue. A kind of unsatisfying blend of P.G. Wodehouse and Agatha Christie which is unlikely to interest those who aren't already fans of the series. The one bright spot is Campion's valet, who is kind of a rough \\"anti-Jeeves\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew it","review":"I've seen all the shows when they first aired, I've seen so many reruns but still need the DVDs. It's not the best show but definitely one of the best of all times and I will buy me all 8 seasons one at a time and probably watch 'em over and over again.

Having previously studied music, I was also hoping for a unique perspective and a broader education in classical music, but found this book to be nothing more than a college level textbook. It is arranged nicely and has great appendix on creating a music library. But the author is often long winded, using musical terms that aren't clearly defined and over descriptive and opinionated explanations of composers and their works. This might be nice for someone who has a beginning interest in classical music, but not for someone who has a working knowledge of the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful High-Quality Pearl Strand","review":"I ordered this 16\\" freshwater pearl necklace and the matching 7\\" bracelet a week before one of my best friend's wedding.

It didn't feel like I was reading a book, like I was reading a letter from someone tellling me all about their life and what they've been up to. a really compelling story by a great poet and musician, Jim Carroll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbingly honest","review":"For a teenage diary, this is extremely well written. Jim Carroll was clearly a gifted writer, and his diary brings the New York City streets of the mid-60's to life. His vivid descriptions of growing up as a street wise kid on the mean streets of the city clearly paint a picture of the period.That said, this is was NOT a fun book to read. There is much about Carroll's life in this period that is not pretty. His growing dependency on drugs is readily apparent as the book progresses, as is his willingness to do almost anything to pay for his next fix. There are graphic descriptions of both the drug use and his sexual encounters, but even so there is a sense of honesty in the account that somehow seems to be redeeming. In the end, this is a powerful glimpse into a life on the streets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Misguided Teenager","review":"A good book, very true real life situations. Jim Carrol growing up in the mean streets of New York. The situations were very real, and show what many teenagers have to go through today, even if they don't grow up in a large city. Violence and crime are spreading rapidly, and no teen is safe from it. I can't really understand why every person gave it five stars, to me five stars is a book that you read five times before reading another. Overall, the book is a very realistic and entertaining and I would recommend it to any teenager that is headed down the wrong path, it will most likely set them straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't pollute your mind or give it any artistic credence","review":"Overcompensation for his fundamental assessment that he is unredeemed trash. Tedious, self absorbed, and boring in a way that only a life of getting a next fix or hustle can be...which means that the majority of Carroll's worldview is the stall of a public bathroom. The lame narrative contrasts with Trinity School days and the clean-cut world of athleticism and basket ball versus his rough trade street life is such an obvious transition anyone else would have fallen asleep before making it up as their effort to construct his life as a work of art. One suspects this poetry was originally written on toilet paper and should have been flushed. Unfortunately it was preserved; and the whole disgusting mess is served up here. Don't pollute your mind or give it any artistic credence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"The Basketball Diaries is sad because it's honest. It's gripping because it's real.

I found that the book was even better, as always. You can't find fictitious books this well written. This book showed me a side of reality that I had never known; and yet I could still relate to it. After picking up the book and not being able to put it down until I was finished, I am now looking for more Jim Carroll books to interest me as much as this one did"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stunning Realism","review":"The movie inspired me to read the book. Many people were reluctant to see the movie because they didn't think Leo DiCaprio would play a good part. He did a great job! For those who still won't see the movie, you have to at least read this incredible book. It's unforgettable...and that says a lot considering the hundreds of books I have read. This book has made me a big Jim Carroll fan. This book is based on his life. However, instead of getting stuffy background information and dates easily forgettable, you get a simple \\"this is how it was.\\" Since he is a poet, the book has a beautiful flow of words and vivid detail. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks!","review":"This is an interesting, disturbing, and ultimately uplifting read. I am sure while reading it you will alternatly laugh, and be in tears. It documents a great singer, Jim Carroll's life between the ages of 13 and 15. It is a hard read, not in the fact that it is two complicatedly written(the slang can be a prob, but a good Internet site on Jim will give you the meanings) but in that Jim speaks of horendous things with such calculated nonchalanty. But trust me, get THIS book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the translation!!!!","review":"Am I the only person who loves these books and thinks they're absolutely hilarious because of the Sidney Shapiro translation? I feel very shallow, because the stories and characters are certainly fascinating, but I get an enormous kick out of such lines as this:\\"Frigging monkeyshines! Who says I have any Right Honorable XImen in there!\\"\\"Don't hog him all to yourself! Let me have a lick of the juice too. Think I don't know?\\"\\"Little ape! What do you know?\\"\\"Stingy as cutting vegetables with a hoof-paring knife in a wooden spoon, aren't you?\\"And the fact that they keep saying things like, \\"I don't give a tooting fart!\\"I apologize for this not-very-intellectual assessment of the books, but they kept me laughing out loud and reading choice passages to people. I love them!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-climactic and poorly printed","review":"I must confess that I read this book hoping for another Romance of the Three Kingdoms. While Outlaws of the Marsh starts strongly, following a number of interesting characters as they attempt to escape from misfortune, I lost interest about half way through. The last 20 or so chapters (excluding the final chapter) were very boring and difficult to read and nothing exciting really happens. By the end of the 2000 odd pages it is easy to forget that the first half was so exciting and fast-paced.As for the translation itself, it is not too bad. Some translations make the characters out to be villains whereas Shapiro's translation takes a more neutral approach. The printing is on very thin, delicate paper with lots of typing errors and as such is a bit disappointing. There are also some paintings reproduced in the text but these are of very low quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Translation","review":"Actually I read this book in Chinese version for uncountable times, in general we, the Chinese, read it for fun without much rethinking on what is right and what is wrong. For me, I read it when my brain does not work so I would like something different to refresh my brain.This time, I read this novel in English version compared with Chinese version line by line. Actually I feel that the translator knows the Chinese language better than me, because many nuances, when I read in Chinese version I do not pay attention because of strange and unusual words, were translated. These translations even help me to better understand those Chinese words.It is a pity that many poems in Chinese version were not translated in English version, some of those poems in fact reflect what the authors considered the behaviors of protagonists and what the authors viewed on Chinese society. Certainly those poems are extremely difficult to translate."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you action, get this book! Don't hesistate","review":"I can see why this book is a classic, it keeps the reader in suspense and entertained. I really enjoy the colorful dialouges and the very discriptive scenes in the books. The characters are well made and I love how the are all connected to each other in various waya as the story is unfolded. I am still reading this book as I write this; it is one the best stories I heard in years; I can't seem it down sometimes. I am very grateful to come accross it. Please do yourself a favor and buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Shoe","review":"These shoes are great! They were a wee bit more then what I typically pay for shoes but the number of compliments I've gotten far out weigh the extra cost. They are so comfortable and they go with just about any outfit.

So a 4 or 5 star rating is on the level of Gone with the Wind, Casablanca, Titanic, and the likes...movies that are worthy of Academy Awards.Needless to say, Renegades doesn't meet that criteria.It's a hopelessly bad \\"buddy\\" movie with cheesy acting, a fairly lame story, with some action mixed in.The brilliant \\"roll your eyes\\" moment was when the Indian elder heals Sutherland from a gunshot wound.Don't expect anything and if you're into pretty bad cop movies, you might like it.

I almost gave up at page 105 when the hero checks into the hotel after running around Paris from 6am to late at night. He visits his comatose friend in hospital and fights off an assassin there, meets different people in various locations across the city, fighting off another set of bad guys and slips into a nightclub all the while evading tails by taking circuitous routes via the Metro.

The whole story took a new direction possibly aimed at getting women to read spy thrillers.I don't know. I don't care.

I found it to be quite difficult to keep from throwing it in the round file before I finished it. I did give it a two star rating because it did keep my interest albeit boring. I think Robert Ludlum's name should not be on any book not authored by him. Now that this great mystery writer is dead, publishers should not be allowed to use his name to sell books. If his name had not been on the cover of the book, I would not have purchased it. I assume that he had made outlines of the three Covert One novels before he died and the co-authors went from there. This particular one should have been in the Science Fiction section of the bookstore instead of the Mystery Section."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawner.","review":"Maybe OK for beach reading, but barely. If you should happen to forget where you stopped reading, no matter if you skipped a few pages -- maybe that's even better! Not like Robert Ludlums earlier works. Has internal inconsistencies, like the hero picking a door lock when a blast of gunfire from an AK47 inside shreds the door, but just \\"nicks\\" our hero. After he goes inside to dispatch the baddie (a woman), he leaves the apartment carefully shutting the door behind him. Huh? The plot of this book is one escape from baddies after another.

They are really good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Travesty","review":"It is unfortunate that Mr. Ludlum's name graces this novel.

As others have indicated; stick to the vintage Ludlum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Awful","review":"The only good thing about this book is that some of the dialogue is so bad that it makes you laugh out loud. The story, unfortunately, is a series of chases. Our heros get in binds and do heroic things to get out of them. Over and over. Characters with no depth or motivation. I have a habit of finishing any book I start and this was the ultimate challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action all along","review":"You'll never expect a Ludlum novel to be a literary masterpiece, and the Paris Option is no exception.

What I love about this book is the rhythm, it's so fast, the story is very entertaining, it's all about action and the characters are good. But on one thing I have to agree with the critics: the whole DNA computer story is non-sense, this supercomputer it's more fantasy than anything that could be real in the future.Now I'm going to continue the Covert-One series and off course the Ludlum's classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far cry from Ludlum's original novels","review":"The Covert-One series, written by a variety of authors, unfortunately does not live up to Ludlum's standards. Since Paris Option was my first of the series, it was bearable, but all other Covert-Ones are very similar to each other. If you've read any one book from this series, I would suggest you stay away from the rest.The suspense is decent, but the climax is very predictable and it all works out somehow in the end, without a well-thought out approach to the finale. Covert-Ones start with a variety of events occuring simultaneously, events that in the beginning don't really seem to have a bearing on the other.

Overall though it is a good read and I think it can help people in many situations in life (business, relationships, job, etc)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book on strategy","review":"The Art Of War is the best book of war strategy I have ever found. Each of the 13 Chapters describe one aspect of war strategy in a clear way. Even if this book as 2400 years, it is still even more relevant today as strategy it is applied to other sectors like business and sport (Sun Tzu For Success: How to Use the Art of War to Master Challenges and Accomplish the Important Goals in Your Life).This very is a clear translation without any commentary. While commentaries help to explain the views of Sun Tzu, I prefer this version because it is so clear and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly Overrated Due to Pop Culture Popularity","review":"Granted, most readers will find some wisdom in \\"The Art of War\\"; on the other hand, perhaps most of this \\"wisdom\\" is simply common sense dressed up in militaristic metaphors. I know that some of the popularity behind this book stems from the fact that plenty of its readers (usually male) are hip-hop figures, business types, and budding entrepreneurs. I'm sure the occasional gang leader took some leadership cues from Sun Tzu (was there really a Sun Tzu?) and this probably created an almost cult-like devotion to an \\"ok\\" book. I believe it's not quite one of the best leadership books ever, as some might suggest. Read it to relieve your curiosity, then delve into more modern tomes by folks such as Seth Godin or Guy Kawasaki if you're looking to start a business in today's world. In addition, you'll gain still more by reading biographies by one of today's business leaders."},{"rating":"2","title":"The art of success, by Sun Tzu","review":"Sun Tzu is a genius and this book is a timeless classic.

It really covers some of his principles from a distance, not really a comprehensive view or direct translation of his work. Please note that this book is very short and appears to be written as a synopsis. If you are looking for a quick read or intro into his principles, than this should be good enough for you.

Be prepared for the editor jumping in just about every other passage to add his own 2 cents, and possibly the most unnecessarily lengthy introduction to a book that has ever been done. The commentary isn't even useful, most of the comments are entirely benign and contribute nothing to the reading at all.The kindle version contains terrible line breaks, no chapter delineations, and clearly was a copy paste job from the original manuscript.Maybe the introduction could be useful to an academic studying this work?

Is it some sort of spiritual or mental awakening? No, not at all. Do I plan on leading my life on by the words of Sun Tzu? Of course not. However, I will say that many of the sayings/verses within this book are very inspiring to me; through the words of a man who lived centuries ago on another continent, I can take his broad view of life and see my own more clearly.A solid, inspirational read, but if you're a collector, go with the hard copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"comment on condition not the actual content","review":"i received it on time and in very good condition. it was a gift and he said he enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Art of War by Sun Tzu [Kindle Edition] , Price: $3.51","review":"I have just downloaded the kindle edition.

But if everyone shared common sense alike, all wars would come to stalemates.I can see in the future that this will be a book I will reference often. I couldn't help but think about modern day warfare being a protracted and expensive venture. Warfare has become a business. A business that will surely wear upon citizens and infantrymen.

It is cheap for a reason: This little book is all of 96 pages long, including the introduction.The best edition of Sun Tzu is the Special Edition that contains two English versions; one simple version, like this one without commentary or notes and another version that the complete, fully documented Giles's Edition and, in addition, it has the text in Chinese Characters.If you are going to spend the time and effort to read and understand Sun Tzu, you may as well spend a few dollars more and have a book that is worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Art of War","review":"A good version of Sunt Tzu's masterpiece.

Keep in mind that Chinese language must be taken in its entire context, not seperated into individual characters and then translated word for word. What the translator has done in this case is equivalent to, for example, when English speakers say \\"Today, it rained cats and dogs\\", the translator automatically translated into \\"Today, it rained cats (as in the sense of house pet) and dogs (as in the sense of house pet)\\" instead of translating into \\"Today, it rained heavily\\".

If you love history, and especially the Roosevelt family history, this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite an interesting book.","review":"This book discusses in detail the lives of a dozen Roosevelt women - Teddy's sisters, Eleanor, Teddy's mother, and Franklin's mother (and others). Very well written and interesting.

Most of it has to do with the way it was filmed: it is as though when shooting from the \\"nude\\" side of the screen, the camera crew was instructed to film in a completely different - and unsexy - way compared to the way they film the \\"shadow\\" screen. There are 3 models. The first one, when filmed from the \\"other side,\\" is filmed from the chest up 90 percent of the time. The second one spends most of the time on the floor, stripper-style, rather than actually dancing. She also has lots of flab on her belly and a terrible boob job. The third model never actually gets nude - she keeps her thong on. Bottom line is - NOT sexy at all.

Once the investigation starts, Bobby finds ties to a New Orleans mob family and genetically altered coffee. And to top it all off, the Cashio mob are no strangers -- Bobby's got something personal against them and the perfect opportunity for justice.Surrounding this action-packed story is Bobby's girlfriend, Magda (for the romantic in you), and a lively New Orleans backdrop that will have you scrambling for your travel agent.

In this case, it was written by a doctor whom, I gather, has not even finished his residency. This book seems like just another promotional piece for Dr. Smith (notice that the cover is just his picture).Let's face it, we all know what to do to be healthy. Unfortunately, not enough of us do it... and no book will get us to do it, either, unless it's really based on good science and clinical judgement, a la Dr. Dean Ornish or Dr. Andrew Weil.

But the problem is the diet is very, very, VERY strict and harsh. Against my better judgement, I purchased this book as a Christmas present for my 19-year old daughter who would not stop asking for it. She is an athlete and a college honors student, and only wants to lose 20 lbs. But I truly see no way that she would be able to ever stick to the strict letter of this diet. So I feel like I am setting her up to fail and the very first diet experience of her life will be failure. Not a good thing. I do not recommend this book for the first-time dieter, but I'm sure it would be fine for a more serious dieter.

The sound was excellent for such a small unit. The problem is that the lone wire (connector) developed a loose wire or some other circuit malfunction so that now the speakers are useless.

In hindsight we know, for example, that Arnold Schwarzenegger is very strong and has heart trouble.

Some of the other reviews on here mention God and give off the idea that this is a Christian film but they never once mention God, so when they say \\"Just Believe\\" you're left to wonder are they referring to believing in God, one's self, or something else entirely. I guess it's just me but this movie leaves a lot to be desired. I loved the story line behind the movie but it leaves you with a lot of unanswered questions. The story line needs a lot more development. This really could have been a much better film with more character development. You kinda feel like it starts in the middle and abruptly ends.

It was, however, too late to return for another, as it was meant to be an xmas gift I was shipping to my father-in-law in Ireland, & was already well past xmas. It was nothing more than an old, used, yellowing/partly torn library book, complete w/library card envelope intact, & in scrappy condition, at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this book during Lent for preaching and teaching","review":"Pastors, Christian Educators, Church Leaders, In a world where God is sugar-coated by the church, where preaching as therapy reigns, where God is our personal God at OUR beck and call, read this book. It will be an excellent resource during the season of Lent for preaching and teaching. Lament is not a topic often discussed in the Church. Lament is a true and necessary element in faith. To pretend otherwise is short-sighted, indeed.

By reading this book, a good comparison can be made with other famous revolutions in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasant, sentimental journey","review":"\\"On the road\\" in Cuba. A nice sentimental journey with lots of traveler's problems to keep it interesting and underscore the harness of traveling in a rather undeveloped country. A pleasant peek into some Cuban lives and that touched on the emotional conflicts in someone (Cuban raised in Miami) who had been detached from his roots.I wish we had seen more variety of the landscape, but still it was good. I also wish that the print had been better and the subtitles more clear, but that was acceptable.I think it stayed away from politics, contrary to some comments here. Cuba was presented as very poor, but there was no blaming either of the US or of the Castro government. It stayed focused on the characters and the atmosphere of the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Duke","review":"Duke Jordan was best known for being part of Charlie Parker's late 40s quintet. But as a pianist and band leader in his own right, this dude was highly underrated. I saw a list of the 100 greatest jazz pianists and DJ wasn't even on it. That's shameful.Sure, he may not have been an innovator like Thelonious Monk - but then who was? These are all DJ's own compositions so he's not only underrated as a performer, but as a composer as well. Although none of these songs have become standards, they are all excellent. This disc could hold its own against many of Oscar Peterson's better recordings - high praise indeed. This is an essential disc for even casual fans of hard bop. Also, having been given the Rudy Van Gelder sessions remastering treatment, the sonics are demonstration worthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old friends","review":"My two kids are now 22 and 17. They played for hours with this family when they were small. The figures were made well and, except for paint wear, they've stayed intact to this day. They were kept as a favorite toy after the kids got too old for them but were lost during a recent move so I replaced them with this identical set a couple of months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not As Good As Marketed","review":"I love the Halo franchise, however both Halo 2 and Halo 3 were a let down in My opinion. As far as the Legendary package goes, there wasn't enough included with it for the price that was being asked for it. The helmet could have been bigger. Halo 3, from what I've read from all of the books about the games, is actually the other half of Halo 2, so Bungie and Microsoft sold us out for game content and story plot.Where's the rest of the story? I personally preferred Halo : Combat Evolved over these 2nd and 3rd games. I plan on making my own Master Chief helmet with the one from the Legendary package utilizing resin and clay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best game ever !","review":"This game was very fun to play. The packaging is a poster. You can't wear the helmet, but it looks realistic. The first Essentials disk has a mini game called Warthog Launch. The rest is bonus features, themes and gamer pics. The second Essentials disk comes with Halo and Halo 2 cut scenes. You also get a bestiarum, This Spartan Life and Red Vs Blue episodes. This is for MAJOR fans only due to the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool Collectors Set","review":"I got this for my kid and he loves it. I was very surprised to see all the goodies that came with it. The helmet is not adult sized which is why I didnt get one for my self but it is a good sized helmet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 3 Legendary Edition, Worth The Extra $$$","review":"There have been enough reviews of Halo 3 the game, so this is just about the Legendary Edition. Quite honestly, if you are not obsessed with Halo, Think plastic helmets are cool, or have more money than you need; then you don't want to buy this. It's twice as much as the game by itself and you'll probably end up putting the helmet in a box and forgetting about it anyway. NO you can't wear the Helmet! (Unless you have a very small rectangular head). If you're looking for another piece of gameroom art, then it might be worth it, but most people will be better off just buying the game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Halo 3","review":"I purchased this for 59 dollars which is a great price since it originally sold for 129.

Halo 3 legendary edition rocks and everyone that loves halo should buy it and its a good price"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"Halo 3 manages to stay original despite being the third of a trilogy. The first Halo game on the Xbox 360, it has incredible graphics and sound, exceeding expectations.Given that the multiplayer is the most important feature to many users, I can assure you that it has seen improvements as well; the Forge (build a map) and Theater (replay matches) modes are incredible additions to the series. A must-own for 360 owners.The special features included in the Legendary Edition are fun, although it's up to you as to whether they're worth the extra money"},{"rating":"2","title":"too bad you can't wear the helmet","review":"why should you buy this (if it's not already sold out)? well, you should to get the helmet. not because of the game or the bonus disks that give you extra icons you can put on your xbox live account, or the fold out poster from the box that houses the set, or the countless hours and sleepless nights replaying the game, or the little comic book insert the extra dvd holds. no. it's for the helmet. that's it. if you don't agree, then go frag yourself with the common people's edition of halo 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freakin Sweet!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This game is awesome and so is the Legendary Edition. The helmet is cool cuz u can use it as a hold for ur game."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO HELMET","review":"I ordered what I thought included the halo helmet, I did not need the game I was sent. Not paying close attention this only included the video game. Too pissed off to send the game back I will gamestop it tomorrow.

Do not buy if you think the mask is included."},{"rating":"2","title":"very cool","review":"halo 3 is an awesome ending to an awesome story arc. The game was great from beginning to end.

The helmet is sweet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must buy for the XBox 360","review":"Extremely addicting and very fun.It is seriously worth buying an Xbox 360 just to play this game.The online part of the game is amazing.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettin some head from Halo","review":"I got lucky and happened to run across the Legendary edition of Halo 3 on sale for 60 bucks. I like Halo 3 a lot, but I wouldn't call myself a fanboy or nothing. I don't think I would've bought the legendary edition for regular price for what is included with it. I've seen the Spartan helmet on ebay for around 40 bucks. The extra content is okay, but I don't think it's worth that much. It would've been nice to include something else like a plasma grenade or action figure with it. All in all It's still an awesome game, and hopefully next time Bungie does something else with the franchise they include a lil something extra with the \\"legendary edition\\" of whatever it is they're making."},{"rating":"2","title":"If your a Halo Fan the helmet is worth it!","review":"I am not going to review the game because you can get that anywhere....IF you are a Halo Fan or a collector the Legendary addition is great for one reason.

Cut some fluff and receive 5 stars","review":"For those who have read \\"Novell's CNA Study Guide for NetWare 5\\", you will be familiar with David Clarke's style. All the necessary material is covered, but extra fluff is inevitable. As with the CNA book, the author uses a fantacy corporation named ACME to illustate his points. The company is made up of heros from earth's past (King Aurther, Abraham Lincoln, etc...) that are the key players for each division/department. Using an example for illustrative purposes makes since, but I think Mr. Clarke goes too far. My advice to Mr. Clarke is keep writing good study guides, but trim out some of the non-sence.On the whole the book is very good and I recommend it. You may end up doing more reading than you had planned, but you will learn the material. If you are preparing for CNE exams, experience definitely helps. Do the labs and practice exams."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for those NOT wanting to become a CNA","review":"I must say that this is easily one of the worst books I have ever read. It contains jokes, a very stupid story about setting up a Novell Network to save the world, and miles of other garbage that you must shovel out of the way in order to find any facts. The sample test at the end was not only poorly made and unrepresentative of Novell's test, but it also contains many errors, giving you incorrect answers to some questions. Please, take my advice and buy another CNA preparation book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of the Worst","review":"If you think this book will prepare you for the Service and Support 5 exam, think again. I took the exam and found out that the book was full of holes. Even worse, it came with software, which turned out to be defective and when I complained, I was not compensated. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm so frustrated from this book!","review":"I'm ready to pull my hair out! This book probably has most of the info you'll need, but, as other reviewers have commented, it is buried under a load of garbage. Worse than that, when the author does try to provide information directly, he is often unclear and repetitive. His organization of the subtopics is poor, too. Unfortunately, there are very few third party study guides out there for NetWare 5. Books like this can actually make you learn to not like NetWare itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another smarmy offering from DJC the Fourth","review":"I am amazed that people actually rate this guy's text. If only I could give less than one star ! If you're studying for an exam, you want FACTS, not quizzes, crosswords and 'jokes'. If you could take out the 'fluff' this book would be 50% smaller and 100% less irritating. And one final point - proof-reading should be a must when you're supplying study guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I bought three other books at the same time as this one, and this one was one of the worse ones. I did not feel it gave an adequate amount of information on the methods compared to the other books I bought. I don't even think this was a good book as a supplemental to the more in-depth ones. It went to Value Village immediately.The other books I bought were:Taking Charge of Your Fertility (Weschler) - definately the best resource for this; very in-depth and lots of information; definately my go to book;The New No-Pill No-Risk Birth Control - not as good as Taking Charge of Your Fertility, but had good supplemental information and also would be fine as a stand-alone book;Honoring Our Cycles: A Natural Family Planning Workbook - Waste of money! Worst of the four I bought. It seemed as if it was written for a sixth grader who had never learned anything about the reproductive system. Really annoyed me and I didn't even make it through the first couple of pages before tossing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNDERSTAND YOUR FERTILITY CYCLE","review":"This easy-to-read book tells women, step-by-step, how to understand and chart our body's signals to figure out when we can and cannot get pregnant. This is a non-religious approach to natural family planning, and includes instructions for using the method with a condom or diaphragm.Women can also use this book to figure out the best time to conceive. Other side benefits include: a better understanding of mood swings and other physical and emotional changes that accompany our menstrual cycle; and heightened awareness of abnormalities in our cycle.The simple writing style and plethora of pictures and diagrams make this a fun, interesting, and very useful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and practical handbook","review":"This book is so well written and explains very clearly through detailed description and diagrams everything you need to know about mucous. Sounds odd, but if she didn't have such good diagrams I don't know if I would have quite understood what she meant. For the first time in my 35+ years I am understanding my body better than ever and YES, I can actually tell when I'm ovulating now, simply through tracking changes in the mucous as the author recommends. I definitely recommend this book to women who both want or do NOT want to conceive.June 2004 UPDATE: I'm pregnant now for the 2nd time - unfortunately I miscarried in February. I conceived both times in months that I was careful to follow the fertility signals especially the physical signs of ovulation (i.e \\"strings\\" - read the book, you'll know what I mean!) I'm a believer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to understand and use--for avoiding & achieving!","review":"I had already gone through the very tedious process of studying NFP from the huge study manual in order to learn about my fertility signals. I ended up adapting the information I had gathered from the huge behemoth NFP manual and several other NFP resources and coming up with what worked best for me. It turns out I was using the Fetility Awareness Method (which this book teaches) without even knowing it. If only I had found this simple little volume first!! :) It is a great way to review and has simple drawings to help certain things stick in your mind. My husband and I used FAM for 9 months to avoid pregnancy, and then used it to achieve pregnancy in only 2 cycles. We are now 7 months pregnant. I would highly recommend this volume to anyone who cannot afford to take an NFP course outside the home and doesn't have the wherewithall the read the several hundred page NFP study manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sad.","review":"I ordered this micrometer especially because of the .0001 (ten-thousanth) range. When I opened the Amazon box, the Brown-Sharpe box label on the outside said it was a .0001 micrometer. When I opened the wooden box, the first thing I did was start reading the instructions, which said the micrometer would measure to .001! What, that can't be right? I looked at the body of the micrometer and sure enough, no ten-thousanth vernier scale on it.I can't blame Amazon for all of this because the outside of the Brown-Sharpe box indicates the micrometer's range as .0001. It's a pretty nice mic otherwise - if you want to live with the .001 graduation. But that's not what I ordered or paid for so the micrometer is right back in the box to be returned tomorrow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love That noodle","review":"These noodles are great. I have been serving whole wheat pasta, then after reading about soba noodles, decided to try them. I chose this brand based on the price and reviews. The first time I served them with grilled zucchini and a marinara sauce. After the first bite, my husband asked what kind of pasta I was using. When I told him, he asked me to never use anything else. I had to agreed, they were the best...even better than regular pasta, as they seem to absorb the flavors of the dish. Guess we are hooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"good general purpose noodle, but way too expensive here","review":"I like these noodles. They cook quickly. The buckwheat gives them a little more flavor than common spaghetti noodles. For a simple one-dish meal, serve some stir-fried meat and vegetables on top of a bed of soba noodles.Just be careful of the price. Similar quality soba noodles cost less than $2 per pound at local grocery stores. Amazon's price is sometimes better, but usually not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honesty is the best policy","review":"Indeed, it is, and this book has the best policy I've seen in a long time. In a literary world full of books where, no matter the genre, the characters act in extremely predictable ways, Young's book offers uncomprimising and refreshing honesty in his book about a fraudulent naval chaplain. If you want a book that isn't afraid to hold a mirror up to the life around us, this is your pick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise, not so great writing","review":"The premise of this book is interesting and the first few pages were both well written, and very promising. Unfortunately, the writing deteriorated through the rest of the book. There were too many run-on sentences and obvious strains of effort in putting together the dialog. A book is generally not worth reading when one starts to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed for the author. I'm not objecting to the premise or language of the book but to the quality of the writing which simply wasn't very good.Oddly enough I first encountered this book when its creator sent me an unsolicited email message urging me to read it. Receiving spam is obnoxious enough in itself, but receiving heaps of self-praise and frantic requests to buy a marginally written work is just sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Story on My Summer Reading List","review":"I picked up \\"One of the Guys\\" at the bookstore last Sunday. I read the first chapter while waiting for coffee and I couldn't put it down. What a triumph for Robert Young. I hope we will all have more of his work on the shelves soon.

This is by far the funniest book I ever read, and I have read a lot of books."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Guys","review":"I had such high expectations of this book, but the first chapter turned me off. The author graphicly describes homesexual activity between a Catholic Priest and a Protestant Minister if that is not enough to turn you off; then the very grapic description of the main character cleaning up the porno booths and the precise description of everything he cleans up will! I just don't see why the author choose to describe these things in the detail he did. It is very strange, and I am very sorry I wasted my money on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kirkus Reviewer Missed The Boast By \\"Miles\\"","review":"I am honored to have in my possession an advance copy of ONE OF THE GUYS and am stunned by what I read yesterday in the so-called review from Kirkus Reviews, dated March 19, 1999. I'm wondering whether the reviewer and I read the same novel. Because his or her story synopsis--though replete with factual errors--seems to have some of the elements of the novel that I read, I must conclude that we did have the same book in our respective hands, but that we experienced it very differently. In the first place, the style of Young's tale is that of a satire. They say the purpose of the satirist is to expose human error to withering ridicule, often through the use of hyperbole and irony. Either the reviewer does not get satire or did not read this book. I suspect it is both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good, somewhat profane look at the Navy","review":"Robert Clark Young has written a throughly enjoyable book. Parts hilarious, parts sublime, often profane (of course one would expect profanity from sailors.....) in language and treatment of serious issues. While not monumemtal in scope, it never the less deals with the issues it touches upon with grace and style. While the premise sometimes stretches credibility, it does not do so to great extent. Never having been in the Navy, I probably did not enjoy it as much as one who has gone through the experience would. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difficult to put down and wishing there were more to read!","review":"This is an excellent first novel by Robert Clark Young. It's hysterical, serious, and keeps you literally on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for Miles Derry all through the book, wondering how he'd handle his different dilemas aboard the USS Warren Harding...and truly hoping he'd pull this off without hitch. Chaplin? Truly so, but more like Charlie Chaplin, Miles was an excellent character and a better man than I, Gunga Din.

One of them got hung up on the \\"1\\" in the units column (column on the right). The other would not count up unless you pushed the button at a precise angle.

I was but two years old, headed across America, from Georgia to Alaska, towards Eagle, the tiny community that McPhee discusses with a keen eye in the third section of his book. I spent my childhood in that community and it would not be until I was fully grown that I would actually read his book. Just a couple of years ago, when I was attending college in Georgia, I became homesick for Alaska and decided to read the book that had been so impressive to my parents. I was amazed by McPhee's way of seeing the truth in something foreign to him -- how he described the people of Eagle. I highly recommend this book to all those who wish to venture into the land of Alaska, whether in their actual travels or in their imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books from one of America's best writers","review":"John McPhee, it's often noted, can write about anythying and make it interesting, so when he tackles a subject as broad and fascinating as Alaska you know you're in for a treat.The book is divided into three parts; it begins in modern Urban Alaska, with the story of its history and contemporary society. From McPhee takes you to the remote villages and towns, a place still populated by Native peoples and rugged outdoorsmen (and women). The last chapter concerns Alaska's last frontier- the remote North Slope, and the men who drill for oil there.Like all McPhee books, the author seems to fade into the background and let the people and the land tell the story for him. Sometimes the reader feels as if or she, and not McPhee, is standing there on an oil rig.Alaska is a rich topic, and McPhee is a wonderful writer. A great combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tricky, imaginative: McPhee at his best.","review":"If you already love McPhee's work or are interested in trying him, Coming into the Country will fulfill any expectations. The completed book leaves one with a profound sense of having been there, as well as having recieved a considerable lecture on back-country living. McPhee's ability to wrap lessons, stories, personalities, cultures, habitats and countrysides into an intriguing package makes this book a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent music!!!!","review":"This is an excellent selection of Native American Flute music.

Can't beat the price and the variety is perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lame-o","review":"It's like a dirty old trust-fund man's film, licking his lazy, narcissistic chops over the coltish, not-spectacularly talented Liv. Reasonably pretty in a banal way, but there's an awful lot of near-inadvertently campy, jaded-bohemian carrying on (which, admittedly, has its appeal). Rachel Weisz makes an appealing debut, though.

Lucy's losing her virginity is the obstensible focus of the plot, but the movie is really about the beauty of loss - loss of a parent, an old friend, a schoolgirl fantasy of the perfect \\"first time.\\" The scenery is stunning, the soundtrack great, lots of humor and quirkiness, not to mention Liv Tyler's face. Watch this movie a few times - it gets better each time around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sensuous Film Not To Be Missed!","review":"Absolutely incredible! Though I am a sucker for a lot of soul-searching types of chick-flicks, never before had I been so enraptured by a movie that has been dubbed a chick-flick. Liv Tyler's acting was commendable, and the rest of the cast lived up to and beyond the challenge of overcoming her beauty. The cinematography was breath-taking and the storyline grabbed me from the beginning. Few movies are about a young girl's longing for love AND sex, and I was pleasantly surprised that Stealing Beauty did a remarkable job of portraying boh."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Quick! Come and wake me up!\\"","review":"It's about this girl who pricks her finger on a spinning wheel, falls asleep and wakes up with incurable kleptomania. (What, they couldn't get Winona Ryder to star?)Okay, I lied. The movie's not really about that. I only wish it were about that, because then it might be fun trash instead of plain, boring trash. Although _Stealing Beauty_ pretends to offer profound truths about sexual liberation, it's really just interested in scoping out the chicks and the scenery. Still, the photography is nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stealing my money","review":"Slow boring plot, other than 2 brief nude scenes, this movie is about as slow as it gets. Not really a story line to this and the actors who are top notch are wasted.

In fact, this was probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. I was bored half-way through the movie since Lucy did nothing else but bounce from one man to the next while one of them was half-disgusted with her behavior, but also attracted to her. Of course, they end up having sex in the end.Story line was incredibly predictable.If you are looking forward to being bored, or if you just likepretty pictures I recommend this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art","review":"The story is good, not great, but good...if it had been more on the level of Babette's Feast, this would have been a masterpiece, BUT..Visually, this film is stunning. The scenery and filming of it is unbelievable! I felt like I was looking through the eyes of every impresionist painter of the past as I soaked in the composed shots. Beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mystery.","review":"I normally like very much Bertolucci films. So I saw this film with great expectations. Sure, Liv Tyler is pretty and Jeremy Irons is attractive even if he was dying (in the story, of course). Some of us would like to see more than Tyler, however. I guess that I did not understand what was so particular about the theme or the synopsis. Even the gorgeous Tuscany looked a bit artificial in this artists' village. So were the personalities in the villege. What was this all about? was all I could say after seeing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bertolucci's Magic","review":"I would have never guessed this was Bernardo Bertolucci film (Last Emperor). Simple story with some great acting (Irons, Cusack, Moffet and Rachel Weisz) and some of most gorgeous cinematography ever filmed! With a superb soundtrack featuring great songs such as 2 Wicky, Glory Box, Superstition, Alice and I Need Love sung by Sam Phillips! Lot's of lush and mood setting atmosphere in this coming of age picture featuring young Liv Tyler! Pure cinema! Pure magic! Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer in Toscana with a delighted stolen beauty","review":"The presence of Lyv Tyler (1977-) makes us to walk in the road of erotism and takes us back to our first love."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"Loved this one. It's clever, and enjoyable. I understand some of the criticisms, but it's worth the rental fee. I think its one of my faves! The musical score is fantastic too. It was refreshing to see Italy portrayed this way, there was certainly an unapolagetic sense of authenicity. Liv is perfectly cast, like her or not, she seems to have a solid grasp of Lucy's mindset. Joe Finnes is fantastic as Chris, and I can't rant enough about how brilliantly cast this film is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something missing.... yet a fine movie to watch","review":"\\"Stealing Beauty\\" could be considered a breakthrough for both Liv Tyler and Rachel Weisz. Not only it helped Tyler shake off her failure in previous films (\\"Heavy\\" and \\"Silent Fall\\"), it gave her and Weisz a good leverage to box office hits thereafter (like \\"The Mummy\\" and \\"Lord of the Rings\\"). So Bernardo Bertolucci deserved all the credit here. In fact, the cast and cinematography were quite enjoyable. However, when it came to Bertolucci's portrayal of life through the eyes of artists (and people connected with them in one way or another), I couldn't help thinking of Federico Fellini. I believe Bertolucci is almost as good as Fellini, just one small step short. After watching \\"Stealing Beauty\\", I logged on to search for \\"La Dolce Vita\\" and pre-ordered the DVD right away. If you want to figure out what's missing in Bertolucci's artwork, I strongly recommend you to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Subtitles = Disappointing DVD","review":"Wonderful film - which is the reason I purchased it on DVD. However, there is a major flaw in the DVD... at least as far as the English speaking audience is concerned. A significant amount of the dialogue is in Italian. The English subtitles only appear when the dialogue is in - you guessed it - English!Not a lot of help.And for the Spanish speaking audience, the Italian dialogue is subtitled, but none of the English...Is this a design flaw or a defect in my DVD ? I don't know for sure but not being able to understand the language makes it difficult to enjoy the film.This is one of my favorite movies - the film itself deserves a great review, but the same cannot be said for this particular DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"One of the best movies of all time! Bertolucci captures it all: everything is well-rounded, every intimate moment realistically captured, the scenes, the emotion, the beauty and the avant guarde. This is avant-Guarde cinema at its best, it doesn't isolate the viewer, but wholeheartedly brings them into a brave new beautiful world. Lucy is leisurely looking for her father, life and love in an isolated arts commune in Italy. You will forget where you are and how you think you should be living after seeing such free and open beauty of people and interchanging lives. Gorgeous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"intolerable movie about a girl looking to loose her virginity in Italy","review":"OMG this movie was so bad.

Sure, Tuscany is beautiful (which is also why Frances Mayes' books are hot sellers these days!!), and Jeremy Irons is a veteran actor of high caliber. The 70s music didn't hurt. Bertolucci's name naturally \\"sells\\", but when I saw this movie, I was like, WHAT IS THIS???????"},{"rating":"2","title":"The myth is not that clear","review":"The legend of Billy the Kid has always been fascinating in the cinema and western folklore. We do not actually know perfectly well what happened. The official version is that he was killed by an officer of law. But other more romantic versions exist. This film takes the stand of the legend : Billy the Kid survived and lived a long and old life with his enamour. The film is very well thought to permit this outcome. That is its main interest. The acting though is kind of average. The pleasure is in the logic of the argument, though the Indians in the film seem to be rather naive and simpleminded.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"},{"rating":"1","title":"Homina Homina.","review":"Yowza! That Jane Russell philly almost makes this slow piece of horse puckey worth sitting through. Almost.(You see, she's kinda hot.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Janie Babe!","review":"The only reason this film gets two stars is because of Jane Russell. Howard Hughes was no John Ford. But surprisingly, he wasn't bad as a director. He wasn't good, but he wasn't bad. The only reason to watch this film is for Jane Russell's debut. The script is inane, and the acting by the leads will make you cringe. But bountiful Jane wears low cut tops, and when she bends over -- holy mackeral. And there is more fun to the film in the close-ups Hughes takes of Jane emoting impending sex. Hughes intention was for Jane to be erotic, but the expressions on her face are not of this world. There is no man that has ever seen these facial contortions on a woman. Trust me. Buy a used copy, only for these scenes. It is worth the laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memorable western","review":"Among the infinite versions of the legend of Billy the Kid, this one is by far the most extraordinary. And I say it for two reasons. The first one is that the film combines three essential elements always present in a good script: love, friendship and treason. Everything's fine between Doc Holliday and Pat Garrett, until Billy the Kid comes up. He steals Doc's horse and, despite of this, Doc becomes his friend and protector, which makes Pat swear to God we will catch both of them. Between the gunmen is the lovely Rio (Jane Russell, in an unforgettable performance), a character too sexy and too provocative for a mid-forties western. Her presence is a guarantee of a bizarre and unexpected love triangle. The second reason is, since this story is a legend, everything is possible, even changing the obvious ending. Maybe you'll get disappointed with the conclusion but certainly it will make you reflect upon the oldest dilemma of mankind: the good and the evil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Downright Good","review":"I'm going to disagree with the \\"cheese\\" claimers about this movie. I thought it was good. The acting wont win an worldwide award but it's not bad, and there are some funny parts. A light hearted, interesting, fun to watch western."},{"rating":"2","title":"good western","review":"Considering the 1941 time frame, I thought this was a better than average Western. At no time did historical fact get in the way of the story. The music was typical, the guns, everything was strictly Hollywood, but the acting was pretty good. The main thing is that it is a fun old time cowboy movie and a bargain at the $3.88 price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westerns are one of my favorites","review":"I had never seen this movie prior to ordering it but I am very pleased to add it to my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Atomic Clock for the bucks","review":"Would have posted 5-stars, BUT the instructions sucked.

Casey is a no-nonsense, take-no-prisoners PI in North Carolina. Her boss can't stop eating Little Debbie cakes, and her boyfriend can't stop Casey from doing what she wants to do. In this book, a string of rapes on a college campus results in Casey having to go undercover as a college student. Meanwhile, her whole group of crazy friends moves into a victim's house and sets up an adult frat-house. At times, Casey is the sanest of the lot. Katy Munger has the wit of a Janet Evanovich or a Harlan Coben -- with the hard-boiledness of a Robert Crais or an SJ Rozan. But Casey Jones is her own woman, and she gets better and better with every book (as does Katy Munger). Pretty amazing, for an author who was excellent to start with!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the Ending","review":"This is the first book by this author that I've read.

What is the problem with this book - it does not say anything! There is no point to it. Sure, it is entertaining sometimes, but there is no goal to this book. What was the author trying to achieve? He gives ramblings about why he hates certain people - much like the new book by Bernie Goldberg (which is pure trash) - but does not really say how to fix the problems he says these mostly celebrities create.We need to stop with all these right wing authors writing books with no point other than to slam the opposite party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surrounded by himself","review":"As I write this, Mr. Gallagher is in Texas, playing dress-up with military costumes and launching verbal assaults against the grieving mother of a fallen soldier -- despite the fact that neither he nor his four military-eligible children have ever served.If this is your idea of patriotism, you're welcome to it, but make no mistake: as loony as the left can be, chickenhawk extremists like Mike Gallagher are not a rational alternative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as bad as the radio program","review":"More mindless drivel from one of the weaker bulbs on the right.

It is well written and informative for what it is and if you suscribe to Gallagher's way of thinking you will probably give it 5 stars.I couldn't quite give it the 5 stars because though I enjoyed the writing, I do not subscribe to Mr. Gallagher's way of thinking which is everyone who isn't conservative must be an idiot. People that he cites as idiots do not represent the general population any more than Al Sharpton speaks for all African Americans. I know very few people in real life that subscribe to the way of thinking that the conservative talk show hosts attribute to the \\"liberals\\" of this country or anyone who thinks that going into Iraq was a huge mistake.That being said, if you put aside any criticism of Gallagher's bias, you can really enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gallagher Chronicles - Discover the REAL Mike Gallagher","review":"On his daily talk show, Mike Gallagher says that he \\"has no secrets.\\" Yet the BIGGEST secret of all - the one he wants nobody to find out about - wasn't even mentioned in Surrounded by Idiots.

But this morning I nearly flung it into the trash because it is so horrible. The plot is basically non-existent (the entire novel turns on the fact that there's going to be a party and all of the women are really excited about buying themselves new dresses)and the writing is abysmal. It's basically nauseatingly romantic pap. It's not even amusing in the way that Harlequin romances or real bodice-rippers are. It's just dull. Most people would probably be able to intuit all this just from the cover design, but I thought I'd issue out a warning for those who sometimes like to \\"slum it\\" with a brainless novel in the W.C. - this book does not even measure up to W.C. level - unless you've run out of T.P."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating","review":"I rarely rate books with 5 stars because I only want to award the BEST books with the honor, and this book truly deserves it.

Of course there is the carry over of some characters, but it is more of a sideways step than a straight out continuation.

I thought the book was boring. Every little detail repeated over and over again... \\"She opened the door. She walked through the door. She closed the door\\". I get it - let's move on. I think this book could have been condensed by at least 100 pages. The book had the potential to be moving, but wasn't.

Each track has it's own uplifting message whether it be the song about love 'Out of the Blue' or the song about courage and strength 'Be Strong', you really know her heart is in it. And it's a refreshing change from the usual manufactured pop which dribbles from the mouths of Britney and Christina.Some of my favorite tracks are 'Mistaken Identity', 'Be Strong', 'Electrical Storm' and 'Last night on Earth'. If you loved her first album you will love this and if you need something more in your life than 'Oops I did it again' give this a listen. She's the pride of Australia because she's a down-to-earth, genuine beauty but also because she has an amazing talent. I hope you all can love her as much as we do."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lovely Sheila From Down Under!","review":"Very nicely packaged 2 disc set with lots of photos of the lovely Aussie Delta Goodrem both on the CD case and the 16 page enclosed booklet. Booklet also contains the lyrics to all 14 tracks.You always have to wonder about daytime television stars when they decide they're also a singer. Well, this one is. All in all an enjoyable array of safe songs that don't challenge her vocal range so it's a little difficult to tell how good she really is.

All songs are integrated into a 60+ minutes suite, with dark, mythological themes dominating (both musically and lyrically). Even though this band had some personel changes, it doesn't show in the quality of their music which is, as usual, of very high standards. Definitely their best album so far!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure astonishment,","review":"Alright listen up! Progressive Metal and/or recent metal period is defined here with the gods of melody joined with some of the most catchy licks ever. Rusell Allen's compilation of vocal tracks on V are like nothing else out there. James Labrie has nothing on Rusell's range or harmony. Romeo is a genuine god to the guitar world, Pinnella is my hero (I play keyboards myself and he turns barouqe into thrilling Egyptian like sequences). Rullo's double kick matches so flawless, there is no way it could have been layed down any cleaner. And every bass lick is so complex with a twist of its own style.I strongly recommend this CD to anyone who has heard SX or even if you havn't. BUY THIS ALBUM and I swear to you that your perception on metal and music in general will be changed for a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prog Metal","review":"This album is the best release of this band to date. If you think these guys sound good, go and see them play. I saw them open for Blind Guardian in NYC. One word describes Sympony X, Phenominal. The keyboards along take breath away, and combine that with Micheal Romeo's guitarmanship and a hard-hitting vocalist and you have one of the best live bands. These guys slay. Any true metalhead or music fan should pick up their albums. Fans of Dream Theater will be hungry for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bach on steroids!","review":"What do you get if you combine Kansas, Trans Siberian Orchestra, Under the Sun, Queen, and Bach?

A musical joy every step of the way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOORING!","review":"All right people,I read the reviews, and thought I should get this album. This is a very boring, flat, heartless album, no feeling, no soul, nothing. After a few songs, I could not bear it. I gave this a few more chances, yup, I listened to it at least 5 times thinking perhaps I was distracted. Writing complex riffs and doing stops here and there and adding backvocals is not and should not be a given recipe for prog metal. I have not heard anything not boring in this album except the 1st song, which is unfortunately too short and led me to buy the album. (so, listening to the samples on amazon may mislead you.Beware)How could I know that those 30 seconds were probably the best seconds in the album?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rivals DT's \\"Scenes From a Memory\\"","review":"I like to tell people who haven't heard of Symphony X that they are a heavier version of Dream Theater (DT). Based on that comparison, I would say that this rock opera by Symphony X is a heavier version of DT's \\"Scenes From a Memory.\\" Not that the lyrics are as deep or the story connecting the entire album is as compelling as DT's album, but Symphony X has such a great heavy progressive sound and put such a monumental album together that it rivals DT's album in the way you will be drawn into listening to the whole album in one sitting. You can't walk away from it. It grips you and you are there for the whole ride right from the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"yes.. this album is everything they say it is","review":"now i am going to be completely honest here: there is not one bad track on this album. there is also not one mediocre track on this album. there are two good songs on this album. The rest of the album is straight up AMAZING. Fans of Symphony X all have this album, but for those who want their first Symphony X cd i actually would not start here even though it may be their best. I recommend starting off with the Odyssey if you are a newcomer. After the Odyssey, THEN purchase both this album and The Divine Wings of Tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music, lyrics of cheese","review":"Music composed by a virtuoso, classically trained guitarist and combine it with lyrics that are either painfully cliched, plain cheesy or are a result of bad thesaurus usage and you have Symphony X. Intelligent music . . . unintelligible lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one put me to shame","review":"\\"Not a bad listen. Some moody arrangements are interesting enough (\\"Communion and the Oracle\\" is nice), but too often Symphony X seem to play fast just for the sake of playing fast (\\"Evolution\\") - and speed does not make a simple melody any more interesting. This is an above average metal album, but it isn't really \\"progressive\\". Unless \\"progressive\\" is measured by the number of drumbeats per second...\\"That's what I wrote almost two years ago, upon first hearing it. Since then, it has grown and grown and grown on me, and has been one of my favorite albums. The more more you listen, the more you discover subtleties in the orchestration, vocal arrangements and lyrics that move, thrill and rock you. Once you manage to \\"listen past\\" the metal, you discover a whole new album. Genius. Absolute genius!To all fans of prog rock: If you've been turned off so called \\"prog metal\\" by the likes of Dream Theater, don't let that bias you against this album, as I initially did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unappreciation for a classic piece of music.","review":"This is one of the albums that people seem to know more about then others but only from people who have heard of this group. Symphony X is not a very well known group from my standing. Good music like this often times isn't given the credit it deserves and because of that it doesn't reach the ears of people who would enjoy it.V is an album that defines Symphony X. Their other albums are masterpieces as well but if I were to recommend a friend on of their cds this one would be it. Every song is connected to the next creating an intrecet mix of blazing music and vocals. Not a single song is bad, even the little ones that don't seem to be much more then a waste of a a few seconds are worth the listen t get the feel of the album.Any fan of Prog Metal should own a copy of this cd. It is an album of epic proportions."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!! now thats power metal!","review":"Amazing!, cant stop listening to such a great masterpiece from this unknown band Symphony X. This cd includes terrific Lyrics, Romeo is just one of the best power metal guitarist ever!. This band is the next Dream Theater, I hope they manage to keep the great work as they did with \\"V\\". I bought this cd thanks to peoples reviews and I think ill use the same method for every cd I buy. Powerfull metal!, the music seems like a musical act introduced into varius songs, this isnt the type of music with different songs that dont make sense with each other, believe me this makes sense!. Please metal fans, make yourself a favor and buy this CD!."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid like the Plaugue... and not in a good goth way, either","review":"This is cheap...rock from the leadsinger of FasterPussycat.

The only negative for me was it was way to short of a video and only lasted 30 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marketing Hype","review":"This book is written by the Fibre Channel marketing team - it reads like sales literature. There is no unbiased discussion on the technology, no mention of any of the weak points and exhorbitant claims about Fibre Channel's ability.

It covers the same overview, delves into much more detail, and covers real world uses of the technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little wine journal","review":"We love this journal. The three ring binder style allowed us to remove the filler pages from wine sections we don't normally drink (blush, dessert) and add those pages to sections we drink often (reds!) Also includes a handy quick-reference chart with definitions of oft-used wine terms.If you are an absolute purist about recording the entire, full label on the bottle this may not be the journal for you. The space for the labels is ample if you are ok with trimming to fit in some instances. The journal is the size of a med-lrg planner so the pages aren't so large that you have tons of space to record tons of info or large labels, for instance.Certainly a good solution for the novice or amateur wine aficionado."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous virtuosity!","review":"I have been a fan of Emma Kirkby's for several years, and I believe this collection of early music contains some of her best work. Included are pieces in English, Italian, Latin and German by Handel, Purcell, Bach, Monteverdi, Schutz, et al. Monteverdi's \\"Lamento della ninfa\\" is simply lovely. Kirkby easily tackles the gorgeous and complex ornamentation of \\"The Harmony of the Spheres.\\" The pure drama of Handel's \\"Armida abbandonata; Venti, fermate\\" is touching and tragic:\\"Winds, cease blowing,no, do not drown him;true, he has betrayed me,yet still I adore him.\\"How many women have had similar thoughts?A wonderful collection, in my opinion, and truly essential for Emma Kirkby fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD totally kicks!","review":"Edgy, hard driving bass lines.

I didn't expect to like any of the others but they weren't too bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Original Artist","review":"With all the alternative/rock girl leads out there trying to wave and scream in the critics direction to be seen and heard, Tracy is a step away from the rest.. She sings and performs as if she doesn't give a damn if you listen or not. But that somehow makes you want to listen all the more. Very comfortable on stage and snuggly fit perfectly with her band Tracy gives you hard edge singing accompanied with her impressive violin action on this new CD to match her classic first one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great voice and rocking music","review":"Tracy Bonham has a distinctive and powerful voice of the Janis Joplin kind, and she's not afraid to use it. I immediately picked her out on the background of an Aerosmith record, adding some nice punch to one of their tracks on Honkin' On Bobo.She's a great composer of rock tunes, with some confident, satirical, feminist lyrics. \\"Behind Every Good Woman\\" is the best cut on this album, and if your local radio station didn't play it, shame on them. I bought the CD for that song, but once it got into my CD player, it stayed there for weeks. Let's hope Tracy keeps making full-tilt rock like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is an excellent CD. i would like to thank my friend michael for getting me hooked on Tracy :) This CD is wonderful! a cd that you can definately groove to :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better Than 'Burdens'...","review":"Tracy Bonham blew me away when she released the amazing debut \\"Burdens of Being Upright\\", and I listened to the album continuously for months. When I feel like rocking, I take it out still. This album, after only 4 full listens, completely eclipses the debut. She's grown so much in terms of songwriting and melodies (and her violin is perfect), but her lyrics are still the beautiful poetry they were on 'Burdens'. This album is more like therapy than anything. My therapist thinks it's funny, because I refer to Tracy as my shrink during our sessions. Freed is a very self-aware and honest track, and the violin intro is beautiful. The single Behind Every Good Woman has got to infuse every woman out there with fresh energy and strength. Or maybe it's just me? No matter; the bottom line is, Tracy has made it clear that she's not a one-album wonder with this flawless disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spin A Second Beauty","review":"Tracy Bonham proves she has a softer side...for maybe two tracks. The rest is pure alternative rock with weird, edgy lyrics and a fine grasp of JUST how well violin fits in with rock. (Yellowcard needs to team up with her...)Her voice is still infectious, you can't get around it's uniqueness. Her lyrics this time are a little more...purposeful. We are left with songs like Meat Hook though, where we feel just a bit confused. Jumping Bean seems like a sequel to Navy Bean (even mentioning it in the song!) and Behind Every Good Woman is an anthem to just about anyone.Not that she *exactly* tours much anymore (but I anticipate she will with her new album dropping soon) but if you can see her live, do it. It's an experience that only barely surpasses just how amazing her discs are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of tasty goodness!","review":"On Burdens of Being Upright, there was more pop flavor and more tasty hooks than on Down Here. BUT... Down Here still manages to be a better album. The instruments here play a greater role in expressing the feeling behind a song, so the album has a more visceral feel. Bonham is a fearless feminist, ranting about makeup and plastic surgery on \\"Fake It\\", and telling some unfortunate guy in no uncertain terms that the relationship is over on \\"Jumping Bean.\\" But Bonham is much more than angry. She sings about her struggles with life in general on \\"Second Wind\\", and worries about wanting the right things on \\"You Cant Always Not Get What You Don't Want.\\" One caveat: the album ends rather anticlimatically on two mellow tracks. On the other hand, former Soul Coughing bassist Sebastian Steinberg plays bass on most tracks. Steinberg is one of the best rock bassists of all time, and his contribution to Down Here makes the album even better than it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"an emotionally intelligent album -- a no-regrets buy","review":"Wit has its place in life, but I'm not completely sold that it works in music. The term \\"witty rocker\\" makes me cringe. I like the rhythms to be simple, dumb, and dirty and the lyrics to be passionate without being cloying. But here, it does work, because it's not just the lyrics that are intelligent, but also the creative instrumental arrangements, song structure, and melodic stylings that are catchy and refreshing. This album sounds like Liz Phair's \\"Whitechocolatespaceegg\\" crossed with Jon Spencer's Blues Explosion, with emotionally-relevant lyrics.Several songs are standout depending on what you're looking for, but what makes this album worth your money is the versatility of the band and diversity of tunes, which successfully merge Bonham's classically-trained influences into an alt-rock format and yields a highly listenable, cohesive album."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"excellent these shoes are great for sport, he recommends, are very bright light, yet simple, such as expected, the packaging is a little big if we could reduce would be best"},{"rating":"2","title":"First of a great tradition","review":"Situation was B-Side single released by Yaz(oo) in the early '80s and this mix, while weak in someways by today's standards of overdubbed club thumbing and tribal traditions, is a testament to the first generation of non-computer mixes when things were done old school with tape and signal.

The remainder of these mixes add NOTHING whatsoever to the original version.

Some of the info is good, but this book is an example of why our electorate is becoming more polarized and less educated about how things actually work.

The idea that a cabal of the wealthiest men in the world, greedy capitalists all, would hatch this fantastic conspiracy to bring about World Socialism is just plain stupid. Unless the author really means National Socialism (Nazism), which is more like Corporate Socialism, or fascism. That is far more believable, and likely.

Unfortunately, the author is extremely sloppy in his argumentation, and it is impossible to tell from one sentence to the next whether one is reading something that has a hope of historical foundation, or just more anti-banking and anti-banker rantings and ravings. The author is so unfair to his subjects, it is difficult to read this book without developing sympathy for the institutions and individuals he most wishes to criticize. One sided rant from start to finish.Even worse on monetary fundamentals, which apparently escape the author's comprehension. If banks create the funds they lend out of \\"nothing\\", then why do they suffer when borrowers fail to pay them back?"},{"rating":"2","title":"federal reserve","review":"this book takes you through the times we have had central bank and why each time it has failed to serve us. It is easy to read despite its size: the author has you read the synopsis at the beginning and then each summary following the chapter. It will take about an hour.

I felt she had a real knack for drawing complex characters with believable motivations. I was completely drawn into the world she portrays, and I found Sano an interesting character with some very believable problems. My one criticism of the novel was its melodramatic ending. Then I read Shinju and had much the same reaction.But The Way of the Traitor is melodrama through and through, unredeemed by any of the depth of feeling that marks the others. The author's attempts to flesh out her characters by the use of flashbacks to their earlier lives fails badly, and the plot is like something out of Enid Blyton, with mysterious lights and smuggler's coves. By the time I got to the last couple of chapters I no longer cared about any of it, least of all who the guilty parties were."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Just didn't do anything for me.

Which Turns Out to be a Great Thing!","review":"4 Stars = ClassicHere is a more sympathetic & human retelling of the Beowulf & Grendel story, actually a poem, written between the 8th & 11th century.Here Beowulf is a more kind & understanding protagonist. Grendel is a wronged antagonist, who looks very much human, but is a mutant or abomination in the eyes of humanity. Both are played as sympathetic characters. Gerard Butler does a fine job as Beowulf, as he plays his part as a multi dimensional personality, not just a one dimensional blood, fame & power lusting hero.Stellan Skarsgard, who looks remarkably like Geoffrey Rush in all that orange hair, does a fine job as the King, who has a secret to hide from Beowulf about Grendel, & only at the end is his hand forced & his humanity at stake for what he has done.A thoughtful, sincere retelling, \\"Beowulf & Grendel\\" is highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Beowulf & Grendel!!!","review":"REGARDLESS of what everybody else says;this is the best Beowulf & Grendel movie ever made!!

Perhaps the remaining two segments of this epic will be addressed some day with equal cinematic vigor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story - Great visual imagry","review":"I liked this movie enough to buy it after watching it. IT's not an action movie and in ways it is not hyper-dramatic. It plods along at a pace that matches the nordic scenery. There is enough action in it - and drama - to keep a person watching. What I liked about it best was the imagry and at times the humor. I also like the story and the acting. Yeah, I guess I liked everything about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf and Grendel","review":"After waiting over 30 years for a movie to be made of one of my favorite stories, I was sorely disapppointed in this production. There was barely anything in the movie which was true to the original epic poem. The best part of the movie was the scenery and the costumes. My least favorite part was Grendel conceiving a child with a witch. This epic poem has been read by generations of English-speaking people, not because it is easy to read but because it is a great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight to DVD....no wonder.","review":"Maybe you'll find a gem every now and then that went straight from the cutting room floor to DVD, but this is not it. This movie is the direct result of what happens when there is absolutely no production and no money put into a film. While the scenery and landscapes may be fascinating, the acting and dialogue is horrible. I'm sorry, I've read the poem and have seen these actors in other roles and this movie is a completely distorted view of what the poem really is and who the actors really are. Save your money and your time and wait for Robert Zemeckis' Beowulf adaptation coming out later this year in a THEATER near you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another ruined classic","review":"Don't be fooled by the costumes and scenery. This film mutilates the greatness of the Beowulf story. The monster is regarded as a victim, the Geat warriors a bunch of immoral thugs, and Hrothgar more evil than Grendel. Adding insult to injury, the acting is second-rate, the scenes are joined like a broken window, and script is full of anachronism.Disappointing, moldy cheese on an attractive platter.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't recommend","review":"I had a hard time getting thru this movie. Why on earth was all the bad language put in there. It was just so out of place to see men of this period of time using the \\"F\\" word, and more, over and over again. It just didn't fit. The acting wasnt bad, just the scripts. It could have been a good movie done properly. My impression was Poor Low Budget Film! Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Hopefully I can resell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This was the most obnoxious time waster I have ever witnessed. I kept waiting for the Monty Python Troup to show up. The acting was horrid. What was with the rocks and urinating on the door?? I found myself rooting for Grendel. Of the 33 people in the theater, 10 got up and left half way through. This was a story of great heros, not neurotic children. Too bad Gerard Butler's career has come to this. I hope the Beowulf saga ends here and no attempt is made to do a sequel as discussed in the director interview. I would have been ashamed to put my name on this piece of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 hours I will never get back","review":"Horrid! Grendel was just a misunderstood?

HOWEVER, NO ONE COULD HAVE SAVED THIS MOVIE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad film--avoid at all costs!!","review":"Save you money and rent or buy The Thirteenth Warrior instead, a Beowulf adaptation that is a cinematic masterpiece by comparison to this drek. If you want to see Gerard Butler ina medieval film, then rent Timeline, also a masterpiece by comparison. The highly repetitive soundtrack, stationary camera work, constant use of the same lng and medium shots (where are the close ups?), and snail's pace editing make this low budget Beowulf & Grendel unwatchable. Shots of Bowulf and his gang riding shetland poneys are truly laughable, as are the fake blood and severed limbs and heads and he bearded boy at the start of the film. The glowing reviews on this website are no doubt written by relatives of the cast and crew or by employees in the marketing firm paid to plug this sorry excuse for a film."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEOWULF & GRENDEL","review":"WHAT CAN I SAY ,I KNOW THE STORY AND IF I HAD SEEN THIS MOVIE BEFORE I KNEW THE STORY, I WOULDN'T CARE ABOUT THE STORY AT ALL.

Unfortunately, it did not live up to the hype. This is--in its way--nothing more than an exploitation flick. The main female character is there for no reason other than to be raped and used by the male characters. Due to amazon's policy, I can't \\"spoil\\" the end of the film by giving away what happens, but rest assured, it only gets worse from there. The writers of this movie created an entire character whose only function is to be abused. If you want a great medieval epic, look elsewhere. If you want a good movie, look elsewhere. If you want to find out more about Beowulf or Anglo-Saxon England, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beowulf and Grendl","review":"Great production of an epic poem!! Superb cast of performers gave all they had!! Have watched many times now and am spellbound till the end!! Truly a great movie that is sure to be a classic!

Let's face it people, it's a pretty bad movie.Clumsily edited, terrible makeup (especially all the rubber Grendel body-suits), no closeups of actors (there are about 10 actors in the whole \\"epic\\" movie), and that's not even mentioning the accents, which are all over the map. Sarah Polley sounds like she's straight out of the mall, while Butler is unintelligable half the time.The scenery is gorgeous, but it's hard to get into the spirit of a Beowulf movie that is twice as inept as The 13th Warrior. If you are on the fence, take a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good...","review":"After enjoying so much action and effects on the new animation film with Hopkins and Angelina..this one falls short of almost everything...good acting but a lack of depth and budget make this one a rental at the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cinematic re-telling of a great myth","review":"The harsh, stark world of the literary epic, Beowulf, is re-created and the story liberally re-told in this wonderful film. As you'll read in other comments, the scenery is ruggedly beautiful, the acting good, and the tale as interesting as the original tale. It does move at a pace that is slow for Americans, but Americans (I'm one) should slow down and get lost in the tale (have a beer while you watch it). As you may know, Beowulf was written from a Christian perspective on a bleak, old world better left behind. Christianity subtly pokes its head into this film without being annoying or proselytizing. Beowulf is heroic in this film not because of his exploits, but because he gains insight into struggle between the trolls and the Danes. There is violence, but it isn't overdone, and a couple of brief love scenes. There is a lot of drinking beer and waiting for the troll to come!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie--stay away","review":"This is a horrible movie. Anyone looking for something similar to Lord of the Rings or any other well-done movie based on an epic tale, should look elsewhere. Terrible script, bad sets, horrible acting. I could watch/listen when Selma the witch with the American accent was on screen. Her acting is some of the worst I've seen in recent times. How does she get work? And the script writer went out of his way to make the dialogue sound epic or \\"old\\" and it sounded ridiculous with her American accent. Not to mention all the gratuituous swearing. Swearing's fine (I do a lot of it myself) but when it's just crammed in there for no reason it's sound moronic. Bad movie. Laughable makeup jobs (check out Grendel's hair and muscle suit)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf and Grendel","review":"This movie has very little in common with the real story. I disliked it very much and would not recommend it to anyone! I originally bought it to show to my classes after we finished reading Beowulf.

Spare yourself the agony and save your money.So NOT recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Action","review":"This film needed actual monsters and more fighting. I am not normally one to ask for action. I love character study films. However, when there is neither character study nor action nor motivation, a film drowns in its lostness. I was saddened that the writers got their history wrong. Most scholars believe that Beowulf's tale actually traces back to at least 200 BC. So, the cliche monk would not even exist in the original telling. The worst part of the film was that the characters all had different accents. This film is an incorrect account of Beowulf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been called: Beowulf vs Captian Caveman","review":"I cannot believe the positive reviews of this peice of crap. Also, I found it really hard to believe that the Grendel in the movie could have been such a threat. The Dane warriors come off as laughable that they cant seem to capture or kill Captain Caveman.Grendel is supposed to be a troll, a supernatual terror that needs a hero like Beowulf to kill. Grendel in this movie made me think of the John Matuszak character in the movie Caveman with Ringo Star. Ridiculous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a way to ruin a classic.","review":"I had high hopes for this movie. I'm a major fan of this genre, and was hoping I'd found another clasic. After all, the movie was based on a epic. How could they go wrong? The way they went wrong was to add modern speech to the film's dialogue. Everytime I became immersed in the realistic look of the movie, a contemporary phrase or profanity would snap me out of the film. It happened time and time again. It became comical. After about an hour, I ejected the Beowulf and Grendel DVD from the player, put it back in the case, and returned it to the rental store. I haven't any desire to see the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lousy movie","review":"Why anyone bothers to make a movie this bad is a mystery. \\"The Thirteenth Warrior\\" remains the best Beowulf movie to date, in my opinion. This one stinks. Save your money and time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent it instead of buying it","review":"I'm not going to lie, when I say that this movie had so much more potential. Gerard Butler is an excellent actor, but the script for this movie was weak. Therefore, he did not perform to his full potential. If you read the story in school about Beowulf, the movie will let you down. I just wish Hollywood could understand this when they make big budget movies. The actor Gerard Butler is just now being recognized for his work in 300. I noticed his potential in Dracula 2000. He pours himself into the characters he portrays. I just think it was sad for him to waste his time in Beowulf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well Done But Poorly Conceived","review":"The movie was well done- the acting and presentation was pretty good. However it managed to completely miss the point of the book. Since when was a man-eating monster just mistreated and misunderstood? Though Grendel was portrayed as a victim, bothe his and his mother's hovels were strewn with piles of bones! Despite his diet of people the king cannot think of a reason that he should have dispatched Grendel's father beyond the coincidence of their paths crossing. Such enormous liberties were taken with the story- to present the hero as the bad guy and the monster as the tragic hero! What a shame to take such a wonderfully crafted work and twist it to show \\"what it really must have been like.\\" The whole point of fiction is to see things beyond our scope. To edit and reduce this marvelous tale in order to make it match someone's idea of what must have been--that is truly tragic."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment and a poor retelling of a great tale","review":"This movie is an uninspired retelling of the Beowulf and Grendel tale. There are added characters that bring you no closer to an understanding of the story, an added back story that is supposed to explain Grendel's rage and added violence that does not better explain Grendel in any manner. Avoid this version of the tale unless you like to look at lovely scenery and watch people running around in furs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously???","review":"This movie is bad not because it appears to be shot on a shoe string budget. Or the make up on the creature Grendel looks like the Gico caveman if he ate lead paint as a child. It's basically a giant rasta wig!?! I can even overlook the bad special effects. It's the horrible acting by all, except maybe Gerard Butler (and I'm being biased) that make this a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I watched 2007's Beowulf and it was absolutely amazing so I rented this version.

If the viewer is looking for a pictorial representation of the original, this mess isn't it. It is loaded with gratuitous sex and violence, has characters that don't exist in the poem, has language that doesn't exist in either the original Old English or any translation. The action is made up of wildly improbable and illogical events. Beowulf with a Scottish accent is laughable. Beowulf's original home is at the southern end of Sweden. The correct pronunciation of Geat is Gay-ot.

Don't mind me babbling on, just watch it, it's great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This movie follows the tale of the Geatland hero Beowulf and his fight against the troll Grendel. This movie was shot very well and the screen writer not only used the epic poem but the history of the era to make this movie.

It is also very gritty, and true to the land (with actors actually suffering in making the movie), and that gives it it's realistic 'truth'. Well-acted, well-played, and well-presented! It will scare you, and you just might identify with some of the players, but that is always a danger, isn't it???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beowulf & Grendel DVD","review":"The movie was faithful to the epic except trying to make one feel sorry for Grendel with a bogus opening scene. This I could lived with but the story dragged and the screenplay was as vague to point that if you did know the story you would be lost or certainly would not have cared. The actors were liveless (sort of like Anakin Skywalker Star War 3).In short, I heard of this movie by accident and that should have told me something."},{"rating":"1","title":"One is too much","review":"Being bored and offended at the same time is hard to manage - but this film manages.

Prof Khazen moves then to a meticulous refutation of Lefitst views of the war, denying that sectarian divisions led to the war or that there were legitimate social and economic grievances among the Lebanese (as the leftists were syaing). Despite the length of Prof Khazen's book, I don't find it satisfying as an account of what happened in Lebanon in the period 1967-1976, nor does it cover adequatley the destructive role played by the Lebanese elites in these tragic years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive and Insightful","review":"This is a far more insightful and comprehensive work than several books on Lebanon I have read in recent years. Although I take issue with some of the author's arguments, the book is a solid academic work not only on the war but also on Lebanese society and politics. It is also based on new data and research material. The book is highly recommended for specialists on Lebanese and Arab politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"No the Lebanese war was not a civil one.","review":"Outstanding work! At long last someone comes to the fore to change the widely held perception that Lebanon's wars were home grown. El-Khazen's methodically shatters that image by proving that \\"civil war\\" is a misnomer and that Lebanon fell under a crushing weight of an authoritarian M.Eastern neighbourhood. I highly recommended it specially for journalists covering the M.East."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misinformation in the guise of scholarship","review":"This is a book written with hate for everything Arab and Muslim. To say that the lebanese civil war has no domestic roots insults the hundreds of thousands of dead, injured, or maimed Lebanese. let's face it, Lebanon's archaic sectarian political system is no recipe for any country. It is high time that we come to our senses that narrowly based identifications that have tormented lebanon for so long must lay to rest.

In modest, self-deprecating terms Shackleton describes the ordeal of his crew as they struggle for survival after being stranded in the Antartic after their ship is crushed by ice.In an era without reliable long distance communications, or modern equipment, 28 men managed to survive nearly two years in the frozen Antartic. Even more amazing, Shackleton and 5 companions crossed over 800 miles of some of the worlds roughest ocean in a 22 foot boat to bring help for the rest of the party.Having read Alfred Lansing's work \\"Endurance\\" this personal memoir by Shackleton also includes a description of the southern party, which was waiting in vain for him on the other side of Antartic.Shackleton and his party of 28 accomplished one of the most amazing examples of man's fortitude and indomitable courage.

Right after this Blanche comes in and has a negative attitude and whines that \\"life has no meaning.\\" Sofia snaps back \\"so who's for popcorn?\\" which gets a roar out of the studio audience, but falls flat with the DVD viewers because the scene between Sofia and Dorothy is edited out on the DVD version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"The Golden Girls is a wonderfully hilarious show.

Unlike so many of the other reviewers I found this biography to be excruciatingly long and boring. It takes quite an effort by a writer to make as fascinating a person as Mark Twain dull, but the author succeeds. The writer kept throwing in his personal asides in an effort to be clever, but instead was merely annoying. The writing style is awkward and stilted and it takes a real effort to push through to the end. The author seems to be trying to direct attention to himself as much as the subject. This style makes the 722 pages seem twice as long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to listen to as well as read","review":"I wouldn't presume to add anything to the reviews of this book, even if I could. But I didn't find any comments on the quality of the recording, which is worth a note.The reader is the author himself, Ron Powers. He is very easy to listen to. I find myself drifting off less than I usually do, and getting a lot more of the meat of the book. Powers manages to suggest by his voice when the subject changes or a recurrent theme appears and he clearly pronounces the punctuation that he no doubt sweated over. His imitation of Twain's voice isn't quite what I expected after Hal Holbrook, but it works to make the transitions to and from quotations very fluid, and I have begun to think of it as the voice of Twain.All in all, I liked Power's reading as much as those of professional readers.

The larage bars I have are only half used and I use it every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm high-maintenance, so...","review":"I've never been able to decipher what ingredient it is in some soaps that gives me a strange 'surface rash' on my skin ('surface' being that there are raised bumps that scab over but they don't itch and they're not red. Not painful, but not pretty). But, turns out that this soap does this to me. It also has a VERY strong medicinal smell which is a bit too strong for what I'd prefer in a soap and probably part of what causes me to break out. So, QUALIFIER: This soap does not work for me due to my sensitive skin, but may be great for others who do not have this challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Olivella Face and Body Bar","review":"This soap has an unpleasant medicinal smell.

Creative storyline, great direction and some really good acting makes this movie worth watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece!!!!","review":"This movie is fun, fun, fun! At first I thought it would be another disappointment along the lines of Olsen twins movies--one big bore. On the contrary, it was a wonderful story of two friends that I enjoyed immensely. I recommend this movie. It contains a trove of positive messages in it (the 'happily politically incorrect' among viewers should seriously rethink their wrong opinions and appreciate this film more.) Bend it like Beckham and score with this thoroughly delightful movie. It's a joy on all levels!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This movie was actually a lot of fun to watch. (to my surprise, since I'm a chic flick opponent and a die hard action movie fan). It was funny and cute and I think suitable for a whole family to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend it Like Beckham","review":"A fun culturally rich movie for all people, Bend it Like Beckham is a bittersweet movie about love, dreams, and family. Jessi desperately wants to play soccer, and when a girl named Juli invites her to join a soccer team, a rift is placed in Jessi's family as she is conflicted with following her dreams or following tradition.This movie focuses big on tradition and first loves. It's a good movie to show to a soccer team. The homosexual jokes became a little old (what is up with the British obsession with homosexuality?), and the movie didn't concentrate nearly enough on the reasons why Jess' family wanted to protect her. This is a cute movie, however, and the faults are quickly forgiven."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Dream a Dream","review":"Bend It Like Beckham is a story about two girls trying to fulfill their dreams of becoming professional footballers (in America that's Soccer). Each has their own battles to fight as the girls deal with their parents' traditional minds sets collide with girls' ambitions and dreams as well as their mutual attraction for their coach.Complex but witty, Bend It Like Beckham is full of fun and wonder as if \\"My Big Fat Greek Wedding\\" has spurred an outing of cross -culture and -generation movies that show the compelling nature of families. This movie is a sleeper hit with a potential for a great sequel.The DVD has many neat additions expecially the receipe. I wonder if I too can create this dish?Want more reviews, visit:http://www.oddworldz.com/thehallow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Story, Without All the Angst","review":"The plot is standard enough: a girl has a dream that her parents don't support. \\"Bend It Like Beckham\\" adds a bit of a twist by throwing in cultural inhibitions. There is, after all, a difference between rebelling against one's parents, and potentially turning your back against one's cultural heritage.This movie manages to pull off all of the struggles inherent in that. There is humour that those of the portrayed ethnicity will relate to. These jokes, however, aren't so deeply enmeshed that the rest of the audience is lost. The film is, in turns, light hearted and thoughtful.All in all, I think this was a great mix of thought-provoking and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites...","review":"I had a craving to watch this movie again (it's been a few years), so I rented it. Then after returning it, I though, why not just buy it? So I did, and was very pleased. It arrived within the expected time range, and the quality of the dvd was as the seller had described. I was leery of buying movies from private sellers, but this purchase proved me wrong!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard fare with an accent.","review":"I really wanted to like Bend It Like Beckham. The cast was good at playing their very one dimensional roles and cutting standard Hollywood dialouge. However I was expecting that maybe, just maybe there would be one single shred of originality. However there was none. The plot twists were predictable, and I did not even feel good after watching the movie. Try this movie yourself and form your own opinions. But if you are looking for anything original this movie fails to deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"Although this movie had its moments, I have probably seen too many formulaic cross-cultural movies and this reminded me of all of them combined. It had everything: the disappointed, but ultimately approving parents, the cross-cultural displacements, the gay (in/out of the closet) best friend, the happy ending home-run/goal/etc., etc. etc. etc. Most people will think I am too harsh, but if you've seen a hundred, you've seen them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this movie and reading these reviews before watching it raised my expectations. But I found this story to be way too predictable. The characters, especially the mothers, were made out to be cardboard stereotypes rather than characters with any complexity. I was hoping to share this with my 13 year old niece but it was such a yawn I think I'll spare her. Funny? I found myself rolling my eyes but not laughing. Also I had to watch it with the subtitles on because there was so much rapid-fire mumbling. I am amazed this got such good reviews. I did like learning about Indian culture and rituals. The very talented actors did a great job with a weak, predictable script."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS!!!","review":"Do not buy this DVD! The studio did a rush job on the transfer and the video/sound quality has suffered!! BEWARE!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save time and money","review":"I just watched this movie and I feel disappointed. The original idea is very good and was for more, instead the film turns in to a cheese soap opera which I just wanted to stop. The only good thing I came out with is that I learn a little bit about the beautiful Indian traditions which seem to me they were presented a little bit exaggerated to attract westerners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is one of the best movies ive seen this year. Keira Knightley and Parminder were awesome. The director seemed to be able to both respect the Hindu religion and poke fun at it, an interesting paradox. An awesome, uplifting movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's alright.","review":"The women are gorgeous. It's funny if you know some british slang. Love the recipe on DVD extras. pretty good acting. Needs more soccer."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED IN QUALITY!","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of this DVD as a couple of friends had recommended it.

My laughter woke her up several times. Later in the flight we had another opportunity to see the film. My wife had to see what I was laughing about so we both watched the film. It was just as good the second time. The movie is partly about soccer but is more about following your dreams while still honoring different cultures. The movie is wholesome and entertaining and displays well the trials and tribulations of parents and teenagers. We saw the film again on a flight from Sydney to Auckland and still can't wait to see it agian when it comes to U.S. theaters. The cell phone scene mentioned in one of the reviews is classic. Pure enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Fun","review":"This movie is unpretentious, pure, heartfelt fun. The story is laugh-out-loud funny from start to finish. The opening scene, in which Jess dreams of being a soccer star broadcast on TV, immediately sets the tone of the film and draws you in. The soccer scenes are great, but not so dominating that those of us unversed in matters of sports can't follow. Watch out for Keira Knightley's spirited acting and her hilarious relationship with her homophobic mother. Oh, and don't press the \\"stop\\" button before the closing credits end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie Ever!!","review":"I just watched this movie and i have to say that as a south asian brought up in north america I could totally relate. very realistic and entertaining at the same time.

Indian Family... I don't exactly enjoy this kind of music they have. But, for a friend I went to watch it - and tonight I'll be in theatres for it for the third time!!! The story is made up great, a bit of dreaming in there, but who wouldn't want to... the girls play great, the coach plays really good and the story is not unrealistic all together... I love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie!","review":"At first, I thought this would be just another chick-flick, but let me reassure you that it's not.

I FELT REALLY GOOD AFTER THAT FILM.MUST SEE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really.Sucky.Movie.","review":"Nothing about this movie was interesting. To write a long review would almost imply that I was interested enough to pay attention to detail. The football scenes didn't even make it interesting. All I learned from this movie was it's ok to lie to my folks and sulk through my sister's special day b/c I couldn't make a match.Too predictable for more words than this. If you are in teh mood for a crapfest, watch this."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is a bad movie, it sends a bad message for tenage girls","review":"The underlying message I found in this movie was: It's OK to lie to and decieve your parents, if you think their wrong and you are right. Then if they find out, and punish and order you to stop, it OK to do it again as long as you think the action may lead to some good.I was hopeing to see some intresting soccer moves, espicialy since this movie was named after a great soccer player, but the lead charachter in the movie is an Indian girl, David Beckham doesn't even have a speaking role in the movie, just a three second walk past the camera at the end of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid British - Indian Girly movie!","review":"Don't buy this DVD. It's realy a waste of money. Bad acting and an even worse and boring script. No imagination at all! A girl that likes to play football and her parents don't want her to. Wow! How original!

As I do not have VHS player anymore I have decided to donate my last few VHS tapes to the library and replace them with the DVD copies of these movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and Funny","review":"I was born and raised in England and grew up in a multi-cultural society such as where this movie is set. Perhaps this is why this movie hit home for me. Despite being incredibly funny, the characters were very authentic. I related so well to the theme of this movie as many of my friends were Indian. I often marveled at the differences between what I was allowed to do as opposed to what their culture dicatated.Some have stated this movie predictable and that maybe so, but in my opinion they're missing the point completely. If you lived within this type of society, you'd understand the essence of this movie, predictable or not. Many English people also grasped the essence, which is why it was No.1 at the Box Office for weeks.If you want a realistic vision of living in a multi-cultural society with plenty of laughs thrown in, then see this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall entertaining","review":"Quick review: I wouldn't say the movie was A+, but it was definitely worth renting. Get it.Question (Sorry for a question in a review): Would anyone know the song at the end, just before she kicks the winning goal (somewhat opera, classical). It's not on the soundtrack and I can't find it.Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fantastic","review":"United was showing this movie on a twelve-hour ride across the Atlantic, as well as three other mediocre-looking ones. I decided to watch Bend it Like Beckham first, and the next three after. Well, guess what - I ended up watching this movie four times in a row. I don't even LIKE soccer one bit, but I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! It has something for everyone. Great soundtrack, fabulous actors, and a fantastic premise - Indian girl (living in Britain) wants to play soccer, but parents say no. The whole movie is a funny, fresh look at culture clashes, girl-power in the sports world, and of course \\"following your dream\\". ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC! I can't say it enough. This movie was the best I'd seen in a long, long time. Go out and rent/buy this right away. You won't regret it (I guarantee)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Number One in my Heart","review":"Bend it Like Beckham is so much more than a great movie. It is a lesson about life, love, tradition and perserverance. You don't need to be a die-hard fan of soccer, or Beckham to enjoy this movie. It is a light-hearted look at the challenges that life throws you, the heights that love takes you and the accomplishments you can acheive when you put your all in. It's funny and serious and can be understood by audiences of all ages, races, cultures, and sexes. Sure to become an instant classic, Bend it like Beckham has wormed it's way to being the number one movie on my list!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the gr8est movie!!!","review":"this is such a great movie!!! for girls who like sports (especially soccer) here's a movie - finally - where the main character isnt obsessed with guys and actually is good at and enjoys sports. better, you meet all of jess's friends, especially jules the sweetest person in the world. this is such a good movie and EVERYONE will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Wonderful","review":"This movie is one of the best \\"feel-good\\" movies I've ever seen. It lifts your spirit and lets you leave the theatre feeling excited and gives you hope about your dreams. It has humor, romance, and a little drama. A great film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bent!","review":"Although I wasn't totally bowled away by this movie, I can't deny it's certainly one of the most heart-warming, well-acted sports/buddy movies of recent memory.But when you throw in soccer and conflicting family traditions, you're allowed to turn up the depth, throw out the typical Hollywood standards, and turn up the volume--this film features a superb soundtrack featuring \\"Blondie\\", \\"Mel C\\", \\"Bally Sagoo\\" and \\"Curtis Mayfield\\".The acting is great; particularly Anupam Kher as the dad, and Parminder Nagra as Jess--they put a bit more in roles where not much is required. On the soccer end, the editing is pretty good, and the skill level is satisfactory.If you dig this film, you might also enjoy \\"Green Machine\\" which features a number of \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" alumni."},{"rating":"2","title":"A victim of its own success","review":"Yes, there are parallels with 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' but for me, the most pertinent is the hype. This is a good film (in fact, I think it is better than MBFGW), but by the time I had seen it (on video) I had heard so much hype that I thought it would be phenominal. So if you haven't seen it, know that this is a fun and enjoyable movie, but not a truly great film as many would have you believe.Two minor criticisms: First, there were a couple of scenes where my American ears had a hard time understanding The Queen's Englsh being spoken so rapidly (even after rewinding and cranking the volume). Second, while the training/park playing sequences were exhilirating, the actual game sequences were a bit choppy and hard to follow--a bit anticlimactic after all the buildup."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful little movie","review":"A trite and true plot (pun intended), but so well put toether that all is forgiven. Very funny in places, and deals well with the heavier issues (and there are a few).Some of the other reviews here go into dep plot details (spoilers, even), so be cautious in reading those, if you want any surprises. Although there are very few in the film....The sad thing, though, is that the movie is already dated since the WUSA has \\"suspended operation\\" due to lack of money recently. So much for Women's Football in America. Too bad, because it really was a lot of fun, and a very good thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasantly sweet","review":"Watching Bend it Like Beckham is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours. The plot is predictable, and there is nothing profound here, but the female leads are attactive and engaging gals who play their roles well. A flick that made me tear up a little bit a couple of times (yeah, I'm sentimental, and do have a teenaged daughter), and at the end made me smile. In a world filled with violence and mayhem, we need more movies like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Curl Power","review":"Jess, a London girl of Indian extraction, leaps above Anderlecht and scores! Becks gives the diminutive striker a hug and Gary Linneker declares her the future of English football. So begins this shiny happy fun ride. Though \\"Bend It\\" relies on quick cut football scenes designed to hide the actors' lack of skill, the culture clashing is amusing enough to see Jess through to her final triumph. She buys boots on the sly, juggles a cabbage, and avoids learning to cook a proper Indian meal. As her parents busily prepare for an older sister's traditional wedding, Jess slips out to the training ground where she catches the eye of the coach. Indian girl, Irish boy, . . . oh my, the post-colonialism. A not quite so bizarre love triangle develops with all the attendant complications. It's nothing that a swerving free kick can't fix. If you love treacly endings and have always wondered what England looks like in the sunshine, \\"Bend It\\" is your cup of chai."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie plus recipe","review":"This is a really good movie and you don't have to be a soccer fan to enjoy it. Some of the reviewers here touch on the charming parts, the race differences that make the movie way more than a sports film or a silly American underdog team movie (think Ladybugs or airbud). But I want to say anyone who likes to cook should look at the extras and watch \\"Who Wants to Cook Aloo Gobi\\". This is a treat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming!","review":"A charming and memorable little film, one which I enjoyed enormously. Wonderfully cast, wonderfully filmed, my kudos goes out to the makers of this film. Can't say enough good things about it. A rich and vibrant look into both Indian tradition and footballing culture. Simply wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend It Like Becks With A Smile","review":"Absolutely wonderful football movie. Two young football-playing girls aspire to turn professional despite culture issues (one, Jess, is Indian, where footballer girls are frowned upon). The script is amusing, the direction tight and the acting amusing, brilliant, and dead on. From first frame to last you'll find yourself with an ever-growing smile."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Movie That's Full of Life!","review":"We watched this movie as a family and enjoyed it a lot. The pace is quick, the characters are likeable, and it's interesting to see some of the difficulties that occur between generations of a family that is trying to maintain their cultural heritage (Indian) while allowing their children to enjoy themselves in their own native country (Britain)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bend It Like Beckham","review":"An excellent movie. My daughters and I love it. Great soundtrack. It makes you want to go out and play soccer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"This album puts all other asian rappers to shame. Jin is nothing compared to Chan, and this album only certifies Chan as the best Asian rapper (maybe with the exception of Offwhyte).

I am super happy to have stumbled upon Chan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching Art in Motion","review":"The beautifully depicted setting brings to mind the thoughts of lustful romance in Gardens of Eden, while the torrents of Spring do haunt.

This classic is for people who want to escape the drabness of everyday life, and experience an erotic tale of deceit, passion, and confusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fake masterpiece and a complete waste of time","review":"Imagine yourself sitting on a theatre seat and staring at the stage where a bunch of names handwritten on a piece of cardboard paper boldly by the same person, are going back and forth to bigger carboard written names like \\"England, America, Roma, Florence\\" endlessly and a dubbed voice talking over them boring you to death. This is how i feel reading this book. A portrait for 700 pages for god's sake! A casual neighborhood rumor or playing pac man can give you much more literary pleasure than this one.

Plus, Isabel is just too darn conceited - she's in love with herself (that's why she turned down a few guys before picking the wrong one).It does have its good points...but I'm more inclined to Jane Austen or the Brontes - they at least have sensible heroins.I totally agree with Ahmedabah (scroll down and you'll find his review) - except the version I read had 645 pages, and what he said about American girls!

It would have been nice if the Amazon description had mentioned that these cassettes will not play on a Walkman or other audio player without a special adapter (and the adapter only works with headphones). I have listened to many books on tape but this is the first one that has required an adapter; I have no idea where to purchase the adapter (which appears to be specific to the publisher) and I am not thrilled about doing that to listen to one book, anyway. The tapes will play on a full stereo system with some adjustments, but you have to be able to switch the stereo completely to the left, which results in a really annoying sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling Psychodrama","review":"The great power of Henry James's work is that he is intensely compassionate and unwaveringly tough-minded; he creates complex and dimensional characters and allows them to make the worst choices possible. Best of all, he doesn't lapse into melodrama or let his characters off the hook for their lapses in character or judgement. That's the beauty of his work; instead of a cheap redemptive payoff, he shows the range of human experience, woven into a tantalizing and totally involving narrative. Isabel Archer is charming, irritating, self involved, charismatic, and tragically shortsighted. Her fate is all the more tragic because James allows us to travel the entire, rapturous distance with her, signalling the bloom of every camellia, kiss, or withering blow to the spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk two moons","review":"This book about the mixed up life stories about Samantha's best freind Phebee, while she is also trying to get her life staight.

Reading this book was like watching a lava lamp - moving (turning pages) but going nowhere. I only read 40 pages before I couldn't bring myself to pick it up again. Good writing grabs you and compels you to continue - this doesn't. Singing birds are inspiring - this book isn't. The CD that came with it closed the lid on the coffin for me. The birds aren't allowed to star here but the author himself. He fails to communicate with the birds who provide great motifs for improvisation - only recall one time on the CD where the author generated a musical idea based on the bird songs. The book and CD are pretentious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unscientific and pretentious","review":"Rothenberg is a New Age writer and musician that enjoys playing music to birds and jamming their singing with the sound from different wind instruments. Surey lots of fun. However, it is from this perspective that he attemps to understand why birds sing. To be true, he does review some scientific papers and provides a not too bad coverage of the findings of the scientific literature. But Rothenberg enjoys exposing the shortcomings of this research (rather pretentiously by the way) and coming up with unscientific ideas of his own based on his feelings about why birds should spend so much time singing. He seriously believes that his empathic method of blowing desceding fifths and chromatic scales with his clarinet to singing birds can take him a long way into understanding the misteries of bird song.

He did not go into details about key moments throughout his life and it seems he is holding back something through the whole book. His infidelities were handled with a surgeons glove, which is fine if he is protecting those closest to him and the guilty ones involved but his life with his showbiz friends and insights to his world were full of shadowy figures and leaves us in the dark most of the book. I'd love to have read about his spirituality and his innermost thoughts on how he sings the way he does would have been a start. If this is a \\"revealing\\" biography he forgot to be revealing. He is still one of the greatest vocalists to ever sing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally did it!!!","review":"I read Engelbert's Biography and I found it very interesting.

It was reaggravated twice over nearly 3 months @ 3 weeks in and @ 2 months in despite resting and RICEing it. A friend's mom recommended Symphytum Officinale after her son used it to help with a bone break. Since staying off of my foot was not enough, I desperately decided to try this along with USP Labs Super Cissus Rx, which I read also aids bone healing. I used an order of each and continued to take it easy for an additional month. Once I finished both bottles, I slowly began increasing my activity. I ran my first mile roughly 6 months post fracture and can now run 3 miles regularly with no signs of reaggravation. It might have been the sheer amount of time I rested for, but I think this along with Cissus Quadrangularis is definitely worth a try considering how debilitating and unpredictable stress fractures can be. These taste fine/good btw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deep Fryer","review":"The Presto Fryer is a great fryer. I especially like that it has two baskets that can be used at the same time for different foods. The baskets hook onto the fryer for draining so oil doesn't drip everywhere.

I should have heeded the other reviews and purchased a different fryer. Taking the advice of several reviewers, I tried keeping the temperature at 350 degrees instead of 375 while frying battered fish in one basket and french fries in the other one. The fish stuck to it's basket and the fries were brown and soggy. So, I tried the same scenario with the temp at 375. The fish still stuck to the basket; the fries were still brown and soggy. Even tried the \\"twice-fried\\" method for the fries with no significant improvement in the crispness factor. I was also disappointed with the long cooking time as another reviewer noted.After a VERY LONG, tiring and trying cooking experience, I scrambled for my old faithful large pot, piled in Crisco and lovingly dropped in the rest of the fish.

Having no real idea what it was about I checked it out because of the teaser about Doreen listening to the Pixies on the inside cover.Once I got home, I read it in three days. It usually takes me a while but the pages just flew. I would open the book and the next thing I knew it would be three hours later and I'd be another third or quarter of the way through!In fact, this book was so good that I was very surprised to see the MTV logo on the last page. Because in general, I hate MTV. This book, however, pushed me to read more of the reccomended reads. None of which have truly lived up to my experience with Brave New Girl.Still, I didn't feel the depth of Doreen's relationship to her father. Even towards the end of the book. Thats the only draw back of this young adult novel, because the ending really made up for it.In short, read it. And then wait for Luna's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teen life as it always has been.","review":"My best friend gave this book to me and told me to read, but I should expect too much from it. Well I started and finished the book in one night.Doreen was a strong girl in the story, but a lot of what happen to her and what went on didn't seem like it was true enough. I know this a book, but she at times was very naieve in things that happen to her and what she did.The best part of the book overall would be the end for me and the way she finally managed to connect with her father who seemed like he expected so much from her and that is why he was so tough on her. Overall this book was a very quick read and good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soo good","review":"This book Brave New Girl, so soo good. I find that i can relate to it really well, and yeah, it is now like one of my favorite books, i would say that all of you should go out and get it, or at least rent it from the libary.

I liked this book but thought more could have been done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too far away","review":"OK, this book has a good ending with loads of actions BUT -unfortunately - everything that comes before kind of lacks something.I bought this book mainly because of the comparison to 'Catcher in the rye' (by JD Salinger), but this book is nowhere near it.Doreen, the main character seems mostly nave and passive, with no ideas of her own. That makes her, and the story, a little strange and 'far-away'.Anyway, if you like 'Catcher in the Rye' and are thinking of buying Brave New Girl then you're probable better of just reading 'Catcher in the Rye' again."},{"rating":"1","title":"depressing","review":"I wish I could give this book 0 stars. It showed teenagers in the wrong light. The main character, Doreen is this angry, depressed 14 year old who hates everything. Everyone else in the book, except for Ted of course, was portrayed as evil people who deserved to be f-worded by Doreen because they like something that she hates, like singing along to commercials. It hardly has a plot and the whole book reads like Doreen sharing with us everything she hates and wants to swear about. The reason I bought this book was that I saw the ad on MTV and the title \\"Brave New Girl\\" together with the pretty colors on the cover made it look like an empowering sort of book. But, I was wrong. I'd recomend this book to angry, depressed teenagers who would like to get more angry and depressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"i dont get it","review":"This book left me totally confused, I didn't even know she was raped for most of it. Almost every other word is f*** and I know real teens dont talk like that. I mean we all say it but not to the point where it has to be in every sentence. I dont really understand what the plot was or if there was one. Maybe I just dont get it but this is one of the worst books I've ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little overdone","review":"All in all, the book isn't bad. I know some could complain of the language, but I understand that Louise Luna is simply trying to convey Doreen's message in a way true to the character, and it works. Unfortunately, the portrayal of a standoffish, aloof teenager has already been over-capitalized on. It's a bit tired, to tell the truth, and a little formulaic. Personally, I thought Salinger's Holden Caulfield already covered this (in a timeless and universal way), but I guess the voice of disillusioned youth will always have its fans. Rather a female version of \\"The Catcher in the Rye,\\" I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys the sort of book often sponsored by MTV. Not really my cup of joe, but it's not terribly bad.Final note: Be aware that this follows in the footsteps of the Molly Bloom-James Joycean stream-of-consciousness. If you like a nice sequencial chain of events, or things spelled out directly, this isn't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"whatever happened to developing a plot","review":"I went into reading this book with high hopes as it is another book by the same publisher as \\"perks of being a wallflower\\" however...it never seemed to go anywhere and I just waited and waited for something interesting to happen...but oh well...can't get everything you wish for. Not a bad light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm, MTV Had to Make One Mistake","review":"Since MTV started publishing books, I've been following them closely. The Perks of Being a Wallflower holds a place in my heart as my favorite book of all time, as a matter of fact. So, when I saw Brave New Girl and it seemed like a Perks kind of book from the female perspective, I was very excited. How disappointing! Doreen is a bitter character. Events are clear clear clear until the turning point, when everything is described cryptically. And it just spirals downward from there. I guess even MTV had to make a mistake on publishing a book. I know there are better, fresher, more optimistic voices out there. We don't need to have a happy story, but a 14-year-old character who is this jaded and this obscene just isn't necessary. If you're looking for a really good read that is as good as the summary of this one sounds, go for Perks instead. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anything but Brave","review":"I attempted to like this book; I really did.Present in the \\"young urban hipster\\" vein that is anything but passe these days, this MTV work is anything but \\"Brave.\\"The publication review says \\"10-14,\\" but I would never give this to anyone under the age of 15, for this book appears to have been penned with adults in mind.Half the book is full of explexitives which after awhile, become redundant. As for the extreme lack of punctuation, it is very irritating for everything just blends together. The characters speak so alike, the reader can hardly distinguish who is saying what.I kept waiting to find some moment to relate to, but alas, none every came. A great idea, it's a type of She's Come Undone for the teen crowd but the plot and poorly developed characters feel like a watered down, curse-laden episode of Dawson's Creek."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written, I'll give it that","review":"It was well written, i enjoyed reading it, good storyline, it was completely ruined when i looked at the last page, advertising other books from the MTV publisher, it reads \\"More from the young, the hip, and the up-and-coming.\\" which i find completely hypocritical. if you read the book you'd understand. the heroin is completely unhip. and the ad is oozing with hip. it made me mad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I don't understand how someone could possibly say this book was any good.

It provides a broad enough poetry base, so that the average reader can find some poetry that they really connect with and pursue. This volume does that for sure, but in the words of the Hass (the editor) he felt stifled under the structure of the book. He had some interesting ideas about grouping the poems by year, or by the age of the poet. But alas, structure prevails and the poems are in alphabetical order of the author's last name. Is it worth it? Of course it is. Will it blow the top off of your head? Probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go back to previous years, pass on this one","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. I was disappointed in this year's BAP as well. I'm an avid reader of previous collections and was happy to see Rita Dove edit the previous edition, as she seemed to value diversity in gender, ethnicity, and style much more than Haas, who seemed to select more academic, less human works (and as the previous reviewer mentioned, his wife, which I have mixed feelings about). His wife is a wonderful language poet, but really. Overall, a stuffy volume that didn't seem very representative of modern American poetry today.

The main reason is that it is more and more \\"intelectual\\" and smells university. Many poems are well written by today's standards, but that may just be the best way to write a bad poem. A bad poem can be considered good literature, but many good ones were considered in their time bad literature. I didn't buy this book, I read a lot of pages in the store and didn't even find three poems to make me part from my 15 bucks. The other volumes I have just sit in my library and just one or two poems in the 4 volumes I have really hit the score and make want to come back again. Want a good american anthology? Then go fot Alan kaufman's \\"The Outlaw bible of American poetry\\". Another good one is the \\"vintage book of American poetry\\".

The Germans are faced with certain defeat but we get to meet some interesting and caring characters who in a peace time situation might become very close friends.

However I was pleasantly surprised and impressed by the film as it was unlike most conventional war movies, which tend to tell the historical aspect of the war. What this film achieves is to bring the war down to a personal level for the audience. This is done through sensational acting from the whole cast and excellent directing from Ari Taub, who chose to tell the story in both German and Italian, shying away from the commercial idea of using only English (so that American's don't have to read the subtitles). I normally dont like war movies, but this was really interesting. Not your typical shoot em up, big explosions, good guy vs. bad guy film. This film had a lot of heart and the director has created a very refreshing and truthful film that I would recommend anybody to go and see."},{"rating":"1","title":"lousy","review":"From the description on Netflix, I was excited about this movie; it seemed to hold some promise. After 50 minutes or so, I had to turn it off. The music was out of place and corny. The acting was sub par. Was there a plot? If so, it wasn't evident. Very disappointing. I kept waiting for something more, but it never came (and I didn't want to waste any more of my time). Is it a comedy? Is it a parody? It's hard to take this movie seriously.Before renting, be sure to watch the trailer(s). To search for the trailer, look for \\"the fallen 2004 trailer\\".

Now make it fast quick and in a hurry!I will preface my statements by saying I have only seen the pilot episode form the \\"Iron Man -2 disc set\\".This is NOT Iron Man. Tony Stark isn't Peter Parker, nor should his story be ripped from some rejected power-ranger script.

So this really is a bastardization of the original story. Tony Stark as a teen doesnt interest me. In the true stories he is just a rich kid that can appreciate resposibility and that he learns that as an adult; NOT a teen. I will buy the older series as it is true to the storyline. I was interested in this series when I heard about it, but didnt realize later after reviewing that this is the only Iron Man story that conflicts with all others and claims that he had Iron Man armor as a boy. What a load of manure. Especially since it is the only of its kind.

The plot is so simple: Jessica, a super-shy-lesbian-curious found a girlfriend on the ad, she loves her but she doesn't wanna have sex with her. In the end, she goes back to her co-worker which happens to be a guy. That's it! Wanna buy it? Up to you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offbeat romantic comedy","review":"Occasionally, you might hear a woman say she's given up on men. This is a movie about one who tried. Unfortunately, as the title character finds out, certain behaviors are not easy to change.Jessica Stein, tired of bad dates, responds to a \\"Women Seeking Women\\" personal ad out of frustration and winds up in a lesbian relationship. The comedy arises primarily out of her discomfort with this attempt to change her life. Fortunately, this movie rises above gay stereotypes (for the most part) and treats its principal characters as fully developed human beings.There are some imperfections in the movie, and there were sometimes when watching this movie when it seemed unoriginal. But overall, this is a good movie and a different approach to a familiar genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth renting, not buying","review":"I rented this movie with my friend.

KISSING JESSICA STEIN could have been and should have been a funny story about a single woman's sexual confusion and frustration in an inherently confused and frustrated world, but instead we witness Jennifer Westfeldt giggling and ad libbing well beyond mere annoyance as the insecure Jessica Stein. Heather Juergenesen, who co-wrote the script with Westfeldt, plays bisexual Helen Cooper with such ambivalence I felt she would have been more comfortable simply staying behind the typewriter.The story is contrived, the timing between the characters is off, and the ultimate demise of the relationship tacked on as a footnote ending is exasperating. KISSING JESSICA STEIN had potential, then squandered it via unimaginative, one-dimensional, stereotypical storytelling. Kind of like kissing a patch of drywall, but who would want to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lesbian movie that's better suited for straight people.","review":"Yes, Kissing Jessica Stein is a funny, well-acted, and well-written movie. But if your expecting a good lesbian romantic comedy, you'll be disappointed.If you're straight, you'll love this film. If you're a lesbian, you're likely going to have mixed feelings about the movie.In the end, this movie sends a VERY important message to straight audiences: you can't choose your sexual orientation.It's disappointing that Hollywood can't produce a \\"true\\" lesbian film as good a Kissing Jessica Stein. (Those who watch a lot of lesbian films will know what I'm saying.) Why couldn't the writers just made Jessica Stein a lesbian????To sum up: it's a good movie that will leave most lesbians depressed in the end.

Luckily my friend got the tickets and I didn't have to waste my money. This movie was another ... lesbian movie disappointment. I must say that I loved this movie at first. I thought that it was excellent... until about the last 5 to 10 minutes of the movie. The ending ruined the entire movie. Why is it that noone seems to be able to make even one lesbian movie where it ends happily?! If it weren't for the ending I would have gone to see this movie again and bought the DVD when it came out. However, because of the ending I never want to watch this movie again. It enraged me so much that I have been angry about it for the past 3 days! Hopefully now that I've vented I will get over it. If you are looking for a good lesbian movie, skip this one. If you watch the movie right until the end of the brother's wedding and then leave immediately, you will love it.

Well this DVD is a bit like that. In the comentary the women who plays Jessica talks about not trying to make statements about being lesbian or straight. This movie made me angry. Not because I'm so close minded that I can't handle people experimenting but because this movie was advertised as a lesbian film. It is not a lesbian romace. It is a movie about a straight women who experiments with a bisexual women. The focus is on Jessica and who she ends up with and not on Helen. I recomend this movie for straight couples or women as a \\"chick flick.\\" However I do not recomend it to lesbians. It is not the same sex romance it appears to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest gem of a film - real people navigating intimacy in relationships","review":"I really enjoyed this film. It's funny but in a quiet way. I thought the relationship between Jessica and Helen felt real. Except for the portrayals of Jessica's mother and the wacky friend who gives overbearing advice, I felt the film veered away from stereotypes. I liked how the film showed that Jessica's fear of intimacy (with men and women) were the same - her refusal to divulge how Helen has become a part of her life to her mother reminds me of similar situations with straight couples - the man who refuses to introduce his mistress or girlfriend to his mother out of shame. I thought this was a well-written film about relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"'Kissing' is a keeper","review":"When you say 'romantic comedy' you typically think: guy meets girl in cute way, girl and guy face obstacles, girl and guy triumph, a sweeping overture plays. Roll credits.That's not the case of 'Kissing Jessica Stein'. The Jessica in question, is actually straight. However, Helen comes into the mix after Jessica spontaneously answers Helen's 'woman seeking woman' ad, and the two have a earnest relationship that is a bit rocky at first, then soars for awhile, then comes to a halt. I won't ruin the ending, but it recieves mixed reviews. Some like it, some hate it. I personally liked it, as it shows the completion of both Helen and Jessica.The film is a delicious fusion of romantic comedy, lesbian film, Jewish wit and love. It drives forth the idea that we don't know ourselves as much as we think we do, and that love doesn't involve falling for a sex, but a person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kissing Jessica Stein","review":"This movie is terrific in every way. For starters it should not be advertised as a Gay & Lesbian film. It is a brilliant romantic comeny. Jessica Westfelt and Heather Jurgensten steal the show in every scene. Their performances are terrific and the supporting cast do a great job. The two girls wrote the movie themselves and it is perfect. The key behind a good movie is a good story and they have done it. The humour is halerious and it is an all around good and fun film. You can see the fun they had making this movie because it is reflected on the screen.This is a good and funny film in every way. Because it didn't get as much exposure through advertising as other films because of the budget lots of people will miss out on the experience. It just goes to show, you don't need to have a huge budget or media attention (eg.StarWars or Spiderman) to have a great movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"spoiler ahead","review":"This was a pretty good movie, but it was not at all as advertised.

What kind of romance is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought...","review":"Turns out that this film is just another \\"Chasing Amy\\" or \\"Three of Hearts\\" story. Girl get girl, girl loses girl, girl gets guy. In who's universe does this type of thing even happen? This is just another male fantasy film of getting two women in bed together. If you want a good film with a good story try \\"When Night is Falling\\".Thought the film was going to be a comedy but there really isn't much in it to laugh about except the story on a whole. In fact it is rather said how the whole thing plays out. Why's the writer's even bother showing all the struggle of coming out to ones family and having the mother so quickly except things, if she isn't going to spend more than six month's with this woman before going back to a man? It does not make sense and ruins the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie about really finding yourself","review":"I love this movie.

The actresses were pretty, sensual and sexy. The kissing scenes were hysterical. This movie has something for everyone: straights, lesbians, bi-sexuals, Jews and people from Scarsdale. If you fit one of these categories, it's for you. It shows us that you can never know where love can come from nor what form it might take. There is but one thing to hold dear: to thine own self, be true; ok, maybe two: don't take yourself too seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miserable movie either way.","review":"This movie was, hands down, one of the worst I had ever seen. I don't particularly care that Jessica ends up going back to her het life in the end - face it, this does happen. Women DO experiment, and some decide that it isn't for them after all. It's a bit unreasonable to expect sexuality to remain within rigid borders.The problem with this movie was that it was a extremely off. The actresses were terrible, even if they were cute. The dialogue was so horribly timed that I kept feeling as thought I was watching a badly dubbed kungfu flick. I didn't even bother watching the end of it, and even I knew that she was going to go back to the guy in the end.The moral? People who write should stick to writing. People who act should stick to acting. Never the twain shall meet."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVER RATED!","review":"The movie trys too hard and is full of cliches.

Every guy in this movie is either portrayed as angry, or neurotic and clueless about women. Furthermore, the men who are portrayed in a positive light are all gay. I mean, c'mon. I bet the directors and producers all hate men, even if they would not admit it openly. A straight, jewish, New York girl only runs into clueless, idiot straight guys, and as a result, has to turn to lesbianism for fullfillment. Please. Just another example of how much of the entertainment industry is run by women for women, even if its not openly expressed. I guess in a perfect Hollywood world, all the men would be gay and dickless, and talk all day about interior decorating and high art.

I cheered for the characters in their explorations of themselves. The character of Jessica Stein perfectly brings out the neurosis of sexual exploration, and in doing so gives people a real feel of what it's like to want to try to do something different in life. Although this film explores sexuality, it still is a film about women, written by women, therefore a lot of the nuances are real and very spot on.

Poor packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini Moos","review":"The product arrived several days after the date I had been told it would arrive. The outer packing box was damaged. The inner box, the Mini Moos box looked as though it had been opened and taped back shut with clear packing tape. When looking in the box, it was obvious that several of the Mini Moos has had been opened, or broke in transit as the inside of the box was sticky and rather messy. The count on the box read 188 but in reality there were only 160 and that was including the empty containers. While checking it out, we also discovered the sell by date was more than three months ago.he inner box with the product looked as though it had been opened, the sell by date had already passed and many of the Mini Moos had either been opened or broke open in transit and spilled all over the box. Although we like Land-o-Lakes products this was a disappointing mess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Land O' Lakes Half n Half Creamers","review":"These creamers are the perfect solution to have at work in your desk so you don't have to use that horrible powdered stuff that the office provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference for CNEs and CNA out there","review":"Good book but lacks detailed info on Netscape Fast track web server.

Extremely wordy, repetitive, regularly travels half-way around the world to get across the street. Exhaustive in its treatment of trivial details (like how to expand an NDS container) while lightly skipping over complex subject matter (like partitioning). The only good thing I could say about this book is the design and outline of its contents and the effort exerted in filling in the details seem to be well matched, both of them quite low. Would not recommend this book for anyone unless they are an incurable insomniac -- this is the cure.

Covering the first seventy five years of the Toronto Transit Commission, Mike skims the surface, offering up an anecdote from each year in the system's history. There's plenty of good photographs to boot. Few maps and no track plans, but it's a worthy addition to any railfan's shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read (just ignore the cheesy title)","review":"I'm not too familiar with the gothic romance genre, which is pretty much looked down upon by snooty readers, but if they are all written like Barbara Michaels I'm all for them. This book worked for me. It is witty, well-paced, has a clever plot, and most importantly, is believable notwithstanding its batty premise of a modern-day witches' coven deep in Upper Middle-Class America. A reader looking for \\"horror\\" is bound to be disappointed, because Ms Michaels is not out to terrorise her readers or scare them silly. Which is fine with me, because I prefer stories which are moved by real human agents who face up to challenges and grasp their destinies, rather than tales popoulated by terrified pawns of the supernatural. An easy and thoroughly enjoyable read. Not too much stress on the little grey cells, but neither are we required to suspend our disbelief."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not dark, but good","review":"The book is not as dark as I would've expected.

It garnished Hallie Berry with her Academy Award and I must admit she did a fantastic job, however this movie is not something I would see again. The performances are good and even Peter Boyle is a standout. Hallie tries hard and performs very well.Billy Bob Thorton is also a deep performer in this piece. Coupled with a really weird town and a really backwards thinking community - this movie shows the harsh realities of prejudice, love, hate and rivalry among a father who doesn't love his son and a son who loves his father.I wouldn't recommend this for the faint of heart and it has a real depressing theme - even Hallie's own child gets a strange twist. Overall the DVD doesn't have a lot of extra features but it does have few trailers of some better films. I was disappointed in this and wasn't quite expecting what I saw. I rented it because this is not a film I would buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not believable","review":"how could a poor black woman (halle berry) fall in love with a racist corrections officer (billy bob thornton) who took part in the execution of her husband (p. diddy)? it is hard to believe hollywood would present this ...as a sentimental romance. just think, halle berry won an oscar for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oscar for Halle??","review":"It's becoming so obvious that the Oscars are political. Totally Political. I believe Halle Berry is a very talented actress and have enjoyed her performances in the past but this film left me empty. The story, while dealing with serious subject matter, was comrpomised with a thin thin story. Billy Bob Tornton merely showed up, Halle Berry was forced to overact to make up for a zero character and the explicit yet boring sex scene was a cheap ploy to get audiences into the theaters. Quite simply, a waste of time for the audience and an Oscar for Halle Berry in a performance that should be an embarrassment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"There were moments where this film interested me, but otherwise I found myself wondering why Halle got an Oscar for this role, or more importantaly-- why this film was so acclaimed. After watching the credits role I decided it was because of the sex scene; \\"taboo\\" lust, if you will. The plot was weak and the ending left me hanging."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unintentionally funny movie of the year!","review":"While watching this I was reminded of a conversation I had with a friend of mine. He had watched a horrible made for TV movie in which the dramatic climax was a wheelchair bound man screaming while being pushed into a swimming pool.Both movies try to make you feel for their characters and end up failing horribly. In the scene where Halle Berry vents her frustrations by abusing her son. She yells at him about his obesity and tells him not to eat any more candy. When she leaves the room the boy removes a candy bar from under a pillow. I broke out laughing, not at the action, but at the fact that this was the movie that roger ebert picked as the best film of the year. In any other movie that WOULD have been a joke.The other flaw of the movie is that it uses racial tension as a theme, but does nothing with it of any significants, the movie would have been the same if Berry's character was white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schizoid","review":"This movie has three thing going for it: it's cinematography, its moody soundtrack (which mostly worked well with the visuals) and that interestingly-shot sex scene. Otherwise, the characters and plot were frankly laughable. As a character-driven film, my DVD player has more character. It was really just style over substance, which wouldn't have been as bad if the film didn't take itself so seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissapointment","review":"This movie was one that I had been waiting to see. I should have waited longer. Halle Berry was good -- but not good enough for an oscar for sure. Just because she is in a race related drama, breaks down when her son dies, and has at least a 5 minute soft-core porn scene with Billy Bob doesn't make the role deserving of best actress. Sissy Spacek (In the Bedroom) and Nicole Kidman (Moulin Rouge) were both more deserving. Overall, I don't think the movie served a point. I have seen plenty of race-related dramas -- this one taught me nothing I didn't know already. Seeing it just made me dissapointed in Halle Berry (and her need for some raunchy scenes) and the oscars in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"That sound you hear is the glass ceiling shattering...","review":"hail, hail, halle, on her magnificent accomplishment, on the being the first black actress in the 74 year history of the oscars to win best actress. and this performance is definately a 360 from anything she has done in her 11 years in hollywood. in fact, one who watches this film may do a double take to see if it is really her, that she was capable of conveying such emotion and depth. the interracial romance with billy bob thornton is daring, to say the least. interracial relationships are always controversial, an interracial relationship set down south is like pouring gasoline on a campfire. seems like over the past year hollywood has become more open minded about making interracial movies. i have seen 3 in the past year ( save the last dance, crazy/beautiful, and \\"O\\".) halle's and denzel's triumph will no doubt inspire other minority actors and artists to raise their talents a notch, to bring out the best in their work..."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE I HAVE EVER SEEN!","review":"THIS MOVIE WAS THE WORST I HAVE EVER SEEN.

Need to watch \\"Sleepless in Seattle\\" to cancel it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a winner","review":"I'm sorry but I found nothing worthwile about this movie. It to me is just another film about a dysfunctional family. Thorton's charcter seemed to be more upset about the whole in the chair after his son kills himself in front of him than about what had just happened in front of him and when his father makes a nasty comment about his new love interest that he finds offensive he conviently puts \\" Old Dad\\" in a home. This movie is supposed to be close to real life? Aren't there enough dysfunctional familes already, why does Hollywood think we need see them on the big screen?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my time back!!","review":"I would like my two hours back.... But I guess I have got the same chances of that happening as Hollywood making a non-politically correct movie. This movie was so PC and so boring that it made me ill. To start, they tried to make us feel sorry for P. Diddy's character but failed to tell us why he was executed so that we may instead feel sorry for the victims of his crime. I went into the movie thinking Halle Barry's was a great actress, I was wrong! Her acting was perhaps the worst I have ever seen from her. I guess having committed a hit-and-run herself she couldn't know how it would feel to be on the other side of the wheel. If one good thing came from this movie it was the relief that I rented rather than buying this horrible movie.

I could forgive the rear entry sex scene from the son with a hooker, then Billy Bob about does the same(the hooker bends over nude, but he decides not to go ahead.), but when Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry do the same for an unusually long period of time on screen, that is over the top for respected actors. She got an award?? I thought the no-name actors did the gratuitous things like rear entry worthy of porn. You could watch this by yourself for self-gratification, but nothing else.

You have to earn your oscar not be pushed by the NAACP because no blacks have been chosen yet (I think Will Smith deserved the fist black male oscar for \\"Enemy of the State\\"). For example, while Queen Latifah was just as good as Katherine Zeta-Jones in \\"Chicago\\", Katherine has been in a lot more films and is more distinguished. Same with Nicole Kidman rightfully beating Renee Zellweager (Sp?). I think this film was totally overrated and the story is boring and predictable.

When I saw that X-RATED scene between Berry and Thorton, it turned my stomache! It literally caused me to loss all of my RESPECT for Hallie Berry, and I haven't watched any of her movies ever since. I felt that what was done in this film was just appalling--and to recieve an Academy Award for a PART LIKE THIS!?. Of course I expect others will differ in their oppinion; but that \\"love scene\\" was STRAIGHT UP PORN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got to finish it","review":"I'm sure this was a great movie, but it kept freezing and getting stuck after the 6th or 7th time of restarting it I gave up and never got to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halle Berry 's ocsar winning performance PLEASE!!!!","review":"This was a horrible movie. The plot was simplitic at best.It was going all over the place. None of it made sense. Halle Berry is a one note actress at best. Is it just me or does she play the same part in every movie. She needs to stick to playing crack heads like she did in some of her earlier movies and then at least you see some dimension in her performance. I have talked to atleast twenty people who have seen this movie and did not understand it. Whoever directed this fluff should have lemon juice squeezed in his eye. I am not hating on the sex scene in this movie... After all that's what she got the oscar for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure raunch - not worth a single star","review":"Halle Berry has mortgaged her dignity and probably her career in this should be X-rated loser-fest. Billy Bob Thornton also continues to spiral downhill with his poor choice of starring roles. If your want to see Halle Berry, ... then check it out. Otherwise dump it."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE stuff!","review":"Honestly, there aren't enough to words to describe how bad Monster's Ball is, and how undeserving of an Oscar that hack Halle Berry was. Terrible acting, half-hearted plot, a white knight rushing in to save the po' nigra woman - and let's not get started on how a born-and-bred racist can change in about 48 hours, all because he had sex with a black woman. PLEASE! There was a black woman who deserved an Oscar nod for her riveting role in a movie that year, all right - her name was Nona Gaye, and she was magnificent in \\"Ali.\\" But why award a black woman playing a strong, dignified role that required actual acting skills when we can give it to someone engaging in shrieking, crying, and raw sex (and UNNEEDED raw sex) at that? Hey, is it possible to give this movie zero stars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"This movie ends up flat. The numerous sex scences seem their just to push the envelope of an R movie verses a porn movie. Few of the characters or plots are explored. It is hard to agree with other reviewers who mention that the movie is just smart, not needing to explain everything. If that is true, why the numerous sex scenes? I can't recommend this movie to anyone. Monster's Ball fullfills the notion that movies critics enjoy what the average viewer will despise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"Luckily, I did not spend the money to buy this movie on DVD. It was on TV so we watched it because it had gotten so much hype.I did not enjoy the movie at all. Found it to not have much of a story plot and to be rather boring actually.Halle Berry did not give an Oscar-winning performance in the movie, and Billy Bob Thornton gave his usual monotone performance.Found it hard to believe that it took to the end of the movie for her to find out that he had something to do with putting her husband to death, and that the movie ended with them just sitting on the back porch looking up to the sky."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"Quite possibly the most tedious film I have seen, I am utterly mystified by the hype surrounding it. The acting is wooden and not believable - both Thornton and Berry have done far better in other roles - and the story, while professing to be a gritty and realistic drama, is more like a cynical attempt to introduce sensitive issues such as race and the death penalty in order to make the film seem like a social commentary rather than a shallow and boring look at 2 unbelievable and hypocritical characters. Simply put, save your money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent Something Else! Not worth the money","review":"While this movie does address real issues, and I'm sure that some of the things that happen to the characters in this movie could happen in real life, this movie is defiantely over rated. I don't see how the critics see this as a great film. If you ask me it was more about sex and abuse (in many forms) than it was anything else. If I could, I wouldn't even give this movie one star. It was more of a x-rated flick than it was a drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste of Film","review":"I like all the actors in this movie, with such talent, I thought it would be a great movie.

Sorry I wasted my time watching this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"If packaging and price are an indicator, Monster's Ball is not worthy of your time or money. It's the same story, a poor black man executed in the Deep South and we are supposed to feel for him and his family. Anyone could have written this story. Monster's Ball is not The Green Mile. Why did Halle Berry win an Oscar for her performance? She's worthy of an Oscar for Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, not Monster's Ball. There had to have been another reason because her acting wasn't the reason. Maybe it was because of her sex scene with Billy Bob? Or maybe the Academy felt it was her turn. Lion's Gate known for 'B at best' movies, didn't spend a cent to include a program insert. I guess it was to keep the price down, or maybe they agree Monster's Ball wasn't worth the cost. Cost, cheap but not cheap enough. Thank goodness Bill Bob Thornton kept us interested. This film is rated R for sex and judicial violence. Not recommended for young audiences. Pass on it and get the Green Mile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash....","review":"Monster's Ball is a terrible movie. Oscar....yeah right..it must have been for that crazy ... scene that was really unecessary. Halle Berry should have won this award for Dorthy Dandridge...this movie was trash ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely overrated","review":"Tragic and dramatic in that \\"beat the viewer over the head\\" way. About as subtle as Kelsey Grammer is these days. Thornton does a better job than Berry - but sadly, I am not always sure that he is acting in this one. Berry has one fine scene in a truck, but when you can catch a 60 sec. sequence and say:\\"oh, she was really good there,\\" that's not Oscar worthy. BTW: The sex scene really does not deserve the attention it received. Rent only."},{"rating":"2","title":"It isn't easy to watch . . . so?","review":"The person I saw this film with was turned off because it was \\"depressing\\". My response to that was, \\"so what?\\" Life isn't always fun-filled and wonderful. Maybe some people see movies to escape; I see them to journey into situations that don't often touch my reality. Because of the wonderful performances by Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry (and even Sean Combs), this movie was very true-to-life and revealing. I'm no fool: I know that racial tensions run deep in the southern USA, but this film makes it more real to me than it ever has been. The end of this film, I think, is very thought-provoking and haunting. It's difficult to know what she's thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Fans of Billy Bob will enjoy this movie, and people will probably buy it for Halle Berry's Academy Award-winning performance. The steamy bedroom scenes will attract some viewers. All in all, the movie has a slightly manic quality. Halle Berry plays the role of convict's wife and bereaved mother without much gradation, and comes across as slightly hysterical throughout. (Her acceptance speech at the Awards seemed a continuation of this \\"take\\".) Billy Bob plays a phlegmatic, decent man who has his own memory-demons to conquer. The movie is diverting but fails to satisfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Disappointed","review":"I thought the movie was going to be something fantastic since Halle had won an award for it. But it was a big disappointment and the sex scene that I had heard so much about was not great. Everyone in the movie in my opinion did poor acting. And the ending was ......... there are not enough words to describe what a disappointment this movie was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"halle is awful and loose","review":"man this movie could have rocked but halle kinda ruined it for me .i mean she is a horrible actor and her false preformance combinded with her loose desision to get nude gave off a sour aroma to the whole film. she deserved the oscar but certainitly not for this movie. Do not buy this is all you want is to see halle because her preformance doesnt live up to anything. Absolutly awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster Disaster","review":"This movie is awful. It's about a racist white man who becomes open-minded after knocking boots with a crazy Black woman. How inspiring. Halle Berry- the most overrated Black actress in history- wins an Oscar for her role as Leticia. Whoop-dee do. Then she dedicates the Oscar to Dorothy Dandridge. I'm sure Dorothy turned in her grave when she heard that. Any self-respecting woman in her right mind would have never done what Halle Berry did. But who needs respect when you have tons of money, right? Anyway, this movie is awful and is probably enjoyable to those who reminisce about the good ole days when black women were sexually exploited against their will by white men. I'm sure Adrien Brody enjoyed it because he had to get a piece of the action when he kissed Halle Berry on stage. Halle Berry should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leontyne Price is a better singer than Britney","review":"Leontyne Price is a better singer than Spears.This is a hideous movie about racism. It includes a far-too graphic sex scene. Berry actually won an Oscar for this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What the Hell is this????","review":"This movie is a porn movie and that is it. No story. No good acting. No clothing. NO BRAINS!! This is this most dumbest movie ever and that is why I lost five dollars. This is a waste of your money and that's all. I mean I would rather watch The ring over and over cause it is better than this movie. I hope that they take back Halle Berry's oscar because she didn't do to well in this. I mean I could get an oscar for just standing here and looking dumb. So save your self a whole lot of money and watch something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tries too hard","review":"Monster's Ball is definitely one of the most contreversial of last year. The film's performers are all at the top of their game, especially Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton, even Sean \\" Puff Daddy\\" Combs does a fine job. The only problem with it is that all the tragic events and mishaps are plugged into the first two halfs of the film. And when the final act comes around you almost feel cheated, or disillusioned because the sheer power of the first two acts are absent. You almost feel as if the film should have been finished awhile ago. Still for most of the way through this was a great movie, definiteley among the top ten of last year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Halle Berry is incredible!","review":"I just saw this movie yesterday. I have to say that this si probably the best-acted film I have seen in a long time. Everyone was so believable, and Halle Berry is definately worthy of an oscar for this role. The film is about an african-american woman named, Leticia (Berry)and she is having a hard time coping with the death of her son and husband, and she can barely pay the rent to her apartment. That all changes when she meets Hank (Thorton), and they get into a good relationship. However, things soon change, but I will not spoil anything else. You should see it, it's great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent for my eyes...","review":"I only got through about a third of this movie and then I had to turn it off. Way too violent. Objectively the acting is good, if it affected me this much. But I can't watch a half hour of intense child abuse and racism and other [stuff] without feeling queasy. Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thornton must have been good in it, because I absolutely *hated* both of them after the first 20 minutes of the movie and didn't care what happened to them. OR maybe they were good actors but the plot was too intense. I found out later that something terrible happens to Halle Berry and is supposed to make you feel sympathy for her, but I never felt any. The two of them are a couple of monsters and deserve every bit of their misery. So, you decide...if you have a strong, strong stomach and can get through the first half of the movie, then stick with it. Otherwise, do like me and go rent a disney movie instead. I get enough [stuff] every night from the evening news."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film isn't even worth reviewing...","review":"All I want to say is, Billy Bob Thornton and Heath Ledger both deserve 5 BRILLIANT stars for their performances. I'm sorry, but Halle Berry brought my rating down to a star. The storyline is worth another star. Hence, two stars is my rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie I have ever seen","review":"The main problem I have with this film is that there is no point. It starts out with Heath Ledger having a runin with a prostitute and it never gets any better than that. I watched the Oscars when Halle won and I thought that I would give this movie a try. I rented it and brought it home to watch with my parents. I am 21 years old and I was embarrassed at the unneccesary nudity and pointlessness of this movie. Save yourselves some time and do not rent/watch/buy this movie. Halle definately did not desreve an Oscar for this terrible film."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE GOT AN OSCAR FOR THIS?","review":"This may have been the most overrated, predictable, and unbelievable story I have ever seen on the screen before! And to think that Halle Berry actually received an Academy Award for this junk?Perhaps the Academy's members cast their lots for the greatest body of the year instead of the best performance (THERE I would have to agree with them - she is a stunningly beautiful woman).Save your money (and about 2 hours of your time) - this movie doesn't even merit a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this film","review":"Producers in this film attempt to answer for western societies increasing growth of interacial marriages and dating. Airy music fits the seen for this movie well because the script is way out there. I had a really hard time understanding the plot. Most annoying was the music which played almost more then intellectual script. Sean Puffy Combs plays the black guy who is in jail for what ever reason I never caught. Billy Bob Thorton plays a racist who has taste for the wife of a guy he helped execute. Film shows a bird flying the coup when this interacial couple gets intimate. Producers were genius because they were able to give audience a bad taste in their mouths and an airy space in their heads after watching this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I give this movie one star for Hally Berry's wonderful performance. However, other than that this movie will bore you to death. It contains one of Hollywood's favorite story line, Southern rascists. This movie is a throw-back to another time in the South. We would appreciate it if Hollywood would take notice that the South has changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie.","review":"I wouldn't recommend it to anyone I like. It got me very depressed at the end. I hate the plot , the story and everything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"monster's ball... who knew?","review":"This movie above all was really poorly made. It has real family issues and a heavy porno flick all rolled into one. If your up for a decent movie look somewhere else, looking for sex in movies, then this movie is for you.The title almost had nothing to do with the movie. There was no monsters or a ball I could find throughout the entire time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harsh tale of character development","review":"Most couples break up after they've lost a child. Grief and blame so easily destroy even the best of relationships. It's odd to see a diverse pair of people come together over the loss of their sons, overcoming age, race, and the South itself to do so.This is definitely not a film I'd want to see again. It's stark, harsh, and brutal at its worst and painful even in the better parts. Still, it was well-done by both Thornton and Berry and Berry definitely deserved her Oscar for her performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow--what a tough movie.","review":"Any movie that opens with an anal sex scene between a man and a prostitute is bound to be tough, but this movie takes graphic sex and violence, racism and misogyny, life and death to whole new levels of gritty reality. The story was excellent. The acting was excellent. However, while the ending turns out to OK, this is certainly not the feel-good movie of the year. It is an excellent portrayal of one man trying to rise above the cess pool of his life. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"To understand the movie, you have to have some kind of understanding of where it coming from. you have to be able to relate in some way. Or at least be able to empathize with those in their positions. I was able to do just that. Growing up in the south and seeing for myself the invisible line that divides the races and the cultural taboo of interracial relationships brought the film closer to home for me. I think it was excellently done. Halle Berry's role was deep and hard to play and she did very well. She deserved any award and recognition she got her performance. Great movie! I do agree, however, that the ending did disappoint me. It would have added a great dramatic climax if they had explored Halle's finding out about Billy Bob's involvement in her husband's execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't deserve the hype","review":"This movie was extremely overhyped!Yes blacks have been discriminated against in the past and there are alot of worthy black actors and actresses who have been unjustly overlooked for past academy awards.However by giving the best actress award to Halle Berry I can only come to the conclusion that she recieved this award because she's black!Denzel earned his on talent alone.Halle was given hers based on skin color and this is not the way to make up for past injustices."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally Wrenching and Captivating","review":"This the most emotionally stirring film I've ever seen. It is less about racism, and more about the desperate lives of the well drawn characters. There hasn't been a better acted movie released in years. The performances are keenly done. Monster's Ball can be difficult to watch at times. Your heart will break, you will laugh, cry, scream, and walk out of the theater a different person. Go out of your way to see this movie. It is one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgustingly Bad","review":"In a word, Terrible. Resulting in a total disrespect for Halle Berry. Her acting is poor, as usual. The movie is lacking in plot and believability. And Halle Berry IS NOT representive of good Black actresses, the ones who've been overlooked and truly deserve recognition for jobs well done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving","review":"This movie left such a bad taste in my mouth that I'm compelled to write an online review. Jeezz....talk about manipulation! This \\"film\\" is full of \\"plot points\\" that are supposed to move the story to its ultimate \\"happy-ending\\" conclusion. Instead, I felt maniplated and cheated. Halle Berry basically receives all of her acclaim from being physically beautiful. To me, she is always \\"acting\\"--nothing in this perfromance is real. It's all about screaming and crying---the stuff that Academy Voters adore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great...","review":"This film could have been great. The acting is flawless andthe story itself quite remarkable. The sex scenes are sointensely graphic that the pleasure of watching the film islost; in short watching such scenes makes one feel like aPeeping Tom!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic but well acted.","review":"This film is dramatic, tragic, and all out depressing. But the acting is what steals the show. Halle Barry deserved the Oscar, and the film will be remembered. Not the best. If you are in the mood for happiness, skip this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"Ok, let me start with the fact that I felt let down a bit because of all the hype. And if Halle Berry deserved an oscar than so did Billy Bob Thorton.Billy Bob plays a racist, ... parent and prison guard who learned his ideals form his racist, ... father. He sees the light and runs into Halle and forms an attachment to her. The rest, so they say, is history. While Halle's performance is very good I feel that Billy Bob's was more of a progressive character study through changes and issues.And the ending left something unresolved (in my opinion). The hype was worth more than the movie. It drug a little but was a good character study if you could stand the pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Halle Berry and Billy Bob Thorton drew me in.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Initially, I found many of the flaws in the characters left me indifferent, but unable to turn away. I began to care about their lives and what would happen to them. The reformation of both Hank and Latecia could not have been accomplished in my opinion without them establishing an emotional bond. Their physical encounter restored their humanity and in the process their intimacy made them tender. I could not believe the two people I saw at the end of the film were the same ones introduced to us at the beginning. Kudos to Halle Berry for a brilliant performance, and to Billy Bob Thorton for making me a fan of his quiet intensity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow wow wow wow","review":"I'm late to the party on this one, but this is probably the best film I've seen this year. Billy Bob Thorton and Halle Berry are smokin' in this oddly original tale. That's the most realistic love scene I've seen in a Hollywood movie. The score is astonishingly great. Fits the emotionally charged scenery to a T! The racist father is great acting personified. The ending is perfectly balanced. We don't know how it's going to turn out until the last few seconds. I cannot recommend this movie highly enough. I don't know why I'd never seen this before. Even Puff Daddy is good as the condemned man!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster's Drawl Y'all","review":"I found this film to be repulsive. I also find it hard to believe Halle Berry (The Flintstones, B.A.P.S) won an Oscar for this. Her performance was blaringly flawed, and her portrayal of a \\"ghetto hootchie mama\\" was exaggerated and offensive. The storyline in Monster's Ball is also redundant. How many movies do they have to make about prejudice in the south? We get the point! This movie was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a zero star rating? ; Not if they payed me.","review":"Like American Beauty, Monster's Ball had its cast, crew, and studio kiss critical posterior to hide its less-than stellar actuality and place itself among the oscars...Monster's Ball can't even scrounge up the mediocrity of a stereotypical movie...The entire film plays like Mississippi Burning for the mentally and culturally imapired. This movie should be immolated in front of the Hollywood sign ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rx for Depression and hopelessness","review":"This is the first movie I have ever walked out on. What starts out as depressing continues on to go down hill in emotions from there. The only likeable characters are dead within the first hour of the film. One tragedy after another until there is no hope left. The so called \\"hot\\" sex scene is so needy and desperate that that was it for my boyfriend and I. So sad-definately not a \\"feel good\\" movie.Don't know how it ends, that is true, but could not bear another minute of the desperate depressions aroused by watching it as long as I did.I was amazed about the Oscar. The whole story seemed so contrived to me. Halle probably did the best she could with the subject matter............"},{"rating":"1","title":"High School Creative Writing","review":"... That's this movie.The characters are not well developed, and many of their actions appear to be inconsistent with what we learn about them. I got the feeling the plot was developed with a Magic 8 Ball. What happens next? Ask the question, shake the ball and look at the answer. In this case, I stopped caring what happened next.The nudity is not full frontal but the sex scenes are explicit enough to make me uncomfortable seeing them with my grown daughter in the room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be a sexist..","review":"If it weren't for Halle's beautiful naked body, this movie would be a total piece of .... Why did she win a oscar anyway? It had to be the sex (sorry Halle,) but I could name three other films that she was better in: How about \\"Losing Isaiah\\" wasn't she better in that film? And even \\"Boomerang\\" was better than this movie. However, I will watch Monsters Ball again, but I will fast forward the movie to my favorite parts...and that is a shame because she is a good actress...the only reason I watch this movie: Halle naked!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully made, compelling movie","review":"I went to see this movie with an attitude of taking my medicine. I knew it was supposed to be very well done but I did not expect it to be emotionally satisfying. While it contained scenes that were brutal emotionally, it was quite compelling right up to the end, and surprisingly worked well as a love story. I understand why some reviewers are saying this is the best movie of the year. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"3.5 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:An intense look at the lives of two characters, Monster's Ball is raw and brutal but possessed of great truth; though the movie is certainly not for everyone, it features two intense and nuanced performances along with a conclusion that goes so counter to expectations (yet fits so well) that it deserves mention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably BAD","review":"I cannot believe Halle Berry won an academy award for this crap. This was one of the worst films I have ever seen. It has no plot, terrible acting, no pacing. It just goes on and on, with meaningless scenes interupted only by meaningless sex. ...

Barre's performance is totally unwatchable, but then the entire movie is unwatchable. I watched it out of pure curiosity and regretted it. It only proved one thing to me.....that movies like this are why I stick with the classics. May God forgive me for even thinking about watching such a low class, evil production.

I thought that the dialog was terrible. They mumbled through most of the movie. Giving this movie one star is about 2 star's too many. I have had root canals that were less painful. I was embarrassed for Halle when she begged Billy Bob to \\"make her feel good\\" and for Billy Bob when he threw his father out of the house to make room for his new girlfriend. And do you ever see the chemistry between the two of them? One has to wonder if he really had feelings for her if he felt guilty for all the racism that ran in his family. One also has to wonder about his son and the prostitute that they both used. What was the point?Skip this movie. Shrek was WAY better. Moulin Rouge was better. Monsters, Inc was better. Even Dude Where's my Car? was better."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"I should have known that this was a bad movie as soon as I saw who Halle's husband was portrayed by.

In The Killing Art, protagonist Kate McKinnon must re-invent herself in the glamorous art world of New York City. But just as she begins to take comfort in her new existence, she is drawn back to her past as an NYPD Detective and finds herself on the trail of a serial killer.The thing that I find most fascinating and satisfying about Santlofer's work is the way he incorporates his inside knowledge of the art world into every page. His use of his own paintings as clues is both unique and brilliantly enticing. Before embarking on his career as an author, Santlofer was already a well-known painter. His symbiotic merging of the two art forms creates a product that is addictive to say the least.Donna Carrick"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy From This Company!","review":"I would rank them with negative stars if I could!!!I purchased this item from Allegro Enterprises Inc. and when it didn't arrive for several weeks, I purchased something else.

She does so with flare, as does the author Merrie Koester Southgate. I saw this book at the CAST (Science Teachers Convention.

I bought it at an NSTA convention five years from the author and have used it every year since. The story is entertaining, but at the same time teaches my 5th graders about choosing a science fair topic, completing research, presenting to judges, and designing controlled experiments. I have developed activities and discussions from the suggested lesson plans in the back of the book. The most valuable part of this book is the idea that students should choose a topic about which they have a real interest.

The science fair has so much amusement in it. Because you have to pick it out and have to do the project. Well there is this teacher in the book that is really funny and she is Mrs.Pflumm.

This author examines why the S&L situation happened. The answers he uncovers do not paint the picture that the politicians want us all to think too much about. Basically the Federal government changes the rules in relation to capital requirements for S&L based on pressure from contributors and a Reagan policy of deregulate everything. Once that happened the mess started. The biggest mistake the government made was deregulating a business that they were on the hook for if they went under. The vast majority of S&L's were actually doing fine until even more regulation came out regarding capital requirements - all in all the politicians had as much to do with the issue as the bankers. The book is much better at explaining this then me, if you are interested in the topic or would like to broaden your understanding of the issues I would start here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Austin Powers movie yet.","review":"I've seen all of the Austin Powers movies, and this one I think is the funniest so far.

Man, Austin Powers NEVER gets old to me! When this movie comes out I am definantly going to buy it! One thing that dissapoints me is that some people are giving this movie a low rating because they say it has to many of the same jokes. If you think about it, they are the same, but in much of a different way. I think that everyone should love this movie and go deep inside it and find every little piece of humor stuck in it!

This movie adds nothing to its predecessors except for a lot of sentimentality, one suspects to attract the greater American public and their almighty dollars.The humor resorts to the bathroom and below in an effort to come up with a few laughs.Maybe he should change his name to Austin Texas. There wasn't much in the way of Power here...A waste of money: wait for the TV reruns if you really have to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"please... this was awful","review":"This movie was nothing but joke after joke. The first to Austin Powers movies were funny, but they also had decent story line. Austin 3 has a weak story line and the bathroom jokes were utterly wrong.

But when I saw it I was really dissapionted. First of all it was no where near as funny as the first two films were.The characters are getting worn out and the new character goldmember is a horribe and dissgusting adition to the group.Plus whoever thought of putting beyonce Knowles in the picture must have not been feeling well that day. She is a terrible actress, is not funny and is nowhere near as good looking as Elizebeth Hurley or Heather Graham.

Good Movie, Okay DVD","review":"This isn't a review about the actual movie, but the DVD itself. The Austin Powers Movie: Goldmember, was wonderful and very funny. However, the DVD does not live up to the movie. The DVD has several wonderful features in it: The Infinifilm opition which allows you to watch the movie and access speical features that tells you about how the movie was made and the concept of everything. However, there were several features in the DVD that made the DVD worse. First off, unlike most DVD's the DVD was in the Full Screen Version, which cuts off part of the movie itself. Second off, the movie doesn't have subtitles at all, which makes it hard for anyone that can't hear well or that don't know English to watch the movie.Pros:It's Austin PowersInfinifilm FeaturesCons:No SubtitlesFull Screen Version"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mojo is gone.","review":"Loved the first two movies, the third is a complete bust.

Apart from this, I think that the plot could have been a lot better: the movie just doesn't seem to proceed right after the opening scenes (which I think are great by the way) I also got the impression that the producers have 'borrowed' too much from the first two movies, which made me feel like I was watching a new version of the the second Austin Powers movie... Many jokes from the first two movies are 'revised'... Also, I think that the new Goldmember character has not contributed much to the movie and is more like bizarre than funny...All in all, I would recommend you to buy the the first two Austin Powers movies which are much funnier than this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, and one more thing...","review":"(My previous review was titled \\"THIS DVD IS GARBAGE\\")You cannot use the \\"scan\\" function, either.

Grrrrr!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not funny....","review":"Goldmember is the epitome of the tired, recycled, over-produced garbage that Hollywood puts out specifically for the sake of fast food tie-ins. There's hardly an original moment in the entire movie. This fact must not have escaped the writers, because it's brought up in a joke or two (which seems like a way to cover up thier laziness). As for Beyonce's acting, well I'm happy to say she didn't embarrass herself. Not that it matters. She could have been completely edited out and you would still have virtually the same film. The only reason I can come up with her being there is to sell movie tickets, dvd's, soundtracks, and so on. Anyway, if you're one of the lucky few who haven't seen this movie I'd recommend keeping it that way. But if you still feel that you must, do yourself a favor and rent it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Straight from the Devil's Torture Pit.....","review":"Most reviewers of this dreck start off by saying \\"I loved the first movie but...\\". I don't give this series of filmed train wrecks that much credit. The first one hurt my eyes and brain, the second one was completely unwatchable and this one is just plain evil. It is like the writers thought \\"the last one was full of stupid jokes, lets pour alot more into the third version of the same story!\\" Bad idea.It is a sad commentary on how inept comedy film writers have become; to create an unfunny waste of a film like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a laugh, Try this one out","review":"Wow, for the second time I went to see \\"Austin Power's in Goldmember\\" and let me say if you want a comedy, this is one for the ages, I feel this is the best out of the three Austin Power's movies, Mike Myers, just lights up the screen as Austin Powers, Dr.Evil, Fat Bastard, and Newcomer Goldmember. Old faviortes and new delights come into this film, I was laughing out loud non-stop throughout the whole movie, Yes I will admit this movie is not softcore humor, This has a lot of sex jokes and a lot of sick humor, So I would not recommend this to the kids, I am 19 and I loved it. This movie also includes a lot of Cameo's by Britany Spears, Tom Cruise, John Travolta, and a lot more, If you don't like comedy's this movie will change your mind, It has good replay value, I have seen it twice and I still laugh just as hard as the first time. Do yourself a favor and go to this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too raunchy and self-congratulatory","review":"The brilliance of the first Austin Powers is almost completely lost in this sequel, unfortunately. The rip-roar laughs are raunchy, not clever (as before), and the characters are steeped in self-congratulatory amusement. This is Austin Powers dumbed down. Save your money on this one, but long live Austin Powers of old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haven't I seen this movie before?","review":"It's truly official. Austin has completely lost his mojo. The jokes are so repetitive that even the actors look bored telling them. We get the same old catch-phrases thrown at us again and again. If this doesn't bother you - and you just love Austin to death, then by all means see this movie.For me, it's gotten really old. The characters seem lost for anything original to do. The cameos in the movie are entertaining, and I do wonder if this movie would have suffered without them. AP3 is not a horrible movie by any means. I found myself laughing at times, but the true laughs are few and far between.I still need someone to tell me what is so funny about Mini-Me. A really small guy getting getting objectified and physically abused for 90 minutes. Yeah, what a knee-slapper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first two","review":"This movie is just not as funny as the first two. In addition, somehow number 2 is back, even though he died in the first movie. Austin Powers's father has a hatred for Dutch people that the movie doesn't explain. There is an attempt to get as many actors in this movie as possible. I regret not seeing this movie in the theater because I would not have bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest of all the Austin Powers!","review":"This movie is #2 on the movies I laughed at the most, the first is \\"Jackass the Movie\\" which was so so funny! This movie was really really funny. The jokes were kind of raunchy and pushed too far, but they left me in stitches! Check out this really really funny movie that is just too good, that I can't review it! Just check it out and see for your itself. But I warn you, jokes are used so much in this movie, that it gets funny, then they use it until its buried in the ground!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funnier than the last Spy Who Shagged Me","review":"Haven seen both the first Man Of Mystery, the second The Spy Who Shagged Me and this lsat installment. I can say that this is the funniest of all three. Two new characters are introduced in this film Austin's Dad Nigel Powers, and Foxy Cleopatra. The jokes in this last movie made a lot more sense to me and tickled me more than the entire second Austin Powers movie did, espeically the part with The Osbournes and the outtakes on the end of the DVD. The second movie was awful but this one put some life back into Austin Powers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldmember is NOT The Spy That Shagged Me...","review":"Goldmember was mildly amusing, but the plot was really lame and Goldmember was just annoying... And I'm sorry... Beyonce Knowles CANNOT act... There are a lot of gals that would have made a better Foxy. Also, the cameos got really annoying... The only amusing one was the one with Britney Spears. Die blonde! But the others were really tiring... Dr. Evil and Scott were amusing though... But as previous reviewers have mentioned, it seemed like they just recycled the jokes from the last couple of movies. It was alright, but they could've done better. Pick up the 2nd one instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This in all honesty has to be one of the worst films ever made. The \\"humor\\" consists of bathroom, sex, and grossness gags which aren't in any way made funny, but are just presented for us to laugh at because they are obscene. Most people over the age of eight won't break into giggles at this sort of thing. I'm not speaking out of any puritanical objection to grossness in itself in a film: there is a long tradition of comic grossness in art, but for grossness to be comic, you have to do something with it. This film doesn't. If there were an academy award booby prize, Goldmember would deserve it. Advisory: the \\"sexual innuendo, crude humor and language\\" which give the film its PG-13 rating are all too idiotic to be very harmful to anyone of any age. The New Line Entertainment DVD transfer is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gold-dud!","review":"Let me start out by saying I am a huge fan of the series. I have a very easy going sense of humor and it takes a lot to bore me. Well guess what, this one bored me. The Goldmember guy is a really stupid character and the plot is not all that funny. This movie must have been thrown together in a hurry because I could have easily written a better script givin the success and the characters in the series. I highly recommend waiting for this one to come out on cable and save your money. If you plan on giving this one as a christmas gift keep your eyes on the auction sites the day after christmas I'm sure you will see it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the point?","review":"The only reason i saw this was because i was visiting a friend who is a projectionest so i watched it from the booth. I was glad i wasn't in the audience. This IS the dumbing down of America at it's best. It's humor is just plan stupid, the acting is a mockery to the actors guild. There is no entertainment value except to show the rest of the world what americans think is comedy. No wonder we are hated. The movie is pointless, doesn't go anywhere, it's stupid and is not very creative. There is no value to this film at all. This film is an insult to real comedy. It's just white trash at it's very best."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it zero stars I would!","review":"The first two movies were great, but Goldmember is not funny. I think I might have laughed 2 maybe 3 times. The rest of the time it was like watching idiots try and figure out why they were even doing a movie, and none of them realized that it was supposed to be a comedy.1.) Mike Myers needs to go back to his original ideas, be the Austin Powers that he created.2.) Have the bad teeth.3.) Dr. Evil does not need to act modern or hip.4.) The sidekick role with mini-me and Austin Powers, not!5.) Lastly, the female has to have chemistry with Austin Powers.Don't waste your money. Watch the first two over again and have a really good laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD FUNCTIONALITY PROBLEMS","review":"This DVD is made by New Line's division of Infinifilm. For some reason, the functionality of this DVD doesn't work on Panasonic players. About the only functions that work are Stop and Play. I feel sorry for Panasonic, because I got my DVD player for Christmas and thought it was a problem with the player. So I took the player back and exchanged it for another Panasonic player. But the \\"Pause\\" still didn't work. I just today found out that it is a DVD/Infinifilm issue and not a player issue. I'm afraid Panasonic is going to lose a lot of money if more people like me start trading in their players, because they think they don't work properly. Maybe Infinifilm should include a list of brands that its discs don't work with."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS DVD IS GARBAGE","review":"Not the film, but the DVD itself. Whether or not you like Austin Powers is subjective, so I won't bore you with my personal opinions.However, I will tell you a story. I was watching it last night, and had to get up to do something. So I hit the \\"pause\\" button.THE PAUSE FUNCTION DID NOT WORK!So I thought, \\"that's wierd\\", and hit \\"stop\\" instead, so that the movie would just pick up where it left off when I got back. When I did, guess what...The movie, instead of picking up where I stopped it, actually SKIPPED BACKWORDS TO THE BEGINNING OF THE CHAPTER, which I then had to watch all over again. In addition, there is, in my personal opinion, no excuse why the widescreen and full screen can't just be options on the same disk.I will NEVER buy anything from this product line again. When a modern-day DVD can't even perform basic functions like \\"pause\\" or \\"stop\\" like the cheapest of VCRs, something is terribly wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly made","review":"Very poor quality DVD.

It was HILARIOUS. I've talked to quite a few people about it, and they all loved it. Sure, Goldmember was kinda gross and not great, but the movie was funny. It had a lot of the same jokes but it was still really funny even though I have the first two and have seen them each a million times. This movie is the best!!! If you like the other Austin Powers movies, then I think you should like this one too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one Yet! =)","review":"I don't know why everyone is giving GOLDMEMBER a bad review. It was hilarous! I would have to say the ending was very suprising. But, The parts with the \\"mole\\" were the best. It seems to me like at least all the really important characters have been shocked by the size of that thing. But Austin seems effected the most by it. Anyway if you haven't seen iot already, then you ought to. My and my father would laugh fo 5 minutes after a funny scene, then we would start all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dreadful! Pure Trash!","review":"This movie is about as weak and unfunny as they come. Minime's character is brought to new lows (sorry, no pun intended) and does for midgets what \\"Birth of a Nation\\" did for Blacks. Filled with fourth-grade bathroom humor, unfunny gags, the nonacting of Beyonce (but hey, her scenes work with the sound down). Nah. The second Austin Powers film was not bad and the crude humor was at least mildly amusing. This time around, the crude humor is just crude!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2 was enough","review":"To tell you the truth, i've never really been a big fan of the Austin Powers movies, but i really thought there was no need for a third. The first two were enough laughs for everyone who enjoys these movies and Mike Myers should use his talents and create something new. I think i may of prefered it if it came out a few years later as in 'the long awaited movie' and then it would have been more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible - Don't buy - Do Rent!","review":"I rented this movie, before I would buy it, and boy, I am sure glad I did.

Pay the 4 bucks to rent it, instead of the 20 bucks to buy it. You'll appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Old, Same Old...","review":"I won't hesitate a second longer - 'Goldmember' was terrible. The first sequel,' The Spy Who Shagged Me', was bad enough but this really stretches the franchise way too far and over the top.I would have thought that the writers would have come up with some new material but no, its still the same 'Yeeeah Baby' and 'Very Shagadelic' one liners which bring down this films' credibility even more. It's only saving grace are the vast amount of cameos near the beginning, from then on; its trash. The overused 'mole' joke really gets on your nerves after a while and is just another blatant lack of fresh ideas for this third instalment. Even the appearance of Destiny's Child beauty Beyonce Knowles isn't enough to keep you interested. For real comedy, just stick to the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie -- Avoid","review":"Considering I was only able to watch about 15 minutes of this movie before I had to consign it to oblivion, you might want to weight my review lightly (after all, the movie might have gotten better at the 16 minute mark). But, essentially, this \\"movie\\" consists of a slew of Mike Myers spots (poor ones at that), interspersed with something to hang them together. It's essentially the same thing that happens with the later Eddie Murphy movies: we've got a star, let's show everyone how great he thinks he is. Stick with the first two movies (the first one's excellent and the second on is good) and avoid this one like the plague. I rate it at a terrible 1 star out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three is enough","review":"Not bad, but I seriously think that the AUSTIN POWERS horse has run it's course.

Yet I din't understand it as much as i understood he first 2, but then again, I enjoyed it. Then i got it for Xmas the same year and I just watched it a couple days ago.

He one time stops Dr. Evil's plan he had and is knighted by the queen of England... only to find his dad did not attend. Dissapointed by his fazha's(as GM says)failure to attend, He then stops by Dr. Evil's prison and is informed to go back to 1975 and rescue him. but then, a Dutch henchman named Goldmember kidnaps him, takes him back to 2002, and then Austin, and a chick named Foxxy Cleopatra meanwhile Dr. Evil escapes with Mini Me from prison, and start fresh on a sub going into Japan.THOUGHTS: Awesome!

But is a good come back. The critics bash it for not having a plot, but ask yourself 1 question, Why do we need some complicated, inventive, thought provoking plot in a COMEDY! We don't, that isn't what comedy is about. In some forms of comedy you need a plot, but in this form you don't. This is a feel good movie you can sit back forget that you have any intelligence and just have a good time. That is what comedy is about. The Mole joke is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moer shagadelic fun","review":"From the opening moments I enjoyed the movie. It was both a fun trip down memory lane for Austin Powers fans and there was an immediate sense of more groovy antics to come. The numerous cameo appearances were fun.That said, the original Austin Powers movie is still my favorite. This film beats out #2 easily-but somehow it was less consistent in its zaniness than the original. Somehow Austin himself seemed a little subdued once the opening dance numbers passed--which were great. Goldmember is a must-see for Austim Powers fans. The crowd at my viewing included grannies and teenagers alike. Very shagadelic sequel but less tight than the original..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Very First Review!","review":"This is my first review here on Amazon.com, and I felt SO strongly about this movie that I was inspired to write this brief review.

Honestly, if i would have paid 20 dollars for my wife and i to see this, the movie theater would have one less employee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly lame retread","review":"The first two were great (they still make me giggle today), but Goldmember has seriously little to offer. The Foxy Cleopatra character makes previous female foils seem downright literary in their complexity. The Goldmember character is incomprehensibly stupid and underexplained.

Of course not, but not enough to reward staring at the thing for almost two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was not very happy with the DVD. I was unable to pause, fast forward, rewind, etc. The makers of the DVD clearly did not do their job when it came to code for all types of machines.

I guess they needed to find the money for Tom Cruise somewhere. Unfortunately, the conspicuous logo placements are distractions. It's pretty sad that the filmmakers didn't have the confidence in their movie to do away with this crass commercialism.[DW]"},{"rating":"2","title":"almsot a classic, they should have lost beyonce","review":"The title says it all, mayBe if she wasn't in it it would have been a classic. Her acting skills are horrible, why would they bring her on for this role. Without her in the way the film still stands as a very funny and imaginitive comedy. All the characters from the past show up in this all out comedic warfare. Including one of my favorite actors seth green returns for his brilliant preformance. Jay rouch did an excellant job directing this film, and mike myers and michael mccullers wrote a very funny script. The only thing that seems strange is that with only two executive producers there are eight producers, two of which are writer/actor mike myers and demi moore. but with that aside take beyonce out and you have a comedy classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better than Preparations A - G.","review":"Don't get me wrong; I like a good fart joke as much as the next person.

Goldmember is a comedy, but it also reveals many secrets of the last 2 Austin's, like Austin and Dr. Evil's pasts (you might be suprised by the truth). On the laughable side, Minime turns good, Scott turns evil, Britney Spears has bullets shooting out of her [breasts], The Osbournes pop up in a scene, and anything else you could imagine in an Austin Powers movie. But, there is a little problem. I don't know if it's just me, but Austin's magic is fading. It's not as funny as it used to be and a lot of the jokes have already been used in previous movies. But, this is still a hilarious movie to see, by yourself or especially with your friends, but, now it's time to leave Mr. Powers, as this is the last episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy","review":"As always Mike Myers is great. The movie was well done. It will be one that we enjoy watching over many times for a crazy laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"someone should be ashamed","review":"The first one was a riot, the 2nd not bad, but three stikes and Mike Myers is out. There is no humor in this movie - only crude attempts at gross slap stick that merit not even a snicker. The only crowd I have heard praise this piece of trash are 17 to 19 year old males - and only when they are together withother 17-19 year old males. And be aware, parents....this movie IS NOT for children under the age of 15. The rating clearly should have been \\"R\\" - another case of the PG13 spectrum being way too wide. Overall, save your money and go see Big Fat Greek Wedding if you want to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks Funny","review":"This looks like a good movie but that they shouldn't have used Beyonce. They keep switching the sidekicks. It still looks Funny though. I really do want to see this. I have looked on to the computer and found Austin Powers as a kid maybe 6 to 7 years old.?. So I'm guessing that you'll see Austin Powers as a kid in a few scenes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin losing Power","review":"The third of the Austin Powers trilogy definitly doesn't carry the surprises and uniqueness of the first two.

This movie shows many cameos and some new characters. This movie is better than the \\"Spy Who Shagged Me\\" but I still say the first was better, it started it all. The movie doesn't use all the same old jokes as many thought. You won't wait to the end!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah Baby! More laughs!","review":"Austin Powers in Goldmember is no doubt one of the funniest movies so far this summer. Sure, from seeing the first two you'd think you've seen the jokes one too many times, but Mike Myers and company seem to add new freshness to them every time. The cameos in the beginning are great, so make sure you're prepared to count the stars..! This is a shagadelic time at the movies, don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay once","review":"The thing about this movie is, when I saw it in the theatrSe it was hillarious and unpredictable. When I got this dvd so my family and me could watch it, we sat throught it in total silence. The movie's fine once, so borrow it or something, it's not worth buying. The special features are okay, but not worth buying it alone for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Amusing, Occasionally Clever, More Often Not","review":"I liked the first of the Powers Trilogy, thought the second had some very funny bits but was disappointed by Goldmember. The opening scene was clever with all of the movie within a movie gags. I figured we were in for a real roller coaster ride. Yeah, unfortunately, the ride was mostly down hill. The movie is a loosely joined collection of skits about toilet humor, sexual innuendo and a few (very few) funny (very funny) sight gags. My friends at work, some 15 years my junior, all hated it. I give it 2 stars because there are some fun parts that are probably worth seeing. If you really like Mike Myers films, you will enjoy Goldmember. This DVD version has the Infinifilm feature and it's really a pretty cool add-in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"If you've seen the first two movies of this series, which are just too good, then you've seen just about every joke in Goldmember. Just got a bit too tedious to listen to \\"Oh behave\\" without any really new angles of humor. Mini-Me defecting was random. There was no real chemistry between Austin and his latest babe. And yes, we're tired of the time travel business. If you really have nothing to do and want to watch a movie, just rewatch the first two in this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Austin Lovers only","review":"Maybe this movie is an appropriate ending to the triology. The best part of the movie was the first five minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another raunchy movie not worth anyone's time","review":"When I went and saw Goldmember in the theater, I thanked the powers that be that I was employed at a theater and got to see the movie for free since it saved me the money I would have lost in buying a ticket. The only reason I gave it one star was because I couldn't go any lower than that, such as no stars or even a negative star. Beside the fact that I don't necessarily like the Austin Powers movies to begin with (hey, you wouldn't like it if your dad's boyfriend forced you to see it, either!) I thought that Goldmember bit the big one. Hard. It's hardly worth the film it's printed on. Save your money and your time and don't buy this movie. But, far be it from me to be ultimately condemning: if you're a diehard fan of Austin Powers, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny, Yea","review":"Mike Myers is a comic genius. This movie lives on the experience of Austin Powers. His new character is great. If you like the other two movies then you will love this one. Watch it with some other people and watch it more than once. After a couple of times you will pick up on jokes. Many people hated this movie because they never caught the jokes. Mike Myers comedy is a mixture of Mel Brooks, Chevy Chase and Bill Murray. His movies won't even make any top 100 AFI lists but they make you laugh. Now the DVD is great. The picture is bright and clear. The sound is also very good. I am not fond of the Infinifilm DVD's but they are ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running on Empty","review":"What a shame,People embraced this franchise so much that we just had to love it to death. The funniest moments in this movie are the cameo appearances of Tom Cruise, Kevin Spacey, Stephen Spielberg and others...after that runs its course, not much is left.Someone else here says the outtakes are funnier than the movie itself, since they feature Mike Myers improvising. I'm fulloy prepared to believe that. Iron-poor blood otherwise dominates this effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very Funny and Not Very Good","review":"I went in with very high expectations since I liked the 1st two installments a lot. The problem with this was trying to make every scene funny and it got old, dumb, and boring. There were probaly about 4 or 5 scenes that I actually laughed at. I decided that it might be like the original when each time you see it you find something new. This was wrong and I found myself wanting to get up and leave. Its funny how people in the audience would fake laugh at certain parts which they knew weren't funny but they almost felt obliged to.p.s. If you miss the 1st 5 minutes of the movie, then just leave because those were the most entertaining of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Failure","review":"Granted, there were some funny parts to this movie, it pales in comparison to the second. \\"The Spy Who Shagged Me\\" was absolutely current and up to date with pop culture, which is the main basis of the Austin Power's franchise. However, the third is trite and old and GoldMember is just plain disgusting. Knowels was suprisingly good and the DVD was great with loads of extras."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is very \\"toyt,\\" as they say in Holland!","review":"Mike Myers should stop right now. Despite my appetite for more Austin Powers adventures, there is a lot of appeal in quitting while he's ahead. Goldmember is by far the best of the three Austin Powers movies. The jokes are better, the timing is better, the performances are more on target. This movie does everything right. This is Austin Powers on magic mushrooms, a freeflowing trip with no holds barred. The fact that everyone was having a great time making this movie is apparent from the very beginning. Rather than dissect the movie and tell you about what works (most of it) and what doesn't (very little), just see it. Of course, if double entendres offend you, or if you can't take bathroom humor, stay home. Myers can't resist a little gutter humor, but it works here.It's much more fun than an unfortunate smelting accident involving your genetalia!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie [is weak]!","review":"I loved loved LOVED the first two movies, but I would have given this movie NO stars if that was an option. Other than a few chuckles (mostly in the first six minutes), this movie is a total dog...There's no story, the jokes have mostly been done before, and there's no charm. Please, Mike Meyers, DON'T make an Austin Powers 4 unless you have a script that is better than the original. Folks, don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Austin Powers has died and gone to Hollywood.","review":"This was the most self-aggrandizing of Mike Myers' \\"Austin\\" movies to date. The first one was fun, the second one was entertaining enough, but definitely needed some re-work, but this movie -- with its little \\"Hollywood Insider\\" bits and Myers'egotistical performance made me wonder how he gets his head through most doors.

You may not think it'll deserve a second viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"better to get the bootleg...","review":"the first ten mins. was funny and the jail scene and and shadow but the first one was way more funnier. and beyonce was trying to hard act and any way all she was saying is i'm foxxy cleopatra. she was much better in mtv's hip-hopera (carmen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"Okay, the jokes were fine and Biance was stunning, but the skin thing! icky, icky, icky. Im the sort that cannot stomach most toilet humor, and this is just as disgusting. I fell in love with Mike Myers and hope that the next one is much better. The father story is uninteresting, the \\"veird\\" joke is fun, but the movie lacked any memorable moments. Scott Evil was definatley my favorite part of the movie.Would I recommend this one? Nope. I have the first two Austin Powers at home, and would rather watch them a hundred times than have to watch Goldmember again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make it stop, please!","review":"Following in the proud tradition of lousy sequels that have plagued America in recent years (Blair Witch 2, Blade 2, etc.), this is another example of the \\"dumbing down\\" of America.

Story and effort are once again compromised for lame bits that play like short skits from Saturday Night Live."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?!","review":"Most people in this world are busy, so I will not wase your time. Let me start off by saying that this movie is very poor. Sure the begining is pretty good, but then it justs gets weaker and weaker. The ending is just plain BAD. There is no other word for it. Dr. Evil turns out to be Austin's brother?! What's up with that? If you really want to, rent it.

This was the cheapest one I could find that had a decent amount of features. But, it somewhat shows how cheap it is...The size of this recorder (according to the specs) appears to be about the same as other competing units, but it is actually a little bigger than it should be. If it was about an inch shorter, it would fit better in your hand. The recording quality is a little scratchy, but my main complaint is that it doesn't play loud enough to hear it without turning up the volume so much that its audio quality is very scratchy.Another problem is it makes clicking sounds through the speaker when buttons are pressed or options are changed. I would only recommend this recorder for very limited voice memo activities and when you are looking for a cheaper device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think Twice Buy Never","review":"Okay this is a \\"value\\" priced digital recorder.

Don't misunderstand - I liked it but found myself a little bored at times. However (let the contradictions cease!!) I liked the format of this book as autobiogrpahy more than most of the others I have read.

Jung comes across as so incredibly self-absorbed - it's only me, I, me, I and me again. He writes hundreds of pages about his most detailed inner experiences, yet there is not a single word about his relationship to his wife, children and mistresses. If I hadn't known that he was married with five children I would have assumed he was a complete hermit. Loving relationships seem to have meant nothing to this man. I honestly wonder how he could have been a good therapist. I also wonder why so many women have followed his teachings when quite obviously he held them in such low regard. I only hope that the reality was better than this book makes him out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"hogwash","review":"We know now what we didn't back in the '60s and '70s: this 'autobiography' is more creative writing than historical fact, and it wasn't written by Jung but by one of the many disciples assigned the task of creating a mystique of sainthood around a deeply troubled individual.The carefully crafted presence of Wise Old Man Jung is artful, a mix of hero-worship, hagiography, and new age religion. More recent scholarship paints a different picture: a monumental temper (often violent, directed against clients); sexual relationships with psychiatric inpatients; bizarre family relationships. The motto: don't believe everything you read from the 'autobiography' shelf, and don't get conned into this pseudo-psychology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"The book arrived heavily water marked/damaged with biro marks on many pages ---- very disappointed as normally the books I purchase through Amazon are in good shape.I've already submitted this feedback to Amazon twice since I purchased the book and received no reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life through Jung\`s eyes","review":"It\`s extremly interesting to have Jung\`s point of view on his own life.

It reads more like an interesting novel than a textbook, but don't let that fool you. The information is there; it just sneaks up on you so that you don't even know you are learning. But....by the end of the first chapter, the reader is given the opportunity to begin interpretation on a simple level. And what a boost that is to beginners (I've seen the excitement in the students I teach.)The author has done an excellent job of organizing the material in a logical fashion for learning and still manages to appeal to the seasoned astrologer.One of the best features of this book is that it teaches concepts that can be applied over and over in various combinations.I highly recommend what is truly a \\"New Way to Learn Astrology.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Introductory book to astrological analysis","review":"Basil Fearrington's The New Way... is an incredibly helpful book for those eager to enter into no nonsense, real life astrological analysis.

Cooder plays a strange mix of country, soul and gospel and I will have to leave it at that since I can not really put a label on it. The book-let is not all that well done. The cover photo is a picture of Cooder looking a bit crazy but I guess that is what he aimed for There are no lyrics in it but it is nice to see whom played what and such. The lyrics are a bit wordy, but they never get pretentious or trite. Overall, this is a very interesting and quite good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've owned.","review":"A few years back my father got me hooked on this album. It was the first cd I ever owned. An ex-girlfriend liked it so much that after we broke up she declared that cd was not coming with me.I couldn't blame her. The mix of blues and spirituals with Cooder's unique playing makes this one the most intesting albums I own. The medley of \\"Feeling Good\\" and \\"Fool for a Cigarette\\" is one of my favorites as well as balads like \\"Mexican Divorce\\" and \\"Jesus on the Main Line\\".The album also has some songs that keep it from taking itself too seriously. The song \\"If Walls Could Talk\\" has a catchy riff and great words.Cooder's great acoustic style shines through on what was a break-through album of the time and holds up years later. I always hear something that I missed on previous listenings.Although you don't need to be a guitar player to appreciate this album, every acoustic player should hear the fine guitar work.

And if ever I mention it to a few former colleagues I still see, their eyes light up with the memory. I had already bought P&L on the strength of a Rolling Stone recommendation, so I was doubly ecstatic when I saw those clips ('If Walls Could Talk' and probably 'Tattler' and 'Jesus On The Mainline').This is a terrific journey through American blues and gospel, with immaculate playing and an infectious sense of fun. The aformentioned 'Walls' is very cute, 'Tamp 'Em Up Solid' literally chugs along, 'Tattler' is gorgeous, but for me 'Fool For A Cigarette' is the standout: it's so cheerful it makes you almost proud to be a smoker, and that's saying something."},{"rating":"1","title":"My favorite Ry album and the worst remastering job of the series","review":"Well, the packaging IS cool, with reproductions not only of the LP sleeve and disc label, but also the inner paper sleeve. However, the sound is a disaster. The entire disc has been given an extreme treble boost, which creates distortion and completely changes its character. On many songs the percussion (especially cymbals and snare) dominates the mix, making a song such as \\"Tamp 'Em Up Solid\\" sound almost like cocktail jazz. The old CD sounds muffled in comparison, but it - like the rest of Reprise's domestic CD reissues - was true to the original LP sound. Warner Brothers engineers (and Ry) had wonderful ears, and I'm sure the mix we heard in 1974 was close to the one they wanted. This is like listening to a band from inside the snare drum. I don't know how someone listening to this album for the first time would react to the new mix, but I can't handle it. Painful and disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matching Book to Readers","review":"Teachers who are interested in designing a program for their students that meet children at their reading levels, should read this book.

This is a cool feature.) I used five sixteenth staples on my second project and had no problems using the low setting. I had no problems with jamming on either project. I gave it four stars for now as I've only used it on two projects and can't speak to durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does jam but still great","review":"I'm sceptical of reviewers who either say or imply that the Stanley never jams. Never is a long time. The few times it does jam, sometimes caused by the operator, can be cleared easily and quickly. Be sure to use staples with a sharp point, which obviously increases penetrating power. The Arrow brand staples are very sharp.I won't repeat all the descriptions and great features covered in other reviews. Bear in mind the maximum depth staples you can use is 9/16 inch. If you need a greater depth you have to buy a more powerful staple gun. I did not try with Brad nails. Otherwise, for home use only, works as advertised and would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely miserable.","review":"It's fortunate that I bought this mostly for the purpose of securing some rather thin sisal rope to cat scratching posts.

So I got this one which by the reviews seemed like the \\"Cadillac\\" of staplers. I gave it two stars because this stapler did last through the first and only project I put it through. I made a big 3 bin compost pit and the stapler made it though that big project but then I pulled it out for something small and it refused to fire. I think an internal spring had busted, same issue that I suspected in my first Stanley. I then went looking for something completely different--and I found the Surebonder 9600 Pneumatic Narrow Crown Stapler and I have never looked back. It takes the same size (standard T50) staples.

Unfortunately, this film tries to make the viewer believe that it is being truthful when in reality it often isn't.

As for the subject , these kind of things happens in every country so why only blame Turkey? The actors used in the film as Turkish authority are not Turkish which is the worst part of the movie. If you are going to make film based on a true story , you must do it properly first! This film could not have achieved its goal , no , it shows Turkey as Iran which is not. I accept that there were many things which were wrong in Turkey 20-30 years ago but the film is especiialy puts Turkey like an Arabian country , all in dust and every thing.I think Oliver Stone should put his hand on his heart and must think what he has done 25 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slanted, yes, but why?","review":"I read all the reviews on this page before I found a place that carried Midnight Express and rented it. I'm no more racist towards Turks than I was after viewing \\"Lawrence of Arabia.' Yes, it's somewhat exaggerated, but why? Because these guys had nothing better to do than sit around and say \\"I hate Turkey\\"? The movie's purpose, as I see it, is to discourage the use/sale of drugs of any sort, because this is the sort of situation you'll wind up in. Another purpose, to show the value of human life, life of any sort, and that people should be forgiven. (Though I would have enjoyed seeing the smugglers of \\"French Connection\\" end up in this hellhole.) On another note, why must all movies be political statements? This stands on its own as a fine dramatic piece, regardless of any \\"attitude\\" it might have. If Parker were racist, would he have directed \\"Mississippi Burning\\" ten years later?

Then maybe you'll think that it's gonna be an adventure to take a vacation here but I am afraid you'll get disappointed. First of all Istanbul is not an ugly city as they try to show in that movie. Secondly neither the law courts and the prisons are like that in Turkey. I don't claim that this movie is based on a whole lie but there's a great exagration we see. Turkey was very different 20 years a go but it has never been a hell as it seems in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten Up Folks, Its Only A Movie","review":"I have read some of the reviews posted here for this movie and they almost laughable.

Nuff Said."},{"rating":"1","title":"FANTASY","review":"This film is an obvious result of the greek and armenian lobbies in the US. It is simply an anti-propaganda tool against a nation. The political purpose has been achieved.

It is a true story? If it is, it is prefectly Ok to show the unfairness of a prison life however they can NOT generalize to its society what happened in the prison. My only recommendation those who are judging turkish people just because of this movie is to watch 'Sleepers'. Unfairness can happen in prison life but there is no need to have very racist dialogues in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a movie to see if you're already deeply depressed","review":"An awe-inspiring and horrifying depiction of existence in a Turkish prison.

I don't blame them. It is a gut wrenching story of survival in the worst of conditions pulled off beautifully. The acting is great, the mood is set just right, and it had me glued from start to finish. NOW with all that being said just watch it and ignore the \\"based on a true story\\" part.

Perhaps I'd have liked the film more without reading the book. Some books can be improved when turned into films, such asForest GumporFor Love of the Game, while some, such asQ & A: A Novel(upon which \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" was very loosely based) really suffer when they reach the silver screen.

US State Dept did nothing; finally a signifnicant bribe was made to several officials to release the children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film","review":"I am completely amazed by the number of reviews which seem to reguard Midnight Express as a badly made film because it presents a negative portrait of Turkey or because it is only loosely rather than strictly based on the original book. The real question is \\"Does the film work within the framework it establishes?\\" And the answer to that is a resounding yes. Whether or not you believe the story is true, whether or not you believe the film is unreasonably negative toward the Turkish people, the film works. Davis is quite remarkable in his performance; the action is tense, taunt; the cinematography is unexpected lyrical. It is a film to be savored with repeat viewings."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"i cannot even get to considering how good the movie is, as far as it's quality is concerned; because i just cannot get over the fact that i was extremely deeply offended by it. being turkish, i simply cannot accept the fact that this movie is around, \\"free\\" for people to view. i cannot think of a better way of creating a horrible impression of turkey in the minds of those who do not know much about the place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watching This Movie is Wasting Valuable Time","review":"If you have nothing to do, better than watching a dark, biased and totally boring movie then go ahead, waste your money and time.

It's probably even more shocking to the US public as an American is the victim as far as drug dealers may be called victims.People suspect of terrorism may due to the actions and regulations of the Bush government face a similar degree of dehumanization. This movie demonstrates the consequences if we allow governments to act as they want, freely and without controll. This concerns both George W. Bush as well as the former Turkey government. The sadistic prison guard could well have been Donald Rumsfeld talking about constructive techniques of interrogation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible propaganda","review":"This is a terrible propaganda of the Armenian lobby in the USA against Turkey. The whole purpose of the movie is to create a bad reputation of Turkey and Turks. Apart from this, the movie is nothing. Not a single bit of thing, even a Turkish name for a chief character, has anything to do with reality. Yet, they shamelessly call it a \\"true story\\". Apart from the propaganda part, the story is a simple one, without any originality. So the Oscar goes to the Armenian lobby... For those who wonder: 1- The movie is shown several times on Turkish TV channels. 2- Alan Parker and Oliver Stone are not hated in Turkey. 3- After 20 years, American tourists still do not prefer Turkish coasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MOVIE DOESN'T SHOW ANY REALITIES!","review":"I know that many of you impressed with this movie.

The movie is not as faithful to the story as it could have been, but this is great film-making by Alan Parker. The cast is outstanding and the script riveting. A must see. It does not glamorize drugs orimply the original arrest was unjust. My only complaint is that it is in mono and the color transfer is poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oliver Stone's first signs of brilliance","review":"Finally got around to seeing this and was very impressed. The story is compelling, the performances are excellent, and the score is haunting, but ultimately it is Stone's tight, effective screenplay that makes this movie work so well. No, it does not give a very favorable impression of the Turkish people, but given the circumstances of the prisons there at this time, it is probably realistic. The \\"pigs\\" courtroom speech is absolutely true to how Hayes would have felt at that point. A perceptive viewer would understand the context of his speech and assume that in reality not all Turks are pigs. Context is everything. Ultimately, though, that doesn't have much to do with the point of the movie. It documents in painstaking detail the brutality and the suffering this young man went through."},{"rating":"2","title":"its more like a 4.8","review":"this movie is great,its amust see, but it has some mistakes. i'm not tirkish but people who have been ther tell that not everyone are pigs and that they are not so racist. so allan parker shouldnt talk so bad about the turkish because they are not all bad people. apart from that this is a wonderfull movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Midnight Express","review":"This was a very good movie to see, even though it was made some time ago.

It's not some watered down parable that makes everything all rosy and happy. This book is real! It made me feel angry, upset, angered, and at time sad!

It is the best David Fincher film yet, and one of Jodie Foster's best performances. It is intense, intelligent, exciting and downright scary. Jodie's character is subjected to a home invasion from which she must protect herself and her daughter(Kristen Stewart who absolutely steals the show). That is as much of the plot that I will detail. Know this. Panic Room is not a brainless shott'em up action flick, but rather a thriller for the thinking man. It is a cat and mouse game with realistic characters and exceptional dialogue.

And the fact that FOster's character is smart and so is her daughter. Survivors are generally smart people. There's the first step of Foster and her daughte rin the safe room, then the robbers and her daughter in the safe room and then I was waiting for the last twist on the room. That didn't come.

But make sure you see the movie at some point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Goes Downhill Halfway Through and Awful Ending","review":"The movie was sort of interesting, with a lot of little plot twists--until it was about three-quartes through. Then it got really stupid, contrived, and of course, politically correct. Jodie Foster does a number of really stupid and non-realistic things--like not telling the police there's a problem. Afterall, the thugs holding her daughter can't hear what she's saying. And then, not taking the damn gun herself and shooting. Finally, if I see one more \\"dead man rising back to life\\" in any movie, I think I will throw up. Raoul, who already has a bashed arm and is bleeding quite badly, is smashed over the head with a sledge hammer. That would be enough to do any mortal in. But no, he pops up back to life, full of vim and vigor...well, I wish they might have put a realistic ending on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic and Flawed Plot","review":"The only good thing about this DVD is the acting of Jodie Foster. This DVD is a true bomb. The kid acts fairly well, but the rest of the cast borderlines on camp. There are just too many incidents when Jodie Foster could have taken more realistic measures to save herself and her family, but instead chose to do something stupid, like not to seek help outside, not to use the gun herself and not inform the police when opportunity prevailed.Some suspense and clever camerawork, but mostly predictable. This suspense drama proves to be almost comical and ridiculous to the point of frustration. The almost 2 hours could have been cut in half and this would still bomb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Jodie Foster, as usual, is terrific and the only reason to watch. She just needs meatier roles. This one is very predictable from the moment she and her daughter tour the place. I wish, just once, this type of movie would go off in another direction but, of course, it does not. The perpertrators are so bland and typical that I was thinking of the thugs in \\"Home Alone\\" trying to be serious. Did not recognize Dwight Yokum. The dialog and circumstances have been seen many times before and with much better results. If you have nothing else to watch, then do so.

The robbers that invade Meg's house are pretty hilarious! They have no clue what to do to get into the Panic Room. They will crack you up! I mean come on, you have Dwight Yoakam playing a bad guy.

Her daughter, wonderfully done by Kristen Stewart, seemed to have a sexual identity problem.

There are a number of nicely-handled tense moments. Wait towards the end for the macabre things to happen in the story though in the beginning one is lead to believe that it is going to be a \\"Home Alone\\" kind of a thing where the intruders are simply going to be outsmarted all the time and that no murders or killings would take place. Brilliant piece of acting by Jody Foster particularly in the scene when the cops come home to check if anything is wrong in the household and when she is forced to prove them that everything is alright. The conclusion of the story was also a fair one. Not a boring movie. Four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do Panic!","review":"Panic Room is the best thriller I have seen in years with this much style and energy. Jodie Foster is believable as the divorced Mom. I widh dhe did more like this because you hardly see Jodie Foster in movies anymore, but this is a triumph for Foster!

I'm giving it a bonus, because it is very rare when the main character doesn't anything stupid! huray. The film is geniously suspensfull. It always is true to what it is never anything else.

I don't know if the critics were paid off, but I know that this was the worst, most unthrilling movie, (which it was supposed to be...) that I have ever seen. seriously though, I thought it was more funny than it was scary, which ruined it for me. I think the \\"scariest\\" part was the father getting the s**t kicked out of him. Everyone in the theater moaned when all the stupid points in the movie came up, which were in abundence by the way.

Does that tell you something?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, was this a Bad Movie...","review":"I'm sorry to say ... this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. And it was a free rental!

This movie is so riddled with plot holes and unrealistic behavior from the characters that it quickly turns into a bad comedy. In fact, I found Joe Pesci to be more menacing in HOME ALONE then I did the three bumbling clowns who torment Jodie Foster in this non-thriller.Jodie, please, you're a great actress. But your last couple of movies were complete duds. Do yourself a favor and pick some better scripts girl. You're striking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & Underwritten","review":"I truly believe the script of this film was orginally entitled \\"Home Alone 4 starring Jody Foster.\\" At least the Macaulay Culkin films cut from the same cloth were somewhat comedic.

Being a huge fan of David Fincher, I broke my rule of never going to a show on its opening night. Big Mistake! Talk about a boring movie. Right from the beginning, it seemed painfully obvious that nothing would become of this film (dare I even call it that). Leto was just so awful, that I was glad to see him go - not soon enough in my opinion. Jodie Foster - what a waste of talent (probably her easiest acting job to date). And that little girl of hers - reminded me of everything I didn't like about Terminator 2. Enough cheesy one liners to make you physically ill. I personally found myself not really caring about the movie's outcome after an hour or so. It's THAT bad. This is one of those, \\"Oh it's on cable for the 42nd time movies\\" Why was the audience laughing aloud? Why did I get the same urge to leave that I had when watching AI ???

For me this set is what I wanted from the day I saw this movie at the theater.This comprehensive DVD package gives you details about ever possible part of production. The multiple commentary tracks provide numerous stores about the process of making this film and many key people can be found on these tracks. Personally my favorite part of the DVD set was the visual effects breakdowns. Here you get to see numerous visual effects show from the film and learn about how they were done. I'm a huge fan of the \\"How'd They Do That\\" kind of features and this release didn't let me down.This is such a packed release that it makes me wish all the films I love would be a release half as good as this amazing set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panic Room puts you to sleep before ever scaring you","review":"I recently rented this movie on DVD, and I'm sure glad that's all I did. The plot is about as shallow as you can get, burglars break in, mom and daughter lock themselves in panic room. The rest of the movie is filled with the burglars cussing one another because they can't break in. There's also many other plot holes, for instance, when Foster is finally able to call 911, they put her on hold! unbelievable! After the movie ended I hoped for some interesting features on the making of, but nothing. All you get is a trailer and some worthless filmographies. The movie wasn't scary in the least, so if you want some good sci-fi thrillers of recent, rent The Others or wait for The Ring to come out on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Miss","review":"Great concept for a film. But, executed poorly. Fincher is great director who couldn't seem to get this one off the ground. Plus, did anyone who worked on this film, look at the dailies?

I look forward to Fincher's next film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak...","review":"Good idea for a Hitchcockian thriller, but oh so far from it. Fault doesn't lie so much with the director or actors, it is just an extreamly weak screenplay. Every character is a moron. So many obvious flaws that it would be hard to explain here, but suffice it to say I was looking at my watch after about an hour. I really enjoy Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker. They are fine actors and usually very selective about what they will do. Apparently accepting these roles caught them in a weak moment. Rent if you must, but save your hard earned money for another purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a horror movie!","review":"I purchased this as a rental here on Amazon because it was listed as a scary movie.

It\`s a watchable thriller with a couple of twists that kept me entertained for a while, but it doesn\`t go beyound that. For the most part, it isn\`t too difficult to figure out what is going to happen, and the lackluster ending only makes it worse. Appropriate to watch in a rainy night when there is nothing else to do, since it\`s still good enough to kill a couple of hours.

The thing that bothered me the most about this movie is all the twists in plot seemed to be based on some sort of ESP going on between antagonist and protagonist.

After such an incredible film like Fight Club, I don't know why he would even glance at a script as dull and unlikely as this one. Even more shocking was that Jodie Foster pried herself out of the director's chair to act in a movie that wasn't powerful or thought provoking in any way. There weren't even any striking special effects to keep me mildly amused. It's not the worst movie ever made, but it's certainly not the best either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Panic","review":"How can it be that in a horror movie, you can be hit over the head with a shovel and be hit over the banisters down two flights of stairs falling on your head and get up and still know not only where you are but who you are, and I know of people who trip over their feet and twist an ankle and cannot walk.....But lets be sensible for a mo, Jodie Foster is great at pulling loads of faces, just when she is ment to, I love her to bits, her acting is as ever, very very good, and this film lets you know that even if your doing bad, you might just have a heart too. well done Jodie, I'll buy the DVD when it comes out.

Even after watching a bad movie I usually have the pleasure of playing critic with my friends. \\"Panic Room\\" offers so little plot and such thin characters that we ran out of conversation material 15 minutes after the movie. We could have found more material to analyze in a test pattern. I did have a few laughs with this movie, but if I could get that two hours of my life back I would. The camera work is splendid but not enough to save this movie. Fincher, Foster and Whittaker are great - in other movies. Dwight Yuck-um should not quit his day job, and the actor who played the other thug has already faded from memory.

That's what happens when Jodie Foster (who works hard to save this film) and her daughter get stuck in the panic room of their new mansion, where three thieves have broken into. The problem, of course, is the treasure they want is in the panic room, so the two women are forced to spend quite some time in this room, which is not such a terrible problem, since it has been built for that same purpose. The room contains a toilet, flashlights, fire blankets, a medicine kit--pretty much anything you would need in an emergency, except a single piece of food. Maybe the builders of the panic room expected people to eat the blankets. The movie has other moments that are simply unbelievable, which is too bad, because this could have been a pretty good thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actors, but not great story.","review":"All the actors, especially Jodie Foster and Forest Whitaker, do outstanding jobs in their roles. In the beginning, you start to believe this thriller will be a game of wits. But in the middle of it, Jodie Foster's character starts doing things that, given the circumstances, is just ridiculous. The burglars have so many options to place the circumstances back into their favor, but rather than have the advantage (even though they have a great bargaining tool at their expense), they do things that are just plain stupid. A person with any decent sense of common sense could do better. Worth watching for some great acting, but because of the [bad] story, wait for the bargain theaters or wait for video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intense? Not so much...","review":"Okay, I was ready to be on the edge of my seat. Go ahead, scare me! Well, I stayed in the middle of my seat and was somewhat entertained, but suspense? Maybe a little. These bad guys actually cracked me up. Dwight Yoakham, I have to say, can deliver the bad guy like nobody else. I didn't even recognize him for awhile. The camera work was...interesting. Made me slightly nauseous. I didn't see how it affected the story or complemented the movie. Something they just thought would be really \\"cutting edge\\". The outcome of the movie is predictable (c'mon! You think they're gonna kill off Jodie Foster?). The actual ending was, in a word, bad. But all in all, I can't say I hated it. I call a rental and be done with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cinematography!","review":"This movie is so stylish with is clever camera angles.

It's great to see Forrest Whitaker in the movies again after being behind the camera for a while. But the real gem in this film is the continued progression of country singer turned actor, Dwight Yoakam. He is great as the cold as ice burglar. This is an awesome film.

This sets the stage for a stalemate that neither side can afford. The object of the intruders' search is hidden within the panic room itself, and daughter has a medical condition which makes escape imperative. This film is a fine cat-and-mouse thriller that doesn't cheat or insult the intelligence of the viewer.

For every Seven and Fight Club we've had an Alien 3 and The Game. Panic Room slots comfortably into the latter bracket - it's just Fincher-by-numbers, the Big Man treading water whilst he waits for a half-decent script to drop in his letterbox. Take one waifer-thin premise, flesh it out with a few decent performances (and, courtesy of Jared Leto, one of the worst this reviewer has seen in a long time) and some flashy editing, and what do you get? On this evidence, just another disposable popcorn flick.

With such plot twists as Sarah being diabetic and Meg being claustrophobic, along with many others, this one kept me on the edge of my seat.

The most glaring is that track 15 is not \\"Blue Shadows on the Trails\\" and is not even Roy Rogers!!! The song you get is \\"I Never See Maggie Alone\\", and it sounds like Kenny Roberts to me. There are a few more songs I wonder about as well.Caveat Emptor!!! The songs do sound good, and I did enjoy them, but was bemused by the glaring errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Irish Language Text","review":"This book is an essential one for anyone who wants to learn Irish. It contains 34 well-written chapters, pronunciations, and a lot of grammar. The glossary in the back is useful, but to get into the nitty-gritty of grammar details and for a more comprehensive word list, you should probably buy a companion dictionary or grammar book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning Irish","review":"Forget learning Irish using this method. Irish is difficult enough for the natives. The spelling of the Irish vocabulary and the pronunciation of such are worlds apart--this book does not take into consideration that the average English speaking person has to learn a totally different set of grammerical rules ( our English rules do not apply ) of which there are pages and pages to master before being able to figure out the most simple pronounciation. Latin is easier to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irish for linguists","review":"This book is brutally fast-paced, and seems to assume a pretty solid knowledge of linguistics. For example, in lesson 2, it states, \\"A second person singular pronoun, e.g., tú, tusa, is used wen addressing one person. A second person plural pronoun, e.g. sibh, sibhse, is uned when addressing more than person. The plural is not used to express politeness or formality\\". That last sentence would be utterly cryptic to someone who has never studied a language that makes a T-V distinction. On the other hand, if you're already a polyglot, this book is probably exactly what you're looking for.As a side note, the binding is not very good. I've owned the book for one week and the pages are already falling out."},{"rating":"2","title":"This edition provides a great introduction to the language.","review":"This edition, the book and audio casettes, gives a great introduction to the Irish language. Combining 36 lessons, an extensive pronunciation guide, and an Irish-English/English-Irish dictionary, this book is the best I've used. Be sure to get both the book and the casettes, as they may be sold separately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Version","review":"The seller sent me the wrong edition.

The writing is direct and spare, often eloquent. Many of the poems are rhymed and metered, but these are expressed with such ease that the form calls attention to the subject rather than to itself. Always there are people in these poems--from the daddy with a sagging rubberband mouth drawn by his child to the beloved husband with a failing mind. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"husband loved it","review":"husband did not expect this gift but really loved it.

Much in the vein of King's X (but in no way a copy), the Galactic Cowboys crunch, thrash, strum, harmonize and laugh through songs about all kinds of subject matters.In short - tight playing and vocals paired with lyrics with a message make this album enjoyable with every listen. Another great addition to your CD collection (this album always gets critical acclaim, but is very underrated and under-noticed by music fans). See why Texas Music Magazine declared this album a hidden gem and a Texas rock classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Listening Pleasure","review":"If you want something new in a hard rock sound, this is it. I have listened to the GC for 3 years now and never grow tired. Kaptin Krude jams hard and Kill Floor leaves ya beggin for more.

The words are fine and give us an important message, but the visual message is equally, if not, more important. Children are visual learners. We want to raise successful, confident children of both sexes, so why does Cornell have to give us the boy as a firefighter and a girl as a nurse? My absolute unfavorite is where the children are given medals of honesty and as a best friend, while surrounded by adults wearing their medals. The males are wearing medals of bravery, intelligence, politeness, suaveness, and impatience. The women are wearing medals of adult cute, svelte, and pear-shaped! Come on, where's the gender equity, Jamie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read","review":"Its a fun read with great pics!

As someone who was truly looking for help or advice, I was very disappointed to find that this book offered neither. Gregoire blames a low sex drive on pornography, abuse, and premarital sex... or a woman's own prickliness and distraction. Suggestions given included ensuring that the surfaces in your bedroom are clear, so you aren't worried about cleaning up while you should be concentrating on pleasing your husband. Oh, you work outside the home? You should consider staying home, lest you damage your husband's self esteem by not allowing him to be the \\"provider\\". (Really?!)As the primary \\"provider\\" in my family, I found this downright offensive. To suggest that my ability and work ethic goes against God's intentions for womanhood is ridiculous. And I guarantee it won't jump start my interest in sex.Looking to increase your sex drive for $10? Don't buy this book.

HANSON RULZ!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop Rockin'!","review":"Well, just when I thought I couldn't love an album more than Middle of Nowhere, along comes This Time Around. This, in my opinion, is much better than Middle of Nowhere. Now, don't get me wrong, Middle of Nowhere is AWESOME, but this is better. I absolutely love every single track, which is hard to say for many albums. It's still pop music, but mixed with rock. So, you get Pop-Rock. It contains some of the sounds of Middle of Nowhere, you can hear that, you just have to listen and compare. But it is slightly different (more rock). There isn't such a big difference as some make it sound, you can really hear that it was a natural evolution.

I've enjoyed most of Tess Gerritsen's other novels, but this one frustrated me with its sappy, bad-Harlequin-romance atmosphere. Although they are supposedly intelligent, mature adults, the two leads behaved like none too bright, naive yo-yos. Granted, there were a few good surprises, but all of the characters were pretty one dimensional. This may be partly due to the book's shorter length (i.e., if you cram in lots of plot developments, something's got to go). I always feel guilty about panning an author's hard work, yet I also want to spare a reader hours of unsatisfying effort. I finished reading this book because I'm stubborn, but I'd advise others to skip it and stick with her later works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a shame that this wwas ever published","review":"I have been a fan of Tess Gerritson for a long while and have enjoyed many of her novels over the years (except that awful one set in England where neither the plot nor the characters worked). I really looked forward to reading this latest offering but I am now exceedingly annoyed at having spent a reasonable amount of money on a complete piece of rubbish! The plot was so predictable that all which subsequently occurred was obvious by the end of the second chapter and the writing was so appalling that I had to skim a good proportion of it. I seriously doubt if Ms Gerritson actually wrote this..if she is sub-contracting she needs to find a better writer to do it in her name."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"Whistleblower is Tess Gerritsen's 5th stand-alone novel. When Victor Holland runs in front of Cathy Weaver's car on a lonely California highway, she takes him to the local hospital, aware that he seems to be terrified, but unaware that he has been shot. While his ravings seem to be paranoid, the murder of Cathy's close friend, followed by several other murders, has Cathy not just believing Victor, but depending on him for her own safety. What follows is a rollercoaster ride of pursuit and evasion as Cathy and Victor try to prove what he has uncovered without losing their lives. Plenty of action along with some romance makes this an entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Novel -- Skip This One","review":"I searched out Tess Gerritsen as the author of the books that inspired the new tv show Rissoli & Isles, which I love. As I usually do, I hit an online auction site to find book bargains, lots of books for a few dollars. If I was rich I would buy all Kindle versions, but I'm not.In this case I am so glad that it was a bargain. Whistleblower is one of the most frustrating books I have read. I want suspense. I want action. I want intrigue. In this book the two protagonists stop every few feet to make out. Yes, the story is constantly interrupted with \\"romance\\". Not even good romance.I have read three of Gerritsen's other books and love them. Do not judge an author by one book that didn't quite make it.Gerritsen is a talented author who wrote one less than thrilling thriller. Loved The Surgeon, Harvest, Life Support.

Author Stuart Muszynski, bedridden for over a year with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, visualized his grandmother's life and home town in Poland, and the ethical values that inspired five Christian families to hide her and his parents during the Holocaust. Exploring history and the cruel choices that once had to be made to survive during and after the Nazi occupation of Poland, Searching for Values recounts chilling tales of the Third Reich's methodical genocide while marveling at the compassion of those who risked their lives to defy it. A profoundly moving blend of the lessons of present and past in the quest for building a fulfilling life and community, and passing on positive values to one's children."},{"rating":"1","title":"what Co2 cartridge ?","review":"I ordered this charger as the ad posted it was new and it came with a C02 cartridge when I received the package in the mail today the item was just inside a mail envelope no product packaging and no cartridge, I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks","review":"disappointing..leaks freezes up tooo often seems unsafe-took too long to arrive and delayed the process.very unhappy.........................not the greatest...not worth the money"},{"rating":"1","title":"can you here that","review":"after one use, wait not even one use it developed an air leak and i lost all the co2. also it did not come with a co2 cartridge as advertised."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xmas gift","review":"Got this for an xmas gift.

The seperation of Sam from Lucy and the heartbreak it caused to both of them is but one example of what CPS agents do every day, tearing children away from loving families to place them for adoption, and gain adoption bonuses from the Federal Govt. in return.

This is one of those films that we attend because of the stars it contains, not because we think the story will be anything but maudlin. But I AM SAM is a terrifically well written, sensitive tale that avoids the goo of most films about characters living challenged lives. In the hands of Sean Penn, Sam is wholly believeable and his performance is easily the finest of last years' crop. But so is Michelle Pfeiffer's role. This in fact is a stunning cast, finely directed, that yes, makes you teary-eyed but for all the right reasons. You know, it really is OK to show your compassion for characters such as these.

Reasons for actions are plain, translucent and sometimes even weird. The story does not stick together, but gets dispersed also in the first, but really awful in the second part. The movies there gets to be a real dull experience that u forget about on the road home already. I know some people will talk about its great theme and how the love winns all and such sugar, but it has been done so many times and much more convincing then here.Have to say at the end that M.Pfeiffers performance was better than expected.

That said, this is a totally manipulative movie, with overacting by Sean Penn as the mentally challenged father trying to regain custody of his daughter.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"you'll laugh and cry- its a very good movie","review":"this movie is very touching. i wont retell the story because thats already been done, but i would like to say that it is definitely worth seeing. sean penn and dakota fanning both give outstanding performances. very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb acting","review":"I was just amazed at Sean Penn's acting in this movie. So much in fact that I was upset that he did not win the best actor oscar. I felt he deserved it. This is a very emotional movie. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending kind of leaves you hanging. I won't say more so I won't spoil the movie for you. I also felt Michelle Pfieffer has played more convincing roles. Anyway, i loved the movie as a whole. The script is well done and it is not just a courtroom drama. This movie deals with a lot of modern day issues. The music goes along perfect with the movie as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Performances","review":"Sean Penn and Dakota Fanning are outstanding in their roles as Father and Daughter in this film. Michelle Pfeiffer does a good job as the attorney who comes to their rescue. But the script seemed more along the lines of a tv-movie of the week. Unfortunately, the script was just not that well-written. In spite of that, Sean Penn deserves his best actor nomination, his portrayl is perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!","review":"This film is not for everyone. It's definitely sentimental (if you like that in film). It's about an autistic man who is fond of the Beatles and is trying to raise a young daughter. Child services tries to \\"protect\\" the child by placing her in separate custody. A court battle ensues.Good points: Excellent acting. Dakota Fanning was only 7 years old when she made this. And anyone who can go toe to toe in acting across from Sean Penn is quite an actor.The not so good points: Too much hand-held camerawork. Odd use of monochromatic filters (green and later in the film, blue). Uneven pacing. Inability to sustain my interest.The DVD: Looks sharp and sounds great.DVD extras: I was not interested enough in this film to check out extras, but there seems to be a fair amount.The soundtrack: Very nice remakes of Beatles songs.Let it be......"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie Full Of Emotion","review":"This movie will make anyone whos ever cried or laughed at movie do just that. If you like sad movies, happy movies, funny movies, dramatic movies, any of them, you will have a part of this movie made just for you. It's about a metaly retarded father and his struggle to keep his daughter his, it cannot be described any more without giving away part of them movie. If you've liked any movie you'll like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"Despite a nice effort on the part of Jesse Nelson, I Am Sam did not turn out how I expected it to. Sean Penn, however, is absolutely brilliant. His performance isn't acting. It's something so much more than that. He is Sam. Also, Michelle Pfeiffer is my favorite actress working today. The combination of such talent and such beauty is so rare these days, and it's refreshing to see it in Pfeiffer. But even with these two amazing actors and the stellar supporting cast (although they do little to add to the film), the movie is very flawed. It's manipulative, forced, and contrived. But all means, try the movie, but don't expect to much."},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"This film is ridiculous. It's attempts at forcing the viewer to be emotionally involved are laughable. This is for someone who has no idea how a mentally disabled person acts or lives...but would like to empathize. Please. Anyone who actually thinks this film is anywhere near real life or that believes this could actually happen needs to get their head checked. Go volunteer at a hospital...go donate your time to a real life situation. Not Sean Penn's foolish attempt to gain your attention and sympathies toward a stupidly acted and horribly put-together film. A disgrace to anyone who really knows how these people live and behave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mental","review":"This film was a film that brought Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer fans to the next generation of lame. Why mentally challeged? Why do Pfeiffer fans have to see her kick a coffee table? Dakota Fanning is outstanding in her dubut, but Penn showed his fans this \\"was not a good choice\\".(Penn is nominated for Best actor. And Phieffer?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is RETARDED","review":"I saw this movie yesterday. I decided to check out the reviews to see how badly people blasted it due to the fact that it sucked soooo bad. I am shocked that a lot of people seem to think this movie is good. Sean Penn generally cannot act, and he's even worse at acting retarded. The only part I almost cried at was the closing credits, when I realized I would never get the previous 2 hours of my life back. Why is it that when actors play retarded people their performances are considered great? Any real retarded person could have outacted Penn in this terrible movie. As for the girl -- was she playing a 35 year old woman trapped in an 8 year old's body? Her intelligence and emotional capacity made the movie laughably unrealistic. I would give this movie zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply awesome","review":"I haven't seen such a good movie in recent years. This movie touches the chords of your heart and makes you feel like \\"You are Sam\\". Sean Penn was as awesome as ever. I think he should have won an academy for his performance but as usual they never give it to one who really deserves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel stupid for having rented this.","review":"This is by far one of the worst movies I have seen to date. Very predictable, and full of scenes with unrealistic dialog. Penns poor performance is only worsened by the unimaginative and bland screenwritting and direction of this movie. At times I had to wonder if the script itself was written by someone afflicted with \\"Sam's\\" mental disability. Complete fecal matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul moving","review":"Watching \\"I Am Sam\\" may make one cry. One cannot help but feel sorry for Sean Penn's character. The Beatles's tracks give it that extra emotion. This is one of the best movies made in 2001. It was written, directed, and produced with heavy heart and soul. Sean Penn's Oscar nominated performance as a mentally challenged father is his best of his career. He proves that he heavily researched his role before filming as do the crew. Michelle Pfeiffer performs at her best in years as a Penn's stressed lawyer. Seven-year-old Dakota Fanning makes a wonderful debut as Penn's daughter. One will not be disappointed after watching \\"I Am Sam\\". Some will leave influenced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sam-A Movie with True Heart","review":"I have seen this movie several times--I have never gotten tired of seeing it. Sean Penn takes his acting ability to a new level--definitely a movie with heart. Michelle--what can I say? She plays her part to a definite degree of perfection. With Sean and Michelle playing off each other and the storyline being what it is, definitely a winner. The movie industry has lost the essence of what it means to make a movie with feeling. I believe \\"I Am Sam\\" has it all and reinstates the human spirit--the way we all should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't good","review":"When i first heard about this movie, I thought that it was going to be very sad and emotional, but it turns out that it wasn't(Only the idea and plot is). In this movie you are supposed to feel sorry for the mentally challenged guy(the main character), but for some reason I thought he was just plain stupid. No, my heart did not melt and I did not cry when he said \\"I want my baby back!\\" I actually laughed, because it was the complete opposite of sad, and i honestly(realistically) don't think that he should of been a loud to have a child...its abuse!(By the way, for the movie sountrack and throughout the film, why didn't they put the original Beatles songs, instead of \\"cover\\" wannabe bands?...they probably didn't want the audience to focus completely on the music maybe and not on the actual movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"a rare hollywood gem","review":"this movie makes you think about how we a society treats people. sean penn and Michelle pfeiffer give great performences. and little dakota steals your heart. this movie will make you cry Michelle Pfeiffer's charater sure made me cry and sean penn's sam is so loveable. every one should see this film weather or not it looks good to them"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst movies I've ever seen","review":"This movie exploits common stereotypes about mentally challenged people rendering a stick figure world filled with simplifications, distortions and outright falsehoods about the reality of living with mental disabilities. The acting is horrid and the plot is downright stupid. The movie is also filled with cheesy gimmicks to engineer a compassionate, emotion-filled response from the audience that would have been avant garde for the 1950's. The ending, with a nauseating dance number with flowery music was simply worthy of a missile attack on the director/writers. This movie is ultimately empty of validity. This movie is a fraud. Rent it first before you buy it. I guarantee you will end up not buying it, or asking for your rental fee back...."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotional triumph.","review":"An outstanding cast of actors/actresses that bring the viewer into the movie with full heart. This movie cannot help but move the viewer into compassion, There is a parallel continuously in the lives of the main characters, love, fear, hope . People that see this movie cannot help but look into their own hearts and the mirror and wonder if they themselves could see true love when it is absolutely necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece ...","review":"I went into this movie with a completely open mind. I am a big Sean Penn fan and have even learned to tolerate Michelle Pfeiffer. This movie is a [not what I expected]. I don't think that I have ever seen a movie which treated the viewer more like an idiot than this movie does. We are lead to believe that Sam has the intellect of a 7 year old but throughout the film he uses terms such as \\"harass\\", \\"constancy\\", among others, appropriately and with a certain level of sophistication. If you are really looking for a movie that undermines your intellect and treats you as the one that is intellectually challenged then this is the one for you. If not....skip the movie and get the soundtrack....the only worthwhile piece of this production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulation at its best.","review":"I didn't want to see this movie when it was out in the theater because I thought judging by the movie trailer that it was a movie that was designed to pull at your heart strings. And I was right. The whole 'all you need is love' is a nice song, but doesn't work in the real world. Unfortunately we all need more than just love to get by in this world. I see parents professing their love for the children on the news. Telling the camera crew that their child would never hurt anyone-they didn't shoot, kill, or do any of the things the police is accusing them of. Loving parents are pulling their hair out over drug-addicted children or just plain bad as hell. It takes more than love to raise a child. End of story. The two stars are for Dakota Fanning and Michelle Pfeiffer-good acting chops. Penn I thought tried a little too hard."},{"rating":"2","title":"tears","review":"I never cried so much watching a movie. Even my husband got all emotianal. Lovely story but so sad. Sean Penn is just great.

When it arrived, it would not read in any dvd player in my home. Im very upset!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of The Best Films Of Its Type","review":"Some directorial problems in the beginning (i.e. music video style camerawork)do not prevent this film from being considered a classic in the genre of movies about the disabled or ill. Love Penn's performance. He is so good in everything he does. Michelle Pfeiffer really surprised me here...She gives one of her best performances. What also surprised me was how the film never had to force anything (i.e. humor, or the emotional stuff). The ending section of the film is very strong with some great supporting work by Diane Weist and Laura Dern. The music/soundtrack is also top notch with Beatles covers by everyone from Michael Pen and Aimee Mann, Ben Harper and Eddie Vedder."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartfelt Winner","review":"I loved I Am Sam! I think this movie was very well executed and I was extremely touched by Sean Penn's portrayal of a mentally challenged father. I personally, was rooting for him to win the academy award and felt he did a wonderful job maintaining consistency in his performance. However, six year old Dakota Fanning stole the show. Most often it was her enlightening wisdom and compassion that drove me to tears. I loved this movie and felt the resolution pleasing! I saw it three times in theaters and am going to purchase the DVD. You must see this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shouldn't have been surprised...","review":"Robert Downey Jr. was right when he said in the movie Tropic Thunder: \\"Never go full retard\\". Penn disregarded this advice at his own peril."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"Very emotional moving movie. Definitely good for those who wish to get a glimpse into the life of those who are mentally challenged."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally moving but misguided","review":"In what real world situation does anyone really think a man functioning on the level of a 7 year old, should raise a child? I would never leave one of my children in the full time care of a 7 year old for even an hour.This is a wonderful movie. The acting is superb and it pulls your heartstrings deeply. It really does cause you to lose grip with reality and side with the mentally challenged, Sam. But in the end, nobody should be fooled into believing this nicey nice, pc bull. in the real world a child should never be raised by a person this impaired and Sam who claims to love the child, should have taken the offer at permanent foster family with visitation rights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better watch \\"Rain Man\\" oder \\"Forest Gump\\"","review":"\\"Rain Man\\" starring Dustin Hoffman as an autistic man was a masterpiece, \\"Forrest Gump\\" starring Tom Hanks was o.k. since it at least contained a certain amount of wisdom, but \\"I am Sam\\" is not much more than a superficial schmaltzy, kitschy tear-jerker.Two stars for the certainly good acting of Sean Penn, Michelle Pfeiffer and Dakota Fanning, but the whole movie itself leaves one somehow unsatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love this movie","review":"I think anybody who does not love this movie has become to cynical.I am not sentimental by any stretch, and I tend to overthink everything all the time, and despite this, I love this movie.

What's not to love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Know You Came Here Because You Think You Like This Film","review":"Usually folks don't like negative reviews......if you really like stories about underdogs, you will like this film. However, if you need some reality touchstones, there are simply too many Hollywood PR machine touches to the script.....it is just too far out and for me it destroyed any shred of credibility for the story. Sure Penn does his usual credible acting job, but the script is too far out.....keep it up Sean and you'll be like Hanks.....all the cute scripts for the no-brainers out there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie in a long time","review":"As being the son of a special education teacher I have come in contact with people such as this. The movie was specially made to make you cry, the plot is a mentally retarted man named sam tries to take care of a 7 year old daughter who eventually gets taken away by social services. Sam fights to get his daughter back in custody and I so wanted him to win. But I knew deep down that sam counld not take care of this child even thought thats what the movie makes you want."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unwatchable, Indigestible","review":"This movie is so terrible I still have to laugh, thinking about it. Mawkish and sentimental are not insulting enough terms for this manipulative waste of perfectly good celluloid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why actors want to play unfortunate SPED people","review":"It just has to be for the Academy Award that most actors pretend they don't want but really would do anything and I mean ANYTHING to get. Well, anyway, we all know how talented Sean Penn is but like most of the actors of his generation they have lost their sense of humor and take EVERYTHING far too serious. I really think alot of them have their sights set on political careers. This movie should have worked but it dosen't it was kind of creepy for some reason and even though all the acting was fine. And is Dakota Fanning the only child star in Hollyweird? Because she seems to be in every other movie produced this year. This movie is really for die hard Penn fans.

The killer blow came with the following turgid and ridiculous description of a meal time: \\"Nicholai made fortifications with his potatoes,forked waves into a gravy moat.Caraway seed men attacked and defended; the sausage battering ram won through.Madga had saved a portion of fruit compote for him. She ladled cream.He plunged a spoon through the white lake to the red current depths,then swirled the two into a Catherine wheel.\\" Good grief.

This is the first Cuts full-length which contains that track as well as other standouts such as \\"Salt In My Wounds.\\" I was very impressed by the guitar tones and production throughout. The inevitable comparisons to groups of yore are not a fault of this music. The Cuts appear to be rock scholars reinvigorating and reconfiguring near-forgotten music forms for a contemporary audience. A thoroughly relevant and important act in this sad age of Pro-Tools soullessness. I had tried to find this release earlier, only to find it out of print. This reissue is very welcome."},{"rating":"2","title":"For those just getting introduced to Steve's music, it'll do.++++","review":"Albeit, it is not the 'ultimate' introductory collection(too many S.E. standards are missing). But, for someone who is just getting into Earle's music, it encompasses a fairly wide variety of what they can expect from this multi-talented performer. In my opinion, the 'highlight' of this collection is the mixture of 'live' cuts mixed in with the wide variety of studio cuts.It definitely does not rate up there with an 'Exit O' or an 'El Corazon', lest we forget that it is simply a compilation of a lot of good Steve Earle songs...And in that case A++++"},{"rating":"2","title":"Although it is a Mavericks album","review":"When i download it into my i-tunes, the get info credits go to The Mavericks.

However as KISS marched through the 80's with different personel, some albums shined and some didn't. I don't know if they were actually trying to get on the glam wagon that all started with Motley Crue's Theatre of Pain, or if they really enjoyed dancing on MTV wearing clothes that looked like they were designed by Salvador Dali. The bottom line always has been the music, so let's talk about that. I thought the songs were good. I liked 'Secretly Cruel' and 'Uh! All Night' the best. If you look past the videos and just listen to the music, you'll probably enjoy it. It's not as hard rocking as others, but it's overall OK. If you're looking for the best KISS album of the eighties, Lick It Up is by far the best"},{"rating":"1","title":"their ugly album!","review":"ASYLUM is easily my least favorite KISS album!

The rest of this, aside from the chorus to \\"LOVE'SA DEADLY WEAPON\\", is junk; bottom of the barrel KISS. \\"UH!ALLNIGHT\\" is my least favorite KISS song of all time.

The cover is ugly, as are the photos ofthe band members and the production...."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Album In KISSTORY!","review":"That is if you do not count \\"Carnival Of Souls\\" as a KISS album. This album began the real downfall of KISS in the mid-80s. Some of the worst songwriting in KISStory matched with the lack of talent from Bruce Kulick make for one sorry album. Seems KISS agreed the album stuck since only 2 songs were part of the regular set list during the Asylum tour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the Asylum; The MTV Era","review":"I really like this record. I think ALL of Paul's songs are great. The album is more rockin' and fun than Animalize. And Gene's songs aren't bad. Paul's \\"King of the Mountain\\" is cool; obviously \\"Tears are Falling\\" is a Kiss classic that recently got new life by being played on the Rock the Nation tour. \\"Who Wants to Be Lonely\\" I've always liked and I think it's like the \\"Sure Know Something\\" of the 80's. My favorite and I still think it's a cool song is \\"Uh! All Night\\". Gene's tunes are good this time especially \\"Trial By Fire\\" and \\"Secretly Cruel\\". But \\"Anyway you Slice It\\" and \\"Love's a Deadly Weapon\\" are silly, but they at least sound cool and are fun and they rock hard. Hey,it was the 80's...and Kiss was trying to compete with Bon Jovi and Poison. Let's not forget how they owned Dial MTV from like 1984-1990.

A very inspired Paul Stanley and crew wrote great songs like \\"tears are falling\\", \\"who wants to be lonely?\\", \\"uh all night\\", \\"trial by fire\\". There's a total change in the dynamics of the songs, just pay attention at the guitars: refined and original strumming. This is the first with Bruce Kulick and you can tell the difference right away, his solos are great. Lick it up has a couple of good songs, Animalize is the weakest, Creatures of the night almost there, The elder was hard to get, Unmasked way too pop and the same with Crazy nights, but Asylum has consistency all the way, and that is what makes it so good without losing the heaviness. Good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gene on lne 1.","review":"'King of the Mountàin' is Paul's best song since 'Love Gun' and damn if 'Tears' doesn't score a solid artstic hit with 'Who Wants to be Lonely?' and 'Love's a Deadly Weapon' gettng points for effort. Erc puts more of a stamp on this and Bruce does (or is it Jean Beavoir?) a good Gene bass impression; Gene's auto-pilot when it omes to, you know, actually making the records approaching critical mass. And Paul ends up throwing in the towel too, the remaining tracks on here...I'm still cleaning the chunks of my walls that this record spewed out of the speakers. It's like that feeling you get when you watch four hours of daytime TV while pounding glazed doughnuts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take his crackpipe away!!","review":"That guy that said Asylum was the definitive Kiss album is out of his mind. This was one of their worst albums and to call it definitive is an insult. Dressed To Kill and Destroyer are definitive albums. They didn't have one release in the 80's that was worth even 3 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has Some Moments","review":"This release is a bit more commericial than Animalize and Lick it Up. All the songs have energy, but most of them still are forgettable. The best songs are \\"Tears Are Falling,\\" \\"Uh! All Night,\\" and \\"Who Wants to be Lonely.\\" Those three are actually good songs, but unfortunately the rest of the songs don't match up. I give this album 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad But Far From Good","review":"I've heard worse albums so this one is not too bad.With the songs Tears Are Falling and Who Wants To Be Lonely at least Paul Stanley is trying to write decent material.Anyway You Slice It is actually the best Gene Simmons song of the unmasked period.The rest is drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY AN EARLIER EDITION!!","review":"The editor of this book butchered it so atrociously, it would flunk as a high school English assignment. While the information may be useful, extracting a complete idea from the sentence fragments, hopelessly vague grammar, and editor's irrelevant digressions and contentions requires extra labor. This edition is as much about P.A. Yeoman's personal beliefs and business as it is keyline planning. See an earlier edition for all the information and none of the fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water for Every Farm","review":"Excellent time tested material on developing fertile land and using water carefully. Mr. PA Yoemans spent a lifetime developing the recommendations in this book and his son provides a very beneficial update to the original work with updated examples of the recommendations as implemented. Tremendous resource of information and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving up!","review":"I first came across this dictionary whilst on a Spanish language course in Puebla, México. I thought it would be great to use with my senior Spanish language students when studying Spanish text instead of a Spanish-English dictionary. They find using this dictionary quite a challenge but it is expanding their vocabulary and allows the class to continually use Spanish instead of code-switching to English. The students would like pictures to qualify the fifth star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie on Amazon.","review":"I watched the movie once and threw it in the trash.

A friend recommended that I read It Takes More Than Love. It is filled with very practical, hands-on advice. I've already put lots of their suggestions to use. What I especially like is that it is written in a very easy to read style that is not full of jargon. Reading many parts made me think they must know exactly what I am experiencing. I'd recommend it to anyone who is caring for a family member."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really wonderful book by an awesome teacher!!!","review":"I had the distinct privilege of working with Ben as his teaching assistant a few years ago, and I can say that he created pure magic in the classroom!! The way he works with children and their ideas is very respectful and provocative at the same time. Children are encouraged to try things, to make mistakes, and to learn. It was one of my favourite teaching experiences to date, and I looked forward to all that we did in the classroom every day. I read this book while working with him, and found that the real life experience of working with Ben was very memorable and amazing, as he showed his enthusiasm and dedication in all he did. And the children love him!! I would highly recommend this book to all who are interested in early childhood education, and to all who want to encourage children to do their best learning in the classroom and at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing read","review":"I am a kingergarten teacher, and I learned so much from this book.

I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here, There and Yonder","review":"This is a reprint of the book \\"Here, There and Yonder\\" by Robert W Brinson originally published in 1982. Thomas Brinson (b 1610) came to America in the mid 1600s and the book tracks the descendants of his grandson Cason Brinson (ca 1693). Cason came to Pamlico County, NC in the early 1700s. Many of his desendants are still in that area. Some of his descendants were among the first American families to enter Texas about 1821. The book has 900 pages. The author had a heart attack and died before he could do a final check of the publishers draft copy. As a result there are some errors that he would have corrected but all in all this is a great book on the desendants of Cason Brinson."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Big Piece of Crap","review":"After seeing that this was an \\"acoustic tribute\\", I decided to check out the amazon page for the cd... I never even bought it because the songs were terrible. Anytime one band wants to cover another band, they should make sure they are acutally talented. The singer in this garbage sounds like he is straining his voice. The rapper sounds like he loses his breath a couple of times and the songs sound crappy. I was hoping someone would come out with an acoustic Linkin Park album. I would prefer it be Linkin Park... But if they never do and someone else decides they want to do it, please bring some talent to the studio so we can all sleep better at night... Thank You."},{"rating":"1","title":"idiot music saves this CD from 1 star","review":"This CD is....

The ONLY fair song is idiot music, other tracks are horrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Good Laugh for LP fans","review":"Ok, so one of the coolest aspects of Linkin Park is their hard guitar riffs and of course the screaming. Not to mention the rap side of the band. Now, this cd has accoustic guitars and bongos. That should say something right there. (SUCKY). But besides that, I wonder if these goths are even trying to immitate Linkin Park. Sadly, I think that they are. They cant sing on key, cant rap, cant do any of the screaming, or anything else they are entitled to do when doing a tribute to Linkin Park.So Im a pretty hardcore Linkin Park fan. I have all the albums and ive seen them live twice. Now, if your someone like me, this lazy crap-for-crap \\"Gothic Tribute\\" CD is just downright funny. I laughed so hard i cried.Oh yeah. I didnt even buy the cd. I just listened to the samples."},{"rating":"1","title":"No no seriously... this one sucks","review":"Not only does this sound like it was recorded in a bathroom stall, but whoever's singing sounds horribly strained. I sounds like crappy acapella - without any semblance of Harmony. Digital mastering and production does a lot for Linkin Park, and talent does quite a bit too. These guys have neither. I've heard horrible music before, but this may be the worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"major suckage.","review":"Okay.

If you somehow were unaware that this book is just another training manual for the Fellowship sheep-shearing machine, you'd do well to move on to more reputable Fourth Way material. I'm pretty confident the author is not destined to be remembered as another Ouspensky, or even another Bennett or Nicoll, but if at all as a rather dull man who facilitated Robert Burton's appetite for predatory sex."},{"rating":"1","title":"total misrepresentation of product offered","review":"I thought I found a used, or slightly defective product.

Up popped this selection with a very confusing title. but a picture of a large dog in a large dog HOUSE. When I saw the $20 price, I assumed based on my past experience w/ Amazon that maybe there was a color defect, overstock situation, cash flow need, etc. I ordered the dog house and got a dog DOOR instead.

It is worthy reading it because we can learn how to use a few words to describe a person's character so clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Naughty Austen!","review":"That Jane, she is such a naughty writer. For those of you who think her the height of Victorian respectability and prudence, delve into the tale where she shows her wickedly funny side.This is a collection of letters, rather than a traditional novel. She wrote this in notebooks prior to becoming an adult and it reads like the 'rough drafts' it probably was. Actually most of the book reads like a really funny Saturday Night Live skit.It is a story told through letters about a young couple in love. Naturally, one of them dies and the other is left to carry on in a cruel and wicked world. Sound sad? Not an all! The entire thing is a parody of the sentimentality that was so popular in the novels of the time. A tongue in cheek classic that was delight from the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"I'm a huge Jane Austen fan, and while this work isn't sophisticated, polished, or well-known, it is FANTASTIC. Non-standard use of spelling and grammar aside (it definitely bothered me at first, but as another reviewer mentioned, there weren't many writing \\"standards\\" at that time so I had to forgive Ms. Austen and move on), this book has become one of my favorites. It is the creative writing of a talented young author with a fine-tuned sense of humor who hasn't yet mastered her gift. I laughed out loud many times, and I recognized some aspects/characteristics/speech of characters who appeared in some of her later novels. It's definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very immature work of a wonderful writer","review":"There's a reason this did not appear during the author's lifetime.

Treck and although this isn't the best episode this is a good way for other people to see all the series. Kate Mulgrew is as good as ever- so don't pull her down.

So as he's selling expensive wine to rich people, he's also stealing their jewels. And he's also cheating on his wife (Davis) with the beautiful nanny (J.Lo). And his stepson (Dorff) absolutely hates him. And his partner in crime (Caine) is an ailing psychotic. And that's just the background to the story.There are plenty of good twists and turns in this thriller. The direction is great, as is the acting from everyone.

The third time Jack Nicholson's character gets beaten with his own golf clubs you're torn between wishing they'd just kill him already and wishing they'd kill you instead so you don't have to sit through anymore of this crap.Save your time and your money, turn around and walk away from this one.

Why?1. Support staff at Panasonic don't speak clearly; Panasonic's outsourced their 800- number to the planet of mumblers.2. They refer all callers to the selling dealer. Does Amazon provide support if you have a problem with something bought from Amazon?3. User Guide is cryptic, unclear and written in Japlish. It uses unidentified icons in the instructions with no textual explanation (i.e., the One-touch Dialling and Personal Speed Dialling (sic) instructions on page 2). Naturally, said instructions don't work.In summary, Panasonic telephones are NOT recommended. I'm saddened, because I've been happily installing Panasonic phone systems for the past 30 years, ever since I left telco, but they've cheapened essential support to the point where I cannot recommend it any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"Phillips defibrillators are the best.

The first half of this film is boring and becomes stagnant to the point of wanting to fast-forward. I kept hoping for some over-the-top histrionics which are a Crawford trademark. The only satisfaction I got was from the typewriter scene listening to her odd, gurgling wails, and the encounter with Vera Miles and Lorne Greene outside her bungalow. If you're looking for camp, watch Strait-Jacket again, and avoid Autumn Leaves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!!!","review":"This has got to be the worst Joan Crawford movie I have ever seen!!

The main character is well developed; the emotions of the father of the murdered girl are well represented, however, the other characters could use some serious development.

Selznick production is brimming with lovely and innocent emotions that are all too out-of-fashion in today's cynical world. Each scene is carefully constructed, with wonderful, warm and kindly touches. Each part is beautifully acted, especially the young Freddie Bartholomew (a few years before another excellent role in Captains Courageous). And the story is one of redemption and good vs. meanness.

It is also a powerful insider's look at the personal compromises and trade-offs women, in particular, must make in order to prevail as torch-bearers. Particularly touching is the recounting of Eleanor's childhood where she consistently overrode her intense longing for connection and home with action and organization. This childhood pattern would become the watchword of her life. Also fascinating is the history of her forebears in slavery and her fights at the EEOC. Lester lets us see Eleanor as a whole person, warts and all. It is a fascinating and compelling read and a clear portrayal of what it takes to succeed as a woman in a man's political world. I only wish there were more women like Eleanor to help keep the torch burning!"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading!","review":"I bought this book because the description on the cover made it out to be a great romance novel about love and war. Instead, this book is twisted, dark and just a big let down. The many tragic events in the book are just too extreme and depressing. Not only that, but once you get to the last chapters the ending becomes very predictable and feels as though it was done in a rush because the author already drove the book into such darkness that she needed to find something (no matter how unimaginative) and quick. I would'nt recommend this book to anyone looking for something romanic or uplifting and I don't think that publishers should mislead buyers with their book descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book","review":"Started reading right away.

This book is a HUGE exception! Fallen Skies is a horribly depressing book. Granted, any book depicting the trauma experienced by war veterans can have a tendency to be depressing but every aspect of this book was depressing. The story is incredibly slow and tedious and the characters are not likeable at all. Each new chapter contained more death, rape, kidnapping, murder and general unhappiness than the last. If you enjoy stories about husbands who rape their wives, try to murder their own children, stab babies to death and make everyone miserable, then this is the book for you. Otherwise, don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak beginning, strong ending","review":"I've read 10+ of Philippa Gregory's historical novels, and enjoyed them all. However, when I was first reading it, I didn't much care about either of the two main characters or what happened to them. They both had plenty of flaws. Just when I would begin to sympathize with one of them, they make another bad decision.I'm updating now since I finished the book yesterday. Once I decided which characters I wanted to root for, I became more engaged in the story.The author crafts several intriguing plot twists, and more than one dark secret is revealed by the end.

It was the first thing I ordered! However, it proved to be a huge disappointment: totally lacking in the character development and sense of era recreation that I feel most of us look forward to in her work. Her characters are flat and very one-dimensional and therefore difficult to become involved with or care about. It's as though the author is reporting in print what is being seen through a video recorder set above her characters rather than taking the reader into the action. Dialogue is stilted. And WHAT is going on with that final plot twist that ends the novel? It was almost like the classic ending from the \\"Michael O'Donahue's (SNL Writer) School of How to Write Good\\" satire..\\"Suddenly, everyone is run over by a truck.\\" I was very unhappy I wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who gave this book a poor rating. I quit reading it only 1/3 of the way through, because it was going downhill so fast.

However this book is typical of many in the same category: Abzug is a great historian, but not a very good writer. When reading this book it seems that one must translate every sentence into \\"regular\\" English. Abzug is simply hard to understand. However, it would be suspected that anyone who reads this book has some background in the field of antebellum time period and especially reform in New England in the early-to-mid-19th century.Cosmos Crumbling provides some interesting perspectives, but it's a hard read, and when finished you'll probably still be left wondering what Abzug is trying to say.

Sadly, this doesn't appear to be his writing. I'm pretty sure his brand name was pimped out to a scientist. There's no excuse for writing this bad. The author has no sense of verse and his writing style has no rythym to it. In fact, some of the ultra-scientific sentences are so long and incomprehensible, your toddler will have no idea what the freak you are talking about, and neither will you. This was clearly written by a scientist, not a true writer. I'm giving it two stars only because the illustrations are nicely done.

Definitely.The second is an argument in favor of the Necronomicon's existence, which critiques its critics, including our book, THE NECRONOMICON FILES. I'd recommend that readers double-check what Simon says against other sources as much as possible. I've already found one talking point that originates in a roleplaying game, and another where the source Simon cites contradicts what he wrote.

And there really isn't much history to it. He borrows a lot from books by Robert Anton Wilson and others, calling it his owns life. Very sad.

This introspective collection of her journal entries and memories shines with her acerbic brilliance. Her circle of \`friends' included just about all the famous people of her era: Fitzgerald, Hemingway, Dorothy Parker, Faulkner, and of course Dashiell Hammett, her lover, friend, and confidant.

Terry Whalin has been both a writer and editor for many years, and he shares information about the publishing business that only an insider can know. Number One is that editors prefer a well-written proposal over a completed manuscript. (Surprised? I was!) Brilliant writing alone won't get you a contract. Editors don't have time to read voluminous manuscripts, so they rely on well-crafted proposals. And they receive thousands of proposals each year. You need a proposal that will stand out from all the others, one that says, \\"Read me. Don't put me in the rejection pile.\\" BOOK PROPOSALS THAT SELL gives step-by-step instructions on how to write a proposal and explains the \\"WHY\\" of each individual step.

The book presents a comprehensive guide to writing nonfiction book proposals. If you've completed a novel you want to market, you will also need to write a book proposal; many parts of this book will apply to the fiction writer's book proposal.

The album was recorded somewhat haphazardly and apparently in various stages of inebriation, but this all adds to the tragic thematic continuity and tone of the album. What makes this album so refreshing is that its production is not highly polished like Young's more recent efforts. What you get here is a collection of well-written, painfully honest songs that are devoid of the cliches that occasionally mar Young's work. There isn't a bad song on the entire album. These are songs of experience that will resonate deeply if you are looking for an album that provides a penetrating insight into humanity's struggle with tragedy and loss. And, by the way, the album also consistently provides some of the excellent rock music we all love and adore in Neil's collaborations with Crazy Horse. This album will likely be a permanent fixture in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid, raw variety of Young, non-radio, classics","review":"What \\"Tonight's the Night\\" lacks in momentum, it gains in variety. This CD doesn't flow like his previous efforts, much less future recordings, but none of his other CDs takes you on an emotional roller coaster like this one. It's sort of the \\"Disintegration (by The Cure)\\" of its time, recorded during a dark period of Young's life where the music and lyrics just came out naturally. An effective maniupulater of moods, \\"Tonight's the Night\\" is pleasing to the senses - pleading, lazily swanky, and resolved. \\"Albaqurque, Roll Another Number, and Let's Go Downtown\\" are great tunes, as is the title song. The mood of this CD was a perfect fit for the mid 70s, and at a time when grunge is well entrenched in the minds of many modern rock artists - if not explicitly displayed - this CD is a great listen. Solid from beginning to end, it's a must add to any size Neil Young collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neil Young At His Most Depressing Best","review":"All of the criticisms of this album/CD are accurate and I still think that it is a worthwhile addition to any collection. The vinyl album record cover had a spooky pic of Crazy Horse with each band mamber identified by name with no image of anyone standing in the spot labeled \\"Danny Whitten\\", and so the journey into addiction, death, reclusion, introversion, and depression begins. It appears that Young himself was experiencing his own personal trauma of the events of those days and it shows. You may not like the questions. You may not like the answers. But, you may grow to like the music, \\"late at night when the people were gone...\\" which is probably both the best time and the worst time to listen to Tonight's the Night."},{"rating":"2","title":"By Far Neil Young's Best Album!!!","review":"Neil Young recorded this album in an warehouse (in two weeks). He and his fellow band mates would spend all day playing music and drinking Tequila, and wouldn't begin recording until very late at night (or early in the morning depending on how you look at it). They usually only did two or three takes per song. This style of recording results in a raw, spontaneous masterpiece. It is definitly darker than his previous albums, and isn't as clean, for it is here that his grunge side was born. The whole album is absolutly solid. Highlight tracks include: \\"Mellow my mind\\", \\"Lookout Joe\\", \\"Speakin' out\\" and \\"Tonight's the Night\\".

Fine for them; work it out however you have to. But why a listener should have to pay for such indulgence is beyond me. Young is not afraid to record mistakes nor to release them.

The deaths of guitarist Danny Whitten and roadie Bruce Barry moved Young to write the single greastest statement against drug use you'll ever hear. I say this because the record is musically as powerful as anything he's done and it is never, ever preachy. Young and Crazy Horse sound burned out, but that only adds to the raw authenticity. If you only own one Young CD, this should be the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Although there are many this IS Neil's masterpiece","review":"All I can say about this album that above all others it captures Rock (with a bold capital R) music in all it's ugliness and excess.

The masses languish in squalor and misery while the powers that be swim in affluence. If you ever wanted to know how the tax payers' money in most African countries is spent, this novel is worth reading. Laudably, time is against these ticks. What has always seemed an elephant for this propertied and privileged class is slowly turning into a grave. More than anything else, Armah's diction and description place him on the map of revered African novelists."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hate This Book","review":"Achebe was correct when he described this book as a sick book. It is. Just disgusting and trying to hard to be sophisticated, ie, \\"European\\". The description by Achebe that Armah's book reminds him of the Jean Paul Sartre novel where two characters sit around looking bored in a cafe in Paris and then in a burst of nihilistic energy decide to stab themselves to make some obscure point to each other. He's on the money. Unfortunately Armah came on the scene when publishing in Africa was not more discriminating."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Beautyful Ones Are Not Yet Born","review":"I have just completed this book and can only say that i would not have read it had i not been required to. It is the story of a poor man in a material world who, despite the pressures around and within him, is able to maintain a sense of dignity within himself. The author manages to create vivd scenes of filth and vileness throughout the novel but the plot leaves something to be desired. Characters are vague and action begins very late in the text. Despite valiant attempts to create a classic, this book still belongs in the attic with all the other dusty volumes. The only people i would recommend this to would be those who love descriptions and those who act too perky."},{"rating":"2","title":"The stuff that nobel literature prizes are made of.","review":"Not any one of Soyinka's or Achebe's books can hold a candle to this particular work by Ayi Kwei Armah. I studied this book for a critical appreciation of Literature course at University in the '80s and until this moment the grating images of corruption and a derelict society that breeds corruption upon itself still erupts vividly in my head. Ayi Kwei Armah succinctly and subtly depicts corruption through his writing with bold imagery and flawless writing.You would pick this book up to read three decades after it was written, and it would still seem like a novel that just came out; it still rings true to this day in many corrupt societies and it is a book that should be up there with the greatest literary giants of our time.T.J.

I understand that satire was involved here. I enjoyed the story overall, particularly the survivalist aspects of it and also the last third of the story. It was an interesting look on the human condition and the history of civilization. My only complaint was the dialogue in the first part of the book. Just awful. I was also a little incredulous about how quickly 20-something woman falls into the arms of 60-something man, as well as daughter offering herself up to Daddy. Other than that, a good story with an interesting sci-fi aspect to it. I think it's a good read for those that are fans of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlikeable protagonist and blatant soapboxing","review":"I'm a big fan of Heinlein in general -- both pre- and post- \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\". I've read nearly all of his novels, and enjoyed them all -- except for this one. I had a problem with how unlikeable the \\"hero\\" was and how unrealistic his interactions with the other characters were. Usually I like character motivation and behavior to flow with the plot more realistically, even in fantastic situations like science fiction novels. That didn't really happen for me with this book, though. The \\"hero\\" seemed to be there more as a mouthpiece for a political philosophy, and that kind of soapboxing by an author often overshadows the story itself. It certainly did in this case for me. I wouldn't recommend this as your first Heinlein novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Heinlein's best","review":"Submitted for your approval... one Hugh Farnham, the slightly henpecked patriarch of a typical \\"Father Knows Best\\" 1950's family. He is a man ridiculed by his loved ones for building a basement bomb shelter and endlessly scanning newscasts for any signs of Commie aggression. But when the Reds drop the big one right in Uncle Sam's backyard, Hugh and his clan, his house boy and daughter's friend Barbara, gets more than some radioactive fallout. They are transported into a future dimension where the Africans rule and all others are slaves.Flat pros, one-dimensional characters and stiff dialogue keeps this flight of fantasy earthbound. Some might be shocked by its treatment of sexuality in a post apocalyptic world, others by its depiction of racial stereotyping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Post WWII Era values?","review":"Yes, this story gives good and bad. For the good you have a conservative older man who builds a bomb shelter to attempt to save his family from being destroyed in a nuclear war with Russia. The concept is not new although he was writing about it before it became a popular storyline. The bad news is that he begins to discuss 'deviant' sexual behavior, primarily when his adult daughter admits to the main character 'Hugh' that he was welcome to have her sexually. Now he of course declines but the very discussion was repulsive, they were of the belief that the small band of survivors were the only people to survive but still! If you and your daughter were the last 2 people on earth I would hope her virtue would be safe. What kind of mind thinks of such awful things? As a story FREEHOLD was quite good and I recommend it. Just beware that it has some odd mores exhibited within. I do recommend this novel but some of his later works tend to be sexually twisted."},{"rating":"1","title":"By far the worst","review":"I agree with Mr. Farris, except that the negatives he cites were more than enough to turn me off.

I gave it a 2 for what I thought of as an inspired plot, but pan the rest due to really, really, really poorly conceived characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I love Heinlein's early stuff. His later stuff is often preachy with the pacing of molasses in a New England winter. And then there is this.It's the pacing of the early work, with the preaching like quality of the later, and characters I find it hard to believe Heinlein created.None of the characters are really all that believable. They are flat and inconsistant in their behavior. Even the Ayn Rand-esque main protagonist seems poorly thought out and tiresome.The story has many interesting points, and some of the future society ideas are very well done. But the plot that they backdrop is far less interesting. I often wondered where events were coming from.

For Heinlein to harvest this story beyond the first chapter is confusing and at the same time laughable. The story zips along as if it is contrived of paper dolls and cartoon images.

And that's putting it politely; both West and Pappalardi seem to be phoning it in, and drummer Schwartzberg - aside from being no Corky Laing (one of the most underrated hard rock drummers of the early 1970s) - is more sledgehammer than rhythm expander. The original double album included a two-sides-long version of \\"Nantucket Sleighride\\" that seemed an exercise in lost self-indulgence upon original release, and it still sounds that way. If you're a longtime Mountain fan, you've heard way better from them. This album is thoroughly unworthy of them even today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Great Performance","review":"As a long-time fan of Mountain, I found this set to be far less than satisfactory. Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, but Corky Laing and Steve Knight are absent, replaced by Bob Mann and Alan Schwartzberg, neither of whom plays well. Mann's guitar/keyboard work is surpassed in its awfulness only by Schwartzberg's drumming, which is simply dreadful. However, no one in this lineup appears to have any real enthusiasm, slogging through one ragged number after another. The version of \\"Nantucket Sleighride\\" is so long that it soon becomes an exercise in pure tedium; it's a wonder that anyone in the audience was able to stay awake all the way through. None of the other cuts on this album is much better; in fact, the highlight is the moment during Leslie's \\"Guitar Solo\\" when a speaker blows; the rest of the album merely blows. This entire set sounds like a contractual obligation, and nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best","review":"For those who are familiar with the earlier work of Mountain, this one is a major disappointment. Although both Leslie West and Felix Pappalardi are here, neither is in top form, and Alan Schwartzberg proves that he is no Corky Laing. Much like John Bonham, Corky Laing played a significant role in defining the sound of his band; Schwartzberg is mediocre in comparison. Bob Mann adds nothing to the mix, and is about as inconspicuous (and insignificant) as Steve Knight. The performances are ragged, and Felix sounds especially tired (or bored). The half-hour-plus rendition of \\"Nantucket Sleighride\\" is overblown, ridiculously long, and boring. There is nothing here that hasn't been done much better somewhere else, making this a must for completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why buy it when it's so easy to make yourself?","review":"Never thought I would see people actually buying simple syrup.

Paul Stanley really shines on this release though and holds much of the album up by contributing the majority of the vocals. Gene Simmons songs are good too.All in all, it's not a bad album, but, it definitely could have used a little more of an edge to it all in order to make it truly great.Standout tracks are Crazy Nights, No, No, No, When Your Walls Come Down, Reason To Live, and Girl Gone Bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS New Wave!","review":"Crazy Nights album shows KISS as a New Wave band of the 80's doing very well.

Then, I went on to take AP,Princeton Review is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD BOOK TO STUDY WITH","review":"I bought this book cause the barron's SAT II Math IIC worked for me (800). I basically don't have knowledge in Physics so I tried to study this book really hard in order to get at least over 600. This book is hard to understand, doesn't have many examples, it's really hard to follow the format, boring, and you have to read the stuff that you don't understand. This book brought me solid 540 in my test, and for next SAT II Physics test, I'm not using this book to study. Especially the explanations for the questions are really hard to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like many people who are so angry about this book~","review":"I have studied a lot of physics in the last few years, and I've eventually learned enough physics to get me through half of college - I even got a gold medal in the IPhO~As someone who have studied physics that much, I were able to understand what the authors have originally intended to do when they wrote this book. But not all people are using this book just for last-minute reviews. I'd say that without a complete understanding of basic concepts, this book would confuse you.The problems in the back aren't very close to the real tests, and I agree it contains a lot of errors. But if you have a firm basis on physics, and just want to solve some problems before the actual test, it's okay. It's a lot more difficult than the real one, so there won't be any surprises on the test day. Just use this book with some other one - this just isn't enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"are you ready to be a professional physicists?","review":"ok, basically i took AS physics (british system) and did pretty bad (D.) I decided to take the SAT 2 physics to show what im really made of to the universities, and this book came along. Essentially this book is difficult to comprehend, its probably useful to study it with a tutor. It has so much detail most of it does not come up in the exam, but knowing more than what is needed is better than knowing less. I got 690 which isnt entirely good i.e 800 but its acceptable. I did this without a tutor so one might succeed with a tutor and this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a Physics instructor","review":"This book summarizes many important subject matters by avoiding many fundamental explanations and description.

I'm attending a Japanese high school have learned all the stuff in Japanese, and I relied on this book to review all the concepts IN ENGLISH. Unfortunately, The explanations are ambiguous and do not explain \\"why\\" something occurs. In addition, there aren't enough charts, diagrams, graphs, etc. to support the written explanations. To make matters even worse, there are countless typos all over the book, and most importantly, the questions are not even close to what actually appeared on the SAT that I took.

The casting of the characters was terrific (with the exception of Chloe-she sounds angry ALL THE TIME!) and the music was haunting! I would also recommend the regular book version on cd, as those are good too. Like a previous reviewer had so accurately observed, these are like the old time radio dramas! The Left Behind books really brings the whole time surrounding the rapture to a higher level of understanding. You really feel connected to the characters.

Two; even the collective view is lost in time - one can never recapture the impact of hearing Hendrix for the first time - in the context of being there in 1969. Someone asked me at the time if JH was British or American, and I realised that for me in 1969 he was neither, he was more like one of the characters from the Marvel Comics that I collected - JH was from another planet like the Silver Surfer! When The Experience appeared on the Lulu show and interrupted Hey Joe to play Sunshine of Your Love in tribute to Cream (who were doing their farewell concert that night) it was as if the hippies had taken over - starting with the invasion of Saturday Night Propriety!

Sadly, this movie is no sequel, except for the fact that in both movies Terence Hill plays a larger-than-life character from the Old West with outlandish gun-handling skills. The humor that worked so well in \\"Nobody\\" is sorely lacking here -- the film is so bad that one cannot even find it funny as a satire on the spaghetti Western genre. The supporting cast is dreadful, the film quality is horrible, the plot is miserable, and the dialogue is laughable (when is the last time, for example, you heard a gunman call his opponent a \\"booby\\" during a gunfight?). The only merit to the film is that Terence Hill is fun to watch -- yet even he seems to trudging through this film -- Hill's half-hearted charm is the only thing that rescued this dud from a single star."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seen it","review":"I liked this as much as My Name is Nobody even though its way less arty.

His way is better, he promises.On Mr. Epstein's web site he offers to critique scripts for nearly $500 each, saying \\"That's what it costs me not to write.\\" This is an outrageous and doubtful claim.This book is the worst of a large crop of screenwriting books. Mr. Epstein can't even get the names of the movies and their characters right--it was THREE DAYS of the Condor, and Louise was played by Susan Sarandon, not Geena Davis.Spend your money on Syd Field, Lew Hunter, Linda Seger--or anyone else.

Sure the green album wasn't very good, but they reddemed themselves with maladroit.Well it was a mistake. Nothing can beat the blue album or Pinkerton and I wasn't kidding myself, no album could be better than those, but Make Believe is a disaster. I'd heard Beverly Hills many times during those last weeks thanks to Itunes and the sound was amazing. What a surprise when I finally heard the rest of the album. After a couple of listens, no song got to me. Even the green album had the merit to get my attention after 1 or 2 listens. I guess this album doesn't do it for me. For my part, I say it's their most boring album to date.I just hope they get their next one right !But hey it's just my 2 cents !"},{"rating":"1","title":"this album sucks.","review":"i can't believe i actually fell for it again.weezer can't write a good album if their life depended on it. this album sucks. plain and simple. it's looking more and more like their blue album was a mere fluke.for the reviewer that said weezer is maturing, you obviously haven't listened to the album. they are trying so hard to recreate the blue album it isn't even funny. listen to the lyrics. listen to the choruses. in a word: bland. they're trying to dumb down their music to recreate an indie sound that just isn't there.they're a bunch of phonies.i would rather have them record more of their b-sides from 10 years ago than to listen to their new stuff now.straight up."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'd have to be as imaginative as Peter Pan to like this.","review":"I'm a seventeen year old audiophile who has about 160, albums, and i can honestly say this is one of the worst that i own. Beverly hills is the best song, despite the fact that the lyrics bring them into simple plan territory. Not a single other song has good lyrics on the entire album. For example, take \\"We Are All On Drugs.\\" \\"When you're out with your friends in your new mercades benz, and you're, on drugs.\\" Okay, this is completely senseless and should not be coming from one of the greatest bands of the 90's. Green Album was weak, but Make Believe makes it seem as good as the White Album. I recommend checking out the band \\"the Living End\\" if you're interested in new uplifting rock music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Listen To Alan this album is terrible...","review":"This is by far the worst Weezer cd out there, I mean comeon what happened? I really liked Maladroit and the Green Album but this album isn't remotely listenable. The lyrics are terrible and it sounds like it was put together in one week. And to tell you the truth when I heard Beverly Hills I knew this wouldn't even be as good as Maladroit. The guitars arent as crunchy and I barely hear any solos on this disc except for Beverly Hills. I thought Maladroit was catchy as hell and better produced than the green album which was a goood thing. I'm being nice and giving this album 2 stars because I really do like Weezer and I think they can do better than this, but if they ever go emo I'm giving up on this band. Buy the new Audioslave album \\"OUT OF EXILE\\" it's amazing, there is not one bad song on that cd, also get SEETHERS KARMA AND EFFECT they both come out Tuesday and there both 10x better than \\"MAKE BELIEVE\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"They used to be good.","review":"CD is boring...

If you want Weezer stick to the Blue and Pinkerton CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Coming off the strength of their prior work, the album lacks a lot of the wit and edge of previous albums. It's not particularly bad, and the music certainly is Weezer, but its disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say It Ain't So","review":"First off, I am a big weezer fan and have been since the blue album. I do, however, know that bands change and adapt and grow musically so let me also say that I don't expect this album to be another blue album or pinkterton or green album etc... I just want good music. This album is mediocre at best and leaves me unsatisfied. There are some bright spots on the album but gone are the days where every track is worth listening to. I am not one to hate a song because of the lyrics; it's the music on \\"Make Believe\\" that doesn't deliver. It's not a complete disaster but it's definitely their worst release to date. It just seems flat and unoriginal even though the lyrics deal with emotional issues. \\"Make Believe\\" seems to be a hit and miss with their fans. If you're a big fan, you're probably going to buy the album no matter what. If you're on the fence, definitely check it out before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"They can't be proud of this.","review":"Remember the green album? Yea its like that but not even as good (less bad?). Rivers Cuomo is too scared to make another Pinketon because they all laughed at him. Maybe he'll come around. Expect to see this all over MTV. At least a band that I like will actually be rich(er). What is actually most dissapointing is that Rick Reuben porduced it. I couldnt be more dissapointed but I'm sure they'll redeem themselves. Too bad I cant get my $14 back."},{"rating":"1","title":"really bad","review":"i didn't expect the blue album or pinkerton but i did expect more than this. i tried to like it. the damage in your heart and the perfect situation are okay. if you think beverly hills is a good song you might like this album. it sounds to me like rivers had a formula and it was to copy crap like good charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevance","review":"After wading through the first 35 of 71 reviews of a CD that came out YESTERDAY, I felt I should mention the amazing power weezer still has to affect peoples lives. And in this sense, if you do not care for Make Believe, or feel it's the best thing since Pinkerton, take comfort in the fact that those first two albumns touched people so deeply that they command this type of reaction from its past and future fans. So If you love this new ablumn, play it all day long as I have been doing. If not, spend and afternoon on the porch listening to pinkerton and the blue ablumn on repeat, and remember why you fell in love with this band in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"60 minutes","review":"I have grown up no weezer. They were the first alternative band I listened to, when \\"alternative\\" was actually a newly coined term. This album just adds more songs to my collection of weezer tracks. Simple and well ordered in music and lyrics. There are a few quirky tracks (aka We're On Drugs) but Rivers brings the punch with some lyrics and guitar jabs in other songs. No band will ever produce another Blue album, much less Weezer, just listen to the pure 50s rock and pop influenced music that weezer continues to make. Any of these songs could still be featured in an episode of Happy Days, which is what makes Weezer gorgeous. So buy the album and enjoy it_"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let us call this \\"Lamer\\" instead of Weezer, shall we...","review":"Actually, I give it no stars. Not a big weezer fan but my best friend is. She bought it and we listened. GRRR...all that I can say is PLEASE DO NOT PUT ANY MORE ALBUMS OUT!!! YOU LAME EXCUSE FOR A BAND!!! 11 year old kids get into this crap that you call \\"ROCK.\\" Go buy Franz Ferdinand or Interpol or a Led Zeppelin album but DO NOT WASTE a penny on this poorly crafted album. One track sounds like THE CARS. Rivers, you are no Ric Ocasek. I $OWU$IO@#$ hate this band. TOTAL RIP OFF!!! POSEuRS LISTEN TO THIS CRAP!!! Weezer fan means loser. Rivers is a little poseur. I had to write this. I have seen more hype about this album than one should. Pinkerton, that was an album. This make believe or pretend you are a real rock-punk band is corporate crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened, Weezer?","review":"Being a Weezer fan, this album is hard to listen to. When I heard Beverly Hills, all I could do was hope that the rest of the album wasn't that bad. Then i heard the rest of the album, and my worst fears were confirmed. Weezer, at least for now, is dead. I've always thought people were too hard on Weezer albums. Maladroit was great, and green was decent. But I can't support this. The dream is over, the Weez has gone emo. Lord help us."},{"rating":"2","title":"make believe","review":"this is a great album by weezer, it is actually a decent length album, too. it is 40 something minutes unlike the 28 minute green album, which was the worst anyway. weezer waited a couple of years but they made a great album for 2005may 10th 2005 is the date of this album, and may 10th 1994 is the date of the blue album. well, that doesn't help much but it's weezer trivia.make believe is a great album, if you are a weezer fan you should buy this right now. make believe might be weezer's best album yet.i give it 4 stars for great songs and an improvement from the last one."},{"rating":"2","title":"no blue no pinkerton, so what","review":"this is a good album, I had read so many bad reviews of this, that I was a little apprehensive about forking out my 12 bucks, but make believe is very good, strong songs, catchy guitars, what else could you want? this is not the blue album or pinkerton, but those two albums are in a class all their own, they are masterpieces, that being said, make believe is far superior to the no emotion green album and the worst weezer album maladroit. I'm not a big fan of the current single \\"beverly hills\\" but it gets good about from track two, and never really has a weak moment, there is even the cars sounding keyboards on this, very good weezer, hope they continue to make great music for years to come. if you dig their b side stuff like \\"jamie\\" and \\"suzanne\\", you'll like make believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the weezer I knew.","review":"I feel like they sold out with this record but if that's the direction they wanted to go then so be it, that is their call.

Hearing \\"Beverely Hills\\" and reading reviews was enough for me to know that River's is a complete coward and would never release another interesting song for fear that it might not click with the mainstream. The sad thing is that Rivers was about to show some guts shortly after releasing Maladroit. For the supporting tour they played songs mostly from Blue and Pinkerton and released a ton of really good songs on their website that were supposed compose their 5th album. They were on the verge of releasing the album but production came to a hault. Appearently Rivers had flash backs to 1996 and couldnt bare to release another cult classic. Anyway if you want to hear what should have been Weezer's 5th album try down loading songs like:\\"Mad Cow\\"\\"Prodigy Lover\\"\\"Hey Domingo\\"\\"Living Without You\\"\\"Modern Dukes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Rivers has completely lost it","review":"It is such a shame to know that the creators of such sublime albums as Pinkerton and The Blue Album have been reduced to this.People only give them good ratings because we want to believe it's the same old Weezer we know and love. The truth is if it were any other band releasing this uninspired, unthought-provoking,crap everybody would hate it. This is worse than Maladroit-even the lyrics suck. Rivers has completely lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"the saddest day of my life.","review":"I remember, a long time ago, I rushed to the store the day this came out, excited as hell, and went home and listened to it and crapped my pants in anger. I loved blue and pinkerton, green and maladroit were decent and had their moments. This has no moments. I listened to a probably twice a day the week I bought it, hoping I would find some redeeming qualities in it. I didn't. It got worse and worse. I have nightmares about it where 'we are all on drugs' plays over and over again. I'm not going to buy anymore weezer albums. I'll always have the first two. and all the memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money","review":"I can't believe someone would like this album. I am a Weezer fan, not a fan of crap but it appears that being a Weezer fan means you like really bad songs that sound like over produced, bad rock with cheesy hooks and bad riffs. I guess I should say that I am a fan of The Blue Album, Pinkerton and The Green Album. Oh Matt Shape, look what has become of Weezer. I've read a few reviews that stated old fans would like this album. What a LIE. Don't believe the hype, this album stinks. I'd try to sell my copy but I would pass this CD on to my worst enemy!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full Blown Terrible","review":"What is this crap? Weezers previous releases i loved (yes, even the green album and maladtroit) but this, this just straight up sucks, 85% of this is just lame emo/love songs, and the lyrics SUCK, i couldnt wait to hear it when i first got it, then after i had listened to it, i was so disapointed, i still like weezer, but lets do ourselves a favor and forget this godawful pice of crap ever happened, i want the old weezer back."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems rushed&pressed","review":"Weezer has always been one of those bands that I could take or leave but they at least might have something sorta interesting. this album however doesn't bring much to my interests. the Lyrics&Music are just kinda there. not One single song caught my ear."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Such A Pity","review":"This is the most disappointing album I have ever bought. I am (was) a huge Weezer fan and I think Pinkerton is one of the best albums ever recorded. But WTF is this? As soon as I heard the single, I had serious concerns - it sounds like Weezer trying to be Weezer, and it is boring and stupid. \\"We Are All On Drugs\\" sounds like something a bunch of 14-year-olds would come up with for their high school Battle of the Bands. It is really really really really bad. And the lyrics - my god. This album has no life, no soul, no heart. I think Rivers has been replaced with a robot. Weezer is dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but Different.","review":"Let's face it we all know the blue album is by far the best and it will never be recreated. But with Pinkerton, the green album, and maladroit we got good music only different, and this album is the same. It is slower than all the other albums but it is still good, it's not like any of the other weezer albums have sounded the same they are always changing. So if you are buying this album expecting the blue album you will be disappointed but if you are a weezer fan and are used to none of their albums sounding like the last but have enjoyed them anyway then the same will be here. So enjoy this album and also go get Good News For People Who Love Bad News"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me it was all a dream","review":"Angst when you're over 30 years old isn't cool, it's pitiful. Grow the f*ck up.This album lacks any punch and those moments when it comes close fade away once an insipid lyric is attached. \\"We Are All On Drugs\\" is not tongue-in-cheek, is not ironic and borders on an earnestness that's almost Mormon--meaning, it's a lame tune. The rhyme scheme along pisses me off. The radio track \\"Beverly Hills\\" is non-threatening and sing-along (file \\"The Damage in Your Heart\\" here as well). \\"Perfect Situation\\" opens as a Weezer tune that sounds like it's a third-rate rip-off of a Weezer tune. And the 'ballad' tracks reek of psuedo-sentiment, like some Oprahish memoir.Is this what Weezer aspires to? It's just not what you want to hear from these guys. Make Believe sounds like a soundtrack album to a Kristin Dunst movie or a WB teen-drama, if you're into that love this album up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make Believe = Unimaginative","review":"Many of the reviewers seem to have accepted and embraced the fact that a typical Weezer song is mindless and repetitive. Why? If way back in 1994, Weezer had released Make Believe instead of The Blue Album do you think they would have a cult following, let alone be around 11 years later? It was their freshness and creativity that brought them popularity and it is soulless dribble like this that will lead to their demise."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazing substitute for sleeping pills.","review":"I got this CD back in May shortly after it came out because I liked the single... biggest mistake I've made in a while. The songs, with the exception of like 3, (1, 6, and 9) just have absolutely no energy at all, and the ones that do would have been good songs if they didn't have such corny lyrics. Let's face it people, \\"you're my best friend and I love you, and I love you, yes I do\\" are not good lyrics... well, I still say that Beverly Hills is an amazing song, but other than that and a few other perks here and there, it's definately not worth buying, or even burning for that matter. Sorry guys, but unless you wake up, I don't think I'm buying your next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weezer not the same anymore","review":"I don't know, I really like the first three tracks, \\"Beverly Hills,\\" \\"Perfect Situation,\\" and \\"This is such a pity.\\" But after that, the songs are total crap in my opinion. \\"hold me\\" is ok. But I feel that weezer has lightened up their style too much. I don't hear anything in this album that even remotely reminds me of the songs that made them bad ass and awesome- \\"Hashpipe\\" \\"say it ain't so\\" and \\"the sweater song\\". They were way more rockin back then. Now they seem like synthesized whiney little bitches. I'm sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Like Fish","review":"So after reading some of these reviews, I honestly can't see what people see (hear) in this album. Yes, the Blue Album and Pinkerton were incredible. The Green album was listenable. Maladroit--eh. Make Believe: a piece of dung, trampled on by a herd of elephants and then lit on fire. Yes, I think it's that bad. You'd think someone like Rick Rubin could do something with this. Who knows who's fault it is. But, this album in NO WAY \\"evolves\\" Weezer. I'm reading reviews of people saying we (old school Weezer listeners) can't accept that Weezer is \\"all grown up\\" now. No. This is definitely more immature than anything they have put out. Even the witty sarcastic lyrics are lost. Unless the sarcasm is so buried, it's not sarcasm anymore.The only exception is if their only goal is that each track they write for this album will make the next Reese Witherspoon romantic comedy movie of the girl who became a woman and persevered all the odds. Well then mission accomplished, Weezer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all are crazy.","review":"I love the Blue Album. I really do. It's fantastic, but if you think that if Weezer should simply cut and paste that album over and over again until they run out of colors then this album isn't for you.If you enjoy Weezer, enjoy seeing a band grow, enjoy seeing musicians mature, and hearing fan-freaking-tastic music, then you need to get this record as fast as you can.

There's very little discussion about and explanation of Thomas' philosophy.

I was so hopeful when I started this reading that I would get a general idea of the philosophies of Aquinas. Obviously I did not expect to get to know him intimatly. What I got was a sarcastic and condescending review of a man who has greatly impacted the catholic church (the author claims that without Aquinas, the church may not have survived) and thus western civilization. I wish I had read the other reviews here first. The book presents itself as being biographical and unbiased but from page one you learn of the author's obvious distaste for Aquinas. I don't mind this sort of writing, only that I would like to know what I am in for.

The poetry is abominable and the content completely ridiculous. From reading these poems, I get the impression that they are the work of a madman, who is fixated by Jews and Judaism. Christian Kim blames Jews for the September 11th attacks on America and just about everything else. This book is very boring and represents poor value for money - please avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry of the worst kind!","review":"'Going the Distance' is typical of the appalling literature Kim churns out year after year. The poetry is simply awful and the content is dull to say the least. The main theme behind these poems is the idea that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. Kim also seeks to incite Evangelical Christians to rise up and fight Jews wherever they find them. It is clear that Kim uses poetry simply as a vehicle to convey his religious bigotry and unpleasent political views. I would steer well clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete joke!","review":"This collection of poems written by Kim is a complete joke. I find it amazing that one could have the audacity to write such rubbish and publish it as poetry. I've read many of the poems and found them to consist of little more than a few poorly constructed sentences. I often found the material very confusing e.g. In one poem he talks about the responsibility of the Islamic terrorists for 9/11 and then goes on to say that the Jews were responsible.Kim's work comes across as 'amateurish'. Given the amazing lack of quality, I can only assume that the book was not edited and the author simply published it himself.I concur with most of the other reviewers, who say that the content of some poems could cause offence to readers, especially those who were affected by 9/11.This book consists of little more than a series of inane rants from an embittered old man - please avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"unnutterably bad","review":"If one looks past the author's unpleasant politics and his paranoid hatred of Jews, one finds simply the worst poetry imaginable. One can only assume that this work was published by the author himself. It fails on almost every level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poorly written and uninspiring","review":"This was the most appalling piece of literature I have ever read, if one can call this literature. The attempted use of metaphors failed in every respect and the language used was no better than that of a five year old child. I believe the author needs to find a new path in life."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible","review":"This is the worst poetry I've ever read. Kim seems not to have a clue about what good poetry entails. The style of writing is monotonous, rather like that of a boring old man, who rants and raves about inane topics. The poems are awkward to read in that they do not flow well. I found some of the content nonsensical e.g. one of the poems suggested that the Jews were responsible for 9/11. We all know that it was Muslim fundamentalists lead by Osama Bin Laden, who carried out the atrocities of 9/11. The quality of the poetry is so low that unless you are looking for a joke birthday present for someone, I wouldn't purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major let down!","review":"I was really let down by these poems. The poems had some rather nasty political undertones e.g. some of the poems seem to suggest that the blame for the 9/11 atrocities lay with the Jews. Anti-Semitism seems to be prevalent in Kim's poetry and this book is no different. Whilst I find the attitude of some Orthodox Jews annoying, I don't believe that Kim's poetry is going to make them change their ways etc. Kim has a propensity for drawing conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. A few of Kim's poems are contradictory and contain mixed messages.The standard of the poetry is rather low and I believe that Kim maybe an amateur poet just starting out on his writing career. If this is the standard to be expected from his work, I hold out very little hope for his career as a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This is one of the worst poetry books I've ever read. I was stunned by the ineptitude of the author in writing these poems.As I started to read the poems, I found myself becoming increasingly frustrated. These poems seem to lack inspiration and came across as a 'dull ramble'. The author, Kim, appears to be clueless when it comes to selecting the ingredients required for good poetry.I concur with the other reviewers, who condemn the vile political views portrayed by Kim's poems. I would say that most readers would find it difficult not to be offended by them however extreme their views may be.This collection of poems can be summed up as a pile of rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"I was very disappointed with this collection of poems by Kim. Some of the messages conveyed within these poems were deeply disturbing i.e. they emphasised the need for revenge. A few of the poems represented the extreme minority anti-Semitic view that the Jews were responsible for the 9/11 tragedy (due to their policies regarding Palestine). I was disappointed that so few of the poems contained messages stating the need for peace and the avoidance of brute force in sorting out disputes.I would advise readers to avoid this book because many of the poems may cause offence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Fan","review":"I am a big fan of Heerak's poetry. In this book, he does not disappoint. Love poems are powerful. Poems about war makes you think. All of his poems engages the senses as well as the inner soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving Poems","review":"I bought this book from the local Borders bookstore and really liked the poems. Some of the poems were kind of shocking because they were reflections of American anger and fear after 9/11. But I still found them informative; they helped me understand the popular sentiment better. I thought the poet hit it on the nail. I particularly liked the love poems. I thought they were sensitive and captured the longing and tension in a long-distance relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspiring, Dull and offensive!","review":"This has got to be the worst poetry book I've ever read. The standard of poetry is abominable; it did not flow and lacked inspiration. I found these poems incredibly dull, dreary and frustrating to read. The messages conveyed in this poetry book were rather unpleasant e.g. Americans' and Christians' must drop a nuclear bomb on the Middle East and Israel in revenge for 9/11. It seems to me that the author is an angry and insecure individual, who seeks to vent this anger in the form of attacks on Jews and Muslims. Please avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad!","review":"I was really let down by this poetry book; it wasn't what I was expecting at all. The poetry conveyed mixed and often confusing messages not helped by the poor standard of English. Some of the poems were downright racist and would cause offence to most readers. Through his rather poor poetry, Kim, emphasises the need for revenge and intolerance rather than encouraging a peaceful solution to the problems posed by 9/11. It is disappointing that Kim seeks to encourage a negative response to this tragedy. In some of the poems, Kim seems to condone the actions of the Muslim fundamentalist terrorists, who carried out the attack. This is likely to be upsetting for those who lost loved ones on 9/11; therefore I would advise that they avoid this poetry collection. This book was a total disappointment; it does nothing to ease the suffering of those who were affected on that awful day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dire","review":"When one starts to read through these poems, one becomes nauseated as a result of the extreme racism and anti-Semitism. Furthermore, one becomes increasingly frustrated due to the poor quality of the poetry and numerous typos.Kim's poetry is unimaginative and reads as a series of bitter rants about how the Jews were allegedly responsible for September 11th. Many of Kim's poems condone the actions of the Muslim fundamentalist terrorists who perpetrated the attacks. This is likely to cause a great deal of offence to those, who suffered on that fateful day.I concur with most of the reviewers, when they say that the messages conveyed by Kim's poems were confused as a result of the poor grammar.This really is poetry of the lowest standard. The author should seriously reconsider his decision to become a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"total drivel","review":"I found these poems to be very poor indeed, they did not flow well and were puerile in terms of content. Some of the poems portrayed messages that could be considered anti-Semitic. These may cause offense to both Jewish and non-Jewish readers alike. The author appears not to have any experience in writing poems as his attempts at using metaphors were poor and there was no real flow or flux to the poetry.I would definitely avoid this book as I'm sure you could find better poetry in your local primary school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible poetry intertwined with dangerous messages","review":"When one starts to read 'Going the Distance', one finds the most appalling poetry conveying the most hideous messages imaginable.The poems were simply awful. There was no flow to the poetry and the author's choice of language was poor. I concur with many of the reviewers who say that the poems consist of a series of bigoted rants. It seems to me that Kim is using poetry merely as a tool to make his extreme political views seem more palatable.The content can only be described as utter dross. Some of the poems were rather weird and others were downright offensive (anti-Semitic and racist). This poetry collection should be given a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a big fan!","review":"Heerak's poetry is the worst I've ever read. His style is very boring, rambly and repetitive. This poetry collection is no different. Through these poorly written poems, Heerak tries to give the impression that Christianity is superior to all other religions. This idea is clearly repugnant to Muslims such as me. Heerak should be more sensitive to people of other faiths. I think he should give up on his writing career and go on a 'diversity awareness' course to help him overcome his racism.Avoid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"American colonialist taste!","review":"American colonialism is a horrible thing. American military and government officials used local peoples (whether they be Vietnamese, Iraqi or Afghanistani) to subjugate the populations of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan. They deprived them of their own resources e.g. oil, and prevented the progress of innocent civilians. I feel this book, written by Kim, is a typical American colonialist response to the tragedy of 9/11. The 9/11 attacks are a direct consequence of the colonialist policies of the United States. This book does nothing to repair the damage wreaked by American colonialists on their imperial crusades against Islam and socialism. Please avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poetry of the lowest order!","review":"This poetry book is unbelievable bad. The poems were very poorly written and the content ranged from prurient to hateful.Kim's attempts at using metaphors failed completely and the reader was left grappling as to what the point of the poem was. The messages portrayed by Kim were very confused e.g. in one of the poems it is not clear as to whether he is referring to the Islamic fundamentalist terrorists or Americans.One of the recurring themes was the spurious claim that the Jews were in some way responsible for 9/11. This is clearly ridiculous and offensive to those, who suffered as a result of the attacks. Some of the poems were prurient e.g. they described what appeared to be the lewd sexual fantasies of the author.This collection of poems will cause great offence to sufferers of 9/11 from all religious and ethnic backgrounds. Please avoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peabody's Mermaid book","review":"If you loved the movie, you will love the book.

The story is that of the Texas War of Independence from Mexico and the role played by the tiny Texas Navy. The obscure historical figures appear to be accurately written, The names of the vessels and some of the men have been preserved but the details must be left to the author's informed reconstruction.

Hearing Paul Stanley sing Master and Slave was incredibale. Mostly he's known for singing the up beat tempo songs and the ballads, but to hear him crank out a dark, evil song was incredible. This is a departure from KISS almost to a point of a Danzig sound. Would have been nice to hear some of this live. Bruce kulick sings one song and does a great job. I had the pleasure of meeting him several years ago and some friends of mine asked if he would sing more. If the support we gave me helped, we feel great. I walk Alone was terrific Bruce. Hope to see more of you behind the mic. One thing missing from this album is the duets Paul and Gene used to do on songs lost since..well it's been a while until Psycho Circus."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best AMERICAN Rock Guitarist... Period.","review":"This is a must have... check out the new version of \\"I Walk Alone\\" recorded by Bruce Kulick and UNION! This is rock guitar at its finest! Bruce Kulick and Eric Carr made Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons rock harder... if they hadn't, Kiss would be an 80's dinosaur, relegated to special issues of magazines.

This album is a grudge rock album but it's really good. Here's What I think of the songs.Hate- Great opener. Good lyrics and tune.Rain- Try to remember what Hate sounded like. Most of these songs sound the same. Anyways, good song. Paul sings this one.Master And Slave- One of the best songs off of the album.Childhood's End- Great Song with powerful lyrics and killer bass licks.Jungle- Not one of the best but good song,.In My Head- Great vocals by Paul. Cool lyrics.It Never Goes Away- Very unmemorble but try to like it.Seduction Of The Innocent- Remember \\"Not For The Innocent\\" from Lick It Up? Weird!I Confess- Good lyrics and Gene sings.In The Mirror- Good song.

The band have jumped every musical trend since the late 1970's (disco, hair metal, grunge) and this release show it's all for fame and money - not music! I'd like to think that there once was a musical honesty that made albums like \\"Kiss\\", \\"Hotter than hell\\", \\"Destroyer\\" and \\"Love gun\\" among others so good. But with a lot of weak and uneven albums, Kiss have really hit rock bottom with this awful effort. The calculating (of especially Gene Simmons?) have just proven that the band have totally lost their soul and I don't think it's possible for Kiss to ever make a come back. Too bad the band didn't quit earlier when they had some dignity left."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Kiss did not lend very well to the grunge sound. This does not sound like Kiss at all. while other albums that they made were influenced by other types of music you could still hear Kiss shining through.

Besides Destroyer and Kiss Alive I, this is the only Kiss CD gracing my stereo"},{"rating":"2","title":"KISS challenges grunge bands","review":"This is the heaviest KISS album of all time,and also one of the best. This album proves that KISS can take any type of music, and be just as good as anyone in that field. Songs Like \\"Hate\\" and \\"Master & Slave\\". The whole album rocks and is proably the best besides the first one. KISS did an amazing job making themselves as heavy as anyone out there. KISS also picked a great co-producer for the album Toby Wright(who produced KoRn's Follow The Leader album) Overall this is an awsome cd and is better then 90% of grunge albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"FECAL MATTER!","review":"Like Kissco was'nt bad enough.

This is Kiss trying to be someone else. Both Gene and Paul made fun of the seattle sound back in the day and this is them trying to copy that style.Kiss has always been known as a party/good time band.

This disk is heavy which is great but it's also slow which is very anti-Kiss. This was supposed to be a sister album to Revenge, but Revenge although different was still Kiss. By being Kiss I mean fun, fast, sing along, rock and roll. This is very plodding and methodical like most of the music from 93-97. Thank God grunge is pretty much over because all of that music was so unbelievably boring (yes let me be the first to say all of Pearl Jam's songs are boring). And unfortunately Kiss followed suit here."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"It is okay to go in a slightly different route musically. But if you must, do it in a way that doesn't suck. What kiss should of done if they wanted to go in a different direction was add just a little bit of the grunge. But unfortunately they added too much and they sounded horrible. Also the one song that seemed like it would of been a good song was \\"I walk alone\\". But it got ruined by Bruce Kulick's crapy singing. Kiss should never atempt grunge again because they suck at it. I'm glad that they went into a more rock sound with psycho circus. I thought that was a good album a whole lot better than this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad...very bad.","review":"Simply: This \\"album\\" is a waste of time, money, and effort. This is Kiss' worst album, yet. Even \\"Music from the Elder\\" had redeeming qualities--it has a \\"theme\\" some ballads, and rhythm. This album \\"Carnival\\" is trash. I'm embarassed to tell people that I'm a Kiss fan when I listen to this. I would go to the End of the world for Kiss. This album, however, should have been the death of Kiss. Sad. They can't play alternative--there are better bands for that. This album is simply trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Dear GOD!","review":"Hold on a second! This is not Kiss.

Too bad, very much too bad, that this wasn't released to the public sooner in lieu of their reunion tour.Very creative, driving, dark, and a wonderful listen starting with song #2 \\"Rain\\".

I like the original three. I liked Alive! and Destroyer. I started getting uncomfortable during the Hot in the Shade/Unmasked period. This album is heavy on songs written by Gene. You can tell he manufactured the thing from beginning to end. (Not that that's entirely bad, I happened to like his solo album, and \\"Going Blind\\" might be my favorite KISS song.) But here he seems to want to capitalize on that Alice in Chains-Soundgarden vibe, and it just ends up coming off so derivative and kinda pathetic. Quite frankly, it's a little Rob Halford-esque. KISS is SOOOOO much better than this.

The drums are quite weird in that sort of music for example (remembers me to some sort of James Last mood). The sound engineering is of the worst i have met for years. Loreenas voice is clippind frequently when it gets a little louder. The harp and other instruments a hardly been heard in some tracks thogh you can see them being played (remebers me to silent movie ages). The video qality is fluffy and lacks of blillinace at all. If you belong to those species who don't notice these all these things, you would be happy with that recording maybe.

Of course there is always one shining light in the depths of darkness this time a mega ballad called \\"Forever\\" which managed a good placing on the mainstream charts and allowed the band to hit the road (promotors were un-convinced that a tour could be supported until the single charted). \\"Hide Your Heart\\" has Bon Jovi written all over it spoilt by an over obvious chorus, \\"Read My Body\\" a sub-standard Def Leppard wannabe, and na na na's, ah ah ah's and woah woaha's punctuating any other song that lacked a lyric to finish it off properly. In my mind the darkest hour musically for the mighty Kiss. Add last to your collection. Even the cover sucks the big one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot in the SH_ _ !!!","review":"Still trying to be a hip hair band in the mid eighties. Kiss really could not fit in their tights anymore as middle age crept up on them. The formula ran thin but their waistlines didn't! The music was horrible- they were trying to be the hair metal band that they never really were- pathetic. Gone were the great riffs, gone were the great harmonies and the subtle humor. They became a joke- Kiss - \\"Men in Tights\\" but the tights were ripping at the butt seams. And the girls were yelling, \\"Put the Makeup back on...PLEASE!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"worse than crazy nights if that's possible","review":"I just cannot believe how terrible this is. Kiss really should have retired after Animalize anyhow. They have not done a decent album since. Gene and Paul should be outright ashamed of themselves. I guess they didn't learn that jumping on trends for them does not work after the Dynasty/Unmasked awfulness. How could they sink even lower? Start putting out crap like this was the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The tour ruled the album basically sucked!","review":"Hot in the Shade made Kiss\\"s plummet down in the late 80's look worse. Why do we have 15 tracks on the most (in my opinion) unfocused record. Gene is by far clueless ever. The only great tracks here are the singles especially the top 10 \\"Forever\\" a great tune I might say. The others are plain horrible or maybe mediocre at best. This does sadly end Eric Carr'S tenure with the band as he died 2 years later in 1991. His vocal for his one and only \\"Little Caesar\\" is average at best,but Eric will always be remembered forever R.I.P Kiss will come back in full force with 1992 Revenge Cd. This was the first time I saw Kiss the tour was amazing and it comes to show you that no matter who is in the band Kiss still rule live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Recommended Album","review":"I had this album for a while, but I eventually got rid of it. I've got a few Kiss albums on tape and CD, but Hot in the Shade is the only one I had no good reason to keep. The songs just never left an impression on me and just seemed to be filler with nothing standing out. Not a completely poor album, but not recommended either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mere shadow of Creatures of the Night","review":"This album has absolutely no original songs in it. Kiss hit its low point with this album and the previous album. Ace Frehley plays \\"Hide Your Heart\\" more like Kiss than Kiss does. Another low point in this band's existance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"This is Kiss at their worst. I heard them on the radio saying they put 15 songs on the album because they were classic songs. Give me a break. Half the album's songs are throwaways. This would have been better as a 9-track album"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe not a great album,but has some great songs","review":"There are some high points on this record. \\"Rise to it\\" is a great song. The song \\"Betrayed\\" is my favorate track on the album. Probably everybody knows \\"Hide your heart\\" and \\"Forever\\" are cool songs. But songs like \\"Silver Spoon\\" and \\"Bommerang\\" bring this album down alot. I would recommend it to the post-makeup fans,but for all you who only listen to Destroyer and ALIVE!,stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot? Nah, not.","review":"This has always been an odd album to me. It's not quite as awful as \\"Crazy Nights\\" or \\"Animalize\\", but it's nothing to write home about, either. HITS always came across as sounding like an album full of outtakes. A few tracks are actually pretty decent, for example, \\"Betrayed\\", \\"Street Giveth\\", but all in all it's sub-mediocre at best. To the band's credit, there are 16 tracks on this CD, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"KISS, bought the Disc, not a good KISS album","review":"This is pretty close to being a KISS low point.I Bought the Disc because it is KISS ( Mindless fan that I am), but the material just was not up to the 70's standard . If you like the original KISS material, this is not one to buy, however, it is probably one to get if you need a complete collection, but do not expect a KISS album. Hard to see this as rock... and it certainly is not a good hair band album.Blech"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair Band Heaven, UGGH!!!","review":"Hot in the Shade is not a good album. By the time this album came out, Kiss was on the road of the hair-band trend and just went with the flow of bands like Bon Jovi, Warrant and Poison. If you like those kind of bands you will probably like Hot in the Shade. I on the other hand must say that I am not a fan of hair bands and find most of them to be shallow and boring. Speaking of boring, this album is just that, boring! If I had to pick which song I like the best, I'd say it would be \\"Betrayed\\" and even that is a longshot. Hot in the Shade is for die-hard Kiss fans only!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not one of there better works","review":"Probably there worst piece of work.

It is loosely based on an actual Southwest Iowa crime and the events' characters.

The author has taken the Villisca axe murders of 1912 and recast them. It was a great and well-told story, and made me feel as though I was back in 1912 Villisca, knowing however that this was not the \\"true\\" story necessarily.

COSSELL IS ONLY MENTIONED IN PASSING. IT IS A GOOD BOOK, BUT TO MAKE IT A GREAT BOOK, REMNICK IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT WITH SECOND VOLUME TO DETAIL THE REST OF ALI'S INCREDIBLE LIFE. DEFINITELY WORTH BUYING, AND MOST ASSUREDLY WORTH READING!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't There a Thrilla in Manila","review":"David Remnick's King of the World barely skims the surface of the spectacular life of Muhammad Ali. The only fights that Remnick discusses is two of the battles with Sonny Liston. What about Fraizer? What about Foreman? Heck, what about Spinks? Wasn't there a Rumble in the Jungle? And I know there was a Thrillia in Manila. Didn't Ali get knocked silly in MSG thanks to the soup bone of Joe Fraizer? The first part of this book isn't even about Ali. When are we going to get the full, uncut story of Ali?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A depressing book","review":"It was a boring disguisting fowl book, i disliked it and i CERTAINLY DO NOT reccomend it to others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Muhammed the Symbol","review":"When boxing mattered, boxers were more than pugilists trying to break each other's wills; they were symbols that attracted the attention and aspirations of the masses. Like gladiators in Rome, these courageous men allow us to project our hopes, fears, and insecurities.David Remnick tells the story of Cassius Clay's growth from a skinny, mercurial, but morally upright boy, to a hero and symbol of resistance and hope for millions of anti-establishment figures. Ali captivated the hearts and minds of fans unlike any athlete before or since. Remnick does a beautiful job of explaining why and how this happened. No matter how dominate Michael Jordan was, or Tiger Woods is, neither absorb our emotions like the sponge known as Muhammed Ali.His grace, speed, and power thrilled, while his words, political stances, and humour enthralled. Everyone in America should learn the story of this hero. There is no better place than Remnick's book to do so. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say, he was the greatest","review":"This is not really a standard biography. It focuses only on a few of Ali's fights, ending with his bout with Floyd Patterson in 65. So those looking for a comprehensive overview of Ali's career will be disapointed. However, it does show why Ali is the greatest athlete of the 20th century. It does that by telling Ali's story in the context of his era and it is captivating reading. We get Ali in all his greatness -- and even in all his cruelty. He was a man, but a man that stood for something. That alone makes him rare in sport, especially today when all athletes seem to be interested in are endorsement deals or making rap records. Somehow I can't picture a Michael Jordan allowing himself to be thrown out of sport during his prime years, simply because of a deeply held religious belief. Pick up with book, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"The colorful chartacters of the 1960s boxing world come to life in this very entertaining and insightful work. A must for non-boxing fans too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The author brilliantly shows why Ali was King of the World","review":"Remnick employs an exceptional writing style in describing the ascendency of Clay/Ali against the backdrop of the Patterson-Liston matches. His treatments of the preparations for the Ali-Liston fights are tantalizing. I would have enjoyed some discussion of Ali's post-prison matches, viz., Frazier and Foreman but that shortcoming does not change the fact that this was my favorite book of 1998"},{"rating":"2","title":"He Still \\"Floats Like A Butterfly, Stings Like A Bee\\"","review":"David Remnick is superb. This is the \\"Real Book\\" David should win the Pulitzer Prizer for, not \\"that other one\\", he did win one for writing. As Ali's Deer Lake, Pa. Training Camp photographer during the '70's, I can tell you of this kind, gentle man, who was oh so awesome within the ring. Ali is a \\"one-man masterpiece\\", \\"a true work of functional artisitic prowess\\". David Remnick, on paper in prose, captures all of this. Ali is my friend, my mentor, my role model, and yes, I AM a bit biased, but there have been other works on Ali and this is the \\"best of the best\\".

I shouldn't have worried the author does a superb job of telling the 'histories' of all the main players and mixing it with the society of the 1960's. He also tells the stories of the other main fighters of the times, Floyd Patterson and Sonny Liston. Never boring and written in the style of a historian the author achieves all his objectives and leaves no doubt that Muhhammad Ali was 'the greatest'..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So . . . Liston beat Patterson then Clay beat Liston . . .","review":"A great book! It's more about Liston as the Tyson-like beautiful brute and Patterson the neurotic pugilist than about Ali (Clay). The book does great job in its discussion of the seemy side of boxing; organized crime and the like. It tends to get a bit bogged down in the last two chapters, but overall its a buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Manages to both entertain and educate in an enjoyable manner","review":"Head and shoulders the best and most balanced of the numerous Ali biographies I have read, this book - like the man himself - transcends sport. Remnick is a master communicator in print who delves deeply into the culture and times of the early sixties to present a unique tale of the man who defied the establishment - both white and black - and ultimately indeed became \\"King of the World\\". This book is really three biographies in one, with the stories of Charles \\"Sonny\\" Liston and Floyd Patterson, although as in life overshadowed by Ali, still fascinating in their own way. This book manages to both entertain and educate in a most enjoyable manner. What more can you ask?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Essence of an Ora","review":"The book was a well written and well developed book. It not only portrays Ali as a complex, deep man who did much more than just box, but the whole generation of fighters, promoters, gangsters, Press agents and all the people of the age. The trajedy of Liston, Pattersons lost hope, the rise and fall of some of America hardest working men. The book is an explanation of the scenes behind and all around the sweet science. You dont have to be a boxing fan to enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read about an interesting era in america","review":"Perhaps I am not the best person to review this book as I am not a boxing fan at all, rather a person who appreciates good non-fiction and character studies. I picked up this book based on other reader reviews and the fact that that Time magazine named it the Best Nonfiction book of the year. The title of this book, as mentioned by other reviewers, is somewhat misleading as the book is only in part about Muhammad Ali. This book is more of a history about the era in which Ali became the champ. It is a well written account of Ali's association with the Black Muslim's and Malcolm X. It is also an informative account of the other famous fighters of his time and before. While the book is not a \\"gripping\\" book it certainly holds the interest of the reader. Surprisingly, after reading it I found myself less of a fan of Ali's than before,which may be the best evidence that the book is an honest account of the era."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ali is crazy good","review":"King of the World by David Remnick was one of the best books I've ever read. It is the true story of a champion and how he got there. I recommend anyone who likes stories about winning and glory, to read this book. If you also like reading about dudes getting smoked by a champ. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ali as agent of social change?","review":"I found David Remnick's story of the rise of Ali quite compelling, and that's coming from someone who doesn't even like boxing. The brash young confident kid is portrayed in great detail but the portraits of the other major figures: Liston and Patterson are just as engrossing. Remnick writes well, mixes the story with telling anecdotes and chronicles Ali's rise in the context of the social changes of the time.The book is accurately called 'the rise'; you don't get a lot of the mature Ali and his fights after his comeback. My main question about the book, and it's one the book doesn't answer; exactly HOW did this sometimes loathed figure; an outsider in a religious and racial sense from the authorities, become such a modern day hero? Exactly how did that happen? There's a book there waiting to be written.In the meantime enjoy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"I am an avid baker.

This text is meant for introductory courses and for that purpose it is tolerable. Nevertheless, it is long-winded, dull and poorly written. Also, because it is meant to be used for an introductory overview course, most of the material will most likely be used during lectures. The truth is, this book was the \\"required reading\\" for a course I took. Our Professor was most likely required to assign a textbook and she picked this one, and never assigned us to read any of it.

I wish he was in the other books. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a more realistic Star Wars!","review":"The writers have finally realized our characters can't be young forever and allowed them to age like normal people. Han's grief over Chewie's death is very touching and his personal journey very understandable. I hope the sequel is just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy continuance of the NJO","review":"This is certainly a more than adequate follow up to the excellent Dark Tide duology by Stackpole. Luceno, no stranger to Sci-fi, takes Han back to the days before the Empire, when he was just a smuggler trying to eke out a living on the wrong side of the law. Indeed, Luceno makes several references to Brian Daley's classic Solo adventures. It seems to me that each NJO book focuses on different characters. In HT, it was Han, in DT it was the Solo kids, etc. On the downside, the Vong seem to be getting even easier to kill, yet they plow right on towards the Core. This is, all in all, a good follow-up to DT, and I eagerly await Jedi Eclipse and Balance Point. But one thing I don't get is, how are they going to stretch this Vong thing into 30 novels? Anyone with ideas, please e-mail me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Han is BACK, baybay!","review":"I was wondering when Han would stop moping around after the loss of Chewbacca and get back into his old wisecracking self. I also liked running into his old smuggler pal Roa again, as well as the fact that the Vong are slowly assuming their rightful place as easy-to-vaporize cannon fodder. Han also gets a new pal of sorts, Droma the ever-so-amusing Ryn with eccentric personality traits and insights into the universe in general. There's also confirmation of any suspicions you've ever had about the similarity between sabacc cards and tarot cards, and an amusing Indiana Jones misquote to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best NJO book - 4.5 stars","review":"In a series that I, a devoted Star Wars fan haven't liked much so far, Hero's Trial was a welcome addition. From the beginning, Luceno captures the spirit of the characters very well, and keeps the intrigue up without having to include mindless action. I love his portrayal of Han; I think that his is the best representation of Han that has ever been done, with the possible exception of A.C. Crispin's work in her Han Solo Trilogy. The introduction of Roa is interesting, although his recitation of classic Star Wars lines is cheesy, repetitive, and downright stupid. Other than that, however, this is an excellent book in what, so far, has been a lackluster series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well...","review":"James Luceno did his homework, and he sure kept the New Jedi Order going. I just wanted to stop by and comment that I enjoyed the book and refused to set it aside to read another until I was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good book","review":"This is a great book! I have read all of the New Jdi order books out so far. This one was good and had me up late because I was so hooked. The only negative is that this whole series is written by many diffrent authors so it seems like peoples personalties change. The Yuzhaan Vong attackers seem more human in this book than in the one before it. you see the story from their view a bit more. There is alot of interesting plot. I thought that the last book in this series, Ruin, left alot of things to build on in this book but than I was suprised to not see some of those things. Like we never heard of the Empire in this book while in the last book the Empire helped the new republic fight the Yuzhaan Vong and they seemed to form an allanice. But all in all a very good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book full of emotion","review":"I started the book and couldnt put it down i finished it in two days and didnt want it to end the over all writing was good and it was full of emotion. however it is not the best book in the series. i would indeed recomend it however."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZ - a real sleeper","review":"Forget Nodoze man... just read this!! This is James Luceno's first star wars book, and I have to give him a little slack just because he is new. However... He failed to capture the tone, and the general overall feel of the series that the other authors had created. Although discriptive with his words, he doesn't use them to capture a scene... he just uses them to be discriptive. Text books do the same thing. Although he did try to do some funky stuffs wuth his approach... like writing from Threepio's view at Chewie's funeral... he just doesn't pull it off. He doesn't advance the plot, or add to the charector at all; (this entire book is about Han.) And I don't know Han any better now than I did before. 350+ pages of total waste.An A for effort. A failing grade overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker story, but a happy ending.","review":"I like this book, though the author has Nom Anor back. It starts at Obroa-Skai, after it is captured by the Vong. Then they start translating the history information and then talk about infecting the rest of the Jedi with Mara's illness, using the guise of a defecting Vong preistess, an assasin in disguise.Han is back and back for blood. Chewie's son,Waroo, and his nephew,Lowbacca, want to continue the life debt. Han says that he'll think about it, and goes off on his own little journey, eventualy running into the Vong preistess.All in all, a great book. Something happens to Mara on p. 335, but I'm not telling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vergere, Vergere, Vergere","review":"Did anyone read Rouge Planet?

I don't think we have seen the last of her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book...Bad space battles","review":"A great addition to the NJO, I thoroughly enjoyed this book.Written well enough...my main critique comes in Luceno's handling of space battles. A major part of the Star Wars Universe involves squadrons of fighters and ships going to blows in Space Combat; however, Luceno needs to work on this aspect of his writing. His space battles are lacking and pale in comparison to the rest of his exciting story. With the first battle scene, I thought he was trying to avoid writing the details, which actually might have been better than him trying to do so (which he attempts later in the story).He does wrap up some annoying parts of the NJO saga extremely well and makes the saga ready to move on. These things include: Han's pouting over Chewbacca's death and Mara's illness. I think these things were annoying him as much as they were me...so he got rid of them. Bravo!Overall, I think he is an excellent addition to the SW universe, and he has written a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great re-introduction of our beloved Han","review":"I'll keep this short and sweet because I don't want to spoil anything... I have never read any of Luceno's work, but he does a good job continuing the New Jedi Order series. Where the previous books were more directed towards the Jedi and their contributions towards this new enemy, Hero's Trial gives us a new respect and admiration towards our lovable hero, Han Solo. He has been sorely missed due to the death of Chewbacca and now has to overcome his grief and fight in the name of Chewie. Sometimes it seems as though Han could be \\"Force-sensitive\\" for all the situations that he seems to get himself in and out of... but, that's the Corellian luck for ya. Anyway, it was an excellent book with some great insights to the character of Han and how deep his relationship with Chewie really was. The rest of the cast is also built upon nicely which promises a great follow up in Jedi Eclipse. Happy Hunting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first showing for Luceno","review":"Honestly, I was a bit skeptical when I first picked the book up, as Luceno was an author unfamiliar to me, and the NJO series was so filled with complexities and disappointments. However, I have to admit, Luceno has a lucid, flowing style that keeps you enthralled in the novel. I put the book down twice while reading it. Once to eat dinner and once because I _had_ to sleep. With the reintroduction of Han Solo to the playing field, things are looking up for the beleaguered New Republic. Unfortunately, the book is a little lacking in the Jedi presence for a novel supposedly focused on them. Also, I find it vexing that the two major internal problems confronting the heroes were cleared up in the same novel. It makes me wonder what we've got in store in the next installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"If You Aren't A Han Fan . . . skip this book","review":"Fans of Han Solo will not be disappointed by this book as Luceno demonstrates he has explored every facet of Han's life thoroughly. There are numerous irrelevant references to Han's past scattered throughout the book as Han stumbles throughout the galaxy and befriends the Jar-Jar Binks of the EU, the insufferable, comedic creature called Droma. We have Han stumbling through the galaxy in an attempt to help Droma find his clan-mates; in doing so, Han manages to stumble across the latest Vong scheme and accidentially foil it.With the exception of the Vong scheme, the rest of the book is just useless filler, but then I'm not a Han fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, find out what's going on with Han!","review":"Han Solo has been a mess ever since the tragic events of VECTOR PRIME. Chewie's demise left our favorite smuggler wracked with guilt and anger, and the fact that he has become an object of pity among his friends and collegues in the New Republic has only made Chewie's absence that much more painful.But now Han finally has the chance to get revenge for his best friend's murder. Han leaves his friends behind to go on a solitary mission that may end in his death...a mission to strike at the very heart of the Yuuzan Vong invasion force in a way that the massive New Republic military never could. The only question is, will Han's thirst for vengeance put him in grave risk against impossible odds? As Han would say, \\"Never tell me the odds!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"(yawn) boring","review":"I realize all of those who have written reviews for this book already are going to hate me for this, but I really disliked this book.

I have raised my own children and remember how stressful tantrums can be on us and our children. After watching this video, I was utterly disappointed in Dr. Karp's approach. I agree we should let our children know that they have been heard and we understand what they want, but to mimic what they are doing doesn't seem like being a very good role model to teach them how to handle these emotions they are experiencing. I think it encourages them to react with tantrums whenever they experience their frustrations and anger with a situation. We need to model how we handle these feelings and how we expect them to handle them. Not join in and encourage the unwanted behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Happiest Toddler on the Block DVD","review":"Very detailed, very informative DVD that helps parents understand and feel better about going through the \\"toddler years\\" with their child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wouldn't play on computer.","review":"Never watched.

If your a fan of Donny Osmond you will want to add this DVD to your collection. He has been in the business many years and stronger then ever. Not only do you have a chance to see a GR*8 concert. But he does a Lovely tribute to his Mother. This would be your chance to see Donny as a father as he performs with his very talented son's on stage Jeremy and his name sake Don.

The seats aren't as comfortable as the picture suggests.The reason I can only give this one star is that I took it out of the box and noticed that one of the seats had already been patched with an ugly brown puncture patch. Sure enough, when I inflated the pool, that seat quickly deflated. I suppose I am lucky that the puncture was in one of the seats, so it didn't affect the rest of the pool. But who finds a puncture and patches it before passing a pool off as new? Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I bought this little pool a couple of years ago. I thought it looked ideal in the picture with the seats and cupholders. The first year I filled it and waited for the water to warm up before I used it and by that time it felt slimy. It would be much better if it there was a way to attach a pump and filter. I tried it again the next year during a heat wave and it wouldn't hold air and I couldn't find any holes so I put it in the garbage. I ended up buying thisIntex Easy Set 12-Foot by 30-Inch Round Pool Setand I like it much better because it's easy to keep the water clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived with multiple small holes","review":"Item is bigger than it seems in the picture. Upon filling with air for the first time, one of the \\"seat cushions\\" has a small leak that takes about 8 hours to deflate.

Poor quality control, apparently."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't hold up","review":"I bought this at Big Lots for about the same price and the first time I used it, the thing kept losing air. Filling it with a hand pump is a total pain. Somehow one of the cushions got water in it because I didn't inflate them the first time I filled it. The cushions are pretty pointless because you can't even relax on them. I sat on it and leaned back and felt like i was going to fall out...and when the edge is losing air, it doesn't hold the water. So I have not had luck with this pool. Waste of time and money. Might have been nice if it weren't leaking so much air. I even tried to patch a spot and it still lost air."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME POOL!","review":"We got this pool last summer, and my boys spent the entire summer in it! Us adults love it too!

If today doesn't turn out better, this one gets returned. We have had the Intex 10 x 30 (which we gave away), it held up wonderfully. We also had a 12 x 36 Intex which I tore a hole into when cleaning it out at the end of season but even though I did a number on it, the patch and duct tape kept it going strong the 3rd year...it was the inflatable ring on top which finally started leaking and we couldn't find it to repair.

The first chapter states that Howard Hughes descended into a state of self neglect where he did not cut his hair or nails for years. This is clearly because Hughes was mentally ill, yet this author concludes he had no friends and was incapable of love because he chose to care about nothing but money and greed and just didn't try. I stopped reading and returned the book as well as another I purchased by the same author. I don't understand why this was not an issue for other readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible","review":"Alan Lay McGinnis is a genius! In this book he gives 5 ways to deepen relationships, 5 ways to cultivate intimacy, 2 ways to handle negative emotions, and much more. He also discusses in great detail what one should do if a relationship goes bad. Each of his points are supported by expert opinions and previous cases he has had as a shrink. This book is extremely helpful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jewel of a Book","review":"I read this book on my Kindle and am now considering buying a paper copy to use as a reference. It is not just about Friendship, but about relationships in general, which are probably the hardest things we deal with in life. The author is a therapist who has years of knowledge about human behavior in relationships. I have recommended it to all of my friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw this book away, I disliked it so much","review":"The author of this book made no distinction between friendship and romantic love, or how the two intersect, or don't. He didn't clarify whether he was referring to levels of intimacy in friendship between two men, two women, a woman and a man, a married couple, or a rabbi, a priest, and a nun. Since love has a spiritual element, it can be beautiful to be all-inclusive, viewing love on a spectrum, but this seemed more to be a case of not-very-well-thought-out information and ideas. I wanted more depth and clarity in an exploration of the topic of friendship than this book delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Must Be Better Books On The Subject","review":"I've read this book years ago and I've been recently looking for a new book on the subject being that I'm in a new country and may be here for some years. (I've moved from all of my old friends) Anyways, there's this reviewer Hansen (something or other) who's given this book a 1 star. He's given the book a pretty accurate review. It is written from a Christian perspective and it just seems like light weight self help fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"An invaluable resource for Civil War historians","review":"Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance: A Guide To Large Artillery Projectiles, Torpedoes, And Mines by Civil War expert Jack Bell is a straightforward, highly specialized, exhaustively detailed, 537-page reference to the large munitions employed in the Civil War. A brief introduction and glossary enhance this unique volume, yet the bulk its pages are devoted to specific ammunitions with each shell accompanied by a black-and-white photograph as well as scale measurements, brief commentary, dimensions, and a listing of where they were most often used. Civil War Heavy Explosive Ordnance is a truly impressive and invaluable resource for Civil War historians and military history buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Company","review":"Never received item even after all there excuses.

If you come to this album expecting it to sound like a third Belly album, you will be disappointed. However, once you spend some time with it, the country-tinged melodies and Tanya's beautiful vocals really take hold. All of the songs have a wonderfully intimate feel to them, and it's easy to forget that this is a \\"live\\" album. I highly recommend buying this as an entire album and not just cherry-picking songs as it comes alive when listened to from start to finish (a rare treat these days, it seems). That being said, personal favorites include \\"Kundalini Slide\\" and \\"River Girls,\\" with Tanya's amazing version of the Beatles \\"Long, Long, Long\\" being the high point of the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I think there may be a little too much \\"country\\" feel to the selections this artist performs, which is not up my alley.

Bought the book but did not learn any thing new."},{"rating":"2","title":"When in Naccos","review":"For me, the strength of this book is more Llosa's writing than the plot(s). The book centers on three related stories: a murder mystery, a love story and the atrocities of the Senderistas (Shining Path). The stories are each compelling although there are a few meandering paths along the way, such as character development for individuals who die a few pages later. That said, Llosa's writing is amazing: I would read his grocery list. In this book, he adeptly moves between current and past events, first and third person, all within the same paragraph. His descriptions of the Andes and its people are vibrant. Overall, a fantastic book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, depressing read","review":"This is a great book, and a good intro to Peruvian literature and culture. I found the subject very depressing- but in a 'think beyond what you see' kind of way. Definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is about violence","review":"This book is a portrait of violence, of it's culturule roots and the circumstances that can bring it out of normal human beings. The story is located in the surreal atmosphere of the Peruen Andes. A Simple good hearted police man Litome (whom we've met in Aunt Hulia ) is investigatin a series of mysterious disappearences, and finds himself in a quest after the origins of human evil. His finding are horrific. This book is not easy to read, but it is a very good one and deeply recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"feels like you're trying to catch your breath in the Andes","review":"Death in the Andes is a haunting book about the violent civil upheaval in Peru. I couldn't shake bad dreams about Pishtacos weeks after I read the book because of its' closeness to reality. Despite this, I recommend it. It reads like anthropology and history as it elucidates religious beliefs, politics, and viewpoints from different groups of people in Peru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent storytelling and insights","review":"This is a stunning novel. It provides a great picture of the fear brought to the highlands by Shining Path, and it reveals a very foreign superstitious psyche that some cling to. It's a great read, though beware. It gets quite violent and vulgar.To get the most out of the book, read some background on Peru from a travel guide like the one from Lonely Planet. I read this novel five years ago and missed much of what I got this time as I read it along with various other texts in preparation for a trip to Peru."},{"rating":"1","title":"disgusting and stupid","review":"seldom have i read such a stupid and pointless book! in addition it is crude and vulgar. save your money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something of Heroism, Something of Life","review":"The greatness of Tennyson's epic poems lie in the careful mix of life and legend. We are drawn in by stories of great heroism and power, with clashing steel and gallant oaths. But we also are forced to explore and consider very normal things about life; being worn down by constant nagging, suspicious spouses, temper tantrums, and tired old men. As a result, the \\"epic\\" is also easy to relate to, without losing the grandeur of its time and deeds.I cannot recommend this highly enough to people who want to know how chivalry may be recaptured in our world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book is certainly a classic in all regards. I feel that every man alive in this day and age should read this to revive the idea of chilvary and bravery.

Give me an old book with yellowed paper and a magnifying glass over this.I could not return as it is too late, but this will be relegated to the bottom shelf - no coffee table book - worst presentation of a book I've seen since high school text books with cheap slippery paper.

This is poetry, not prose, Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review for General Books LLC edition - NOT the Penguin edition","review":"The General Books LLC edition is a terrible edition of Idylls of the King. I guess the first clue for me should have been the name on the cover - Alfred Tennyson Tennyson?? How about Alfred Lord Tennyson. Also, the price was ridiculous, especially considering this edition isn't even broken up by idylls and the idylls themselves aren't broken the way Tennyson intended. That's what I get for buying a book in a hurry and not taking the time to see what else was available. I've since bought a Penguin edition and it is MUCH better. It is in the format Tennyson intended and many of the archaic words Tennyson used are defined in the back of the book. The only positive things I can say about this edition is the binding seems to be good quality and the pages are made of good stock. But, worth $32?? Nope"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like a one-woman funny play","review":"I love her casual approach to developing characters.

A must-see for fans of original comedy and comic acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the wait","review":"I was waiting for the book. The aftermath of the downfall of Tsvong Lah and how the enemy would regroup. Nothing. I plot and undetstanding what their goals are is unclear. Why are Mara and Luke stikcking around in a fight witha slaveship when they could be off in the unknow regions for the last month?? Poor Ben will never get to see his scatterbrained parents that way...I would like to see Jaina and Jag develop or die away and I wish someone would come along for Kyp, just like they did for Lando.

By far the worst SW-EU noel series (and of course the longest). I only read this series because I started reading the Legacy of The Force series that came after the NJO and those books kept referencing back to things that happened during the Vong war that I didn't know about... so I read the NJO series... almost every book in this 19 book series was boring, poorly written, predictable and incredibly dry. I would only recommend reading this series if you are just DYING to know what went down in the war word-for-word. If you can live with the abridged version, look it up on Wikipedia or something and find out the main details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Low in the Star Wars Book Universe","review":"The only book i liked in The New Jedi Order series was the first book by Salvatore, Vector Prime. Since then the series has failed to hold my interest, with its lack of focus and coherent plotline. Too many things are going on, and at a length of 15, the series needs to reach some kind of conclusion.Unfortunately the books in this series have become indistinguishable from each other. There is the usual New Republic politics, the Yuuzhan Vong making some gains, and our heroes making desperate stands, barely managing to hold off total destruction.If you want to read really good Star Wars fiction, read Timothy Zahn's books. There are 5 that I'm aware of. Zahn's exciting plot, discussion of Jedi power limitations, and intriguing characters (Grand Admiral Thrawn etc.) make it worth your time.Stop wasting your time with this series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"suicide from boredom","review":"I am stuck in a terrible position. My OCD really wants me to finish this book but I do not. This book is horribly written. At least every 5 mi uses I fund myself seriously wondering what is going in. I don k ow who the people are in the conversation or what they are talking about. Then I will keep reading and slowly start to figure out a little bit ... then BAM! Same thing happens. 2 writers did nothing but make this book confusing. Don't read this unless you absolutely can't help yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Force Heretic I: Remnant (Star Wars: The New Jedi Order, Boo","review":"Another great adition to this new and exciting series that star wars fans have gotten to enjoy.

These are some of the weakest books of the series, and found them just barely enjoyable and then only because I enjoy the Star Wars milieu so much. The basic problem is that they make very little sense. After reading the whole series I still have no idea who the \\"force heretic\\" the title refers to is. And I have only the foggiest idea why the characters think the quest for Zonama Sekot is important. While we're on the subject, the characters are poorly drawn and their actions make little sense.

I need to contact Amazon to figure out what to do. Just some advice... DON'T PURCHASE FROM STEWART TOYS! They don't stand behind their junky toys! Their toy pizza that I bought is very junky as well and the pizza cutter already broke. What's ironic about this whole thing is... if you look them up on the internet, the owner of Stewart Toys wrote about himself bragging that he started his toy business due to lack of quality toys out there...

If you're a beginner then starting with this book is a really good idea and then move on to read Warren Buffett's letters to shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway, Phil Fisher's 'Common stocks and uncommon profits', and if you're really dedicated then Ben Graham's 'Security Analysis'.PS: This review is for the 2006 edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Formula\\" does not reconcile with financial statements","review":"The financial metrics of most of the stocks on his \\"magic\\" list DO NOT match the financial statements of those companies, if you apply the same \\"formula\\" as described in the book.

The book is about 150 pages and about 5 of them are worth reading. If you just read the appendix you can save yourself a lot of time because that is the whole book. The rest of the book is the author trying to be cute and telling stupid stories.The author says if you buy stocks with high earnings yields and return on capital you will beat the market. However, he uses EBIT/enterprise value for the earnings yield. I don't know why he doesn't use free cash flow instead of EBIT. The author also tells you to turnover 100% of your portfolio each year, but ignores taxes when he shows the results for his \\"magic formula.\\" He also ignores transaction costs (especially important for those that have small sums of money or don't use a discount broker).If his magic formula works then it works and it is hard to argue with facts.

The author emphasizes that the time horizon for his investing philosophy should be at least 3 years. For small investors, the necessary tools to apply his formula are not available elsewhere, so what happens if the website is not available after a year?If I had some assurance that the website would be available, I would give it 5-stars.

Why unhappy? The author tries hard to keep things entertaining, as well as provide a stream of gained-through-experience wisdom. The production values of the book are good, too. But the author's message about what will likely work are not entirely convincing, nor are they that different from what hears from financial analysts on TV or in the newspapers. I suspect that for many investors this book will end up on a shelf, little used, gathering dust, eventually to make its way to charity book sales (used book shops won't want it unless you sell your copy early, as they will be quickly innudated).

No competent journalist interested in a fair and accurate treatment of a tribe as controversial as this would consider that an adequate effort. There is a fascinating tale of who these people are, of how they achieved what they have, whether by hook or by crook, of how the money and change in status has affected both them and the region.

I came to this conclusion with two questions to myself. Is there any one single individual who was involved in the passage of the 1983 Mashantucket Pequot Land Claims Settlement Act that supports Benedict's allegations that Congress was duped? No. Could I identify as a factual matter (not Benedict's opinion) any new and compelling evidence in the book or since its publication that would warrant a Congressional investigations and hearings? No. Apparently Congress doesn't think so either. The fact is, Mr. Benedict wrote a novel that can be best described by his own words. 'The best lies are often times laced with bits of the truth.'

On the one hand, the plot depends on a 1 in 1 million event that occurs twice (with slight variation). That's a bit much for me to swallow, especially in a genre where a big part of the illusion is the gritty \\"realism\\" of the story. On the other hand, I happen to like this kind of writing:\\"He could see the bottle rising to her lips, and then her lips meeting the lips of the bottle, as though the bottle were something alive, making love to her. . . he saw the bottle as a loathsome, grotesque creature that had lured Doris and captured her and pleasured itself with her, draining the sweet life from her body as it poured its rottenness into her.\\"If this kind of writing is not quite your style, then this is a book to skip.

In large part as a result of this bold approach, Kripke comments have become both extremely well known and controversial. Readers unfamiliar (or rusty) with Kripke may find the pertinent chapters in Scott Soames' excellent Philosophical Analysis in the Twentieth Century, Volume 2: The Age of Meaning helpful in preparing for this text.Overall, I recommend this book to readers of analytic philosophy - it is a relatively quick and enjoyable read.

Caouette's imagination is brilliant; taking your mind with him with his usage of video, snapshots, answering machine messages, and whatever else came into his mind....just as with Rooks (no computers in Rooks' filmmaking). \\"Tarnation\\" is painfully personal which allows the viewer to capture Caouette's humor, pride and above all his love and caring not only for his own mother but this film made him aware of human dignity and what being a real human being is about with love and care for others....and with cool music.

My intention with this book was to give it as a gift, and when I opened the package I was suprised as to the condition and the missleading representation the book was given. When you first look at the posted picture of the book it appears to be a new publication, there is no description of the age or condition of the book and I think the seller should have included that info.

I don't understand how this book is racist besides Sambo, Mumbo, and Jumbo's titles \\"little black\\" and the artwork. But the artwork just portrays the views of the time, and I've never understood how calling someone \\"black\\" is racist and calling someone \\"white\\" is'nt.

It took me a while to get through it, but I enjoyed reading it. It's a bit of a mix between storytelling and philosophising. The philosophising isn't particularly deep, and the storytelling isn't particularly riveting, which is why it took me a while to finish it, but I did find it entertaining, and was able to relate to many of the sentiments expressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment after BLJ","review":"This books pales in comparison to his \\"Blue Like Jazz\\". While a cross country road trip is a great premise for a book- this one just falls flat. The conversations seem wooden and not terribly realistic for two 'dudes' traveling together. The 3rd character, their ancient VW van which breaks down at frequent intervals, should have been given a name to add some texture and imagination at least.I think the fact that they had to travel mostly on interstates and had very little time to actually linger in the towns and backwaters they encountered meant that at best you have a few meaningful encounters but largely time is spent just trying to cover mileage fast and cheap.Average read and I've already put it in the 'goodwill' box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"I'm a fan of Donald Miller, so it's bound to get a good review from me, but this truly was a very good book- not as overtly spiritual in some ways as his other books, but some parts of it had me laughing so hard that I had to momentarily put the book down- those sections were very difficult to read outloud, needless to say.I would reccomend this book to anyone that is a follower of Christ and enjoys a good laugh with a spiritual message."},{"rating":"2","title":"TPD -- A refreshing jaunt through the life of a pre-Blue Like Jazz Donald Miller","review":"An excellent, quick read. To be perfectly honest, I wasn't necessarily expecting apologetics from Don in this one -- based on my other reads at the moment (Jim Wallis, Francis Schaeffer), Don's musings provided a simple, relaxing commentary on the very events that shaped his, dare I say, revelatory style of candid writing. Instead of clamoring at the front doorstep of Borders, like a Harry Potter fanatic, for Don's next novel, I plan on leisurely strolling in, picking up a copy on sale, and relaxing in my living room with a glass of wine in hand. I reckon that's just how he would want me to delve into his next story of hope, heartache, faith, love, and honesty."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that brings you back to the basics","review":"I read Through Painted Deserts while traveling to Australia for a study abroad trip. Miller retold the places he had visited with his friend in the West of America, a few of those places I have been. It made me reflect on those expereinces and realize how blessed I am.More importantly, it made me realize that I needed to take the next 4 months I had in a different culture to the outmost extreme. I couldn't judge people (as Miller explains in examples). The key note, however, was that we need to stop for a second and realize the beauty of the simple things in life. When we do that we see a side of God. And that was wonderful advice for me entering a new country, but something I can take home too.The book helped me and entertained me. It will do the same to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed...","review":"I'm normally quite a fan of Donald Miller, but I found Through Painted Deserts, as another reader put it, too self-conscious. While he has some occasional pithy comments (I've been haunted by the \\"how\\" vs. \\"why\\" question since I finished the book), he sacrifices the actual narrative for his own ramblings. As a caveat, though, I've read the original Prayer and the Art of Volkswagen Maintenance (which this book was an editing of), and found it to be much more spiritually honest and narratively raw. There's more Jesus in it, I thought, which is unfortunately the point that Through Painted Deserts kind of misses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read!","review":"I loved \\"Blue Like Jazz\\" it was a awesome book. I followed it up by reading this book which didn't catch my attention at all! It was about a road experience that wasn't even interesting. Save your time and money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A brief Comparison","review":"Through Painted Deserts is Miller being his usual self. He's candid, probing and relational. This book is a journey to be shared, as Miller assimilates his own thoughts on life and God. While not as deep as his other books, it is worth reading. I recommend it for anyone who is looking for a book that allows the reader to enjoy life the way it was meant to be lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"I was quite disappointed in this book. I forced myself read to page 100 or so, and then I had to abandon this book. The author came across as arrogant as he kept telling the reader about all the supposedly \\"funny\\" things he did and said. For example, while at the Grand Canyon the park service agent asks for his registration, so he gives her his blockbuster card, then some other membership card--and he's telling this story because he apparently thinks that this is funny or clever, while it is just annoying. What I could get through all seemed rambling, boring, and pointless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans of Blue Like Jazz, Avoid","review":"I loved Blue Like Jazz, and liked Searching for God Knows What a lot, but this left me very cold. The sort of feigned modern-day Kerouac thing just comes off as pretentious &, worse, dull. Neither Miller nor his travelling companion are very compelling characters. Their adventures are not all that interesting. The insights sprinkled through the narrative are few & far between, and really not all that insightful. It was if he wanted to merge a Bill Bryson travellogue with Blue Like Jazz - but forgot the humor found in both. Instead, we get a couple of really fairly dull guys limping along the American West in a beat up VW van. Miller is witty enough that I can't quite give him only one star, though probably should. Call it 1.5 stars. Not good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Author","review":"I have not yet had the time to finish this book, but have nothing but wonderful things to say about the author. Highly suggested!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Smooth Read","review":"Don Miller can really write. I'm convinced that his conversational and beautifully descriptive style could make any topic interesting; however, the story was interesting enough. It takes us along the author's journey across the U.S.A. with his friend Paul. They have some cool adventures, some detours, and some great conversations about love, GOD, and the mystery of this series of events we call life. I read it in a matter of days because the humor and smooth narrative style make it a quick and easy read. I appreciate Miller's insights on the metaphor that GOD intended nature to be. I think the road trip was taken when he was very young and you can tell in his conversations and philosophical narration (it can be a bit immature at times) but its still some great food for thought in there.In three words, the book is: Hilarious, Inspirational, and Thought Provoking. Well, four words technically."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting read","review":"At first I didn't know why I found this book to be so riveting. Upon reflection I realized it was because I felt like I was actually there with Mr. Miller throughout his trek and sojourn. For me it was just light-hearted and enjoyable reading, not really burdened with weighty or theological content, although there were some meaningful moments along the way. I recommend that you read this book after his hit Blue Like Jazz, even though this is chronologically backward, as it will help you to understand how he got to where he was when he wrote BLJ.RJC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love a good road trip Honest.. open .. refreshing view on God","review":"this book was a very open and honest christian memoir. I love his perspective on things and the honesty of searching -but-not-searching-for God is refreshing.He gives so downright funny stories about his trip cross country and the sometimes smart ass mouth that gets him in deep trouble at truck stops.I like how God loves these boys in their mess and Paul is constantly challanging Don to be and do better.Recommend Blue Like Jazz too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but scattered thoughts","review":"I appreciated the conclusions drawn by Don and Paul, but got tired listening to the long, overly descriptive narratives about the Volkswagen van. The book seemed a bit scattered and I kept thinking to myself, just get to the point. It would probably be a good read, but the narrator was boring to listen to. There was only just enough adventure to keep my attention to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I love this book -- not only is it stunningly written, it's a story that resonates with almost everyone.

And they don't push she the original cast out of the way, instead they compliment it, adding even more depth to the family than there was in the beginning. The stories are down to earth, without being overly sentimental or sappy (like some other comics that I won't name) and you can easily relate to the characters and recognize your own events in your life.

Again, that is my personal opinion based upon having spent several months now looking for information and training on options.On the positive side, I enjoyed the instructor.

I must say though, the scent is very mild - I can hardly smell it on me which is a good thing (would mean more chemicals and that defeats the purpose of this product).

Even Billy Gibbons ferocious soloing is toned down. Sure this album made big bucks but so what? it sucks from beginning to end, no wonder teens brought it in droves it hardly would appeal to lovers of 'la grange' If you're looking for high octane boogie forget it, if you're looking for something that people who don't really like rock, but feel they have to have something slightly rocky, be my guest.

If you asked me then what was the best ZZ Top album ever made I would have said \\"Eliminator.\\" With all those cool videos being played on MTV and hearing them all the time on the radio. Thing is I grew up and started to get into their early albums. Now I would say \\"Deguello\\" racks as my favorite from them. Don't get me wrong, I still dig this album. With songs like \\"Legs\\", \\"I Got The Six\\", and \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" who would not. Thing is that at least in my area this CD is on the radio 24 hours a day!

It's classic how Pullman pulls Paradise Lost into portraying his own view points of the world. I should have guessed. Don't buy it, Pullman has apparently no idea of Milton's history, and has misread the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Doesn't work","review":"This is a cheap, single MP3 CD that doesn't play in any CD player I have tried to use it with. The case cover is slightly different from the one pictured. The actual cover has the same artwork, but clearly indicates that a single MP3 CD is enclosed. The Amazon page seems to have deleted any reference to how many CDs are included, and what format is used. In this way the advertisement is misleading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Pullman has no understanding of Milton, actually he can do nothing but project his views on to Milton and Paridise Lost. This does neither he or Milton any good. I think if you want to read Milton then one should read Milton, I really think that after all these years he can stand on his own. But if you are impressed by the cover and the looks of a book, then this shallow self adualtion will do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly valuable","review":"I was assigned to read Paradise Lost on my own over the summer and I am so glad that I chose the Norton Critical edition. Obviously, reading Paradise Lost is a daunting task for anyone who isn't a religious historian and without the Norton Critical edition, I might not have finished the epic at all (which would be much of a loss, not only in my grades.)This edition has a vast array of extremely helpful footnotes (have a Bible at hand for all those cross-references) and it has large margins for taking plenty of notes of your own. More than half of the book is a collection of various literature, excerpts and explanations that are also quite helpful.Certainly, there is no doubt that Paradise Lost is an excellent work, but the Norton Critical edition is invaluable for any average person (like me) who wants to truly appreciate it. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milton's Art for eternity","review":"This is one of the timeless classics of our language. Milton's great masterpiece was written in his failing years. He had just narrowly escaped execution and was quite blind. Despite all this he penned his best work and cemented a reputation second only to Shakespeare. This epic in blank verse is not an easy read but it is worth the effort. His gift for language, words and grand ideas not least of which pens Lucifer as a sympathetic figure ... is amazing. Read this work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've seen","review":"Nice edition of this work. Has good footnotes, and contains much besides the poem itself, including information on Milton's life, and a section on sources that Milton used, and \\"classic\\" and modern criticism of the work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milton Transcendant!","review":"This is one of my favorite texts for diving into and reveling in Milton. The editor, Barbara K. Lewalski, has chosen the Spelling and Capitaliztion that i prefer, wherein the nouns are capitalized and italized. If one does not enjoy stretching one's mind to grasp the Miltonic sentence and meter, then avoid investing in this marvelous edition. Just look out for a Bantam or Signet mass market paperback to satisfy one's curiosity or school requirement. But for those would consider the investing in the Riverside or the Modern Library editions, etc. then also consider this labor of Lewalski to bring Milton to the us."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"better to reign in hell than serve in heaven...\\"","review":"What can one say about Paradise Lost? Say it is epic, brilliantly wrought, a profound picture of God, Satan and all that is in between. It is all these things, and more. I can say, upon reading Paradise Lost with resolution that it is no less than the highest and most skilfull use of the English language that I have yet seen or expect I shall ever see. In Paradise Lost, Milton poses some of the most fascinating questions about human nature and the nature of free will manifest in any work of literature. It is a brilliant work to be appreciated and honored by all who respect art, and seek a fuller, richer life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Poem, Great Edition","review":"Milton is hard to read. The language of the late 1600's seemed impenetrable to me at first, but Teskey's notes helped me through it. Not much has to be said about the poem itself: it is cemented in the canon of the English language as a masterpiece. One thing I was surprised by was the sympathetic construction of Satan. He is not an evil character, he is just angry and even embodies human traits. This edition also includes John Milton's work Areopogatica about the Church of England and their licensing rights. I was moved by Milton's defense of free speech."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I love this book. John Milton brought The Principalities down to my level.

It's not only for religious people, it's classic literature for all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A misreading.","review":"By making the embodiment of evil heroic Paradise Lost undermines our concept of the heroic. The poem does not represent evil as heroic. It represents the traditional virtues of the heroic as evil. Pullman has misread this completely and has framed the poem within this misreading.... \\"better to reign in hell than serve in heaven\\" is a fine line, noble, staunch, heroic, but it is also a lie as to the minions who hear it it collapses into \\"better to serve in hell than serve in heaven,\\" which is facile.Pullman's trilogy is very well written, but is, in part, a fleshed out misreading of Paradise Lost. That is fine, and I enjoyed reading it. But it is irritating when Pullman presents Milton as some kind of ally in this misreading, which Pullman does with this edition of Paradise Lost, and which Milton is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"product no-show","review":"I sent for this product many weeks ago and have received nothing.

The text is at least as good as any of the other editions I have looked at, the footnotes are top-notch, and the critical articles are some of the siminal works. My only gripe is that there are no visual markers in the text for the footnotes, they are simply at the bottom of the page, signified by line number.

My opinion is that this is for a person who is into high-caliber poetry.I am an avid reader, but for some reason, I was unable to get into this book--at all. I had to re-read sections multiple times to understand the meaning, and it was exhausting to refer to the multiple footnotes on every page. Perhaps this isn't my ideal genre.I will say that those who created this book did their homework, and made a great attempt to help the reader understand its content. You read a bit about the biography of the author in the beginning, and understand where he comes from in life.I know this is an absolute classic book, but for me, I strugggled a bit while reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to Read","review":"This version suffers from the major, all to common flaw, of many translated works.Literal translations and attempts at keeping rhythm in another language can often make great works difficult to follow smoothly or even comprehend.I read classics for entertainment and inspiration.

I read about 25 percent of the book then I gave up. There were words in the book that were not even words according to the dictionary so I didn't know what their meaning was in relationship to the story(poem). I talked to my daughter-in-law who is a English Literature teacher at a college in Colorado; she said she had to read Paradise Lost while she was working on her college degree and if there was any way she would have been able to get out of reading it she would have but since it was part of her class she had to read it.If anyone has the patience to sit through this sort of writing this is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"good book, horrible spelling","review":"I made it to the middle of book two before I decided I would go to the library Monday and check this book out.

Any they look so much better on a larger scale that in the smaller print books."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epic Poem of the English Language","review":"John Milton's \\"Paradise Lost\\" is one of the all-time classics of English literature. The epic poem begins with Satan just having been expelled from Heaven. Adam and Eve are tempted in the Garden of Eden, and fall. Before the two are expelled from Eden, Adam has revealed to him some of the major events of the Old and New Testaments, culminating in the Second Coming of Christ. The epic has enthralled readers for well over three centuries.One thing that must be borne in mind when reading this work is that Milton's theology was not orthodox Christian theology, but Arianism, as he denied the Trinity and believed that Christ was not eternal, but created by God the Father. Also, the seventeenth century English is difficult to plow through. However, by forcing the reader to reflect on the origin of evil and to consider what they believe about the concept of original sin, \\"Paradise Lost\\" proves to be worth the effort one must make in reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Erudite Poets","review":"A Christian classiic which I had difficulty following.

The atomic clock feature works great. If the power goes off; day light savings time; whatever, the clock will reset itself. The radio has a good sound for its size. The negatives are: 1. a little complicated to set the alarm, but after doing it a few times no problem2. the clock face light is too bright for our dark bedroom so I always use the dimmer control on the bottom of the unit.

It's handy when you're groggy and can't remember whether you turned the alarm off or just hit snooze.I didn't find the humane waking system to be as nice as I expected -- it seems to ramp up too fast -- but it is still a nice thing to have.Right now my primary complaint is that the analog clock has just stopped working, after only a couple weeks of ownership.

It grabs you, holds you, and delivers a fast paced ride into action-adventure.A fine cast headed by the never disappointing Scott Glenn, Craig Wasson, and Giovanna Zacarias. Supporting roles are provided by Harvey Keitel, Jonathan Brandis, and Miguel Sandoval. Great acting all around.Lest we not forget, there is a wonderful bit by Vikki Carr whose voice has grown moody and mellow with age.Good storyline directed by Arthur Alan Seidelman who has previously given us a string of hit TV movies.Special mention must be given to the magnificent cinematography of Chuy Chávez. Superb lighting and camera work.This film deserved more attention then it received. It's high grade cinema.Don't hesitate.You'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"If you're into made-for-tv quality movies, Puerto Vallarta Squeeze is for you. I wasn't expecting much and that's exactly what I got. I've seen a few movies with Scott Glenn where he was a supporting actor and that's where he should stay. In my opinion, he just wasn't very good as the lead and shouldn't be in the lead of an \\"action\\" film. He came across as way too old to be as lethal as he was portrayed to be that it pushed the envelop of believability. The \\"love story\\" aspect of the movie was laughable.The premise of the movie is nothing new (which isn't a bad thing), but the production value and acting is made-for-tv quality or in this case, straight-to-video quality. Avoid this movie, not even Harvey Keitel could save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Puerto Vallarta Squeeze","review":"This movie was truly a roller coaster ride! A story of vengence, deceit, betrayal and finally redemption - WOW! The cast really complemented each other - no slackers. The vistas of Mexico gave the storyline a heightened reality. Needless to say that I have recommended this movie to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn","review":"Got this because I'm a fan of Scott Glenn, always good to see him carry a movie. A movie with surprising heart and interesting situations between the characters. A big plus is that we visit Mexico and DO NOT have an evil Mexican crime lord 'Jefe'. The villain is American! Sort of a Bourne Identity for Scott Glenn, a role he handles superbly. The movie is a little long at parts (like the serenading dinner or the trips to the bus stop), but has a great conclusion that satisfies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A drama with a heart","review":"I enjoyed this movie.You actually feel connected to the hitman and start to side with him. I found that most of the people that he killed deserved it. The cast was good and so was the plot. It does drag a little here and there but it also has some good action and the violence is not too over the top. There are some views of Mexico that you don't normally see in the movies. Scott Glen and Harvey Keitel were great in this move and if you are a Jonathan Brandis fan you will enjoy his unusual part as a CIA hitman sent to kill the other hitman even though he only has a few small parts in the movie he very good in it.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great musical set for little ones!!","review":"We gave this as a gift to our 3 yr old son for Christmas.

It is much more realistic.

I gave this clock as a gift to be used as a bathroom counter clock. When a new battery was installed in the clock, it was discovered that this clock DOES NOT keep good time! It lost several minutes even within the first hour. So, I cannot recommend this clock if you are actually wanting to use it as a timepiece.

There was no discussion about brushes and their use. There was no discussion about age appropriate make-up. There was only one young model. There was no other skin colors to demonstrate on. Hydration method is just getting your brush wet. It was assumed that you already knew what you were doing and here are some very expensive helpful hints. It is only 1/2 hour and you can learn most of it from just reading magazines. There is a lot of talk about color but not really any instructions about it.

However, if you're a fan of The Misfits and/or Danzig, this is a treat to own. While the recording quality is pretty bad, you won't care, because if you like the Misfits, you've learned to overlook that. So \\"Live: '85-'86\\" is basically every great Samhain song played live. It starts with a remake of the Misfits' \\"All Hell Breaks Loose\\" simply re-titled \\"All Hell\\" and ends the concert in the Samhain classic \\"Arch Angel\\". Personal favorites on this album are \\"The Howl\\", \\"All Murder, All Guts, All Fun\\", \\"Black Dream\\", \\"Death Comes Ripping\\", \\"Mother of Mercy\\", \\"To Walk The Night\\", \\"Halloween II\\", \\"London Dungeon\\", and \\"Arch Angel\\".

My wife is particularly enthralled with it as it revitalizes her feminist backbone, something that needs to be done around the country during Bush jr's reign. This book is giving her ideas of possibility in reclaiming humanity, with beginning where it all starts: with women taking the reins and making this world right. We are all one; we need to accept each other and stop the violence against women worldwide. We must end war and violence in general in order to attain peace. Sonia is radical in that she recognizes the failures of patriarchy and speaks truth to power. Her thinking is sublime. Wholly recommend this book to awaken the giant that is Woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for pendants","review":"I wish I had given more credibility to the negative reviews. Frankly, I don't understand how there ecould be so many positive reviews. It's an ok chain - if you want to wear it by itself. But it's not good for pendants, as advertised. It remains perfectly stiff and oval shaped when worn - even a large pendant doesn't pull the chain down as a pendant normally does.

It's my favorite way to watch that book!Well, it's really amazing, however I would add one thing. I mean, I'm missing there the explanation why that hotel is so luxury. Ok, you can see it while watching it, but there is nothing about service at the hotels, management etc. It's more about architecture, design. But still, this book is worth buying it! For sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A reflection on the publisher, NOT the author","review":"Wish I had read the reviews before purchasing this particular publication.I was thoroughly enjoying the book, until page 176 of \\"Goodbye to Berlin\\", at which point I was in utter confusion until I realised pages 176 & 177 were repeated from the first story in the book, \\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\".I don't seem to be able to find the content of those missing pages anywhere online and I have NOT received a response from the publisher, New Directions (editorial@ndbooks.com)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book, Unacceptably Shoddy Printing","review":"Needless to say the story is great. It's unfortunate that the publisher, New Directions/James Laughlin, couldn't be bothered to reset the type to fit the size of the page. Also, A SECTION OF THE TEXT IS MISSING.

Try to find another edition than ISBN 978-0-8112-0070-7"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Publication Error!!!","review":"This review has nothing to do with wonderful written parts of the book. Instead it has all to do with the printed book itself. I have received two different copies of the same edition printed by New Directions Publications Corp. in 2008 and sold here at Amazon. Both of these copies, which I have since returned, have pages 176 and 177 from the first story, The Last of Mr. Norris, duplicated in the second story, A Goodbye to Berlin. I tried to contact the publisher about the problem but received no answer from the two emails I sent to them. So if you don't mind missing the information on these two pages, which I believe would actually have explained something that isn't to be found out later on, go ahead and order this missprinted copy of the book.

My review, however, is critical if you want to make sure you have a complete copy of 'The Berlin Stories.' If you order the item, check to see if an errata sheet is included anywhere in the book. It's the size of a single sheet of paper slighly larger than the book and will be loosely inserted somewhere in the text. IF THIS SHEET IS NOT INCLUDED, THEN YOU DO NOT HAVE A COMPLETE COPY OF THE BOOK! The printer made an error at page ninety-six (96) of \\"The Last of Mr. Norris\\" and, as a result, the story loses both continuity and completeness.This review refers exclusively to the copy of 'Berlin Stories' with the \\"double shadow\\" cover and an ISBN of 9-780811-218047; I do not know whether the same error was made in previous editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVE FOR \\"CABARET\\" FANS!","review":"Ladies and Gentlemen...Wilkommen, Bienvenue and Welome to the book that started it all: Christopher Isherwood's \\"Berlin Stories.\\" This book is what the play \\"I am a Camera\\" by Erik Von Deutten wrote...later being adapted into the hit musical known as \\"Cabaret\\", which has a lot of stuff missing from the original book.

Very pleased with this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit","review":"I have a small kitchen and the pot rack fit perfectly above the sink right next to the stove, and was sturdy enough for my whole set of hard anodized steel cookware and utensils. And it looks nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"This one of the worst purchases that I've made. The sponge trays do not drain so you get mold. The soap dispenser leaks soap around the neck, so you get soap globs all over the dispenser. The product rusts. There is nothing good about this product. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"It's ridiculous they designed a product to be used near a sink that can't handle getting wet. The sponge trays don't drain so your sponge will never fully dry and quickly gets disgusting and smelly. The \\"stainless steel\\" is just the look, not the actual material, apparently. Within days of use it started sprouting rust spots all over the silver areas. It looks horrible now and here I am shopping for a higher-quality replacement. Why would anyone even think of creating a product to be used near water that's made of a material that rusts? Don't waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inexpensive, But Inexpensively Made","review":"I would concur with the other reviewers, here. Not having a drain for the sponge is a real design oversight. The soap dispenser occasionally clogs and then 'splatt!', just as you're dressed for work or headed out to dinner, you have soap all over the front of you. I'm not sure this doesn't happen with other dispensers, but it has only added to my displeasure with this one. If you need a cheap dispenser (moving off to college), this is fine. However, the main reason that I'm throwing this dispenser away and looking for another, the \\"stainless steel\\" cap. Not long after I purchased the dispenser, it began to corrode and split. I risk a jagged cut to my fingers (have done this a number of times) each time I have to unscrew the cap to refill. Cheap, cheap, cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, but RUSTS!!!!","review":"I bought this for my newly finished kitchen and was VERY DISAPPOINTED when the metal began to rust after 3 months. Not from the sponges, but on the outside of the unit. I have to have a towel underneath so it doesn't damage my new countertop! I do NOT recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I loved this soap dispenser at first. It really looked nice on my counter until it started to rust. I've only had it for a few months, so it was definately not worth the money. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY! Rusts, looks terrible, leaks!","review":"Seems like a good idea, until you use it. The soap container leaks after not very long at all, so the soap that leaks out causes the container itself to rust and leave rust stains on the counter and sink. The space under the sponge holder also gets soap leaked into that, so it looks permanently gross and rusty. For something that's supposed to make your life look neater and more organized, it's a disgusting mess.DON'T BUY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have owned this for several years. I purchased it at Linens n Things a while back. I have to clean the unit twice or more a week. It doesn't drain and is prone to mold. It also has rusted. I am throwing it out to buy another. Don't bother spending the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhealthy Item","review":"In short order this unit will be rusting on the outside of its alleged stainless base and moldy on the inside. It could have been designed to drain into a plastic base that could have been easily removed for proper cleaning but the manufacturer clearly was not interested in making a unit that would last. In the end, this unit is unhealthy and unsightly, resembling a lab experiment gone horribly wrong! Buy only if you plan on replacing it at frequent intervals!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusts very fast","review":"It is a nice and functional design, but base and soap pump rusted very quickly. Finding that \\"stainless steel\\" and \\"Brushed Chrome\\" and variations are often painted plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps my sink organized and clean","review":"I am pretty happy with this soap caddy and how it has eliminated most of the clutter from my sink area. I put the dish soap in the dispenser, which is much more convenient than the bottles they come in from the store. No more waiting for the bottom of the soap to come out of the bottle.There have been many negative reviews regarding the design, many of which I can understand. Drainage holes would be a definite improvement to avoid water pooling up. I haven't had much problem with it though, because I just ring out the sponge and rinse the caddy out once a week or so. Occasionally I have noticed rust forming on the outside of the metal, which is definitely annoying and should be solved with a better material. It wipes away easily though and isn't permanent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great until...","review":"This was great, until it started to leak! It was compact and looked good, but after about 3 weeks it started leaking soap all around the bottom. Yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product!","review":"I can't say enough about this product. The compact design keeps your dish soap, sponge and scrubber in a minimum amount of space. The clear dispenser adds a decorative touch because you can use the many colored dish soaps they have available now plus you can see when it's getting low. It's also economical because in one-pump it dispenses enough to wash a good amount of dishes so there's no waste and my dish soap lasts longer. With the drainage holes in the caddy part, it helps prevent a build up mold forming on your sponge and scrubber so they last longer too. Clean up is easy too. Overall, I would recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a mess!","review":"The soap leaks out the bottom and creates a big mess. Apparently there is no seal between the plastic and the bottom \\"stainless.\\" The soap leaks out slowly, so eventually you notice hard white crust on the seam. Too bad...it looks great, but has to be scrubbed every few days...and you lose a lot of liquid soap in the process!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree","review":"I purchased this thinking it was a good design but when actually using it discovered it was one of the worst purchases I've ever made and have thrown it out after only a couple of months usage. It does not drain. it molds. it looks old quickly. it is not helpful whatsoever. the sad part is I bought it retail and paid a lot more than this for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say - boring, with 2-dimensional acting","review":"I agree with the negative comments - I eventually stopped watching it - unconvincing acting - (and a small point that I found irritating - in TV movies about war, some of them have a \\"too-clean look\\" that make a film seem unrealistic. There is no dirt anywhere, as far as I could see - everybody looks too clean, the settings look too clean, and not realistic. The acting level was what finally turned me off.

Of course it is always difficult to resume a 600 pages book in a 2 hours movie. John Paul Vann caracter is very well described as this gentleman's life was tough and excited. His view of Vietnam immediately after his 1st arrival (1962-63) is well enhanced. No future to stay longer. As usual nobody at the military establishment did believe him...If they did so it might avoid America to lose more than 50,000 young men. Really so good. Paxton plays really well.

So little."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok if you want a quick and pretty lame version of the war","review":"having seen many vietnam movies, i have to say this was one of the least enjoyable. I have to agree with several of the reviews below that this is a made for TV movie, which is ok. It does have that NBC type of acting to it, where the drama is a little over board to prove a point. good for education but that is about it. for those who are looking for a decent war movie, that has some education in it, rent it. for those who are looking for a documentary on the developments of vietnam, the society, the war itself, and America during the post vietnam period, I HIGHLY suggest purchasing VIETNAM The Ten Thousand Day War. That is a 5 star by far. As a follow up, buy In Retrospect by Robert McNamara. This is also on tape but leaves out a lot from the book. Both this DVD and book will provide you with in depth detail on what took place in Vietnam, and why. Why did the American Government do what they did."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bright shining lie","review":"It is a movie for TV with low budget and low performances.

Therefore they promoted \\"I'll Melt With You\\" when the new wave was hot and stopped promoting any other song by them after the new wave lost its popularity in the market. Idiots because Modern English wrote darn catchy songs. They could have been a hit machine and we could have had good music too listen to on the radio. But NO!!! They had to continue to shove crap down our throats and not even allow a band as good as MOdern English to survive. I really think their tactics are not only irritating, but cruel. After The Snow contained many catchy songs that were intelligently written and enveloped them with many different atmospheres. They even experimented with song structures and it usually worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a reason it keeps coming back...","review":"After The Snow is a stand-out in the vast crowd of 80's popular music and pop icons. It is unfortunate Modern English have been dismissed as one-hit wonders, because the album is worth listening to from start to end. If you were into what was then \\"progressive\\" music in the early to mid 80's, I Melt With You defined that era of music. Funny enough, I believe I have four or five different CD's (albums, soundtracks, collections) that contain that song. This is probably the most valued recording in my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Melt With you: Beyond the 80's wave.","review":"This album is definitively for those who like the 80's progressive bands. At first, I bought the record for the song \\"I Melt With You\\", which I find fascinating. But, if you let all the album play, you will discover great musical arrangements and a musical style that won't get buried in the 80's: it still sounds different and I think that is a great album to have in your collection. About the 4 stars, well... just for the song I Melt With You, I would rate it up to 5. There are newer versions, mixes and so of this song, but if you have listened it, this is the one that's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, Max!","review":"My children LOVE Max and Ruby, and this one is a favorite.

From the start , Fox gushes how the Greeks invented politics, history, ethics, theater and writing about human drama...no one asked a philosphical question before the Greeks...come on Mr Fox!...what about the ancient Egyptians, Hebrews, and other Asian societies? Did the Greeks invent fire, the wheel, agriculture as well? The book reads like a high school textbook- grandiose, superfluous,wordy, out of focus. Many reviewers applaud Fox's psychological insight. I never saw this. For true psychological insight, as well as lucid writing and thoughtful conjecture, read Peter Green's Alexander the Great. The photographs in Fox's book will serve as a useful complement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes you for a long ride...","review":"I've picked this book up in a Florida mall basicly because the movie just came out featuring Colin Farrell. The film took me 3 hours and the book took me 3 months, but every piece of extra time was worth it.This book describes the hardships during the journey and is comprehensive in detail. Seeing the movie afterwards made it feel like so much detail was missing, it just wasn't the whole story. And the movie was based largely on this book.If you like the movie and want to take it a step further, I recommend this book. This is the real story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maps on Kindle edition are atrocious","review":"Considering how important maps are to a book like this, Amazon should be ashamed of itself.It looks like they got grandma to get out the old photocopier she used to use and copy the maps from a dusty version of the print edition.For this negligence in providing a crucial aspect of the book, one star is appropriate....The text itself seems interesting so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"know your geography and grains","review":"Mr Fox lost his way on the plains of Macedonia somehow ending up in pre-Colombian America when he writes of passing through\\"corn\\" fields in Ancient Greece. In Asia his foragers were looking for \\"corn\\" again when it was something they never knew of in that time period. Mr. Fox takes a cheap shot at the Bible as well by calling the Bible account of Esther \\"a myth\\" all the while acknowledging the accuracy of Persian king's harem problemscontained therein.

It will also allow you to critically appreciate popular novels about Alexander (I like those by Valerio Massimo Manfredi and Steven Pressfield; both available at Amazon.com) as well as to understand the strengths and weaknesses of movies (like Oliver Stone's Alexander). Separating fact from fiction with regard to a larger than life figure like Alexander is always difficult, but this book will let you do that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toots gives new life to soul classics","review":"Toots Hibbert (no, Amazon reviewer, his last name isn't Maytal) takes these old soul standards and reworks them into something fresh and exciting. Toots shows why he is one of the greatest soul singers, ever. \\"Love the Rain\\" (really \\"I can't stand the rain\\"--the Annie Peebles hit)alone is worth the price of this cd, but there's so much more--check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best movie I've seen in years","review":"This movie contains some of the freshest new comics out there who give their best performances in this picture.

To get a general idea of the pieces for a cheap price, this is fine, but for serious listening/enjoyment by any musician, look elsewhere. I have to wonder if this is truly Philadelphia on the recording. They are known for a wonderful lush string sound but there were too many shocking \\"yuck/ouch!\\" moments from the violins. The winds also had some unpleasant intonation issues occasionally. I would have expected much better from this orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"After all these years, Danzig still ROCKS","review":"I just can't get enough of Danzig. He was good with The Misfits, he is great by himself. Many years have passed since this release... and even today I sit down and listen to his records back to back. The music is well constructed, the lyrics are awesome: his voice control is formidable and the themes dark and powerful. Awesome riffs that will keep you rocking for many more years to come. I STRONGLY suggest for any self-respecting metal fan to get this and all other Danzig Albums. You will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"'' A CLASSIC DANZIG CD '' ! !","review":"MANY PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF '' DANZIG '' -OR JUST HAVE HIS FIRST RELEASE.

I'd heard that song many times before, but had never thought of trying out one of his cds, so I decided to buy Danzig - the first one. The first Danzig album is almost as good as this one, but not quite. This cd is such an incredible mixture of basic rock, blues, and metal. Danzig has one of the coolest voices I've ever heard; it sounds like a mix of Jim Morrison and Elvis Presley. Buy this album along with the first one. Best songs are: Devil's Plaything, Blood and Tears, Killer Wolf, I'm the one, 777, i'm not even going to keep listing songs because every song on this album is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A DANZIG MASTERPIECE!","review":"This is one of danzig's best albums ever! I listened to all the songs and not one of them were horrible. One the first album, I found some songs that weren't the best but the first is still good. I just didn't find any bad songs on this cd. This is my favorite danzig album. It has many great songs on it such as \\"Devil's plaything\\", \\"I'm the one\\", \\"Long way back from hell\\" and many many more. I highley recomend this album if you really love danzig or want to start listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great mix of songs","review":"Wow,This album really rocks!!. I\`ve only heard this one and their first self-titled debut and it\`s really hard to say which one's best because they both rock, but I must say this one contains much more variation than their first.Here you have great heavy rock numbers (\\"Long Way Back From Hell\\", \\"Snakes Of Christ\\", \\"Tired Of Being Alive\\")a very good ballad (\\"Blood And Tears\\")a semi-ballad (\\"Devil's Plaything\\")and a blues-inspired acoustic (\\"I'm The One\\"). Fans of their first album may be surprised or dissapointed because of the variation but I think i'ts an album that grows after each time you listen to it. Ultimately, I think every rock n'roll fan should own this album, a worthy complement to anyones collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terror and evil is what DANZIG is all about!","review":"This album is definitly one of my favorites and one of the best Glenn Danzig has put out! Every song on this cd is a masterpiece and i have spent several hours listening to this cd over and over again w/out getting sick of it. Those of you looking for the Misfits reincarnated in the band Danzig will be saddened. You will however find a new, slow, melodic sound that will play with your ears and leave u wanting more.

Zevon's vocals are a mess, and although REM can play their own tunes fine (part of their magic was their simplicity), they just aren't high-caliber musicians when it comes to tackling covers. I found this \\"performance\\" to be more like a beer-and-whiskey fueled frat night where a few guys who knew they weren't very good got together for the hell of it, and fortunately it was a weekend when the campus was a bit deserted. In a word, horrific. Save your money..."},{"rating":"2","title":"REM sings the blues!","review":"Most of the members of REM got together to express their love for great American roots music by cutting a blues album under the name Hindu Love Gods, and the result rocks! The content ranges from the classic blues Mannish Boy to Woody Guthrie's Vigilante Man to an outstanding cover of Prince's Raspberry Beret, but the quality shines through out. This is what happens when top flight commercial musicians come together to play what they love, not what they think will make them rich. A must for REM fans, and a surprising treat for blues fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy","review":"I was so excited to find this - my brother had heard it and told me about it so I searched and found it at Amazon.

The other songs are okay, but the Blues tune is way too long. However, I'm glad I bought this CD, just for the Prince cover is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Defining this moment in rock music","review":"Glam Rock was a short lived moment in popular music that essentially lasted only about five or six years, say from 1970 to 1975. In 1970 we were long past the time when Ed Sullivan would only show Elvis from the waist up. The pill has made basic changes in the outlook of the young towards sex. Here in the US, the Viet Nam war, Watergate and Kent state were changing the view of the people.In music the time was ripe for a change and a series of musicians did that with a new form of rock that featured extremely theatrical performances with outrageous (for the time) costume, makeup and sets. This was called Glam Rock. It drew upon the history of previous styles of rock and added a theatrical aspect to music that was minimally modified.This book traces the history of Glam Rock from its beginnings with T. Rex and goes through the advent of Suzi Quatro. It explains what Glam Rock was and a bit about how it evolved into the next phase of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIN and CHEAP","review":"Yes, they are soft, but you can practically see through them.

The door side of the driver's seat had been worn down from repeated ins and outs over the years while the rest of the truck is in very good shape. New seat covers would make a big difference and did. After installing, my only problem was the small cover that goes on top of the center console door. I tried a dozen times to get it on but it was just a bit too small. I called the seller who told me to call the manufacturer; I felt a bit brushed off but I guess that was the best thing to do anyway. The manufacturer was great, asked me to measure my top and sent me two brand new covers, one with an elastic border and one similar to the one that comes with the set. The covers are machine washable and should last as long (or longer) than this truck's lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST thing since Sliced Bread!!!","review":"My Beautician started giving me the Zotos Acclaim Extra Body Acid Perm over 20 years ago, and the product is still WONDERFUL!!!

His ability to go off in unexpected directions and his amazing talent for finding humor where there should be none is just as apparent in his short stories as it is in his novels. WELCOME TO THE MONKEY HOUSE collects a number of early works from the 50's and 60's and the book abounds with gems. Standouts like \\"Who Am I This Time?\\" where acting and life become intertwined in a way that brings a special fascination to \\"Tomorrow and Tomorrow and Tomorrow,\\" where horrendous overcrowding leads to brutally funny machinations in a very extended family are just some examples of Vonnegut's cleverness and insight. I hadn't picked up Vonnegut recently and this book once again reminded me of why he is one of America's great writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time!!!","review":"Monkey House.

There is a great variety so if you don't like some of the far out Vonnegut novels you will find some normal fiction here.

The stories are excellent, and a must for any Vonnegut fan. But this particular Kindle edition is just awful. It's like one long stream of text, not even any Table of Contents so that you can jump to the story that interests you the most. And, as other reviewers have noted, there's been absolutely zero proofreading. It's hard to go more than 1 or 2 pages without a glaring typo staring you in the face, sometimes even in character names.You should definitely buy this book.

I was disappointed with a number of things with this CD. First was the music itself. It seems as if the band was either not motivated to write and record or they were maybe in a slump. It's just that none of the songs have a strong impact and leaves one wanting. Possibly it's the way the songs were produced, they are just missing the extra bit of punch. Lastly I have to say the lyrics seem to be something my son could have come up with; nothing creative or inspirational. I know that the songs are suppose to be fun, but not this simplistic.
