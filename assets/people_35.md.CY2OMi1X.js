I'd have to say I was a bit disapointed in the game. The graphics are not that good. And you can't control any of the people or situations. The only thing you can do is buy a few things to open your gym and wait for participants to enter. And you can read their comments. But you cannot interact with them or anything else. It is also very difficult to upgrade your gym with the little bit of money you get in the beginning. Another thing I disliked was you cannot rotate objects to place in the gym or design it much. Anyway, at least the price was reasonable. After playing it, I could see why the price was so low. I do not recommend you buy this game, even if it only cost a dollar! This is the kind of game you would expect to see on a free online game site."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too short","review":"Probably one of the worst tycoon games I've played. First of all it is way too short. There are only 6 \\"scenarios\\" in the game. You can't really do much with the characters. It does tell you what they are thinking and their stats, but you can't place them anywhere, send them anywhere etc. The staff quits most of the time, and don't really do anything. The characters also rarely \\"work out\\", they just walk around. Sometimes the players will stay stuck on the corner or against the wall. The amount of money you are given is nowhere near enough. You run out of it quickly and it takes an enormous amount of time to build it up.Probably the only cool thing about it is the machines. They are pretty realistic and theres a variety of them. But this is pretty much it.Overall, the game is too short and there are way more downs than ups. I don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game was horrible","review":"I love tycoon type of games. When I saw this game it sounded really good and it could have been a good game since the idea is unique. The people just walk around and complain they very rarely use the equipment. It's very hard and most of the time when I try and direct staff to help the customers by the time they get over there the customer's are already done. I have to agree with everyone else that wrote a review it's very hard to start. I tried starting a new game a couple of times and always go bankrupt. There is no variety of machines and with the amount of money they give you it's hard to start up and attract clients.

There are lots of Walker cds available on the inet now with most of them being imported from England. I say from experience if you're going to buy just one Walker Bros. cd this is the one. It's contains all their hits and some really good less familiar work as well. If some jerk wants to sell you his copy for forty something dollars turn and walk.

The film combines interviews with Gilman volunteers, artists (including Ian MacKaye, Jello Biafra, Blake from Jawbreaker, and members of The Offspring, amongst many others), performance footage from throughout the venue's history (including a young Pinhead Gunpowder, Citizen Fish, DSB, Screeching Weasel, Abandon, and some other amazing stuff), and lots of behind-the-scenes film, photos, and information.

How about The Sell Outs, or perhaps The Posers or maybe The Pretenders (oops that one is taken by a GOOD band already). That way, no one would have to pretend they have just discovered the one new band that doesn't really sound like the rest and isn't in it just for the quick money and quick fame. C'mon folks. Get real. These guys are just another nu metal band that won't be around in a year or two and I along with legions of others can't wait till this genre of music is gone and dead like disco.

At a first listen, their cd was really my kinda music but there just wasn't really anything special. But when I hit track 6, \\"The Story Of...\\" and track 10, \\"Circles,\\" I knew that I would fall in love with this cd.

Their album 'South of Sideways' is a testament to a group of relatively talented young men. I only had to listen to this CD in its entirety once to be hooked on this band and cannot wait for more music releases from this group. The band's sound doesn't sound like any other bands I know and I tend to think this band is searching and experimenting to find their sound and when they do they sure will have their signature on their music. Don't be quick to judge this band and give them some time to get established. They have come up with 3 amazing songs in my opinion full of crashing guitars, rampaging hooks and smooth eclectic beats. Look out for the songs 'Eyes Wired Shut, 'Sweet Suffocation' and 'Circles'. Good effort for a young band's debut on the main stage."},{"rating":"2","title":"dope band","review":"if you like dope melodies, strong hooks, intelligent lyrics, and some plain out dope rock to rock out to...or some rock to sit back and think about stuff to, this is the sh*t"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"This is probably the best CD that has come this decade.

Circles, Break Me Out, The Story Of..., and Tres Quatros are definitely my personal favorites.

It looks like Phil and Sco are having fun on stage, but I don't think people uninitiated to the Phil/Dead style would find this dvd entertaining.Phil has brought the world alot of great music, but I don't think this band is as pleasant to watch for people who are critical & unbiased towards Dead songs.

Maybe it takes longer than 6wks, so I'll keep using it, but ladies with this product you are really taking a chance on wasted money depending on how much \\"lift\\" you need to your upper eyelid.

The organization is not useful for the beginning painter. However, experienced artists will enjoy reading the book, like one would a collection of biographies about old friends. In this case though, the old fiends are pigments, oils and various resins. As an artist I found this book to be more interesting to read than Mayer's book and also a great deal less preachy. The text appears to rely on Eastlake's history with respect to which artist's what used what media, etc. These kinds of references are dated and are not supported by contemporary research.

Furthermore, the manufacturer does not provide a warranty and will send you in circles to resellers and distributors to resolve this.

I live in an area where they are building a lot of new homes.

Walk into any William Sonoma and ask to see a Shun Classic (cheap) and a Shun Fuji (expensive) kinfe. You'll see that the Classic line has a damascus print on the blade while the Fuji has actual damascus cladding. Even the handle is of higher quality. The Classic knives are much cheaper, but once you notice the difference, you probably won't want them. I'd rather have one Shun Fuji chef knife (will use 90% of the time) than an entire set of Shun Classic knives (which will cost more)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous knife","review":"As a caterer, I'm partial to good quality kitchen gear.

But if you are going to do lots of prep work my recommendation is to go to a shop and hold the knives...every cook has a different grip and preference for weight.

The blade chips. If you search online, you'll find many people complaining of this. All Kai/Shun customer service has done was sharpen it when it clearly needs to be replaced. These knives are not \\"hand crafted\\". They are mass produced. They are not made of Damascas steel, only designed on the exterior to look like it. They are not made in the samurai custom, or my knife would probably not be chipping.

For the first four months of ownership I was extremely pleased with the knife. Recently, however, the blade broke in two places so that \\"chunks\\" of metal are missing from the edge. This happened while cutting veggies, not stones. The knife is useless and to my surprise, Amazon will not issue a refund.While this may be a one-off occurrence, I would not buy this brand again.Update (January 2013): Reflecting on all the comments: (1) Amazon is so good about product support, I thought it was realistic to hope for a refund; (2) I did return the knife to the US distributor and after a few weeks received a sharpened knife. The original ultra-sharp edge was removed and the underlying steel blade was sharpened. So on balance, I have a nice knife, but not the thin and sharp Shun; (3) The Shun is a nice knife, but too fragile for me. It is possible to get comparable, but more durable knives."},{"rating":"1","title":"On the Edge","review":"I bought this knife based on Shun's reputation. BEWARE! This knife is, in a word, crappy. After three uses (and I only use it to chop veggies on a seasoned bamboo cutting board), it developed a chip. Then I had it professionally sharpened, and though I'm careful how I clean it and put it away, it barely holds an edge, and my 10-year old Wusthof knife is in better condition than this sorry excuse for a blade.

They sent a replacement with help of contacting the head of Shun.3 years later, after returning the knife twice, It looks like crap. The blade has chipped in several locations and we just don't use it anymore(Too much work to contact Shun again). Other competitive knives have help up longer and stronger and the logo has not rubbed off, even our $9 daily use knife.The look of the Shun knife is awesome but for decorative purposes.

I've been having a lot of trouble finding a knife with a comfortable grip, and therefore having some trouble holding the knife properly and consistently for long periods of time. I settled last year for a Santoku from Henckels, which I still really like, but it just wasn't, you know, *it*. The first time I grasped the Shun out of the box, it just fit -- it was like it was made for my hand. It almost dares me to hold it incorrectly. I'm still adjusting to losing the smooth and easy food release of the Santoku blade, but, the trade-off in comfort is worth it. (Of course, now I'm eyeing the 7\\" Santoku from Shun....)

We are not frequent cooks and was disappointed to see that after a few uses this knife has a chip in it.

Since she just needs some iron daily, I don't feel I have to be exact, but I wouldn't trust this if someone needed an exact amount of meds every day.The most yucky part, it's very hard to clean, and thus, traps mold. If you don't clean the crushed pill out of the grooves after every crush, then it will stick to each other, making even less meds to come out next time. So I rinse with water and dry upside down daily. Even with that, I found mold growing in the grooves. So I guess I will throw out and find something else because I am not going to feed my child mold and I can't get the mold out, I tried a brush and then a toothpick.

I have been searching for a good pill cutter and crusher.In my opinion, this one is a total waste. I trust Amazon reviews and am surprised to see this item rated highly. Here is my take:Pill Cuttter - made of smooth plastic with nothing to keep the pill in place. The pill either flies out the front or slips and is not cut precisely. A good pill cutter needs a flexible surface or guide to hold the pill being cut.Grinder - only works on soft pills which I can crush in a mortar and pestle faster. Plus, the screw top jams when the pill is inside and the teeth fill with whatever pill is ground and have to be washed. Prescriptions are a precise science, to have a grinder that leaves even 5% of the pill behind risks a bad dose.I'm tossing this one in the trash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The most laughable garbage I have ever had the misfortune to read.","review":"Only a self hating white person or a mentally challenged Afro-centrist would take anything in this book seriously.If you look at the barely understandable and grammatically incorrect reviews above you should be able to understand my point.

To assess the accuracy I used various free weights from an olympic set, everything from 2lbs to 35lbs, and I would rarely get the same weight 2x (ie, totally inaccurate).

There is a huge selection of tips that make it seem like this would work with just about any laptop (I'm sure it's not really true, but it seems that way), and my biggest challenge in figuring out which one to use came down to the fact that there were actually two that work acceptably, and I didn't know which one to use!My guess is, if you think you might want this, you'll be happy if you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly cut, difficult to assemble","review":"These are awful boxes.

I always enjoy Spenser's independence coupled with his soft heart and strong attachment to Susan Silverman. This isn't a great novel but it does continue the tradition in a solid way and is nice easy reading.If you've never read a Spenser novel, I would suggest starting at the beginning with the Godwulf Manuscript and on from there for a very enjoyable -- and pleasurably long -- series of mystery novels. The characters are worth getting to know.What I especially like about \\"Bad Business\\" is that Vinnie (he's a really good shooter) now has an iPod. What a great image! There is also a reference to Hieronymus Bosch, a Dutch painter from the 15th and 16th centuries who is also a fictitious character created by the author Michael Connelly in a wonderful series of books. Bosch, the principal protagonist, is an LAPD detective who is named after the painter. Is Robert Parker a fan of Michael Connelly?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Solid, But Uninspiring","review":"I have had a hard time getting into the Spenser books.

Parker.But ... Bad Business is different from most of Parker's - it doesn't seem quite \\"fair\\" in the sense the reader could not have put it all together before the end (at least THIS reader certainly couldn't!). Spenser is fine, Susan is fine, Hawk is fine, just too many other characters, too many plots, too many hard-to-believe circumstances - the ending seems contrived ... one of numerous possible scenarios, most hard to believe.Sorry, it was OK, but far from his best ... which are REALLY good!!

If you're committed to reading them all, maybe you'll do better with this one than I did ... :>)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting Old","review":"Parker has been doing these characters so long that he's begun giving them all the same pat lines. I hate doing a negative, but they're getting boring. How many times do we have to see the line \\"We'd be fools not to.\\" Not only Spenser, but Susan, Hawk, the cops, Jesse Stone and at least two characters in the Sunny Randall series. This particular book...and I have copies of virtually all the others.. is wooden and uncreative. I guess the style became so successful that it seems smart to just continue. However, I got no sense of creativity or caring in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding addition to the series","review":"Parker is in top form as Spenser investigates financial and sexual escapades in an Enron-like company. The book is heavier on plot than some of his later works which is a welcome development. As usual the dialogue is amusing and literate. Susan, Hawk, Rita Fiore, and Vinnie Morris all return. Hawk has a new girlfriend and it appears to be a serious relationship. I hope we see more of her in the next book.I was interested in another reviewer's comment that Spenser was the new Travis McGee. I remember that when John MacDonald died, I wondered if there was another author whose new books I could anticipate with the same eagerness, knowing that reading them would be sheer joy.

There is constantly some sort of static, no matter how far or close you move the thing to the receiver. Even adjusting the wire does not help. I've tried using it in the house with the stereo system, but that's even worse than using it in the car. It appears that the only time it had crystal clear quality was when it was placed in my lap with one end hanging on one side of my thigh and the other end hanging on the other side, and even then, this position does not guarantee static-free reception.

We were looking for a 4 port KVM switch for several test systems we have. If you hit the wrong key on the keyboard, the \\"error recovery\\" takes forever (several minutes--maybe up to 10). Switching between the different systems requires a long sequence of key presses and if you press them in the wrong order, the switch goes into \\"error mode\\" again. It was pretty much useless right out of the box. Also, there is no physical button on the switch itself to switch between the different systems like most other switches have. A switch completely dependent on the keyboard is an idiotic idea. This was just a plain bad, unreliable product! It's only useable if you're a robot that presses the exact sequence of keys (4 to be precise) within some amount of time every time correctly.

Or, you should be able to switch audio, but leave the kvm where it is. I've tried different keyboards and mice, but the command keys for the audio-only are not recognized. Which is a bummer as that's functionality I was hoping for.

I search for you, to document your being, your existence, your very breath because you rebel for me, against all that they say is conventional, permissable and normal. i record your pneuma and the beauty of your unorthodoxy.\\"Be delighted to own this book if you truly appreciate art and the soul that creates it.

For years I've wondered about the woman who took those photographs and how she worked...from getting her subjects to pose for her, to how she developed and processed her film, and also about her life. Revelations provides many answers and more. Kudos to DA's daughter Doon for releasing this material in a beautiful volume that has already provided hours of enlightenment, and it just arrived today. The printing is immaculate and the text is amazing with lots of passages from DA's journals, notebooks, school papers, letters and postcards. This book may well become the definitive work on her, as it provides much more insight to her life and work then the unauthorized biography from the 1980's by Bosworth. This is a perfect book, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I can't rate this product with even one star!

It's extremely thoroughHow to Use Herbs explains herb use in different parts of the world. It lists types of plants used in remedies. Then it reviews the effects of different herbs on the nervous system, cardiovascular, digestive, urinary, etc. It lists sources of herbs (root, bark, leaf, flower, oils, etc.) It tells forms that herbs are taken in (infusions, decoctions, capsules, tinctures, glycerates, syrups, etc.)The second part of the book reviews Body Systems and types of herbs used for different conditions. A diagram of the human body shows what area certain herbs are used for and gives a page for more details on each. For instance it lists 11 herbs used for PMS.The third section has the A-Z Herbal Prescriber.

The tools required were a long srewdriver, 8\\", a crescent wrench or a pair of pliers, tape measure and hammer(to pound the anchoring pegs into the ground). Assembly took about 1 hour. The windmill is well made. The only negative comment I have is that the nuts used in the assembly are square and are sometimes difficult to start on the threads of the screws at the topmost bracket.

If you listen to the original french versions you can see how close Shuman and Blau came in the seventies to Brels intention when they created their NYC review. Walkers voice carries none of the passion and level of expression that Brel demands. Way too soft with no edge, and those ghastly orchestral arrangements! Merde!

There, I'm done with the hyperbole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self Induldged but amazingly iconoclastic!","review":"Scott Walker leaves his unique crooning mark on the works of Brel. He is singular in his choice of material to cover, and his choice here earmarks a respect for his elders.Most of the material has a french, morose feel . Walker's baritone takes us into the surly streets of European colour. Scott's moody singular deep voice has a primal quality that stretches to be older and wiser than the years when this LP was cut.An iconoclast of the rock/POP world his fans search with him in his eratic search for his soul. A must for his fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Handled Tribute","review":"The many available interpretations of Jacques Brel's oeuvre certainly allow for argument as to their relative merits (I myself prefer David Bowie's version of \\"My Death\\" to the one on this album); but from an objective standpoint there's no denying that SCOTT WALKER SINGS JACQUES BREL is a strong and tasteful attempt to inject a bit of mass-market appeal into the work of a particularly difficult and esoteric songsmith. Walker sings beautifully as always, and as in his own compositions manages to find enough ironic counterpoint in the material to offset and thus redeem the sometimes bombastic arrangements behind him. That's hardly surprising, since these cuts are in fact taken from the singer's first three solo albums; nevertheless, assembled in one place they constitute a worthy and cohesive tribute to one modern musical original from another."},{"rating":"1","title":"To the author..","review":"Stop posting the fake reviews.

To be fair I will say that the concept was interesting and writing decent. True I was never quite sure what to make of Alexa, but she wasn't the most immediate issue I faced while reading. The real problem was the missing spark of life. The point where the story went from something you read to a place you could occupy in your imagination. I never felt a compulsion to enter into the Land of Elyon.I found the lifelessness more sad than anything else (especially since writing a book is a lot of work). I have read books much more mundane in their concepts and the writing with a lot to wish for, but they had the life giving spark which made a world of difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cover is the best part of this book.","review":"I was so very disappointed by this book. The cover is just beautiful, but although the book has an interesting premise, the story is so poorly told that I found myself just plowing through the pages to see if what I was pretty sure was going to happen did indeed happen. It did. I'm a teacher of the gifted, and this is not a book I am going to put in my classroom. My students would be bored silly with it; most of them could have written it better. There was no doubt in my mind while reading that an adult male was speaking -- even when Alexa is trying to be funny, she sounds like her father and his cronies. I wondered if perhaps she had hung around with them too much. And what's the deal with inserting fables and gods people already know about, when the story doesn't make any pretenses of taking place on this planet? I actually stopped reading this afternoon to complain to my mother. There was no suspense, no magic, no wonder, just incredible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fantasy world!!! by, AK from North Boulevard","review":"I read the book The Land of Elyon The Dark Hills Divide.

She is spending another summer in Bridewell. Alexa is ready to explore and find away out of the walls that surround Bridewell. She finds away and finds a stone that let her speak to animals. She goes on many adventures with the animals to save Bridewell from evil. One of the problems she has to face is escaped convicts are coming to destroy Bridewell. I'd recommend this book to 4th-6th grade because it is a long book and has small words on a page. This is the first book in a series. You should read the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best.","review":"This book had an interesting concept, but the writing itself simply wasn't very good. On the surface it seems good, a young girl sets off to solve a mystery, save her town, and reveal a traitor. All with the help of some animal friends. Unfortunately the excecution of the story simply wasn't very good. The girl doesn't really solve the mystery, she merely wanders about and people explain things to her. She doesn't actually save the town, or herself. That doesn't make her a strong female protaganist, that makes he a helpless little girl. Not appealing.There were also a lot of plot holes. I know this is a children's book, but children aren't dumb. They deserve a tight, cohesive story and good characters. This book really didn't have either. I'm assuming the later books get better as the author improved his craft, but I don't know if I want to risk my money or time on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Liked It!","review":"This was a well written fun little book.

She lives in the Land of Elyon, and in particular within a walled structure, comprising the central hub of Bridewell, connected to three outlying villages by walled passages, resembling the spokes of a wheel.Originally from the village of Lathbury, she travels to Bridewell with her father for the summer, where an encounter with Thomas Warvold (the man who had the walls built) provides the keys to an unexpected adventure on the wrong side of the wall.Here she finds magic and talking animals, but when a treacherous plot is revealed, the line between friend and enemy becomes blurred.

Sometimes I got really confused and I would blame myself for reading fast, but not after checking again and making sure I was correct.I enjoyed some nice touches in the story, especially mysterious parts; mainly I kept reading the book just to know the end.This book may be better for children than adults or even teens."},{"rating":"2","title":"An instant classic","review":"As a fan of classic childrens' literature, I found The Dark Hills Divide to stack up well against some of the best.

It's fine for background music but for serious listening look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not actually listenable in modern terms","review":"Don't be fooled into thinking you might like this if you're into normal modern type music. It's really maudlin \`\`McArthur Park'' type 60's drama music, only about an order of magnitude more affected with pompous message themes. The guy may have a voice, but this music . . . grotesquely earnest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secrets and Lies","review":"It's always a pleasure to discover a first novel with such depth and promise. Author Ron Rash does not disappoint with this lyrical Southern Gothic murder mystery that is so much more than a crime story. Told through the changing voices of the main characters this novel is rich with passion, tragedy and redemption. It's also a fine mystery that will keep you guessing throughout, as things are rarely as they first appear in this story. Ultimately, the truths of the dead will return to avenge the lies of the living. Worth seeking out. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"great read!","review":"simply a great book! i find it better than 'serena ps' even tho the latter also is a great book too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a New Ron Rash Fan","review":"\\"One Foot in Eden\\" is my first Ron Rash novel and I'm going to order the others.

I could not put it down until I finished it. I enjoyed how the same story was carried out through the perspectives of different characters in complete sections, rather than alternating chapters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genuine Page-Turner","review":"Ron Rash has written an extraordinary first novel. The language and descriptions are flawless. His story is consuming. As a resident of Oconee County the references stirred up vivid pictures of the area now and how it must have been in the past. I shall never again look at the beautiful lakes of the region in quite the same way. PEBlais - Author Resurrecting Paul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rash knows his stuff","review":"It took me a while to get hold of this offering from Ron Rash. But the search was worth the effort. He has a style that is unlike any other - hard and spare, but always entertaining.The plot is simple - a missing person, presumed murdered, in the early 1950's environment of the Carolinas. Through the eyes of five different narrators we find out the truth - all beautifully compacted into less than 200 pages.Highly recommened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ron Rash Doesn't Disappoint","review":"When I finished reading Ron Rash's newest book, I wanted more of his writing. Surprisingly, I bought ONE FOOT IN EDEN in November, but didn't get around to reading it until this weekend. Rash took me on a familiar journey through the South Carolina mountains near Brevard, not far from my North Carolina experiences. His characterization makes his characters come alive. I found myself slipping into the speech patterns of the people I met in the communities where I lived, studied, and worked. As a therapist, I was privileged to experience how my clients thought. Rash took this reader on an experiential journey through each character's head. The ending was inevitable. I have now read most of Ron Rash's works. He has never disappointed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent first effort","review":"Ron Rash is one of SOUTH CAROLINA's finest poets and has now proven that he is one of its finest young novelists as well. This first effort brings to gripping life the South Carolina upcountry of the post-WWII years. His descriptions of the once pristine Jocassee Valley and now-lost parts of Oconee County are are as tangible and poetic as Conroy at the top of his game. You will become entangled in the dramatic lives of his simple, mountain folk who are at the crossroads of a world that is changing much too fast.While I love his verse, I can't wait for Rash's next prose effort. If this novel is a harbinger, we have a great new novelist in our midst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely captivating!!!","review":"I love this book, Ron Rash captures an element of storytelling few can accomplish.

Most POE switches don't deliver that kind of power. These things do. But they don't come with power supplies. Somewhere in the fine print it says to use the power supply that shipped with your Aironet device, but because the Aironets are designed to work with POE they don't come with power supplies; you have to order that as an extra.This thing is almost more trouble than it's worth, because you have to find the right power supply and order it, too.

It's the story of Raspberry, a young girl who is going through much adversity that involves her family and friends. I think Raspberry is a character that kids or grownups can understand. She is emotional - mad, happy, afraid, shy, indignant, jealous, and everything in between. She's not perfect, she's real and that's a wonderful attribute to find in fiction. If you enjoy reading about young people and want to understand how they think and where they are coming from in terms of friendships, family, loyalty, and justice, you might enjoy reading Begging for Change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference guide","review":"I purchased this book after seeing an interview with the author on Good Morning America last week. I have reason to suspect that my dad may be nearing the end of his driving career. After reading the Driving Dilemma, I feel much better about broaching this very delicate subject with my Dad. Dr. Dugan offers a very practical and conscientious way of evaluating driving skills. The premise of involving an older driver in the evaluation, discussion and decision making process is made easy with this reference guide.If you're facing this challenge with a loved one, or know of someone who is - then reading this book will make an anxiety ridden process so much easier.

It was a game from the early 70s which reminded me of Hangman, Wheel of Fortune, and lots of other games. However, there's something about this old-fashioned, non-electronic format that pleases to the brain and the touch. It's a family game that any literate person of any age can enjoy. The fact that it was discontinued at some point makes it even more special.It is easy to learn, compact, and durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinker's Game","review":"Someone needs to redistribute this game, as there can't be that many copies left out there from the 60's; and it's really good.

I finally had clear skin after using an antibiotic, but it started coming back really bad. I was reluctant to use the Dead Sea Mask, due to the oils, yet my skin is 98% percent clear and I have been using the mask for 3 days. My acne scars have faded and my skin looks really healthy and has a nice glow. Even though I am eighteen, I was worried about all the anti-acne products and how they were going to affect my skin 15 years from now. Using this mask, I am confident my skin will look great years from now and I have clear skin as a teenager.By the way...I rinse my skin after using the mask, just a little bit, I just like to leave a little bit of the oil residue on my skin and I think it is better to do so if you have acne prone skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Mask","review":"This product definitely lives up to it's sales pitch. I invested, hesitantly hoping that it wasn't a wasted $50. However, from past knowledge of Ahava, felt it was worth trying. It feels so good going on, it pampers your face. It doesn't freeze your face. And it's fun to see the magnet at work. The mud definitely comes right off. And your faces feels revitalized and fresh for days afterwards.

Stories are transparent, deep and at times funny. My favorite one is \\"May we borrow your husband?\\". Here the author skillfully describes a grotesque situation in wich an homosexual couple attemps by all means to have an encounter with the flamboyant husband of a just married couple. He starts telling the story as a distant witness and as time goes by he gets unwillingly involved in the whole mise en scene.

I'm not a big fan of all pink products for girls, so I purchased this item also based on the variety of colors; and because we're a big fan of Sesame Street.

It begins by establishing the problem and explaining some history and goes on to focus on opportunities to improve our economy for all Americans and shrink the economic divide.

Now he is 8 months old and he enjoys it even more. It is a little bit bulky and heavy but my son can hold it ok. It's also been dropped and banged many many times with no damage so far.

It turns out that the heroic crew took measures to \\"hold the water back\\" and special pumps were rigged to clean their remaining oxygen. Once aboard, the salvagers discover a quasi-utopian society run by Captain Christopher Lee - but his dicatatorship has more than a few dark secrets.Engrossing undersea adventure stretches credibility paper-thin but certainly scores points for originality.

I drink more than that so I put another similar water bottle in the other side. I carry all of the a fore mentioned as well as an iPod. It has different pockets to hold the items separately. I am biking as well and I recently started using it for that. It has an adjustable strap that would fit a wide girth. I'm not sure of the product size details, ... see product description for that, but it is sturdy and easy to adjust. I would highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Journey I've ever embarked on!","review":"Well, being from England and only sixteen it is an acievement for me to just know who Journey are, never mind think they are one of the greatest bands of all time. This album brings together song writing skills and brilliant insrumentation to make a truly classic album. Steve Perry has the most incredible voice I have ever heard and I think I am ever likely to hear. It has a sweet, melodious yet slighty Rock husk to it which in my opinion makes a magnificent partnership with the bands song writing skills, and makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up! With songs such as \\"Faithfully\\", \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" and \\"Who's Crying Now\\" on it's track listing how could this album be anything more than AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have been listening to Journey's Greatest Hits in my car for a couple of weeks now and I just love every song.

This CD showcases their best music and how talented a group this Journey Band truly was....HOWEVER keep in mind..ONLY BUY the Journey CDs with Steve Perry. After all, HE is the reason for their success!! Tragically..the rest of the band decided to throw him under the bus and found a poor imitation of Mr.Perry to take his place.What this band has transformed into is nothing more than a \\"cover band\\" with a poor imitator trying pathetically to act and sound like Steve Perry.Save yourself the expense..ONLY PURCHASE THOSE JOURNEY CDs with Steve Perry(as the lead singer). There is such a VAST DIFFERENCE and while they have managed to find a poor substitute to take the lead's place...he DOES NOT possess the vocal range and overall talent that ONLY belongs to Steve Perry!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"JOURNEY ROCKS!","review":"I love Journey! Everyone of their songs is fantastic, and Steve Perry's voice is simply Out Of This World! There will never be another rock and roll band like Journey. They wrote all of their music and Steve Perry's voice is phenomenal. Every song is different than the last one. Groups today will never achieve what this super group has achieved. Talent like the guys in Journey have is long gone. You'll never see it again. THEY ARE AMAZING!!! JOURNEY ROCKS!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Album To Soak Your Tears On.....","review":"just make sure you don't electricute yourself in the process. Most overated garbage to play to your love one, or even get laid to. This album collects a lot of dust on the shelf in my home. Oh I must remind you, also a good album to get dumped with. Sorry folks, but this group up to this point got too much airplay, which made them a commercial hell for the rest of the years Steve Perry was in the picture.

But later in the year i got into alt rock and indie and got bored with stuff like this and the other stuff they play on classic rock radio to death. Who cares if perry has a a good voice so does josh gorban but when you songs suck and have no orginality who cares i acutally pefer someone like tom waites who has a crappy voice simply because he is a great songwriter and he experiments something this band never did.By the way i still like open arms when it comes on the radio i plug in my headphones and listen and feel ashamed to even listen to it"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Journey Through Hell","review":"You know what surprises me?

WHY?! Everybody in the world already has this album (you might as well admit it). You'd have a good argument that it's for the bonus track \\"When You Love a Woman,\\" but if you don't have the Trial By Fire album, you can't call yourself a Journey fan anyway. There is also more of a selection of hits on The Essential Journey 2 CD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Commercial music to make money not art!","review":"What can you say about a band that has to make a greatest hits album with filler music. They could not even write enough decent songs to make a greatist hits CD!

Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Introduction to Journey","review":"To me, bands and artists release greatest hits albums for one reason. That reason is to get people who aren't too familiar with the artist to get them to know their songs, their style, and their genre. With Journey's Greatest Hits, its the perfect album for that reason. With pretty much all their well known songs such as \\"Any Way You Want It\\", \\"Wheel in the Sky\\", and \\"Don't Stop Believin'\\" along with their other hits such as \\"Open Arms\\", \\"Separate Ways\\", and \\"Who's Crying Now\\". The reissue has the Trial By Fire hit \\"When You Love A Woman\\" and remastered, not as good as their other reissues. Overall, I'd recommend it for people who don't know what Journey is all about and to the mega collector. It's a nice collection, has all the hits to get people into the band, and it's a cheap and easy album to find, yet if you're yearning for more Journey, there's Time3 that has 55 songs and The Essential Journey with 32 or 40 songs. Overall it's great album for everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of solid 1980s hits and memories","review":"I snapped up an MP3 version of this album when I saw in on sale a little while ago. I have, in the meantime, listened to selected tracks several times. I have to admit that I was not a big Journey fan back in the late 1970s and 1980s, but in the intervening years I have come to enjoy their sound more, and they have several tracks with lots of staying power that see regular air time on oldies stations...E.g.: Don't Stop Believing, Faithfully, Any Way You Want It, Who's Crying Now, Lights, Lovin'..., Open Arms...etc.If you are a casual Journey fan like me, then this is the album to get...of course, hard core Journey fans will already have these tunes on earlier albums.The sound is classic oldies (man that sounds weird, since these songs were popular when I was in college), but it's true.I really like this collection! 4 solid stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"on top of the world with Journey!","review":"if you truely love great music and you want to be rocked but not overloaded then you must hear this cd. this cd is full of the music that you want to hear when it's just you and yourself thinking about that old flame or when you are with that old flame. Journey rocks the air waves. they always have and they always will. Rock on with Journey. this cd doesn't compare to any other. this is the best one around and like i said, if you truely love great music then you'll love listening to this cd and remembering how you were feeling the first time you heard \\"Faithfully\\". you can't go wrong with these sounds rocking you down the highway while you are \\"falling stone in love\\" with this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic 80's Band","review":"For someone who grew up in the 80's, every song here is a trip down memory lane. Greatest Hits contains the core of thier relevant catalog, and is a great introduction to the band. Journey tugs on the heart strings (Open Arms, Send Her My Love) and makes you want to get up and party (Any Way You Want It) and virtually every tune on this CD is a pop music gem. They don't write 'em like this anymore!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a Journey Fan","review":"This is truly a must for any Journey fan.

But getting this CD has created a new generation of Journey lovers, my 10 and 12 year old daughters! They demand I play the Journey CD in the car and jam out to \\"Any Way You Want\\". Not to mention, the bonus track of \\"When You Love a Woman\\" prompted us to buy the sheet music so we can play and sing it on the piano. This is an amazing collection of Journey at its best.

To refresh my memory, I looked over the track listing of this album. It crystallized for me my problem with Journey -- they did nothing original, and they never improved upon the sounds that they imitated.At best, this collection is simply representative of an era of mindless, disposable rock. At worst, it is schlock that never should have been commemorated, since Muzak versions will forever be heard in elevators for the next couple of decades.Before anyone goes sending hate e-mail my way, try tuning in some public radio to hear what \\"good music\\" really is. Or maybe you should get out your Jimi Hendrix, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Who, Doors and U2 to hear how good Journey's stuff could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD","review":"I recieved an empty CD case .And Marc down ent. would not even acknowledge that I had contactated them twice.

Anytime I hear \\"don't stop believin'\\" all I can think of is a bunch of drunk frat boy yuppies and their girlfriends in their big belts and sack dresses, yelling and screaming tone deaf lyrics in a drunken crowded stupor.

However, as one other put it, they were enscribed into my memory during these times and have now become a cherished part of my memories. It seemed that no matter where you were, there was a Journey song playing on the radio at some point. I have fully come to appreciate their contribution to our culture and salute their music for standing the test of time and lived on to become timeless classics. Their songs still live on today at teen parties when it comes time to slow dance. This generation is starved for smoothing music in the mind jarring rap laced musical culture they exist in today.

I've found better sound from \\"The Essential Journey\\" cd than from this Greatest hits SACD.I think there's an improvement from the original cd, but it looks like they did a lazy transfer to SACD and so, unlike \\"The Essential\\", the sound is not polished.I own many stereo SACD (Sychronicity-The Police, What's going on-Marvin Gaye, The best-Roxy Music, In search of the lost chord-Moody Blues) and I think all of them represent a justification for SACD upgrading.

It's one of the best pressings you'll find, with low surface noise, thick 180g weight, and minimal pops and clicks. There's just one problem......The engineering is poor. It states that it is mastered for vinyl; yet, the amount of sibilance is unbearable the further inward the needle tracks. For a medium that is supposed to provide a better listening experience, this was so bad that I decided to return the album. I've heard many other albums that weren't even mastered for vinyl that sounded better (and had little, if any, sibilance issues).My advice?

Usually it takes 3 good songs on a CD to make me want to buy an album. This album has far more than just 3 good songs. ALL of them are great. The lyrics are not revolutionary, but they are straightforward, dealing with the ups and downs of relationships. Steven Perry is a great vocalist. The songs may be old, but they still sound as fresh as they did when they came out. \\"Faithfully\\",\\"Separate Ways\\", and \\"Who's Crying Now\\" are my favorites, but as I said all songs are great and very powerful.

And if even the lamest band in the world can have one decent song for which they are fondly remembered, what's so bad about that? Spare me the rants about how this music presaged the downfall of Western society: Madonna, Britney Spears and Axl Rose managed to do THAT far more effectively.The worst you can say about this group and their \\"hits\\" is that it's all pretty generic, but even a generic band can have a home run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awfully Lame","review":"There are no doubts about it. This band is one of the lamest on the planet. A few good songs keep this album alive, but most of them are just 100% garbage. Steve Perry's voice is horribly annoying, with his dumb \\"oh-oooh-ooh-oh\\" sound that makes you want to puke. The backing vocals are silly and overrated.

His voice is one with the angels --- full of passion and feeling, with a range that undisputably puts him in the top of the stratosphere with legends like Freddie Mercury and Don Henley. I'd say this is the one cd to purchase if you have lived under a rock and never heard this band before. Don't fool yourself into thinking the \\"new\\" Steve is just as good...when S.Perry left the band (not by choice but by foolish choice on the part of Neal Schoen) the band lost its luster.

These four also happen to be my favorite songs by Journey.There are also lyrics inside, which is much appreciated, since, on some of the \\"greatest hits\\" CDs I own, they don't include the lyrics but should.

I will be getting my money back and will try crate training her instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work for All Cats","review":"I have a male that was acting out not using his litter pan, I purchased this product hoping it would do the trick. Unfortunately it didn't work. I am sure it does for some cats, but not for all. I suggest buying the smallest bag first to make sure as it is expensive. It is a nice litter and clumps well, so I gave it 2 stars for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miracle Litter","review":"My cat decided after years of using Feline Pine that he didn't like it anymore.I tried EVERY brand and he wouldn't use the litter.Then, the guy at the pet store asked me if I'd seen this Cat Attract litter.It was probably the last litter I hadn't tried yet.My cats love it! When I change the litter, they go in it just to dig and sometimes don't even go potty. They just are attracted to it.It's miracle litter!Remember though that when a cat who is usually a well mannered box user all of a sudden changes his habits, it can be a sign that something is medically wrong with them. That's how they tell you that something is wrong by acting out of the ordinary. I had a cat start doing that years ago and he had a urinary blockage. Now, I know to watch for any signs of strange behavior (especially in the male cats since they seem to get the blockage more often than the females do)."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works but it's not the best","review":"I bought this because when we moved into a new apartment, my cat suddenly decided to stop using her litter box and go wherever she wanted. It worked, she began using it after I set it out. The litter works like any clay clumping litter. It is very expensive, tracks a lot because it's fine grained, and I don't really prefer it because it's made from clay. After using this for a few months, we got settled into the apartment and I put out her old litter (Feline Pine Original Cat Litter, 20-Pound Bag). She went back to using it and now that's what we use again. I guess she must have just been confused because she was in a new environment. Although I don't prefer this litter, I know how frustrating it can be when a cat goes all over the carpet and whatever else. This can be a lifesaver in those situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money for a bad product","review":"We tried this litter based upon recommendation. Our cat sometimes goes outside the box and this was advertised to correct the problem. It did not. Additionally, we did not like the substance as it was difficult to clean. When it gets wet, it clumps into a solid mass that stuck to the litter box and was difficult to remove. I even broke the scooper trying to remove a clump. This litter is also very expensive, compared to plain clay. Save your money to spend on something more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't I give it zero stars instead of one star???","review":"Nasty stuff for the humans (sticky gooey mess at the point where clumps form against the sides of the box), and doesn't attract my cats in any way. One cat ALWAYS uses his litter, so he continues using this too, but the odd thing was that he ALWAYS just cannot WAIT to make his mark in every freshly changed litter box and yet he was COMPLETELY UNINTERESTED in marking this new litter, until later that night when it was time for him to \\"go\\". The PROBLEM cat, on the other hand, didn't use this litter ANY more than he'd been using the old litter. Makes ya wonder whether the glowing reviews come from the company's stockholders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware--Once you \\"Attract\\" You Can't Go Back","review":"This product definitely works...in fact, it works so well that my cat seems to refuse to use any other brand now. This is not necessarily very good news, as it is VERY expensive! The 20 pound bag only seems good for about 2 uses--and its $20 per bag...that's $40 per month for one small siamese cat. The litter gets used up FAST because it really seems to \\"extreme clump\\"....meaning, my cat pees once and it clumps so much that when I scoop it out, half the litter is gone. I'm now trying out new things and I'll let you know how they work out. The other complaint I have is that it seems messier than other litters I've tried...lots of little white grains all over our kitchen floor...and this is with a large and deep cat pan. :-(Nov. 8, 2008: Well, we tried some other brands and she basically told us what she thought by leaving gifts on the floor. So it's back to champagne days and caviar catbox nights..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fricking Fantastic!","review":"Earlier in the year we took in a half-grown dumped kitten. Since we've had him his litter box usage had been haphazard and progressively getting worse. It went from peeing on the linoleum in front of the kitchen door to peeing in whatever he felt like. Eventually he started pooping in front of the foyer door and in the bath tub.After vet visits, odor neutralizers, tin foil, adding extra litter boxes, adding extra large litter boxes, and small room isolation we were at our wits end.Finally, our insane neighbor lady told us about this cat litter and after one of her long diatribes about how fantastic the litter is and how Jesus is a space alien, we decided to try it.Within two days the problem beast was regularly using the box and no longer avoiding. This stuff works like a charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cats won't touch it","review":"I have 2 2 yo males neutered cats who have never used the litter box consistently for pooping. I have tried nearly every type of litter, litter box, self-cleaning or basic plastic box, lid, no lid, etc. Desperate, I bought this product with great hopes--along with two more litter boxes and a box of Arm and Hammer clumping litter.They now have 4 boxes with 3 different litters. Yet the only litter they have *never* used for relieving themselves is \\"Cat Attract.\\" Yes, they have been inside the box, evidenced by the litter being moved around. But they have never done their business there and continue to poop on the floor next to it. In fact, they will occasionally use the new Arm & Hammer litter, similar in texture to Cat Attract, but not the product in question.Like the other reviewer indicated, it is nice litter otherwise, so I gave it 2 stars. But don't assume this litter will be your cure-all for behavioral problems. HTH a little. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best ever","review":"This pudding tastes a little funky. It sports kind of a metallic, sort of bitter aftertaste, and I can't quite identify the main flavor, but in my humble estimation, it ain't chocolate. I've had Medifast pudding, which is equally low-calorie & high-protein, and was expecting something more along those lines...something that tastes more like, um, pudding. I wish I'd found a single can of the stuff somewhere before committing to a whole case of the stuff. Convenient? Yep. Great for my diet? Absolutely. Palatable?

Without Mike & Gloria, but most importantly, without Edith, Archie just wasn't that entertaining. Carroll O'Connor's performance as Archie in this series is completely different than in AITF. He seems tired and spends much of his time mumbling his lines. This series also suffers because it is not taped before a live audience and the pacing is slower and off.

Winnipeg Manitoba was wondering about the picture of Beverly LaSalle on the back cover. You're right, the character of Beverly LaSalle died on All in the Family.

Why?In just the first 2-hours of scanning subjects, I highlighted dozens of gems of advice or insights from the Thompson's long experience that I have NOT seen in any of the other books.

You may think you don't have the time, inclination, or interest to upgrade or repair your PC. This book shows in clearly written prose and with excellent illustrations that computers are quite simple to repair, and with a little maintenance, will last for a very long time. The book covers many topics, such as repair or upgrade, when it's reasonable to buy a new PC, and a topic that most of us forget, how to maintain our data integrity.The Thompsons also maintain a web page where you can ask computer related questions. They also quickly answer those questions, usualy within 24 hours.It's difficult to think of items or issues that they've left out.

The illustrations are so gorgeous and the colors are breathtaking! This alone makes this book worthwhile to pick up!The story, too, is quite enchanting. It starts off like the typical \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" - but instead of a rose, it's a lark that \\"Beauty/The Lady\\" desires, and the beast is actually a lion. The specifics of the enchantment vary, as does the second half of the book (complete with a fight between a lion and a dragon, a seven year trek, talking wind, and a griffin!).A nice book to show the lengths someone will go to in order to help a loved one. And again, it's worth looking at if just for the the illustrations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another outstanding book illustrated by Laurel Long!","review":"I am discovering that everything this lady illustrates is of the highest quality. I now have two of her books and will look for more. The intricacy and richness of the illustrations make each page a visual feast! Her fabrics are like the richest tapestries and the borders of each page are complex floral middle eastern style beauties as well. I can't speak highly enough about her illustrations, they need to be looked at again and again. The story line is a combination of different fairy tales and ends as it ought: with evil brought to justice! (This is the only illustration that is a bit inconsistent with the gory end to the wicked sorceress as it looks too posed and beautiful.) All in all though, a great tale and great pictures. Very highly recommended to collectors of fine fairy tales and folklore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Old Tales Must Be PC Now Also?","review":"To the person who wrote a rant about the illustrations being beautiful, but why is everyone white despite the setting. The reason is the tale is told by a white author; therefore, that author can do what he/she desires. And if the audience is mostly white, then they will want characters they can relate to and identify with. Not everything has to be politically correct. Must we make all old tales PC now too?! I don't see why every tale has to be curtailed to reflect political correctness. In fact, it wasn't that way when I was a child, and I don't want it to be that way for my child either. Go live in a country where you are the minority. We don't have to cator to minorities. There is no law stating this, and not many people like it even if they are afraid of saying so for fear of being slandered."},{"rating":"2","title":"lady and the lion- pleasent ridge","review":"The Lady and the Lion was a great book full of adventure and colors.

When reading this book, you feel like you are in the story. It is a story that is a mixture of Cinderella and The Beauty and The Beast. I would recommend this book for ages 7 and up, because you have to be old enough to read the words, even though you can look at the pictures and see the story. This book should have won the Caldecott Medal instead of The Man Who Walked Between The Towers. This is a good book to read alone so that you can see the pictures clearly.

What was Cain thinking?!?","review":"'Career in C Major' is a surprisingly weak short novel by James Cain. While it is not poorly written, the book's entire premise is utterly absurd. We have a middle class, middle-aged man in 1930s New York City married to a posh, semi-neurotic wench. The wife believes she has sacrificed a promising career in opera to get married and have children, and now wants to return to opera. Okay, so far so good. But then it turns out that the husband, without any singing background whatsoever, is a naturally gifted and reluctant Caruso who upstages his (very envious) wife! I am surprised such nonsense was dished out by the normally wonderful Cain. No doubt such rubbish was published only because of his reputation.Bottom line: dreadful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hobbit in Hokkaido","review":"The main part, Savage's own retelling of his journey around Hokkaido, is a fantastic read. At times terrifying, often hilarious. Riding a pony through the cold wastelands, Savage strongly resembles a hobbit, combining a Victorian tenacity with reckless curiosity.The second part is a harder read, a wade through prejudices of the era and misguided anthropological theories of a man who is by no means a scholar. Still, the illustrations are very valuable, and it remains a good source of early Ainu knowledge, once you learn how to distinguish between Savage's opinion and fact."},{"rating":"2","title":"cancelled the trip, but great book","review":"I used this book (and others) to plan a fabulous flyfishing, camping vacation.

A totally pointless release from an otherwise great band.I think Spoke, their first CD is their best CD, followed by the brilliant Black Light, their second CD. Hot Rail, their third CD, has some really good moments, but has a lot of throw away stuff as well. I also liked them better live as a duo then what they are doing now with a full band. So I guess what I am saying is that their earliest stuff is their best, and it progressively gets, not worse, but lets just say less interesting/more predictable. I haven't by any means given up on them and am keeping my fingers crossed for their new CD, already recorded, that is supposed to come out in the spring of 2003. Also, the stuff that they did on Neko Case's, Black Listed, is amongst the best stuff they've ever done, along with their contributions to Giant Sand's, Chore Of Enchantment. Calexico's vinyl only, Descamino-The Black Light Remixes, is also worth checking out if you can find it. It's brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicate Sound of Pink Floyd","review":"When I review live albums, I always judge the sound quality and the sound quality on this effort by Pink Floyd is suberb. The sound production is almost as good as Pat Metheny's live albums. Incredible! \\"One of These Days\\" on disk two is worth listening to twice before continuing on through both disks. I really like the production of the Dark Side of the Moon tracks. A very fine two disk set. David Gilmour's singing is excellent and his guitar techniques are unique in rock music.

A great set list only to be marred by lazy Gilmour vocals and terrible Scott Page sax. You can actually hear Gilmour just saying the lyrics to Us and Them. Gilmour takes control of Floyd and does exactly what Roger said they would do \\"Milk the name for all it is worth.\\". I can not say much more about the video either. It is clear that Gilomour's heart is no longer into it. The really sad part is the choice of songs for this tour. They are great songs but with a lackluster performance it is heartbreaking to hear them. Gilmour has gotten so lazy not only does he not want to sing he also turns some of the lead over to Tim Renwick. So, I give this album 2 stars and that is because of Gilmour's lead on Comfortably Numb and a great choice of songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicate sound of blunder","review":"The plodding, empty performances on this CD serve one purpose and one purpose only: to make more money for David Gimour and company.Don't believe the positive reviews here, because it's not about Gilmour vs. Roger Waters.

All of their albums are really one giant song, and to take away the most popular segments of the album and put them together in a seemingly random order is just awful. \\"Us and Them\\" doesnt sound nearly as smooth and powerful when it doesnt follow \\"Money\\". The songs are fantastic, dont get me wrong, and for a newcomer to Floyd this might be a decent way to see if you like their stuff.

If Gilmour wants to play music, he can play his own music, but he shouldn't play Waters' music, because he pales in comparison. He has a pathetic voice that sounds perpetually out of breath. I sound more like Roger Waters than David Gilmour does. Don't buy this, just buy The Wall, Dark Side of the Moon, and Wish You Were Here.

I think any album or compilation has to be taken in isolation and in this, DST stands out as an extremely well composed and engineered album. What I like about this album is its brooding and almost smoky feel, particularly when you listen to it on cloudy, rainy days, when you are just a bit blue and when you dont want something heavy going on in the background. Pick this album, put it in your CD changer and let it loop, and watch the music grow on you. The soothing bass and the mellow guitating gets you going. Get your rare scotch out and pour yourself a couple and let the heady combination take you to stratosphere!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putrid? Foundering? Not bad? Tiny Tim or Pink Floyd?","review":"I read what's posted and have to ask what they were listening to. Obviously not what I hear in DSoT. This is my favorite. Pulse is better on visuals, if you get the video, but falls woefully short on both sound quality and richness. On DS of T, Gilmour cuts some guitar riffs which makes you feel deprived when you hear the original CD cuts on the radio, and the saxaphone wails here, where whoever they used on Pulse is only \\"there\\" and toking on Prozak. Pulse has one cut that I really value -- \\"Terminal Frost,\\" a rich, vibrant, and pulsating instrumental. But for the best of Pink Floyd, for an incredibly rich, powerful, masterful performance, you can't do better than DS of T. Even better, the video is as good as the CD, plus you get some ladies who wail on Great Gig in the Sky, who also look great doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING PINK FLOYD","review":"The album and video are fantastic.

Recorded toward the end of several years of touring, the performances are average and David Gilmour's voice is tired and weak. There were several recordings from earlier in the tour (For a possible live album/video) that simply blow away these recordings away. They appeared on CD-singles, but for whatever reason, they failed to make the live album. To top it off, the mixing is terrible ... Seems like a \\"rushed\\" product overall. There are much better live recordings of the Floyd out there, I would suggest looking for those ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best live album from Pink Floyd","review":"The guitar solo on 'Comfortably Numb' does not come any better.

DO NOT BUT THIS PIECE OF GARBAGE!Let me tell you a story. A while back I saw \\"THE WALL\\". I then bought the CD. I fell in love. I decided to go out on a limb and by another Pink Floyd CD the next day. I had unwittingly picked up this filthy CD called \\"The Delicate Sound of Thunder\\". Well needless to say, I came dangerously close to giving up on Floyd all together, but luckily I had lost the reciept. When I went to take it back I could only exchange it. I got \\"Animals\\" instead.I thank Christ every day for losing that reciept. In conclusion, I'd like to ask... ROGER WATERS, WHEN ARE YOU COMMING BACK??? Save us from a world filled with only Gilmours ridiculous voice! He butchers all of your songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is The Great Gig in the Sky?","review":"The Great Gig song is in the concert VHS tape version but it is left out of this cd. Why? To watch the VHS version of this cd- The Great Gig in the Sky is a very powerful, emotionally moving experience and in my opinion the best part of this whole concert. It was left out of the cd and I resent that. I've always been Floyd through and though but I regret buying this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bargain Bin Rock","review":"This album reminds me of those cheap \\"Chubby Checker Live\\" albums released on no name labels. It is a poorly recorded performance of a band that bring new meaning to the old Memorex slogan \\"Is it Live or Is it Memorex?\\" The songs plod along. As for the accompaning video, it has the same affect as someone telling you a story they find vastly amusing only to see your reaction and say, \\"you had to be there.\\" The video only makes you realize the real stars of a floyd show are the stuff going on around the band. No amount of flying inflatables can distract from the lifeless note for note performances of Floyd.Horrible. Just buy the studio recordings. Two live albums and two mediocre studio albums. Can't Gilmour just survive on royalties?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Not Good","review":"I have a lot of Pink Floyd, and I know a lot of Pink Floyd. Although this CD appears to have a great lineup of songs, don't be fooled! They sound nothing like the studio versions, and the noise of the crowd is very distracting. Furthermore, half of the songs are from A Momentary Lapse of Reason, a very forgettable and banal (boring) album. Let's face it-- Roger Waters was a bit controlling and vitriolistic, but without him Pink Floyd can't make a really good album. Spend your money on something made before 1980."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeliavable!!","review":"Does every Pink Floyd fan has an extra-sensorial audition, that makes them believe that every PF album is the absolute masterpiece of music? I think so, and I thin maybe I'm missing someting here.

He got screwed over by the band. Without him they wouldn't have had the sucsess they had and now I can tell the diffrence. Rodger compleated Floyd. I swear it must be a Giant kick in the royal bum. It is to have to listen to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delicate Sound of Plunder","review":"I don't want to take anything away from Gilmour, Wright, and Mason. I think they are fine musicians. But, the truth is that Roger Waters was the core creative force (conceptualist, lyricist) of the band. With Waters gone it is not the same band. To me it is unethical to make a career based on the public's past perception. Sure, they contributed to the music. But they are not just playing the music. The older material relies heavily on lyrical content and even their current stage show, inflatable pig, circular screen, etc. was conceived by Waters early on. I'm sorry, but to use Pink Floyd as a product name to sell records and tickets is WRONG and you, the consumer, should be offended. I would feel the same way if Roger Waters called his new band \\"Pink Floyd\\". They were a great team. Apart from each other they are not Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dark Side of Unemployment","review":"Pink Floyd has suffered one of the most ignoble declines of any classic rock band. Without Roger Watters in the fold, there is simply no point (other than making money). That is brought home in spades on this lifeless, turgid concert album documenting their 1987 \\"comeback\\" tour. The new songs don't measure up to the classics and the classics were much better the first time around. A sorry fate for a once-great band."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD PRODUCT","review":"GOOD ITEM'BUT COULD NOT WORK IT WITH MY WINDOW VISTA;I WANTED IT TOO!AND THE PRICE WAS CHEAP TOO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New to NH","review":"My mother just moved to New Hampshire, so this was book is/was great! after living in ct most of her life she has a whole new state to explore..and this book really found alot of great places to discover!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"I loved this book...the characters are colourful and interesting, and it transpports you to another place and time.

I had forgotten the power and emotion that made me fall in love with this lady's talent 25 years ago. It's still there, and better than it ever was. The bonus track video and remix of Con Te Partiro are HOT! and I would challenge any other concert DVD to stand up to this masterpiece.

The machine grabs two piece of paper at once no matter how careful I am, so I often have to fax items more than once. 2) When you dial and get a busy signal, the machine redials. There is no way to cancel the FAX in between its redialing. You have to catch it during the redial. If you have the wrong number, heaven help the person at the other end of the line.

This book reinforces the philosophy that willpower is not enough to overcome addiction (standard AA higher power and surrender philosophy). However, that is simply not true. There is amble evidence to the contrary and other books make this clear (see 7 Tools to Beat Addiction). Most of this book is standard AA philosophy and offers nothing new to someone seeking to overcome an addiction. It is fair to say that this book is well written and is less preachy than others; and it may be just what some people need. If willpower gets you to an AA meeting, then maybe willpower can do more.

One of my favorites off Twilight to Starlight is We Only Come Out at Night. Everyone else seems to dismiss it, but it's special to me. The instrumentation on it almost has a carnival-like feel, and reminds me of the Beatles. Where Boys Fear to Tread and Bodies are my fave rockers off the disc, and obviously, 1979 is a keeper too. Mellon Collie is one 90's album that is rightfully derserves the praise it gets. I wouldn't say it's shame that it's not as phenominally-popular as some of the other 90's albums released, but that makes Mellon Collie even more special. It's nice to know you can treasure something without having every person on the planet listening to the same thing you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two discs of pure bliss","review":"I bought \\"Melon Collie And The Infinite Sadness\\" the day it came out in 1995 and I remember thinking this was the album of my life. Of course in the next 6 years I found many other albums I felt the same about, but this one is defiently at the top of my list. Billy Corgan's sad and depressing vocals immerse you in both discs, which are cleverly titled \\"Dawn to dusk\\" (Disc 1) and \\"Twilight to starlight\\" (Disc 2). Very rarely does an album come along like this that has every song being different from the next, plus it is a double disc which makes it a real gem. My personal favorite songs include \\"Mellon collie and the infinite sadness\\", \\"Tonight, tonight\\", \\"Bullet with butterfly wings\\", \\"Thirty three\\", \\"In the arms of sleep\\", \\"1979\\", \\"Tales of a scortched earth\\", \\"By starlight\\", this album is absolute genius from the mid 1990's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pumpkins at their best","review":"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is the essential Smashing Pumpkin's album. Billy Corgan's musical genius is evident throughout this work. It is unforgettably the last strong album of the Smashing Pumpkins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellon Collie album by Smashing Pumpkins","review":"This is one of my very favorite Smashing Pumpkins albums. It has many great songs and it a pleasure for me to listen to no matter what or when. I would recommend this album to any music lover or Smashing Pumkkin fan!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nobodys Felt Like You","review":"While all of Smashing Pumpkin's albums are good, none of them can even hold a flame to this great work. In my opinion this ties with Pearl Jam's \\"Ten\\" for the best rock album of the 90s spot. \\"Bodies\\" is a great song, the hardest tune on the CD, and it's followed by the great \\"33\\", the softest tune on the album. It takes a special magic to pull that one off the stunning way in which they did, but those are just two of the many gems on this album. The Smashing Pumpkins are known as a hard rock band and definetely due in no small part to some of the songs on this album, but that isn't the end-all be-all to this group. So be sure to give it a listen from beginning to end, it's mainly filled with beautiful soft gems, and if that's what you treasure then prepare for an enchanted evening."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best concept album ever made...Billy Corgan is genius!!","review":"This album successfully captures the pain and emotion depicted on the cover; the title itself signifies what you are going to listen to. Angst-ridden tunes like \\"Bullet with..\\" and \\"Where Boys Fear to Tread\\" contrast extraordinary ballads like \\"In the Arms of Sleep\\" and \\"Porcelina of the Vast Oceans\\" conveying a worldly theme to this album. If you like this beautiful, powerful album, you must definitely pick up \\"The Aeroplane Flies High\\" by this same band. Simply, if you like bubblegum music like, dare I say, the backstreet boys or hanson, \\"Mellon Collie\\" is not for you. Billy Corgan talks not only to you, but to your soul. Through this album, Billy Corgan connects with people like the great Michael Stipe did in \\"Automatic for the People\\" with songs like \\"Everybody Hurts\\" and \\"Try not to Breathe\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Out","review":"After I got this CD, I liked 5 songs (Tonight,Tonight, Zero, Bullet w/Butterfly Wings, 1979, and Thru the Eyes of a Ruby) and I was pretty dissapointed. After a couple months, I really got into it (especially Bodies). 5 stars*"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erm...","review":"To clear any confusion that one may feel when listening to clips of songs they've heard before on this page, such as myself, the clips are switched. What you hear on the first disc really should be the same number on the opposite disc, and vice versa. (I.e., If you were to click on Bullet with Butterfly wings, you wouldn't hear that song. It'd be the OTHER number six song.) If you figured that out already, then nevermind. This is just for people who CAN but DON'T think on a regular basis, like me. Oh, and, uh, Smashing Pumpkins rock... Sure...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious","review":"The Smashing Pumpkins are quite possibly the most pretentious band of the 90's. With their odd artwork and peculiar song titles they often pretend to be something other than a rock band. Guess what? They're just a rock band! As annoying as I find Billy Corgan's voice, I thought Siamese Dream was a dreamy and beautiful record. So where does it all fall apart in MCIS? Around the middle of disc 1, and it's just as dreary on disc 2. There are some hidden gems, such as 'thirty-three' and '1979', but 'tales of a scorched earth' is absolute dreck. Sounds like Billy is screaming loud about nothing. However, this is an album loaded with memorable songs, some of the best the Pumpkins have ever done. If this had been a single album, with say, eleven or twelve songs, it would have eclipsed the genius of Siamese Dream. As it is, MCIS is a two hour epic journey through numbing noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Album","review":"I love the Smashing Pumpkins and it's great to have this album on my computer now. The only issue I had with the purchase is that the album was automatically labeled \\"pop\\" which I feel is absurdly incorrect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album Ever","review":"As you have probably heard about a million over the yrs, this album is amazing. I'm not going to go on and explain how utterly unbelievable it is, for you all have heard it before. What I will say is that it is my favorite album ever. It is number one on my top 10 favorite album list.All the songs are excellent, but some of my personal favorites are: \\"Jellybelly\\", \\"Stumbleine\\", \\"In The Arms Of Sleep\\", \\"Bodies\\", \\"1979\\", and \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\".This album is very theatrical, with the first disc being a more upbeat, feel good, rock cd, and the second disc, being a dark, depressing, sad, mellow cd. Both discs are amazing, but my personal favorite is the second disc.Go and buy this album. it deserves to be in everyone's collection, no matter what kind of music you are into."},{"rating":"1","title":"1/4 Great, 3/4 utter trash.","review":"To be honest, for over a year I thought this was one of the greatest albums ever recorded. Looking back, however, I only really listened to about 9 songs. There is an awful lot of filler (and even more with the reprehensible box \\"The Aeroplane Flies High) and Corgan only exhibits brief flashes of genious in such songs as \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" and \\"To Forgive.\\" The great songs (mostly the ones issued as singles) are very outweighed by filler, or pretentious cheese. Most of the second disc is a waste, track 2 is one of the best Pumpkins songs ever but most of the disc will rarely be read by your laser. If you wanna shell out this amount of cash for a few great songs, more power to you. But there are many better albums out there, \\"Mellon Collie\\" is by no means essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"a true disappointment","review":"A poorly remastered attempt at replicating the splendor of the original. Definitely a rush job to meet the Christmas market. We buy vinyl to get the best sound possible; when each track sounds worse than the 16-year-old CD version, you know something is wrong.If you're thinking about getting this for a Pumpkins fan for Christmas, don't. Seriously. They'll thank you in the long run.Boycott this release and maybe Billy Corgan will get his act together and give his fans something that's worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"not in the same league as other SP albums","review":"To tell you the truth, I stopped liking the Pumpkins over 2 years ago, but I can still say that this is the best SP album by a long shot. Gish is distorted crap, and Siamese Dream is a few catchy tunes with distorted crap in between, but this album's music is complex and beautiful while still holding on to its hard core rock and roll edge. It seemed like this album would be the break out hit for the Pumpkins to become great, but the album after this one is far worse than Gish or Siamese Dream. BUY THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly the best of the S. PumpkinsEEVVEERR!","review":"This album is truly the most stunning piece of music I've ever heard. Billy Corgan has become an absolute favorite musician of mine ever since I bought Ava Adore. When I first heard the sheer art in this C.D. It made me literally want to scream with joy in some parts, others, made me want to cry with an overload of emotion, which is what I truly believe music should do, and Corgan must understand this because every C.D. strikes an unknown chord in your heart that makes you flood with emotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great box set....poor execution on the sound quality","review":"When you spend upwards of $80 on an album you would expect it to sound great and for the most part it does but one GLARING issue. Zero is full of static and ruins the whole set. I have a quality turntable and a really good stylus and I hope it's a pressing issue and not a remaster issue. I have requested a refund and I'm very disappointed after years of waiting for this set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Pressing","review":"I bought this reissue and was quite disappointed by the quality of sound. It's overly distorted sounding in places, has plenty of stereo image smearing and the stereo balance seems off throughout. This vinyl pressing also doesn't sound anywhere close to being as full-bodied in the low-mid range as the CD remaster, causing much of the guitar and drum tones to sound less powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great packaging and B-sides","review":"This is a must buy for any Pumpkins fan. I love the inclusion of the b-sides plus remastering of the classic double disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this album","review":"This is still one of my favourite albums of all time. And for $5? Done! Love my Amazon MP3 app too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still holds up","review":"I hadn't listened to this in a while, actually, and was going over my list of stuff I owned on Amazon. Still a really good CD to leave on and listen to in the background. Pretty amazing after this time, especially since the \\"alternative\\" label has changed so much since then."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, but yet somehow compelling","review":"Billy Corgan is an annoying twit who can sing much better than here (listen to Gish). The unmistakable stench of pretensious B.S. hangs over nearly every song on this album. I want to hate it, and yet, something keeps me coming back to it. Maybe it's the goofy art work. Maybe it's the interesting song titles. Maybe it's the three song stretch on disk two of \\"Thirty-three,\\" \\"In The Arms Of Sleep\\" and \\"1979\\" where the album really clicks. Best to listen to this one in small doses, I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another one bites the dust!","review":"Thought I would get lucky and receive an \\"undistorted\\" vinyl copy through Amazon but to no avail. Several songs were unlistenable. I'm sending back tomorrow. I wish those few people who said they received perfect copies would post which 3rd party sellers they ordered from so maybe I could order from them and maybe get a good one but oh well. Look in your mailbox Amazon cause here it comes back to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long live the pumpkins!","review":"This double CD is packed with great songs. What a variety! There are portions of hard rock, alternative, and pop all mixed together perfectly. This is the greatest accomplishment of the extremely successful band. Billy Corgan is a musical genius and he's got one of the coolest voices ever. Buy this CD and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well-woven masterpiece","review":"Mellon Colloe is the ultimate Pumpkins album. I prefer the hard songs to the ballads, but my god; Corgan sure can craft some songs. Best songs: \\"Tonight\\", \\"Bullet W/ButterFly Wings\\" and \\"Ode to No One\\".Salut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy did your ego get you?","review":"Siamese Dream was one of the best albums ever made. What happened? Billy Corgan's head swelled is what happened. When this happened he decided his music could be awful. There are some songs I enjoy such as Zero and Bullet With Butterfly Wings but I cannot sit through this album! Even to this day I have not been able to listen to this all at once. Even the Zero EP had better b-sides than this. All I can say is brilliance flew out the window when Butch Vig left."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter garbage, i hope to never here any more from them","review":"The band was bearable when the singer didn't think he was a musician of the highest caliber. In the great rock and roll tradition this band has become the best parody of itself imaginable. Just complete pure garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Rock fan HATES this.","review":"\\"How can any rock fan not like this?\\" is one reviewers headline. I say, \\"easy, this album [stinks]\\". Oh sure, there are some moments when everything sounds beautiful and uplifting, but that's only when Billy Corgan is'nt singing... The man simply can't sing. His voice is TERRIBLE. And lets be honest here............. there is nothing musically on this record that hasn't been done before, and better for that matter. This is a classic case of 'The Emperors New Clothes'. So many critics have fawned over this band that everyone seems to be afraid to say that this band is not really that good. 'The Emperor is naked' I say...eeeeeeeeehhhhhhhhhhh.......that's the sound of Billy's voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"My rating of this album is summed up by the title of the fourth track - \\"Zero\\". Billy Corgan has to be the most overrated musician of the decade."},{"rating":"1","title":"He will spare no one","review":"Apart from a few flashes of genius, mainly the singles, this album is mostly poor. I mean, 28 songs? C'mon Billy, do you really love the sound of your own voice that much? I imagine even the most avid Pumpkins fan (which i am not) would begin to get dizzy after 28 songs of your monotonous nasal whining. Other than the singles there isn't much else worth listening here. I recommend you get Gish and stay away from this nasty pretentious beast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack for Gen X","review":"Say whatever you want about the pumpkins creativity, singing talent, adolescent lyrics, etc. But this will be remembered in the next century as one of the most emotionally representive records of the decade, and a great portrait of the confusing, alternative, passive, progressive, boring,wonderful 90's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful packaging, awful sound quality","review":"I took a risk and bought this item even after hearing from dissatisfied customers on the web. I was happy to find that the packaging for this re-issue is absolutely top notch. You get two nice quality, thick booklets along with the four LPs. Unfortunately, my A/B disc suffers the exact same problem everyone else is complaining about. There is distortion which is tolerable up until the half way through the song Zero. At that point, I'm compelled to shut it off. Total shame. I'll hold on to this for the packaging and the hope that the first disc might get replaced. Hoping I'll be able to adjust this up to a five star some time in the future with an update."},{"rating":"2","title":"musical masterpiece","review":"I remember buying this album when I was 11 and was blown away by it. This album was the background soundtrack to my life for years, and has a special place in my heart. Billy Corgan's lyrics are beautifully written and every aspect of the album is done perfectly. Even to this day, I listen to it and it still feels like the first time. Truly a masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Issues and skipping","review":"I bought and returned this album due to skipping and poor sound quality. I could probably live with the sound issues but the skipping in several tracks was too much. If anyone got a good copy of this reissue please let me know from where. Also a little bit of advice for other reviewers. Please review the actual product you are buying not the band. I'm pretty sure anyone that is buying a vinyl reissue of the album already likes the band and doesn't need to know your smashing pumpkin history."},{"rating":"2","title":"SO AMAZING! A MASTERPIECE!!","review":"Let's get real here. This set is just amazing. Mellon Collie & The Infinite Sadness is easily one of the greatest 90's rock of all time, and this IMMERSIVE box set is a blessing to all Smashing Pumpkins fans. MCIS is one of those albums that you can go back to many times and always find something new that you missed before. I love albums like this. This set adds to the magic and puts the listener right in the studio with band. All the ideas,artwork, and creative process are all right here. The artwork in the set is a marvel unto itself and adds even more depth to an already deep concept. To top it off, you get a live DVD of the band in concert. What can I say? AMAZING! Money well spent. Beautiful packaging and quality production."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS CD HAS A BIT OF EVERYTHING!","review":"hi all. this cd is fabulous! Overall it is a rock cd, but there is much much more than that! There are slow acoustic songs, there are metal songs, there is rock songs galore, there are catchy songs, there is even a classical piece! There is common ground here for everyone. This made the ultimate rolling stones top 500 albums list. that same list included the beatles, the rolling stones, led zep, jimmy hendrix, and many other classics, so you KNOW they are good. and, in my opinion, billy corgan has THE best voice of all time. the smashing pumpkins were always standing out just because of his voice alone, but then you add amazing lyrics, great sounds, and endless variety...and you get my favorite band ever! do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this cd. i promise you'll be saying to yourself \\"i wish these guys were still together, they are so darn good, i'd see them live!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"How many artists make double CDs? Not many. How many are not compilations? Even less. How many band pull off a superb 2 CD? This is one of the best recordings of all time. I'd say that 95% of the songs are exceptional, and is a must have for the 90s alternative rock fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned it","review":"It's a terrible pressing of this wonderful album. Beautiful package. Inner groove distortion makes this UN-listenable. Why bother releasing this and not paying attention to the way it sounds. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not even worth repeating . . .","review":"The sound near the inner grooves is godawful. It's a nice $80 mantle piece. That's about all it's good for. Pass on this one, trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smashing Pumpkins Mellon Collie & the Infinite Sadness Vinyl reissue","review":"I waited long for this masterpiece and was very happy to get it via Amazon USA for half the price I would have to pay here in Germany. All in all, these were pretty much the good points. I have the same problem as all the other bad reviews, distortion and sound artifacts (best noticeable on \\"Zero\\"). I think that Amazon makes it even worse by mixing the reviews for the CD reissue with the Vinyl reissue as the problem seems to occur just on the Vinyl version. If you combine the Vinyl reviews, this reissue wont even get near a 2-Star rating. I am thinking of returning my 2 copys of this wonderfull album / s***ty reissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated,actually...","review":"Most bad reviews the Pumpkins get is a direct attack on Billy Corgan.I think is funny how people think they \\"know\\" some guy from a rock band just because they heard his music and read his interviews.\\"Look at Eddie Veder...wonderful person,I can tell\\" \\"Now,Billy Corgan is a pretencious prick\\". Grow up ladies.These are not the backsreet boys...I love every single track on this album.It's a masterpiece that could only come out of a pretencious prick head.Want Ordinary? Go listen to your old boring grunge album...or maybe go buy the new Puddle of Mud album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellon Collie","review":"I have owned this CD for about three or four years. I don't personally think that it is the best Smashing Pumpkins CD ever, I own them all, but it is defenatly one of the best they made. This is defenatly a CD to listen to if you are depressed; the sounds of \\"Zero\\" and \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\" will have to singing along and feeling better in no time. If you end up liking this CD i defitely recommend the Smashing Pumpkins newest CD, \\"Machina: The Machines of God\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD's EVER!","review":"This is another great collection of Pumpkin songs, from Stumbeline to x.y.u. each song has so much feeling. All 28 songs are great. Get this album, it is a classic along with Siamese Dream!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good time to think","review":"When I first listened to the CD I wasn' t amazed. But after listenning to it, during a time in which I had personal troubles, I just started to understand the meaning of the different songs. They kind of helped me out and let me see things from another point of view. Although if I don' t like all the songs of the masterpiece, I keep it as a jewel in my cd collection. James, Billy and D' Arcy, you guys did a fantastic job!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't shipped in a box, shrink wrap torn off","review":"I don't know if anyone else had this experience, but my shipping sticker was put directly on the shrinkwrap and sent out of the Louisville facility, sans box. I was shocked it came this way. Obviously there was cosmetic damage. In their defense, Amazon was good about getting me a replacement set out right away, it will be here tomorrow. As far as the sound goes, mine is pretty distorted throughout, most notably on the inner groove songs, but not one song sounds totally clear. I'm hoping this had something to do with damage during the poor shipping, but since the records look immaculate I feel like it might just be horrid mastering and/or pressing. No one else having sound issues? It's really one of the most distorted 180g releases I've ever heard and I was surprised to see the other reviewers praise it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I felt that this album is excellent","review":"I felt that this album is an excellent work by the smashing pumpkins. Their mix of heavy metal, and lighthearted valentine music was good and well mixed on the disc(s). This has some of their greatest hits on it which should not be passed up.-Crusader"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pumpkins.","review":"These guys used to be my favorite band, until they got a drum machine for Adore and Darcy left the band. She had a great voice and was a competent bass player. At least Jimmy's back for the new album though. Anyway, this album is definetly worth your money if you're into any kind of music. I'm a hardcore metal guy and I like tons of the stuff on these cds, the first cd is more instantly likeable, but the 2nd cd is great too once you listen to it. Billy is a talented song writer, but he could stop whining every once in a while and write about something positive. So get it. It's up there with Siamese Dream on thier best albums list. Top songs : Jelly Belly, Zero, Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Muzzle, Bodies, XYU, Thru The Eyes Of Ruby, Stubliene, Farewell And Goodnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd brings essential happiness to one's soul.","review":"If you want a cd to listen to and love and cherish forever, this cd is for you. This cd is quite impossible to get sick of. This cd has a variety of songs. Some are quiet, some are slow, some are fast, some are loud. Just when you think you have the music figured out, it turns in the opposite direction and surprises you again. The lyrics are very genius sounding. Very much like poetry. This music is perfect for the mainstream alternative person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not meant to sound cheesy, but one of the best albums ever!","review":"I've been a fan of the Pumpkins for 3 years now, and I love all of their albums, but this is their best. I've worn out my copy, and have made others fans of the band by playing to them this CD. BUY IT!!! NOW!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven...I'm In Heaven...","review":"This deluxe edition was worth every penny! I am so happy! This was already my all-time favorite album by any artist, and now that I've had a chance to see what the deluxe edition has to offer, I am fully satisfied!"},{"rating":"2","title":"346 reviews!","review":"Probably THE best guitar album of the 90's. I like it as much as ELECTRIC LADYLAND. I love it that it is a double album! The older Pumpkins-albums now sound a bit dated to me; this one probably will remain standing up. This is a bust-buy for guitar-lovers...! Play it loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"best smashing pumkins album ever","review":"this album proves that the smashing pumpkins would be around a while which they were. the best songs on thes double disk album is tonight,tonight which is the best, 1979 is great to, stumbleine is great as well, bullet with butterfly wings is also one of there best. many of the other songs on here are only average to not that great but the 10 or so that are good makes you want this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little bit everything....great buy","review":"This album has soft rock as well as real hardcore grunge metal. its great listening and defintely worth the money.

It is an acheingly beautiful epic which takes you on such a journey so utterly unimaginable. Basically what I'm trying to say is \\"this album ROCKS!!!!\\" It has so many hits and so many unplayed and obscure songs that unfortuantly not everyone gets to hear. This album has easily secured my devotion to SP and has proven that Billy Corgan is one of the best song writers and muscians in history. I bought this album for the song \\"Bullet with Butterfly Wings\\" and have been rewarded by songs of equal quality and some that even surpass this brilliant hit. But this album NOW. You won't be sorry"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BAND OF ALL TIME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"SP has been like therapy. When I'm sad or lonely i just put on a song like thirty-three or to forgive. when i'm angry or frustrated, i listen to bwbw or x.y.u. when i'm feeling happy or just feeling like a kid, i listen to 1979 or we only come out at nite. This album definitely makes me feel like i'm not alone when i have those emotions. i can never give the band more thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD rules","review":"With an awesome title like that, how can a CD go wrong? It can't and didn't. This CD set rocks the house. Well, mostly. One downfall of this CD is although its packed with great music, the second CD sucks other than 1979 and thirty-three. The other songs had screwed up lyrics and rythms that just didn't seem to go anywhere. I'd like to stress that some of my friends don't share this point of view with me. I think it's a matter of opinion. Another point to stress about this CD is that this is loud music. If you don't like heavy bass and guitar or, umm, energetic drumming then this CD is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Corgans finest moment","review":"I started listening to this cd late 1995 after my brother bought it from a tip from a friend. I only began listening to it while playing doom or marathon and i didnt think too much of it - and indeed I didn't think I was addicted to it - until I found myself listening to it around 4 hours a day.. The ultimate rock album, every song on this album grows on you in different ways, from popular rock songs like bullet, to lesser known gems like love, this album doesnt let you go. Of course after around a year of listening to nothing but mellon collie i began getting into gish, siamese dream and pices iscariot. All these rockn' cd's blew my mind away, but I always came back to mellon collie.

People's affection for this over hyped under devilered mess is beyond me. First off, his voice is weak, horrible, off-key, annoying and unable to express any emotion what-so-ever. The songs themselves are at the most barely catchy. I suppose if one wanted to write songs that were most complex and less straight forward that would be good, that is obviously not the case here. He wants to write songs and play them yet his guitar skills are average at best. The songs don't have any punch to them at all and you can't hum these things. No melody, no groove, no reason. This is just another horrible POP(ular) band from the 90s with poor music skills (which is all too common among the mainstream. One last thing 'Alternative Music' is a market name for POP. This band is Pop and its powerless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious...boring...Bad","review":"I bought this disc not knowing anything about the Pumkins.

Oh, I get it. Cute. Well, thefirst clue that this is a dud is that most decent double albums sell at more than this one, which reflects its relative worth.There is really nothing here, as the so-called \\"hits\\" are poor and the filler is exceptionally poor. I guess every band deserves to put out a mediocre, self-indulgent and erratic album at least once in their career. The Beatles did it with the While Album, Pink Floyd did it with the Wall, and now we have the Reeking Pumpkins offering with Mellon Collie. So bad it's not funny. 1-star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank You The Darkness, Thank You Byzantine, Thank You Tesla","review":"More Boring rock by the talentless fool who excels at sounding like a whiny Tottler."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star for the one decent song","review":"Pretentious title for an album, but at least \\"1979\\" was a decent radio tune, even if one still had to endure Billy Pumpkin's whiny, nasal voice. There does exist an instrumental version of it. I haven't heard it, but would like to. I read somewhere that Billy Pumpkinhead and his pumpkin patch didn't even perform this song in concert at the time. What kind of pumpkinhead is he, not doing the current hit? If I were a fan I would have thrown pumpkin shells at him for that insult."},{"rating":"2","title":"1995....","review":"First off, I'd have to say this was the smashing pumpkins best effort, and quite possibly my favorite cd for various reasons on which upon I shall state. First reason the guitar. If you even think of being a muscisian this is an esential listen. I never realized the complexity of billy corgans musical vocabulary until i heard this. Second reason the number of single and possible singles,Standout Tracks> Mellon Collie and The Infinite Sadness> Zero> Bullet With Butterfly Wings> Muzzle> Porcelina> Bodies> 1979These are my favorite, plus james iha does a nice song, and finally the Third Reason, What you wouldnt expect, i really didnt expect it to sound like it did (on a good way) it is a masterpiece at it lows, but at the peaks it is undescribable for words."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Album of All Time","review":"This is a truly amazing CD. The Smashing Pumpkins were one of the best bands of the 90's, and this was the peak of their success. 2 discs, 28 tracks, 5 singles. What more can you ask for? Every track on this cd is great. What is so great about this CD is that they mixed so many different styles, but personalized them to sound like the Smashing Pumpkins. They were heavy with songs like Bullet With Butterfly Wings, Zero, and Bodies. They were light with songs like 33, Thru the Eyes of Ruby, and Beautiful. They showed a unique, different style with songs like Tonight, Tonight, Cupid De Locke, and Galapogos. They rounded it out with An Ode to No One, 1979, x.y.u., and To Forgive, which were all truly sensational. This makes it very hard to believe that one year before this release Billy Corgan had to record Pisces Inscariot by himself because the band had split. This is the best of the Pumpkins, and this is the best of rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous","review":"\\"Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness\\" and \\"Tonight tonight\\"after only two songs you'll have to push repeat on you hi-fi.This appened to me and had never happened before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Masterpiece","review":"This is by far the best cd ever.

Definitely worth buying and more than worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most amazing album of all time","review":"It is amazing. Tonight Tonight is the greatest song of all time. The album wants me to cry. Listen to it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound issues - beware!","review":"Unfortunately, I had to return this box set as there were some major issues with the sound on it. Usually I can overlook some flaws, but this was too much especially for the price. I thought it was my turntable at first, but after playing with the adjustments I got nowhere. After reading the reviews online, they say exactly what I am experiencing- distortion on many of the songs (almost clipping), especially the louder guitar driven ones which seemed to affect the right channel mostly, poor stereo imaging and overall noisy vinyl. They also cranked up the loudness way too much for this pressing. My friend has an original pressing and we compared them. Too bad, great packaging and all, but for $80 not worth it. Hope they fix these issues and I will certainly get it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! could have been great","review":"First and foremost, this is a five star album. This is a review of the newly remastered vinyl edition specifically. As mentioned by others, Zero sounds horrible, incredibly distorted. The rest of it sounds pretty good, but I'm returning it, for the price I'm not willing to accept this, the entire album should be perfect. It's a shame, the artwork and packaging are top notch, too bad that quality wasn't applied to what matters most, the sound quality of the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vinyl Release: Sound Quality issues!","review":"As another review said, there is a TON of distortion on the Zero track. As I was listening through the album, several other songs had moments of distortion as well. I was playing the album on my AT-LP120, hooked to an Onkyo receiver with Polk speakers, so it wasn't some cheap-old turntable.Due to the sound quality issues, I'm returning my copy to Amazon. I can't justify the cost of the album when the sound quality is so bad. It is really disappointing because the box set is beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cd","review":"The 90's is the best decade of music... you should deffinately buy any and all Smashing Pumkin'scds. Good product! A+"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Dream.","review":"One of Billy's best before he got all new-agey and cumbersome. The band still intact and firing on all cylinders. So much to love here. So much to devour. Easily one of the 15 greatest double albums in rock music history. What else has not been said. You have various styles from so many genres and MORE importantly you have Billy operating at a lyrical apex, along with Adore, that he will never match again if what his newer works concede is true. Pick this up and fall in love if you have a heart to at least a couple of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the only album....","review":"...about which I feel strongly enough to write a review. That in itself says more than anything else I could say. Indeed, words fail me when I try to describe the music on this album. Inspired, genius, masterpiece, celestial, epic... Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is in a class all by itself. Of a time, yet timeless. Beautiful and doomed. Thank you Billy, James, Jimmy, and D'arcy. Love you all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful....","review":"This album has been through so much with me and it's absolutely the greatest (except for Siamese Dream). This album meant so much to me and still does. Smashing Pumpkins forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever made by SP!","review":"I'm 16 years old (young) and I bought Adore before I bought this album last year. Of course MCIS sounds different than Adore but I think MCIS is much better because ot has more guitar and drum parts. It's a matter of taste but I think the most fans of the Smashing Pumpkins would agree with me that Adore is very good, of course, but MCIS is the best album of the Smashing Pumpkins'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Physical Graffiti meets Substance 1987.","review":"I must admit, I was one of the ones who originally dismissed Smashing Pumpkins as another \\"Seattle\\" band, only to find at the time of this album's release that they hail from Chicago (bassist D'arcy Wretzky actually hails from Michigan). Upon learning this, I decided to give them a second chance, and to this day, I am ecstatic that I did. This is the best American double-album of the nineties and the best two-disc set since Springsteen's The River. Among the indisposables are \\"Tonight, Tonight\\", \\"Love\\", \\"Zero\\" and \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\". The rest of the tunes? They're just merely great. Really, this album will convince you that rock still has a great future...no matter what Billy says. This is the most fearsome foursome in rock since The Who---and that is saying a ton."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most memorable album by the Smashing Pumpkins","review":"This album has a lot of both mellow and hard-rock type of songs .Hard being Zero,Jellybelly, and Bullet with Butterfly Wings .Mellow being the Title track,Tonight Tonight, and Thirty-Three .And of course right on the borderline of Hard-Soft... \\"1979.\\" Exremly well written and composed. Very memoable guitar riffs from Billy. Buy this album to start off your collection or as the next CD or Cassette set on it because it is the best !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONEOF THE GREATEST WORKS OF MUSIC, EVER!","review":"This CD set is a good buy. It has mood expressing music that sounds great, anytime. I would buy a personal CD player to listen to this in school, in the car, or anywhere. I would absolutely love so much to meet the Billy, James, D'arcy, and Jimmy. They are the best combination of musicians I've ever seen. If you want a cool site or two, here are some: http://www.pug.simplenet.com http://www.smashing-pumpkins.netThese are great sites. If you are a fan, visit these now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a balancing act between Black Sabbath and Bowie tendencies","review":"This album is fantastic. The only reason I'd recommend it over Siamese Dream is that it has more of what it's good at. While Siamese dream only had 1 or 2 radio songs, most of this album is singles it seems. I do not believe there is honestly a 'bad' song among them. There are, however, weaker ones, but on the whole this is a true masterpiece. It may throw some off balance to hear a heavy metal song and then a glam/dream-pop song, but that's it's intent. I think it would have been more interesting if these two influences (Sabbath, Bowie) would have made 2 seperate discs as well. It would have been a more consistant album. Flood's production is magnificent as was Butch Vig's before him, but that doesn't take away from the fact that Billy Corgan is one of the 90s greatest songwriters. I don't go in much for alternative music, but this is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"probably the best 'double' album in the world!","review":"this album is excellent! it's seems to highly surpass crap albums like \\"The Wall\\". I got this album nearly 4 years ago, and at the time I didn't like every track on it. but now after I listen to it, each song sounds beautiful, and crystal clear. Billy Corgan is definitely a genius There is not one bad track on this album. considering the fact that the album is 122 minutes long. This album should go down in history as one of the greatest albums of all-time.Excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EPIC","review":"I am a big fan of the Pumkins and I can say proudly that this my most favorite cd of theirs. Its long and stuffed with sweet, sweet songs that make my head simply burst with glee.In addition to the obvious intant-hit-ear-catchers, there are several other brilliant tracks such as \\"We Only Come Out At Night\\" (my personal favorite) \\"Bullet With Butterfly Wings\\", \\"Thru the Eyes of Ruby\\", ect. ect.I cant get enough of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New With Defects","review":"The sound was distorted and several tracks skipped.

He opened it and was so excited because he is a big fan of the Smashing Pumpkins. Well, he took it apart and started playing the music and this is where it gets disappointing. Some of the songs skipped, there were black blobs on two of the records so they wouldn't even play, and scratches. I would not advise in purchasing this product. HUGE disappointment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, but too short!","review":"This is a wonderful and lovingly prepared work. For the best of all worlds, I would suggest reading this with the incredible companion book, \\"The Autobiography of Jesus of Nazareth and the Missing Years\\". Then it is almost like an interactive experience, because you see the real man Jesus through \\"The Autobiography...\\" and see exactly where he lived in this book. It may appear a daunting book because of its 400 + pages, but I found it too short! If there is anything else the authors could have included in this excellent book, it can only because there is still 2000 years of dust on it! Buy it today."},{"rating":"1","title":"$25 for defective vinyl I can't exchange!","review":"This review isn't about the band, who are fantastic. It's about a damaged $25 double album I can't return. I never dreamed I had to open a brand new vinyl lp before playing it in order to check it for damage. Decided to spin it today after installing the new Shure cartridge I purchased on a new Technics headshell I bought. Opened the package, removed the first album and what do I see? Serious scrape marks on the first several tracks. Premium vinyl pressing indeed! I have pictures of the damage and it's obvious by the damage pattern it's something that I'm not capable of doing.

Without it this shovel is junk. Within three minutes of light use the lock collar buckeled and now will not keep the shovel locked in place. I could probably put a washer on it to fix it but I think I will send it back and purchase something I can count on. I understand the cost is only 10 dollars but it is advertised as a reliable light duty shovel. It should be advertised as scrap metal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs down for coleman","review":"I'm dissapointed in this product from coleman. Normally the stuff they put out is of better quality. I know the thing only cost ten bucks, but it's junk. The first time I used it the \\"positive fit lock collar\\" bent and came loose from the tightening ring. The shovel blade when \\"locked\\" is bent backwards slightly making digging a pain. I just saw a comparable version today at a tool tent in a parking lot for $8 that was better constructed. I would send it back if the shipping wouldn't cost so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected more from Coleman","review":"The steel ring where the shaft contacts the back of the shovel head isn't hardened. The shovel basically ripped itself apart the first time I used it to dig a hole in not very hard soil. Good thing it wasn't an emergency. I expected at least \\"ok\\" quality from Coleman, it seems they really let there quality hit rock bottom. Looks like I have a new door stop, and will be looking for a new camp shovel. Unless you are looking to scooping a litter box don't waste yer money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS POS","review":"I got this shovel to take with me on a back country rafting trip for 7 days. It lasted exactly one night. The locking mechanism broke rendering the shovel useless after the first night. This was used primarily for taking care of business in the back country without leaving a mess if you know what I mean. I almost threw it in the river and was irritated I had to pack the sucker out. It went strait in the trash when I got home. Coleman should be ashamed to sell this cheap piece of crap made in China. I would give it zero stars if I could. Buy another because this one sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!!!","review":"I bought a Coleman shovel in good faith and took it with me on a hiking trip. We got to camp and I started to dig a hole for a fire, the dirt had a few old roots mixed up in it but for the most part it was soft. This shovel broke almost immediately, the plastic ring that you tighten down to use it stripped and made the shovel impossible to use normally. I got the hole dug but not for a huge amount of effort and ingenuity on my part to get it to work properly. I sent it back as soon as I got home and went out and spent $20 on a real E-tool like I should have done in the first place. Don't let the price fool you into purchasing one, if you ever have to use it, you will be sorry that you bought it. I have always liked coleman products and for the most part, will continue to do so, but I won't ever go cheap on a critical piece of gear like a camp shovel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"I'm a doomsday prepper that plans on living in the woods like its 1799. I was looking for a shovel that was exactly like I had in the U.S. Army, and that's almost exactly what I got. The only difference is the color and it doesn't have a carrying case. For my purposes, it will most likely stay stored in a backpack. So, the carrying case isn't all that necessary, unless I find myself wanting to go on a scouting mission. Other than that, it appears just as durable as the Army issued E-tool and is very compact and lightweight for convenient portability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't make it through the first hole","review":"Used it to dig a small fire pit in sandy soil. It broke after about 30 seconds of use. The issue is that the locking ring is not strong enough, and bent when normal force was applied. After that, it became impossible to keep the shovel unfolded. In the world of folding shovels, you definitely get what you pay for. I bought this shovel for light duty. I guess it just wasn't light enough..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but lube the threads...","review":"I have been pleased with this item. It folds up nicely, and is quite sturdy. The only caveat I have about using it is that you may need to lube the threads of the main collar that locks the tool into one position or another. I had it in \\"Hoe-mode\\" and it got stuck. I had to take a pair of vice-grips to it to get it undone. Price was right though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salt corrosion ruined it quickly","review":"A big disappointment. Our group used it on camping trips to the beach. In less than a year corrosion rendered the metal moving parts inoperable--a shovel with a floppy coupling will not work!

This shovel (a.k.a. \\"e-tool\\" or \\"entrenching tool\\" by the military)had been on my hit-list for a while. The design is so simple, there's not a lot that CAN possibly go wrong. Enter the Coleman folding camp shovel. For it's maiden mission, I headed out to the remove a well-rooted shrub from a grave headstone. Not a huge job. PITIFUL craftsmanship with this shovel...bent up horribly from light digging work. Buy a surplus e-tool, instead. That's the same EXACT thing, only mil-spec/ quality construction. Shame on you, Coleman, for putting your name on this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"If you want a real tri-fold shovel, shell out an extra 3 dollars and go to your local military surplus store. The locking ring literally broke apart, and the handle bent without a fight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great as long as you never put any backwards pressure on it...","review":"I bought 2 of these for a Boy Scout winter camp trip and within a few minutes of using each they were useless. We were trying to dig out snow caves with them and any time you would pull down on the shovel it would pop loose and fold up. After a couple times of doing this it wouldn't even hold anymore. I would think if it was used carefully for digging holes only it would probably work fine. In conclusion, I'm very disappointed in the quality of the lock collar but for $10 it will do what it is suppose to do, just don't expect it to do any more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"xL 2xL 3xL all the same size be advised","review":"i bought 1 shirt just to try ....im 2xL so i bought the 3xL just in case and guess what the 3xL is like a large ...just with a difrent tag..and the material was a faded black looked poor ...very disapointed with this one ,im sticking to name brands nautica ,ralf lauren ect"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Described","review":"Besides the seller sending the wrong size and color..this is thin cheap material..threads are already coming out along the seams..would never buy again"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good.

To be accurate, we stayed in specific rooms in those hotels based upon her recommendations of particularly nice rooms. The rooms, the costs and friendly staff were just as she had described.

Do they even make TVs without stereo sound anymore? Apparently they do. But it got worse. This model only has RCA plugs in the front. It has none in the back. The only plug in the back is the basic cable plug. I guess this is what I get for making assumptions. If you are looking for a television with absolutely no thrills, buy this one.

Some were simply not big charters and at least one other (\\"Eve of Destruction\\") was a big hit for somebody else.Still, the band was remarkably consistent considering that they wrote little of the material themselves (only 4 of these 20 tracks). Interestingly, one of the numerous outside writers they gave breaks to included a VERY young Warren Zevon, who must have penned the snappy \\"Outside Chance\\" while in grade school.Overall, a strong anthology that contains all The Turtles music the casual fan will ever need to hear (and then some)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"If you love those great pop bands of the 60s you need to know about the Turtles!Flawlessly executed,hook filled,fun songs that are so good you'll find yourself going back to this CD again and again!I need their full lengths now......."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Service","review":"Happy with my purchase.

Other great Turtle tunes fit in well here: \\"Grim Reaper Of Love\\", \\"Outside Chance\\" {penned by Warren Zevon} and \\"You Don't Have To Walk In The Rain\\".The Turtles were one of the better American groups to come out of the 1960's.

It's a collection of vivid photos of structures that caught the eye of architect Henry Seider. Taken all over the world (every continent is represented), they include the rock structures of Petra in Jordan, the gothic cathedral at Ulm, and the museum für Moderne Kurnst both in Germany, Isfahan mosque in Iran, works by Le Corbusier, Mies Van De Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, to mention a few, with minimal notes (and in a few cases, sketches) describing each project.Structures range from historical (Petra, the pyramids and temples of Egypt), to classic, to modern, so there should be something for everyone.As with every other book on architecture from Taschen which I own, this is a delight."},{"rating":"1","title":"good photos only","review":"I've previewed some pages of this book on the official site of Taschen. Then I bought this book with the thought that there would be good analysis about those great architectures,since this book entitled with \\"...an architect's eye\\". When I got this book I feel a little bit of dissapointment because this book is merely a collection of mostlt \\"western\\" architecture photos. With few analysis on these masterpieces,I suggest those who interest in real architectural books go browse Google for pics rather than buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"No discussion or analysis - really just glorified postcards","review":"I ordered this book without seeing it first, and I was quite disappointed with it. I am not too familiar with the publisher, but I have just purchased \\"What Great Painting Say Vols. 1 & 2\\" by the publisher, and was expecting something along the lines of those books (great books, by the way).This book is basically photographs only, with bare minimum captioning (building name/location only). No other information at all. I was hoping to see commentary telling me things about the buildings, some sort of architectural evaluation or commentary.The only reason I give this even two stars is that the photographs are mostly pretty nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"started smoking","review":"I bought a Yellowbird a year and a half ago because my first dryer (purchased at the professional shop) lasted more than 15 years.

This paticular timer gives off two warnings before counting down to zero. One at 10 minutes and the other at 5 minutes. I am not sure if any other timer has this feature, but I do have another timer that does not and that is why I prefer this one. The two warning are short - lasting only 2 seconds - and are distinct. So if you know which one is which, you will know if you have 10 or 5 minutes left.One other feature that this timer has, is that it will count forward. So instead of setting a count down, you can set it to count forward by pressing the start button when the timer is zeroed out. In the count forward mode, the hour display is used to display minutes, and the minutes display is used to display seconds. So you can see the seconds tick by. It will only count forward to 19 minutes 59 seconds - the maximum display of the timer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your Number 1 Fan !!!!!!!","review":"I really like this interview.

Perhaps the forced language that makes one think the story is set in the south, but it turns out they are in California. How about the sterotyped and two dimensional characters? Or perhaps the plot, which is lackluster and transparent. Oh, the agony. I read the first 50 pages, looked here and there, and read the last two chapters.

They are awesome speakers with great range. I have 2 little kids so power was not something I was looking for. I wanted clarity so I could still hear dialog at low volumes when we watch movies at night after the kids go to bed. These speakers are perfect for that, easy to install, and a great value. I called Polk to give me some guidance on what speakers I should purchase and how to pair them and this is what they advised.Saved a couple hundred dollars via Amazon or their merchants compared to slightly less quality Sony speakers from the firm that installed the pre-wire in our home.Be aware that Polk only honors the warranty for speakers purchased from an authorized dealer. Not that liquidators are bad (I bought the TC 65 from a liquidator) it's just good to know the pros and cons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality product at a great price","review":"I purchased a pair of these speakers to use as surrounds. At less than $80 per speaker, these speakers represent excellent value. They have the same warm quality that are found in other Polk speakers and the tweeters put out some nice highs. I use these speakers in a room that is about 150 sq. ft. In a bigger room, you might want to go for in-wall speakers that put out a richer sound like the Polk TC265i.Installation is a breeze. In fact, probably the most difficult part about the installation may be finding the wall studs (if you don't have a good stud sensor) and running the wires to the speaker if your house isn't already wired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated Speakers for Sound Quality","review":"I used these speakers to replace horribly sounding, ultra-junk quality Radio Shack speakers and these hardly sounded any different. Their construction was awfully close to the Radio Shack speakers, as well - cheap MADE IN CHINA quality. I think people just follow other people's reviews and are easily influenced by \\"brand names\\" rather than judge equipment on its own merits. I regret the purchase am now looking for better quality additional speakers. Brand names mean NOTHING when they all have their crap made by the same Chinese factories. And we wonder why everyone is out of work now and it is hard to buy quality products of ANY type!!!!!! This was my first Polk Audio purchase and I always heard that Polk Audio was really good but maybe long ago when they didn't farm their products out to the same Chinese factories as Radio Shack!!!!!!

I run auctions on ebay (under the same name if you want to see my pictures), and compared to that cheaper camera I talked of earlier, the pictures are 100% better.There are some things that I don't like about this camera. The software and lack of technical support are lacking. The battery slot is wobbly.

I've had it less than a year and I've taken some pretty nice pictures (you can see a few on \\"share your images\\".The battery door is flimsy, hence the 4 stars, but my pictures have turned out very nice. Like most Americans, I wanted to upgrade just to have something more expensive and I'm glad I did but this is a nice compact piece that I can go just about anywhere with.I loaned it to a coworker for her trip to Kyoto, Japan during the Cherry Blossom Festival, I'm sure her shots came out great and she'll be upgrading to digital:)You'll like the easy use and, unlike another review, it's not difficult for others to master.The price Amazon is offering is way too much.

It will not focus and there are mechanical sounds inside that don't stop. So, for just one year of occasional use, it's over. I have to go out and buy a new camera. I spent about $400 on this camera and that means I paid about $33.00 a month for the use. Too much!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely poor auto focus ---","review":"Over 50% of the photos I have taken are blurry. According to the instruction manual, when the dot in the view finder turns white, the picture is in focus. This is only true if blur is your focus of choice. I have taken still shots, motion shots, shots with flash and without with the same poor focus results.My current digital camera is an Olympus also with a 10x optical zoom which is my desired zoom minimum. My only complaint with the Olympus is the delay time between shots. I had such high hopes for the Minolta as the write time and refresh time is so good. And that did fulfill the promise, but again with out of focus pictures.I am returning the camera and will continue my search for a camera that will deliver the features promised."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT LITTLE CAMERA!!","review":"I'VE OWNED THE DIMAGE Z1 FOR A YEAR NOW AND I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT!

About a year ago the battery cover wouldn't close all the way due to a broken tab in the cheesy cover. Well I just sent it in to be repaired, and guess what they want $150 to fix it. That's almost half the price of the camera for a 10 cent item and probably all of 15 minutes to fix. I won't be getting it fixed (I'll tape it shut), and I won't ever buy another camera from Minolta. Let the buyer beware. Stay away from Minolta unless you like spending your money on repairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not focus with flash","review":"I have had the camera for 11 months now. I like how easy it is to download pictures. It takes great pictures during the day BUT ... in a dark situation, when I have to use the flash the camera almost always focuses incorrectly. Even though it shows you with a red line where it is focusing, with the flash it does a poor job of really focusing where it says it is focusing. Plus, you think the picture is in focus because on the LCD screen it looks like it is in focus, but once you print the picture it is not in focus.

That also seems to make them a little sturdier than similar file boxes. At least the design is sturdy, but the cardboard on these particular boxes seems a little on the slim side, so don't fill them with too-heavy items, or stack them too high. I'd give them 5 stars if the corregation was a little stiffer.My plan in using these is to consolidate all my random stuff that is in random-sized boxes into these standard boxes, then number the box ends, and start a card-file summarizing the contents by box number. Viola! Organized! My local Home Depot used to sell boxes similar to these, but they had this big ugly orange square logo on the side. Years ago, my Mother bought something similar from an organizational guru named Emily Barnes, with nice cross-hatched pattern in the lid. The tradition lives on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid file boxes","review":"These file boxes are strong and great to use. The attached lid just flips up to add to your file box and therefore stays intact without folded or torn edges.

Most of the \\"advice\\" consists of personal accounts of Ms. Grant's own writing experiences, with very specific details as to how she came up with all her plots (and very minor attempts to translate this into beneficial knowledge for the reader). It could serve as a decent catalog if you were shopping for her books. She manages to make some useful points about designing characters to produce conflict, but she misuses vocabulary words on more than one occasion, lacks focus and flow, and really doesn't include any other valuable content. I finally had to quit reading when she started explaining how to use the \\"omnipotent\\" viewpoint (which is presumably one where the narrator can do anything?). \\"How To Write Romances\\" by Phyllis Taylor Pianka is the way to go for books of this sort, despite it not having quite as cheezy a cover as this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking for a better word","review":"There was only one piece of advice that worked for me in this book.

I haven't had any trouble with them at all! Perhaps the other reviewer did not secure the wall brackets properly? My only objection is the price -- it will cost me between around $400 to buy all the accessories I'd like to get (one additional wall bracket, two long shelves, 4 shorter shelves, and 4 drawers were almost $300.

I've studied MANY different SAT books as a student. This book offers problems that may be given on the SAT's that I have not seen in other books. There are all levels of difficulties also. There is no \\"fluffy\\" pages with wordy explanations. Its explanations and summaries of every topic is concise and understandable. A major plus of this book is that it offers MANY math problems of every subject covered on the SAT I. (the key way in getting a higher score is being exposed to many types of problems and becoming familiar with them through repeated exercises) Each page of this book is worth its money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, you can increase your SAT I math score dramatically","review":"By using this book as a study guide, my daughter increased her SAT I math score by 110 points. She did this over the course of 25 days, doing a section of the book each day in addition to her other school work. She was motivated to do this by the need to increase her score to qualify for a program that she was interested in.I chose this book for her because it was laid out in managable chapters and had a review at the end of each section. Of all the SAT math review books, this one seemed to approach the subject in the most logical fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing 30 pages in the middle","review":"I ordered this book for my daughter.

Be sure to check your copy when you receive it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much material","review":"After reading the reviews for this book I thought for sure it would be a huge help. But... it wasn't. There's around 20 sections and although that might not seem that bad, for someone who is going high school five days a week and has hours of homework every night it is. Also, the information and examples presented at the beginning of each section are not sufficient enough. The book will give a simple example to explain a concept and then when you work on the practice questions they will be much harder. Too often I find myself scratching my head and turning to the answer page for an explanation and so instead of actually working through the problems myself and getting better at the process that goes with it I am actually just trying to remember how the book did it. If you are planning to get a high score and want an all around great book for the SAT I would suggest Baron's 2400 Aiming for the perfect score. It's a much more doable book and the math section is extremely helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thinking","review":"Remember the stories your parents told you about black experiences, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the beginner","review":"I was looking for a book that was simple, easy, and to the point.

Imagine eating rice with WD40 or antifreeze. It is really that bad. Now I am stuck with 23 boxes that I am never going to eat. Even if you have no taste buds at all, don't buy this. It has to be unhealthy to eat something with this many unlisted chemicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Staple for enamelist","review":"This book is a stapel for many enamel students.

Both are arrested for not having permits to conduct them,and they are sent to jail where they make a bargain of marriage after talking for awhile. He for her money, She for his title and to save her family from a scandal.

This edition expands significantly on his previous Najdorf work published in the mid-80's. In the ever-changing world of the Najdorf, it is essential to have the latest reference for any player rated above 2000. If you want to play the 6.Bg5 lines, then you need this book. John Nunn sets the standard that others are measured by when it comes to opening books. His works are full of original analysis and useful tidbits.

I thought that she was probably the best soprano out there in the spotlight. After hearing this CD, however, I have really changed my mind. First of all, she sings flat in alot in this CD. Secondly, her technique is showing some flaws now in that she can not always pronounce the words correctly. So she makes some strange sounds. For example, \\"Tu, tu, tu\\" which should be pronounced with a pure 'oo' sound is pronounced 'tuh'. I also feel that her voice is a bit frantic in alot of parts with her middle range and chest voice being weak and uncoordinated. How unfortunate! She needs to get it together or she is going down the toilet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth buying","review":"This is a depressing release, charaterised by insecure intonation and delivery, which inhibits the artist's interpretative range.

I returned it and was looking at the various flat TVs by various brands at many stores. This panasonic was the only TV that didn't the skew the lines much. I got this reluctantly as I initially thought the Toshiba had a much better picture. But, after adjusting the picture, I found that the panasonic had equally good picture.

The picture slipped, leaving the bottom part of the screen unviewable; the cabinet warped; and the on/off function failed to work (the only way to shut off the TV was to pull the plug).Panasonic was extremely slow to deal with the problem; it took over a month in the shop, and paying labor charges, to get the new product fixed.

This is for identifying the problem what i am facing. Yeah Folks you can see some problem they listed in their Manual Itself. According to their category of the probelm you have to talk to them.

I have not been disappointed. The theology is a little too mainstream/conservative for my liking but this book's great strength is its emphasis on historical context. Throughout the text Finger emphasises the historical context of anabaptist theology and, in particular, incorporates the often forgotten non-Swiss strands of anabaptism. I believe this is the great strength of this book and reminded me somewhat of the style of Pannenberg's Systematic Theology with its reliance of historical theology to fashion contemporary theology. Overall, if you have an interest in anabaptism in the modern world then this is an excellent resource, not necessarily for the content but its encompassing survey of contemporary anabaptist theologies.

It can be resolved a little (but not completely) by clipping the cord to your shirt; however there is not clip provided so you'll have to improvise. I do like the sound and the size of buds provided fit great. I would not recommend buying these if you will be moving a lot while wearing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding earphones!","review":"I actually got these to hold me over while my Shure Ec4s were out being fixed (great support BTW).

I absolutely love these and the bas response is much better.True value for your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile for Common Use","review":"While the sound on these was decent, the durability was poor. Within a short time of normal use, the wires came loose from the earpiece. The set was ruined. I had to throw them away. I will not purchase V-MODA products again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best","review":"I am a professional sound system installer. I have been a front of house engineer for many years as well. We included these earphones in a recent trial to identify the best set of earbuds for the money. Our main use for earphones is to sell them to clients for on stage monitoring. They are typically used with wireless beltpacs or individual mixers on stage. We were looking for something under $200 retail.We tried the Sony MDR-J10, the standard Ipod, the v-Moda Vibe and the Future Sonics M5.The Future Sonics had the smoothest, most even response, a pleasure to use. They also came with many earpiece options. The bass on these is everything you want.The v-moda were our second choice, after the required 12 hour break in period. They also came with many ear piece options. These are more harsh on the high end and not quite as much bass as the Future Sonics. To be fair, they are a lower price point.The other earphones mentioned are not suitable for our use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish They Sounded as Slick as They Look","review":"In the spirit of keeping it short and sweet: These headphones look really slick and hip, right? Well, they do have THAT going for them. But the bass in them so overpowers everything else that it just ruins the listening experience. There are no highs and lows, vocals get lost, guitars get lost, everything is just clouded over by way too much bass.Also, after about 30 minutes the inside of my ears began to ache as there's only a thin piece of rubber protecting you from a little round nugget of hard metal.'Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while they lasted..","review":"Well, they sounded great while they lasted.. Which was less than two months. Left earbud stopped working after about 20 hours of use. Too bad too, thought they were comfy and sounded decent.

They were well worth the price as well! They sound just as good (if not, then better) then the great big over the ear headphones! They are very small, and they look great! Also very, very duribal! I've worn mine 24/7 for like the past two or three months, and they are still in perfect condition! They are also the most confortalble headphones I've ever worn.

It is very easy to use: Put the water in, turn it on, make sure it's at your desired temperature, and let it do it's work. It has a cycle to dechlorinate the water as it's heating, and 3 temperature settings (boiling, tea, and formula.)It has readouts for both Celsius and Farenheit, although the display itself shows the current water temp in Celsius.My only complaints, which are pretty minor, are that it had to boil the water before taking it down to the desired temperature (but you can catch it while it's on it's way up), and the fac that there's no \\"off\\" button, only unplugging it. But the way it unplugs is very easy (it has a magnetic coupler on the side) and it also has a handle for making cleanup very easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more sterno!","review":"After using this fondue maker, we have completely converted to electric.

Heck one of them is the same, who's bright idea was it to put yet ANOTHER version of \\"Nothing Between Us\\" on this CD?The sad part is that some people will actually like this repetitive crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Technical","review":"This book is great for anyone that wants to study the title. Very detailed. Sometimes it seems to contradict, but I think it because of how its written. Obviously these are views of the writers and not that of all Pentecostals, but probably most. This book cleared a lot of things up for me and some friends. Technical and in depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foundations of Pentecostal Theology, practical","review":"I am in the process of reading this book and dispite all the other reviews, it amazes me how super-spiritual everyone seems to be. I am a lay preacher and I find this book gets down to the bones of theological understanding, in terms the average person can understand. For everyone who thinks just being a believer is enough, you haven't had to witness to very many unbelievers if you think you don't need a good understanding of what you believe. I find this book a good conservative view of what I believe and have experienced through my Christian walk and helps to cut off the fleshy stuff that takes away from God's glory in the Spirit Filled(Pentecostal) world. Give these men some credit for a good practical book. To bad it's out of print. Some modern Theologians could use a good book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Duffield and van Cleave fail short","review":"Although Duffield and van Cleave's work is a due overview of pentecostal theology, it is also rather superficial, if not to say a bit simple.I would recommend the work to anyone who is interested in a clear overall pentecostal theology. However, the book could be improved by a lot. Opinians are given as 'biblical facts' and hardly any accountance is given for the philosophical, theological and cultural demise of Christianity for the last three centuries."},{"rating":"2","title":"In the top tier of Mahler 3's","review":"Why all the hubub about Horenstien's 3rd? It's been bested by more than one conductor over the years and MTT is one of them. The energy contatined in this performance makes this recording more than a match for Horenstien's version and just about all others as well. If you want a recording of this symphony (and why wouldn't you?) this recording, Salonen's recording with the LAPO, or Lopez-Cobos's with the Cincinnati Symphony are the ones to go with. Horenstien's is very good, but this is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tilson Thomas' Mahler 3rd","review":"What makes this the BEST recording of this most difficult of all Mahler symphonies to perform is the rendition of the first movement. Where other conductors will start the symphony slowly and meekly, Tilson Thomas kicks in the hyper-jets and lets it fly. The sound is expansive and well recorded, and he keeps the piece moving like no other conductor's recording I have yet heard. I would love to hear him conduct Shostakovich;s 4th!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING CD-R !!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I recently purchased this item from ArkivMusic. The item was listed as new. To my surprise and disappointment I received the item and it was actually CD-R's. This was not disclosed by the seller or stated in the Amazon listing. I believe the seller is ultimately responsible for stating this but I know that Amazon does provide this information for some of the CD-R music on demand products it list, but not this one. My initial contact with ArkivMusic has ended badly with the same music statement I've received before from other sellers pulling this switch but that not the point, which they're well aware of and I'm sure it will end badly. I thought the folks looking at this product should at least know that they could be receiving something other than they thought. A CD-R is not equivalent to a standard manufactured CD - I'm a 100% sure of that. Put it in your car over the summer and see if it plays at the end, I doubt it. Buyers beware of ArkivMusic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Diamonds in the Mud","review":"This video leaves much to be desired. It has too much inane narration and not enough music. Rather than presenting the entire concert only excerpts from a few songs are included. Interviews with the performers are often insightful but also laughable. Cheesy psychedelic visual effects were added that obscure the performance so don't expect to be able to carefully observe the band in action. Although this video is mostly disappointing, some great music and great playing does occasionally shine through the mud. Lower your expectations and you'll probably find it entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Casino Indians of California","review":"I am disappointed in \\"California Indian\\". A great crew of Native Actors (Gil Birmingham, Julia Jones, Gary Farmer, Mark Boone Jr and even Dennis Banks), reinforce non-natives view points that all California Indians have casinos and that our tribal councils are medicore at best.My hope for the video was to tell the story of California Indians 1848 to present. Since we are left out of all the other Historical videos concerning Native/United States relations this could have been a real view of History to teach NON-Natives why there are Tribes/reservations/rancheria's.... and that we all do NOT have casinos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"Very good looking book with a great story.

Wesley Thompson writes from the heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this one doesn't cut it","review":"As an overview of the career of Garcia and the Dead this book pretty much gives it all, and that's about it. There is no real insight into the character of the man. What were his demons? What drove such a creative and clearly intelligent man to such self destruction? He was one of the most talented musicians of his generation, and his work was uniquely American in a way few if any others could match. The title implies that this will be explored in the book, but for the most part it is not. If you are familiar with the Dead, there is really nothing new here. Good as a reference book, but not for anything else.Blair is clearly unwilling to tell some uncomfortable truths (he claims the death of Brent Mydland was not a suicide, yet Jerry all but said it was in a 1991 Rolling Stone interview, and the circumstances certainly point that direction as well). I think the author is, in the end, too much of an insider to give a balanced and truly honest telling of this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one True American Band","review":"The Dead were Garcia and Garcia was The Dead. They are inseparatable. Jackson's book digs deeper into Garcia's life and that of the band than any other book on the same topic. Reaction to the dead was binary -- you either loved them or you hated them. This book is clearly for the former. The latter won't care and won't get it. We all still miss Jerry and The Dead. Jackson has forged an earnest and winning attempt so that we can remember him, and them outside their music -- which will live forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I have to read all his work!","review":"The interest this book garnered due its nomination for Thw Whitbread Award was well deserved. My only disappointment was that it didn't win.Set during the 80's it charts the rise of Solidarity. Begging the question 'Remind me, so who are the good guys again?'This is a very emtional, personal journey. I laughed all the way through but it has moments of such poignancy I was very mved too. Not in that fake kind of maudlin may, but the real kind of feeling; real people,live,traumas and laughter.Put down everything else and read this now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"This has got to be the worst recording of Faure's Requiem in existence. The tempo drags like a beached whale, the soloists can't find the pitch no matter how hard they try, and the timing of the orchestra has all the finesse of a two-year-old attempting to dance a tango. In short it's about as convincing as an Imus apology. Avoid this recording like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid it","review":"I cannot believe Columbia (now Sony) ever went to Japan to record Faure. Had they used adequate soloists, it would have been okay. The chorus handles their part quite well, despite serious diction problems. But the soloists are a disaster and the conducting is not at all in the style of Faure. The recording has been around for a very long time. It should have been deleted years ago. In the meantime, do not buy it. There are too many good versions out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic stuff for makers, players & listeners","review":"The book only contains about 35 pages of large type text, so don't expect much detail. The 5 or so pages on playing are really basic, only helpful to someone who knows absolutely zero about flute playing. The book only gives exact mathematical dimensions for making a pvc flute in G, which you can find at the author's website (www.markshep.com/flute). All other flute dimensions are given as 'about' & 'generally'. Nonetheless, the book provides a foundation for someone with a trained ear to be able to start making simple flutes, refining thier skills through trial & error. Overall the information in the book is more than worth the price. As a half hour read it is well worth reading by everyone interested in making, playing or listening to flutes. The knowledge gained versus the money & time invested ends up being a real bargain. The book also provides resources on where to go for more and more detailed information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good detailed book, but only for transverse flutes","review":"The charts and pages on every aspect of making your own fluteare all here, with explanations of WHY, and several optionsfor finishes, materials, keys, etc.If you're going to make anything OTHER than a transverse flute,such as a Shakuhachi or recorder, look on the Web for supplemental material,but still I'm still glad I got this as a reference.

The only thing I didn't like is that the pick part broke off when I was using it to open a can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small, poor quality, but cheapest out there","review":"I bought this at an athletics store due to the price - it was the least expensive one there. Boy was it a waste of a purchase.The shovel is very small, about 35% smaller than my SOG entrenching tool.What I dislike most about it however was the handle. The upper handle unscrews for a compact fit, but the threading was terrible.It took several tries to line it up and when I did, it felt shoddy and unstable. Also when taking it apart, it was very stiff and took a considerable amount of effort to undo.There are much better entrenching tools out there.

It has been sturdy enough and large enough for my husband to use to dig a small hole as well.If you are looking for a larger shovel that is more shovel like in size, this is not it.

He attempts to convey a sense of depth to his poetry, rather than write from his heart. The result is a series of poems that serve better as examples of decorated shallowness, or simply pretense.Specifically in his writing, LeCuyer abondons the use of proper grammar. While this is perfectlly acceptable for poetry, he makes no clear distinction that it is done for poetic effect.LeCuyer's excessive deluges into the pervesely erotic serve no purpose to the enhancement of the poem, but simply as shock value.Basically, LeCuyer's work lacks one true thing: honesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Profoundly disturbing","review":"This is one of the strangest poetry collections I have ever come across.

It is nothing but a collection of raunchy and foul crap. Forgive my harshness, but I speak with conviction (something LeCuyer lacks)...LeCuyer tends to discuss sex excessively. With no clear purpose, he attacks femminity with a force that closely resembles rape. Personally, putting the book down made me feel like I had just come home after being assaulted.In fact, LeCuyer IS a poetic rapist: he has no clear reason as to why he is doing this, but he knows it will give him power over his victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thank God he has only written one book","review":"People like Jim LeCuyer should not be allowed to influence minds - young or old.

Simon Furman have written crap since he first took over writing duties on the original Transformer comics. I never like his ways in how he write the myths in Transformers lore in every Transformers comics. Furman was always bad luck when it comes to every Transformers comics he wrote. The ending to the Generation 2 was a real downer which everyones wondered what will happened next if it continues.

The software gives you NO options, starts loading up everything & anything on your pc while you sit & wait & wait. Once loaded, I had programs that would not work properly plus it was very noisy when scanning a paper. I uninstalled it & my programs are functioning perfectly once more. HP, listen up, something is wrong with this model.

Also the film tray shows on some of my documents as well you would think they would give you something to cover the film tray when not in use. I did like the way XP found this scanner right away with no disks or software. I have a cannon scanner I just got a few months ago but it is limited because it is not compatible with XP with out cannons software, The cannon was so bad that I purchased this one all in all I like it does a great job glad they still make just scanners for people who use laser printers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked previously owned scanner better","review":"I am very unhappy with my new scanner. My old scanner was very easy to use all I had to do was scan a picture and it showed up on the computer where I could then change the size and output and print it.

To anyone who enjoys Foxtrot (or comics like Foxtrot- witty word play, social commentary without lecture) this book would make an excellent addition. The strips dealing with Paige's obsession with Orlando Bloom, and Jason's horror at the possibility of having to share his Tolkein passion with his sister, is humor at its best (especially as an appreciative fan of both Tolkein and Orlando Bloom).I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Foxtrot comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"This is the greatest anime every made.

For a DVD release, this is a excellent deal, getting a total of 9 episodes instead of the traditional 4-5, with the only con being that there is no English voice overs. However, the Japanese voice acting is excellent so you won't be missing out on anything, and the subtitles are near perfect. The DVD extras are to be expected, with the standard clean opening and closing videos.The CD included includes the complete tracks for the opening and closing themes, 'Sarairo Days' and 'Happily Ever After', as well as the TV size versions of 'Sorairo Days' for both halfs of the anime. For a extra $10, this may not be the best investment. What I like about it though is it comes in its own jewel case complete with the lyrics sheet in Japanese (Romanization) and in translated English."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new mecha that should bring in fans","review":"I'll keep this relatively short. If you buy these volumes of Gurren Lagann now you'll be saving tons of money instead of buying the dubbed versions that will no doubt come in more volumes, but I digress. The show stars Simon, Kamina, and Yoko. Their fates inter twine in the first episode and for about 9 episodes or so after that. The first volume is filled with tons of shenanigans that will make you want more up until the last two episodes that will no doubt cause any fan to tear up at least at some point. The DVDs themselves are very bare bones so to get the episodes out faster for those you desire a subtitled version instead of a dubbed version. Either one will probably be great but once again if you want to watch this show and prefer subtitles then buy this series right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gurren Lagann Review","review":"So This Was A Pretty Good Buy.

Moss was open to what came along and made the most of the opportunity to meet interesting people and see interesting things.

In this serial, for example you will see such things as gangsters hanging out their laundry to dry and engage in knockabout fights that are so outrageously phoney as to evince a smile. Jack Holt as our hero reminds one of Fearless Fosdick and engages in tough guy dialogue with, most clearly, his tongue in his cheek. Serial puristS probably hate the serials of James Horne, understandably. Horne must have figured with his limited budget and resources that his approach might not have made better serials but at least they would be different."},{"rating":"1","title":"Advertised product not available","review":"Very disappointing that items are advertised and then not available.

I suspect the reason is that the series about women in prison is now projected to be transplanted to American television complete with an American setting.

In any case, this show has great plot lines, characters you really end up caring about, GREAT villans and (yes, boys) a few girls in love.I can't wait to get the DVD and see the entire series as a whole (I've missed a few episodes from the first season).

Other than now having a book on my bookshelf that jumps out to other parents(because of color and paw print), and a work related book that my kids like the cover of; this book offers no real substance.This book was such a commercial for the Blues Clues show, merchandise, traveling live show, food, etc. that Diane Tracy and her buddies at Blues Clues should have paid me.She really needed to gain her objectivity before writing.

This book was immoral in that no authorial comment addresses these prejudices.If multiple screws, infedilities, drug taking, and little interpersonal attraction forms your life, then you'll enjoy this book. I finished the book, relieved that most of the characters had died - it was just a pity that they couldn't have taken the AIDS scourge to its death bed as well.

A man will do anything for his family and the trapper proved that, The indian has hes reasons for kidnapping the daughter, and it all comes to light near the end of the movie, No I'm not going to spoil it and say too much more. Watch or buy and relax and enjoy. I loved the concept of the story very unusual a few things in the show that makes you sit up and listen that makes this movie stand out more than others."},{"rating":"2","title":"uncle loves","review":"my uncle loved this dvd and it was a good gift he loved to ad to his collection of films not for everyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD MOVIE","review":"THIS WAS AN OLD MOVIE AND I LOVE IT WHEN I FOUND IT ON DVD I WAS EXCITED..SHIPPING WAS FAST AND THE MOVIE PLAYED PERFECT..IN GREAT CONDITION.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Grammar for 20 years!!","review":"I have been teaching in a private school for 20 years. I have been using this workbook since the beginning. It still holds up as the most solid workbook for language arts skills. My original teacher's edition is falling apart, but continues to be my most used workbook. Its approach is simple and straight-forward. It is easy for the students to understand and provides logical sequence of language arts skills. The children enjoy working from this book better than any of the other various publishers I use. I have used these practice pages for fourth graders through high school students. It is what the title says: Easy Grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"grammar made manageable","review":"This book is a great tool for teaching grammar to my active boys who hate \\"dumb bookwork\\". It sounds like they have bad attitudes, but they are bright, hands-on learners. Grammar has always seemed abstract to them. The lessons are clear, yet concise. The exercises re-enforce the concepts without excessive repetition. For my boys who hate to write, this workbook is easier for them to \\"swallow\\" while they learn basic grammar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful addition to English course...","review":"The only thing missing from this curriculium is a writing course.

In doing so he has provided a ground-breaking handbook for those of us who want and need to hear from professionals who understand the challenges faced by children and adults in religious environments. The book is easy to read, brief enough to hold even the ADHD interest and designed in such a way that the reader can skip around and still make sense of what's written.I am impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great OEM type product","review":"Great product, fits like a glove. I simply matched up the trimmer head I have and the ones listed and it fits great. If you have a model listed and you buy a replacement head from Home Depot, it will likely not fit as the common ones they sell there are for newer models, and not the older styles like this is.

In the original it was exquisite and original Technicolor dye transfer prints will be pristine in colour quality whether scratched and worn from use or not.The DVD I received is clearly a transfer from video - and an extremely poor video at that. The sound is poor and the image quite appalling - to the point where we gave up after about 5 minutes viewing.The way that colour elements break down and separate is nothing to do with the DVD, the age of the film, or the Technicolor release print process - the colour layers cannot separate - it is however a classic indication of poor quality video as an intermediate in the transfer process.This DVD is an insult to any purist interested in seeing a milestone in movie production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Faded public domain copy","review":"This film is shown from time to time on TCM.

I've always imagined how The GZA would come off on a Primo track. The remix doesn't include new verses but Primo aptly provides a track that supports both Afu's and GZA's lyrical styles. The bouncy horn loop and drum break tandem merge perfectly with the rhyme schemes of the two MC's. The GZA's sharp on-beat, off-beat flow is air tight whether it's over True Masters more wicked track or Primo's snappier remix. Afu's straightforward delivery is less impressionable but it's still effective. The contrasting feel of both mixes is what makes this such a hot plate. Pick it up and listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the finest","review":"This album is a must-own for any fan of flamenco guitar. Manolo Sanlucar, along with Paco de Lucia, is at the forefront of modern flamenco playing. Tauromagia, is in my opinion, his best album. It combines the best of his early traditional playing with some of the wonderful melodic ideas and colours later in his carer. The writing is very strong, and while incorporating many layers, choirs, effects, etc, it is far from overproduced. His playing is very tasteful and poetic and his technique obviously beyond question.

The 15% that had to do with formwork and concrete was basically useless to me because it was basically a translation of German to English, using German and European standards, nothing that we can use here in the US.I was disappointed never the less and have returned the book. If Amazon had said something about this book was intended for Germans who read English, I would have not purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, cheap film","review":"I purchased one of these at my local dive shop to use on a dive trip. The clear case works well and is durable. I like the large view finder attached to the top and the easy to use controls. The camera is kind of cheap, but does work. First thing anyone should do is change out the film that comes with it. It is the worst! The film is made in Europe some place. Drop in some Kodak, Fuji, Polaroid, etc...Use anything but the junk that comes with it. Throw it out immediately! Only seven of the twenty-seven pictures I took came out and some were dis-colored. This unit is good if you don't want bring your digital camera or don't want to incur the expense of a digital camera for underwater use. I only gave this two stars beacuse of the film. Shop around for the best price. I found mine for $14.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was waterproof, BUT........","review":"I purchased and used this camera in September and the picture quality is what you would expect for paying under $20.

I then threw the camera away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snap Sights 35mm camera.","review":"This thing is a hunk of crap.

Also, could not see a clear window of what was being snapped- so the several rolls of 35 mm film that were taken all came out horrible.

Feltsman makes a few cuts in both pieces and plays the written cadenza in the first movement of the concerto, but these cuts make perfect sense and do not disrupt (but rather enhance) the flow of the works.Mehta leads the Israel Philharmonic in a splendidly balanced and performed accompaniment. The orchestra especially shines in the exposed sections in the second movement of the concerto and the quiet portions of the Rhapsody. An excellent performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the ...???","review":"I heard a bit of this on the radio and was intrigued.

It's sad to see such a wonderful piece of music be so strangely interpreted. The wonderful, fiery 3rd movement is reduced to what seems to be almost random emphasis -- the amazing melodic thread through it is completely lost. My favorite version of the 7th is Anthoni di Bonaventura's on the Sine Qua Non label which is apparently not in production anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Performance of these peices I have ever heard!!!!","review":"The tone throughout the peice is nonexistant. Has this man ever heard of phrasing? He is always over shooting where he is capable of giving good performance. The Finale on the 7th is perhaps the worst peice of pedaled garbage ever to have oozed out of a piano. He plays way too fast for his technique and still slower and less rhythmically coherent than any other recording I have heard. For the love of God, don't spend your money on these blemishes.

Each drink gets several chapters, and the chapters are arranged chronologically. Thru each chapter, the author shows how the combination of human ingenuity and trial-and-error led to the discovery of a certain drink, and how the spread of that drink mirrored social changes. A good example cited by the book is Britian's policy towards China because of tea, and the ensuing opium wars. The book moves briskly, and is good at showing history from multiple points of view. All told, a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow and nothing new","review":"I thought that the book moved rather slowly and didn't really provide a whole lot of information or insight.

This is not great O'Farrell \\"An Utterly Impartial History of Britain or 2000 Years of Upper-class Idiots in Charge\\" by any means.Author seriously pushes a silly theory and supports is with a rather biased selection ofhistorical facts.Simple example - he ignores the fact that Bible is considered as a reliable historical source at least since the nineteen century archeological discoveries, and ignores the fact that Bible is entirely \\"wine\\" culture a 1000 years before Greeks, beer is mentioned only twice, while wine and vineyards are in every chapter. Then he goes on to claim that the \\"Last Supper\\" (which was actually a Passover ritual with 4 cups of vine) was a strongly influenced by a cult of Bacchus...Come on - eating Guinea Pig at the Last Supper in Cuzco Cathedral is at least funny:[...]Enough said - but compare what he writes about coffee with other books, at least \\"Quick Silver\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"The author has no knowledge of verbs besides \\"to be;\\" consequently, the prose sits like flat beer.

The only downfall is that after I read it, I had to write an essay about for it for school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breezy as a Nightcap","review":"Great History even if told through liquid refreshments. One is struck by how history can be viewed as the enrichment of previous experiences, inventions and ideas into greater and greater quality....witness the advent of language to the alphabet to temple reports to fiction to electronic media. In this case it is the liquids we drink and the fascinating way they were discovered, produced and how they changed society. We in the West are well-acquainted with these whereas some parts of the world (Muslim areas) banned many of these and thus did not undergo (for good or bad) the various social changes they wrought.The work is short, simple, pleasing and - except for a couple of quibbles - factual.

There's no preaching, no tiresome political drone - just a story of everyday people who have remembered what liberty is supposed to mean, and recognized those who are trying to take it away. With that recognition comes action, much as it did in 1775. I read the entire book in two sittings, and I'm glad to see that the sequel is already out!

Like Chris Ware's JIMMY CORRIGAN, it begins by introducing the reader to reminders of traditional comic book superheros, and although the rest of the book is anything but a stereotypical comic, it retains various aspects of superhero comic books. It's wonderfully dramatic and fantastic, transitioning from a story situated in reality to one that's dominated by mysterious deaths, apocalyptic fears, and taboo relationships. With BORING, Clowes shows life as at once dreamy, vacuous, adventurous, and painful. He ends up with a moving tale that is deeply structured and well worth the hour or two it takes to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak but interesting","review":"This is one of those books you feel you HAVE to enjoy . . . because if you don't, someone will say \\"You just don't get it.\\"Honestly, there's nothing to get. Dan Clowes tells a story that almost makes sense. It feels like he made it up as he went along, so each chapter seems disconnected from the last. The end is contrived and plot threads are left dangling.But it's not all bad. He art is tight, complimenting the claustrohic and static story very well. The book makes you think and wonder --- you'll have fun trying to put it all together, even if you fail.And best of all, it might introduce you to the wild and crazy world of grown-up comic books, the kind of comic books that Fantagraphics publishes. If this one doesn't satisfy you, there's always Love & Rockets, Joe Sacco, and Chris Ware."},{"rating":"2","title":"eccentric but interesting","review":"Dan Clowes creates characters and worlds that exist only in his mind ,but they are interesting nonetheless. He lacks the all out energy of an action packed entertainer like Miller and his books lack the unified tone of JIMMY CORRIGAN and I consider both Miller and Ware to be superior to Clowes but he is one of our best cartoonists and DAVID BORING is fine work even though the story is too surreal and cynical to have much of a pontless."},{"rating":"1","title":"David Boring","review":"I was so unhappy with this book that it was immediately returned.

I haven't had them long enough to comment on battery life or range, sorry.But, not being able to share address books or answer messages from the phones is a glaring oversight in the included features of this phone.George"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing a major feature","review":"I bought this phone because it seemed to have everything at a great price. I've had it for 2 weeks now, and I've noticed some major flaws:1. The phone DOES NOT HAVE speed dial! This is the feature I use most often when making international calls. I can't believe Motorola didn't provide a basic feature like this one.2. The person on the other end cannot hear me on occasion for a few seconds - and I'm less than 10 feet from the base.3. The buttons are really small and hard to press.On the positive side, the phone looks cool and has a lot of other cool features. Motorola just didn't get the basics right with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy 5.8 GHz if you live in a stucco house.","review":"I was impressed with this phone until I walked outside the house 20 feet away from the base unit and lost connectivity. I called Motorola and they said it is due to the stucco environment. It would have been nice to know this before I bought the phone. There are other stuctural components that also interfer with the phone's range, so I would check with Motorola on limitations before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Outgoing Message Quality","review":"I received this as a gift and am very disappointed with the quality of the outgoing answering machine message. While everyone dislikes the sound of their own voice, this recording microphone is so substandard, that my voice sounds like I'm transmitting from the bottom of the ocean.The controls are very cumbersome as well. One has to push through 5 menu buttons to reset the call counter.I'm returning this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motorola needs help with this one!!","review":"We purchased this phone a year ago from Target and have had problems since the beginning with it cutting in and out during conversations. We can be sitting in the same spot, near the base and it always happens if we are on the phone for more than a few minutes. We have addressed the problem with Motorola, went through trouble shooting options with no success. They sent us a new phone (at our expense to ship the original phone back). Unfortunately this phone gives us the same problems!! Motorola blames our phone company...we live in a major metropolitan area with a large provider - it's not the case! I believe they were one of the first to come out with the 5.8Ghz phones and they need to improve their product as the competion is much more plentiful now. Rather than fight with the phone any longer.....I'm pitching it. MY RECOMMENDATION: DON'T BUY THIS PHONE - not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works, it really works!","review":"Although some people have reported isues with this phone, I love it. It is the only cordless unit that we have had in four years that works in our house. It is clear as a bell, the answering machine works just fine, the range is great. The coolest feature is the speaker phone that is built into the hand set (also clear as a bell). It is great for letting all the kids talk to the grandparents, or for just placing on the counter because your hands are full making PBJs. Overall, this phone has improved the quality of my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"MD681","review":"Best in its field. I've tried other cordless phones, only to be disappointed. The md681 and its' handsets offer quality and performance that is staggering. The phones' range from the base simply blows my mind, mine reaches beyond 200 feet. The speakerphone system is phenominal. I can be 10-12 feet away from the phone and still carry on a quality conversation. The answering system could improve somewhat on voice quality, but overall I was so impressed that I ordered another handset to go with it. P.S. the backlit keys are a real plus and one feature that I was particularly looking for in a cordless"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I've found the MD681 to be an excellent phone on the whole. Pluses: nice looking, friendly operation (the opposite of the Siemens Gigaset), great handset speakerphone, excellent range, no WiFi interference. Minuses: poor answering machine sound quality (muffled), no phonebook tranfer between handsets/base.Overall, a much friendlier phone than Siemens, more attractive then Uniden (I have the Uniden at work, it's fine), less bulky than Panasonic. I'm happy and will buy a few more MD handsets to outfit my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Phone !","review":"As I always use to have either AT&T; or Panasonic phones.

I finally dumped a crappy 2.4 ghz uniden that was screwing up our wireless network, and so far no disconnects, dropped signal etc. In other words, i haven't experienced the 5.8/2.4 ghz issue described in some of the other reviews. The phone is good size, batt charge lasts, the handsfree speakerphone option on both the base and handset is nice and works pretty well, and the answering machine is muuuuuuch better than on the crappy uniden we curbsided (yes!).no wireless interference from my experience over the past monthswhat is buggy is the keypad: you can't dial too fast -- the numbers won't register.another plus: the speakerphone feature is sweet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phone broke 2 weeks after the warranty ended","review":"So, I liked this phone just fine while it worked.But it broke 2 weeks after the end of the 1 year warranty. Now the handset can't find the base, and it beeps approximately 5 times/minute while looking for its electronic mate (which it finds about 1/2 the time). When it can find the base, one can speak on the phone.Obviously I have only 1 data point to offer, and so can't make meaningful generalizations about product durability. But our Panasonic cordless system (bought june 2002) still works fine. And for an original $110 cost, I did think the Motorola would work for longer than 54 weeks w/out breaking. (Works out to $2/week in cost)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sturdy product Good features at great price","review":"This is a well built model that Motorola has designed. I liked answering machine, speaker phones are good on both hand set and the base. Dual key pad helps.

The quality of calls, coverage, and answering machine were very good. However, exactly 15 months later, the replacement handset went bust.

However, it was something I would have lived with, but the answer machine picking up was a huge issue. The answer machine would pick-up randomly, sometimes yes and sometimes no. I returned the phone for a new one with the same issues. The technical support was a TOTAL joke!! Not only did the persons answer the support lines not understand the issue, but had no clue how to troubleshoot it. I asked for a Tier 2 support number and was given a number that was dis-connected!! Called back and was given a number to a adult only phone service!!

Ok, the receiver hand-feel wasn't as good as the Panasonic ... but the battery life is much better than Panasonic's.Alas, it stopped working just after 1 year from the date of purchase. The receiver stopped communicating w/ the base, so no calls. More pitifully, it was 11 months from the date of receipt, given Amazon.com left it on back order for 1 month in 2004. Which Motorola decided to count against my warranty time ... even thought the phone wasn't in my possession, nor in use.Anyway, the phone is probably ok for the current $20 - $30 price (post-rebate).

The second one has a different problem, one which I also had with the first. While you are speaking, frequently the sound drops off and the person on the other end cannot hear you, even if you are standing still, near the base. It is extremely annoying. You also do not realize this is happening until the person on the other end lets you know they cannot hear you anymore. I have had this phone since last September and I'm going to replace it because of this problem.All of the other features on the phone work fine, but if callers cannot hear you, what good is it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Motorola MD681 is great!!!","review":"I bought this item a month and a half ago and I haven't had any problems with it to date. I previously owned one of the Panasonic models (sorry, forgot the model number). It was also a combo phone with answering machine, speakerhone, caller ID and other great features. The problem was the battery always kept dying after a couple minutes usage. I even bought a new battery through Panasonic hoping this would fix the problem but it was short-lived. So after only getting usage from my Panasonic as a answering machine I decided to get this one from Amazon. It's been great -- no battery problems what so ever! It's very easy to set up and use as well! Too bad the Amazon sale price is no longer available though for those of you who missed out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Displeased after three months of use","review":"It has taken some time to discover a couple of very annoying problems with the answering system. If you purchase this machine, I highly recommend that you do NOT try to delete any messages before you have listened to all messages on the machine. I have on several occasions deleted messages I had not yet listened to attempting to delete the message I had just listened to. Yesterday I found out that you can also lose a message that someone left if you pick up the receiver before the telephone call has been disconnected (i.e. the caller had hung up, but the call had not electronically terminated and turned off the answering machine).

After navigating the perils and pitfalls of the Motorola warranty I have decided to simply purchase another phone and cut my losses before this experience costs me more than it already has. If you are looking for a shoddy (at best) product with little to no support from the seller or manufacturer then this is the phone for you. If, however, you are not excited about wasting your time and money then save yourself the aggravation and avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed Anwering Machine!!!","review":"I've always bought Panasonic cordless phones but I thought I would give Motorola a shot. Let me say that it was a big mistake. The phone reception is okay with a slight hiss in the backround but the major disappointment is the answering machine. If the caller hangs up before they leave a message the answering machine doesn't hang up and stays recording, which basically sounds like an annoying busy signal and will stay that way until at least five minutes or until you pick up the receiver and turn it on and off. You shouldn't have to do this with todays technology and for a two hundred dollar phone this is unacceptable. I'm stuck with the phone because I paid too much for this.

Finally, I decided to bite the bullet and get a 5.8 GHz phone, and I will NEVER go back to a 2.4 GHz. This phone can be in almost any orientation and distance from the base station, and still works flawlessly. My only two complaints are that the answering machine microphone muffles and modulates the sound in such a way that the annoucer sound like a quiet, depressed person and the user interface is counterintuitive. With such outstanding reception. Motorolla should spend some extra money on a better answering machine microphone. The best way to change your annoucement is to call your answering machine and configure it using remote access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but has its own flaws","review":"I have been using this phone system for last 2 weeks and should say am totally impressed by the simplicity and quality of the product.

Before this Phone I had Sony cordless phone followed by a Panasonic 900 MHz and I must say this phone is far superior then the others.Some annoying features as mentioned by other reviewers also:a) Phone book has to be entered in each handset, base phone separately.b) If you pick up a call on one handset, the other handset and base phones show as new calls.c) Deleting a message from voice mail is a bit tricky and you can end up deleting all messages instead of a selected one.If you are ok with the above limitations then this phone is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"I bought it by looking at the different features it have.

However, we were sorely disappointed. The book is extremely superficial in it's approach to marriage. The book's main point seems to be \\"pray about everything and you'll be just fine\\" when even the Bible doesn't say that. Unfortunately this seems to be a theme in Christian books: a list of things you shouldn't do, a list of things yo should do, but very little by way of practical advice on accomplishing those things. Additionally, this book leaves little room for disagreement or discussion of different concepts relating to marriage. Finally, the book does very little to actually provide advice on sex, finances, conflict resolution or child rearing, four of the most important components in a marriage. I would keep looking, rather than buy this particular book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a great book for newly engaged couples.

But I remembered seeing it before when I was about one-fourth thru the story.Nevertheless, I enjoyed seeing it again; I love the Jeremy Brett versions of the Sherlock Holmes stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. They seem a bit more true to the tone of the original Doyle stories, partly 'cause their depictions of Dr. John Watson aren't like Nigel Bruce's dopey version in the Basil Rathbone versions of the famous fictional detective (altho' Rathbone made a terrific Holmes:).The video arrived in my mail a bit ahead of the deadline -- always a good touch. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware - high failure rate","review":"Two of the three units at the store did not function.

You can't help but cheer for Jimmy and Nanci, who deserve a second chance.Happy Reading Lisa"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I bought this book because it was featured on Oprah.com. It is a let-down. Sure, the book focuses on how marriages go through ups and downs, but it becomes tiresome, what with the repetition on the same problems, and the idealistic reconciliation that seems forged, or at least exaggerated for the sake of selling more books perhaps.Actually, every marriage goes through bad patches. The bottom line is to rise above everything and focus on the good stuff that make you love each other in the first place. I personally find it hard to believe that the wife forgave the husband so readily the two times he cheated on her. What about feelings of mistrust, bitterness before hitting forgiveness?"},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"I love it, Ive had it for about 3 months now and still listen to it alomst every day.

I doubt that anyone with only a mild interest in the band would enjoy this very much.That said, being a hardcore Sublime fan, this is the most amazing thing to hit the record stores in a long time. This is like the Beatles Anthology for Sublime. It is packed with unreleased, live, rare and demo stuff. It also includes an actual unreleased studio track (likely mixed after Nowell's death) called \\"Foolish Fool\\".

He started daycare last October and every two weeks from then through April of this year he came down with one virus after the other. To compound matters he also has mild asthma. Fish oils were one of the recommendations that I came across so I decided to purchase Scott's Emulsion for him. The week that the product arrived he was in week three of a deep chest congested cough. I was using Flovent and Albuterol as suggested by his pediatrician but as usual they didn't seem to help. About little less than a week after giving him the two teaspoon daily which is what they suggest for his age I noticed that the cough wasn't there anymore. I ran out of his prescribed meds and so far I haven't refilled them. I am so relieved. So my plan is to stock up in preparation for the fall and winter season.

To my parents surprise, they waited and I never got either. Now that I'm older and barely take vitamins my allergies are horrible to the point of having to have my tonsils and adenoids removed at the age of 27.

They are much more durable than the plastic Dymo labels I used to use, and they stick forever.This will seem hard to believe, but I am still using the ordinary C-cells that came with the Brother in the '90's.

I bought a homemade fan VHS online that has much better footage with the whole band including Stotts. My husband and I were also wondering where the rest of the band is...it seemed to us too like they tried to edit out Stotts! This is a travesty!!!

I will try to find that other video that someone mentioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting and shameful","review":"Richie was deliberately edited out of the Damned video and just about every single clip on the disc. There must be some seriously bad blood between the producers of the disc and Richie - with him being edited out of clips and his playing ability slammed constantly. It was sickening.

Truly a sad spectacle."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Stotts, What A Joke!","review":"After looking forward to the release of this dvd, I was as bitterly disappointed as most of the reviewers here. To slam Richie Stotts and not accord him the respect he deserves is the equivalent of the surviving members of Queen slamming Freddie Mercury for his falsetto. Unthinkable! Yet, it happens on this dvd. Worse, the \\"producers\\" go out of their way to cut him out of every piece of video footage on the dvd. Yet, they also have the nerve to use his music throughout the dvd. Most appalling is editing Stotts out of the video for The Damned and calling it a \\"director's cut\\" Who are these people kidding? It gets one star for some good footage and the memories, but there is an alternative, there is a dvd called \\"Chainsaws, Shotguns and Rock and Roll\\" It is hard to find ( I got my copy on Ebay) but it is a great collection and a fitting tribute to the Plasmatics.

I just have shim, wheel, washer, cotter pin instead of washer, shim, wheel, washer, cotter pin. I don't really see the point of the first washer and it made just enough room to get the cotter pin in.One other thing that I wanted to point out is that there is a left and a right to the back axle supports.

He can sing any song like no other,and looks stunning too boot. I have been a collector of Classical Cds and videotapes for sometime now, but just recently purchased this CD, and I must say it is fabulous. Watson's voice is so powerful and deep, it's hard not to fall in love with him. The highlights of this CD are definitely Nella fantasia, Caruso, Miserere, Bridge Over Troubled Waters, Funiculi - funicula and Nessun Dorma. He is wonderful on all the selections, but particularly, is good in his duets with Brennan and Higgins. There are many classics on this CD, but they can be enjoyed by all ages (I am of college age). I recommend this CD so you can experience a brand new singer who sings with honesty, warmth, and power. Wonderful singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other CDs collect dust, not this one","review":"This album is one of the best CD's I've heard.

Russell Watson, contrary to all the hype, doesn't have a beautiful and powerful voice. In fact, his voice sounds really under-nourished. And his performances are so bland and uncommunicative! What a let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a believer now","review":"I cannot believe my ears when I heard this recording. I thought there were 3-4 different singers. Realizing its Watson by himself, you realize what a wonderful technique and style this singer has.I can believe all of these fans singing all sorts of praise for the singer for I am one of them now. In fact, I wonder if the critical reviewers have actually listened to this CD. If they have, they'd surely be aware of what a wonderful voice this singer has.I recommend people to listen to this CD and they will buy it. It's only through this way that they'll know what a wonderful singer Russell Watson is"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"I am no expert in classical music and will only comment on the popular songs. No, they are no good. In fact, very bad. The singer has no communicative power whatsoever. Just listen to \\"Bridge over troubled water\\". I cannot bear to hear such a pop classic being sung in such a bad way. Likewise, the other songs are not enjoyable at all. A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Amazing Russell","review":"Russell never fails to amaze me at the versatility in his music.For sure you are never bored listening to him sing. You stay with him thruout the entire album. I find him to be romantic and powerful in his delivery. Treat yourself to a musical tapestrycreated by Russell. To be so blessed with such talent, there is no one like Russell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not competitive","review":"In the cross-over market, this recording is not competitive as there're much better choices elsewhere in the likes of Andrea Bocelli and Alessandro Safina. The former has a more beautiful voice and a better-school technique while the latter possesses a stronger instrument and more personal charisma. Russell Watson cannot hold a candle besides these true artists. Disappointing recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too ambitious","review":"I tend to agree with those who said that Russell Watson was being too ambitious in tackling this type of program. The songs here require a first rate voice, a first rate technique and a first rate emotional response. Russell Watson can offer little of these here. The best part of the CD is its presentation. But that provides little compensation for the poor musical contents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!!","review":"A girlfriend gave me \\"The Voice\\" for birthday present. I have never liked 'opera' but after listening to Russell Watson I am converted. I have since purchased Encore and Va pensiero gives me shivers. Actually most of his songs give me shivers. I enjoy his change from pop to opera on both c.d.s.Highly recommended, play it loud when you are in the car or home alone...Fantastic..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A jack of all trades","review":"The singer here is obviously a jack of all trades. But even more obviously, he is the master of none. He is here being over ambitious and want to do everything. Unfortunately, he does nothing in the right style. I don't think he has sung any piece even adequately. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signor Watson un cantante non e (Mr. Watson is not a singer)","review":"He's a welder. And he should've stayed one. Alot of people who hate opera like this CD, but this doesn't mean Watson is 'bridging the gap' between classical and modern, it just means he's destroying everything about opera those people hate - it's grandeur, it's complexity, it's beauty. Don't buy this CD unless you hate opera and want it to die screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate Russell Watson Fan","review":"I think that Russell Watson has the most amazingly beautiful voice I have ever heard. He is to vocal music what Mozart is to instrumental. I listen to his music every day and never tire of it. I love all 4 of the new tracts on the U.S. version of Encore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring album","review":"Music appreciation is very subjective. There need be no justification for one's feelings. Therefore, I award 1 star to this album as I found the singing there to be absolutely boring, especially in those more popular songs. The voice itself isn't good either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice","review":"The title says it all. Russell Watson can do it all - whether it be classic opera to semi popular music. The voice goes seemlessly from Funiculi, Funicula to Bridge Over Troubled Water. When I first asked for this, I was a little weary because I do not own any other operatic CDs. However, I am not disappointed. After seeing Russell perform on Good Morning America I began to hope that I would hear more of him. Much to my enjoyment, I hear him every week on the opening credits of Enterprise. Who would have thought that a theme for a Star Trek show with words would be just as powerful and enjoyable as an instrumental piece. I only hope that Faith of the Heart will be on Russell's follow-up recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice","review":"Russell is incredible on the operatic material, but I was disappointed to find pop songs, which I hate, on the CD. However, even skipping those leaves one with some great material. If he would just stick to opera....anyone can sing pop, but it takes a special voice (which Russell has) to sing opera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful","review":"One of the most fantastic voices I have heard in a long time. Listening to this young master will make the hair on your body stand up. It is even better than his newer cd (Encore 4 1/2 stars)This young man will be a household name in two years. If you want to feel the power, emotion, feeling in his words, buy this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting","review":"I disagree with those who claim that Russell Watson sings every type of song with ease. Just listen to the final cadenza of 'La donna e mobile' where the Watson just tumbles down the stairs. I won't be surprised if those who fail to pick this up (or would not acknowledge it) would praise Watson to the skies. But I do hope that people can be more objective in reviewing this cd rather than praising it just because it is sung by the man they happen to like, whatever the reason.I have borrowed this cd from a friend, and both of us are of the same view: The singing here is pretty wretched and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the voice?","review":"As this cd is titled \\"The Voice\\", I expected a great voice on display. But where's the voice? I can't even find decent whining in here. Ghastly singing throughout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"Absolutely wonderful! So much variety on one CD. Russell's voice is extremely soothing and uplifting. I have ordered Encore and can't wait to get it. I am so glad I discovered this wonderful performer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The critics are more convincing","review":"Although it appears that fans of Russell Watson have given this recording unreserved praise in this website, I find the critics views to be much more convincing as their arguments are more objective and persuasive while the fans can often resort to the same limited vocabulary of praise.I, too, have listened to this recording and I don't like it, principally because of the singer's very bad technique and his all-purpose singing style. The voice itself is OK, although it's not of a remarkable quality. Parts of the singing are actually ludicrous as the singer struggles in vain to cope with the music. This is my view!"},{"rating":"1","title":"give me a break","review":"This is the biggest slap in the face to any opera singer I have ever heard. This man sounds simply awful. Anyone can listen to Russel Watson and then listen to any \\"working\\" opera singer and hear a difference.That difference would be known as a \\"technique\\", and a common knowlege of the language in which one is singing. This is a disgusting trend in the \\"classical\\" music industry that just makes me sick. Take any bozo off the street and throw him in front of a mike, and there you have it....the next caruso?? I don't think so. Shame on this record company...shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"Frankly, there's nothing very special in this CD. The singing here is just of karaoke quality - the voice itself is of unremarkable quality, there are transpositions and simplifications when the singer cannot handle the music, lots of artificial amplification and addition of intrusive resonance, poor voice-to-orchestral balance etc.. In fact, many ordinary people can sing much better than Russell Watson at the karaoke box. I regret having spent the full price of a CD to get something that is so ordinary and can be found everywhere in town."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in heart and soul","review":"Russell Watson's singing on this album lacks heart and soul. It leaves me cold. It is also technically defective and he sounds comical in some of the more embarrassing corners.I also don't like the choice of songs - they are unimaginative and most are far too taxing for Russell Watson's slender and poorly developed voice.That this album has proved to be rather good-selling cannot cover up the fact that this album is an artistic disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"A voiceless singer","review":"I can't see how Russell Watson and his record company can market this album and its predecessor by virtue of the singer's voice, for it is obvious from the recordings that Watson is quite a voiceless singer.Not only is his voice rather unpleasant, his vocal technique is extremely deficient. As a result, he resorts to all kinds of simplifications, making his accounts mere travesties of classical singer.None of the tracks on this album is appealing. At times, the singing is such that it is even disgusting from a musical point of view.I don't like this CD at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Singer in dire straits","review":"I don't care about the singing style. But if the singer cannot sustain or reach the notes, it is clear that he is in vocal dire straits and should not attempt the songs. It is not an enjoyable experience having to listen to a new singer in obvious vocal distress. It is not an honorable thing for record companies to release such recordings for public consumption, too. I found all the hype surrounding this new singer to be misleading. And having been misled, I must voice my complaints!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the voice?","review":"I, too, stumbled across Russell Watson on PBS while channel surfing one dark and stormy night. I was mesmerized. So, I searched for and purchased his CD. The CD ought to be titled, \\"The Orchestra\\". It's as though no one trusted The Voice to carry the production. Instead the overwrought production is constantly scribbling all over the vocals. I have been amazed in the past by Ennio Morricone's composing but in this case it is in direct conflict with and constantly obscuring the voice. The voice is simply not showcased, the orchestra and composer are. I hope that the next CD uses the orchestra to support and enhance the singer rather than to drown him out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't make the grade","review":"Frankly, this cd is one of the worst that I've heard. It simply doesn't make the grade, no matter from what perspective one views it. Clearly, some of those who are praising this cd to the skies haven't listened to many recordings. If they have, they'll realise that Russell Watson's voice and singing technique both leave much to be desired.It is also laughable for people to suggest that Russell Watson is good looking. I'm afraid that, for these people, the only tenors that they've heard of are the close-to-retirement Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras, people who began their careers 40 years ago. They certainly don't know that there're many young operatic singers nowdays who are much more handsome and good-looking than Russell Watson. Yes, Russell Watson doesn't even make the grade in terms of appearance.But of course, looks are not relevant when appraising a sound recording. I'm giving this cd 1 star for the singing of Russell Watson."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fresh Voice","review":"I enjoyed the albumn immensely. I'm an old opera buff, and while \\"opera snobs\\" may snub anyone who hasn't actually performed the whole piece on stage, I find Russell's mix of music totally refreshing. His Italian pronunciation needs work, but that will come with experience. His voice is amazing - I could listen to it for hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen first","review":"After reading the mostly positive reviews here, I decided to give this CD a try. Imagine my disappointment after I put on this CD only to find myself being assaulted by a raspy voice, technically disastrous singing and poor musicianship! None of my family members like it, and they accuse me of wasting my money on such trashy singing.I'd urge people to use their ears and try the CD out in record stores before buying it, Many of the good reviews are, in my opinion, misleading. Or borrow one from you friend to have a try first before dipping into your pocket. Or else, you may regret your rash decision, as I do."},{"rating":"1","title":"....HUH?.....","review":"I really think that Russell Watson is getting a little bit too much credit than he deserves...I personally feel that this CD is a pre-mature, unfortunate offspring of a short-lived hype. While he is backed by a touching story of his rise to the public eye, his voice is not the quality that I expect from an album what has such a title as \\"THE VOICE\\". He does have a pretty voice, but it's not the kind of voice that fits such arias as \\"Amor ti vieta\\" or \\"Nessun dorma\\"...both songs send chills down spines and cause goosebumps because it is well written music. Mr Watson will probably do well in crossover repertoire.. along with Sarah Brightman maybe, but in terms of being the new phenomenal tenor, he probably needs to allow his voice to mature some more, and in the meantime, listen to Pav, or Domingo, Carreras, Bjoerling, Gedda, or Wunderlich..just to see how it's really done.. In short, don't buy this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is the \\"Voice\\"","review":"The title of this recording is aptly fits this CD, for Watson has the voice, style, and excitement, as reflected on the great tracks of this recording.Watson is unbelievable with the consumate ease that he flows from pop to the demanding repertoire chosen for him. His technique and vocals are exceptional in performing the music.5 Stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"When I first heard Russell Watson I thought his voice was ok, but then I bought the CD. I fell in love with his amazing voice and wonderful talent that he has. I think he is very gifted, especially when he can sing a variety of songs. Give this CD a try it's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great listening","review":"After reading countless reviews both good and bad I finally went to get the \\"controversial\\" cd. Haha. Well it isn't as bad as some may think. As I am quite new in the genre of opera well all I can say is The Voice has given me delightful listening. Though there may be songs that seem a litle out of place well it adds colour to the album. Just give Russell some time to sort out his vocals and musical preferences and then you will be able to hear THE voice in the near future. (Wanted to give 4 and a half stars but couldn't!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo!","review":"I stumbled across Russell Watson on a local PBS channel, where they were broadcasting his debut US concert. After a few minutes, I picked my jaw up from the floor, called my father and said \\"You've GOT to hear this guy sing!\\" I grew up on classical/operatic music, and my father has introduced me to many singers from the early-mid 1900's. Russell Watson's voice is amazing! (My father agrees!) He communicates well, both vocally and visually. It's abundantly clear that he has great fun on stage, and that his heart is truly in his performances. He sings, and he stirs my heart and touches my soul. For me, that's what music is all about. He is a joy to watch and listen to. I hope he will make Detroit one of his concert stops."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely substandard","review":"This cd is severely substandard. The singing, the interpretation, the music arrangement and the acoustics are all unbelievably bad! It's unthinkable that the record company has passed it for release."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mishandled \\"Voice\\"","review":"Yes, Mr Watson has the raw material for an attractive operatic tenor, but by the evidence of this CD the vocal material is still quite raw indeed. If he pushes, strains, and bullies his music in the manner heard in this album much longer \\"the voice\\" will be a mere shadow of itself in no time. Compounding the problem are the ill-considered re-arrangements of original material. The distending of Giordano's miniature marvel \\"Amor ti vieta\\" - to point out just one example from so many - shows how much the singer and his music manager misunderstand the music! Pass on this problematic CD and rush out and buy Naxos' superior Bjoerling album for a taste of a \\"real\\" voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing singing debut","review":"Russell Watson is one of the brightest stars to come from England in years. Unfortunately, his VOICE album was never hyped in the US but the record sold millions in Europe and down under.Watson is the people's tenor. By this, I mean that his voice is powerful, popular with the public, and he has a wide gamut of voice range, secure intonation, and has different, amazing pop voices that can be smooth or raspy. He also has a broadway type voice too!!!His singing is wonderful on this initial CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tremendous debut CD","review":"Voice is a fantastic debut recording for this unusual and talented singer. Watson can sing opera in an operatic tenor voice, switch to a pop-rock voice in singing pop-rock songs, and finally, a beautiful smooth voice to sing pop songs. This guy is talented and you will get hours and hours of enjoyment listening to this CD. It's tremendous!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances!","review":"Congratulations to Decca for releasing such a wonderful recording. It's great that they have recognized such a talented singer as Watson. Russell Watson at present has the voice, technique and interpretative talent to perform any kind of music. No wonder his performances here are so great.I highly recommend it to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful CD","review":"This recording is exceptional in many ways. Watson's singing is terrific, the musical selections are varied and great, and the orchestration wonderful. As a result, the CD is perfection.A delightful CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A voiceless singing","review":"I'm wondering what \\"voice\\" the advertisements are trumpeting in connexion with this cd. As I can see and hear, there's no voice at all that is of any exceptional quality. Instead, I find a weak and poorly trained voice barely survively in some rather demanding music. I suppose that this recording is intended as a vocal joke, but as a serious album of singing, this simply cannot do."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer without much voice","review":"The title of this recording is ironical, for the singer has very little voice, as judged from the weak recordings here.I don't think Russell Watson is suitable for the demanding repertoire chosen for him. His defective technique and constricted vocals are incapable for performing the music.Can give this a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"What voice?","review":"Where is the voice mentioned on the cd cover? I certainly don't hear any voice of any quality. Instead, I've been treated to an hour of screaming on this cd. The performances of Russell Watson are unacceptably bad. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype-- Watson: The voice that wasn't.","review":"I'd been resisting purchasing The Voice for several months (mostly because I don't like to jump on bandwagons or buy music advertised during morning television), but then I caved and bought it used. What a huge disappointment. As a classical/opera listener, I found Watson's voice to be weak and uninspiring. He takes top prize for the worst male vocalist I've heard to date. I tend to go for voices that make the hairs on the back of my neck bristle... if you like that electricity too, avoid Watson like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deserves a Zero","review":"This maybe shouting, belting or screaming. But this definitely is NOT singing! With an ugly voice and an immature technique, the performances in this recording are of deplorable standard. Definitely not fit for consumption! I'd have awarded it with ZERO star had it been possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"A singer with no voice","review":"The title of this album is deeply ironical, for the singer has little voice! His narrow range and unformed technique are both an embarrassment. Naturally, he fails to do justice to the music. A one-star recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help!","review":"I suppose that Russell Watson is to fall into the same category as Andrea Bocelli as a love him or hate him tenor. This man's voice is atrocious. It is thin and completely colorless. When I heard excerpts from the CD, I positively cringed. I know that he has won awards, but I absolutely do not understand why. The rags-to-riches story is nice, but the voice itself has no foundation, no richness -- he just hits high notes. If you're going to listen to arias as an introduction to opera, please buy a CD by Domingo or Pavarotti so that you'll know what a tenor should really sound like. Though I'm not crazy about Bocelli singing opera yet (apparently he's working on it), he does have a beautiful, rich, deep quality to his voice as evidenced on \\"Sogno\\", his CD of love songs. I wish Watson all the best, but his popularity astounds me. And I love tenors! I only gave this CD one star because zero was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype and publicity do not a musician make","review":"Although Watson's aim of bringing opera to the masses is a worthy cause,the fact remains that 'the Voice' is disappointing. Watson has never had formal training and it shows. His voice is often reedy, lacking the smooth velvet of the likes of Safina, Bocelli and even Groban. Some sustained notes feel strained and jumps from low to high often feel choppy and lack smoothness. A good collection of songs but somewhat poorly sung. The work of a karaoke amatuer, one would do better with the wonderful Alessandro Safina."},{"rating":"2","title":"If not THE Voice, a good story","review":"You gotta love the story: working-class guy turned opera singer overnight (more or less), and this does influence how you listen to this recording. Sure he's not Pavarotti or even Bocelli but for most of us who are strangers to this type of music he gives it a good try. I had never intentionally listened to Nessun Dorma' before, and Watson's rendition did send chills down my spine. I personally didn't care for the pop songs, and even I could tell his Italian was forced. Nevertheless, BUY THIS CD, especially if you don't care for opera. It will change your mind"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much hype, but....","review":"Mr Watson sings with a pleasant tone for the most part, yet he does very little with the words. This is some understandable in the case of people singing in a language they don't speak, but what about the songs sung in English? I'd hate to say this, but this another attempt at launching a pop tenor, a Bocelli II, but Mr Watson has a long way to go, before recording his first aria recital."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is a keeper","review":"It is hard to find fault with such a glorious voice and album. Every cut is a gift. \\"Nella Fantasia\\", a classic performed by all the great tenors worldwide, is not a disappointment. My favorite is \\"Amor Ti Vieta\\". Watson's delivery is masterful. Rarely does a performer excel with such depth and maturity in the performance of such difficult material. Arrangements explode and soar in every selection giving Watson's superb voice rich support. \\"Barcelona\\" and \\"Vienna\\" are especially exciting. Freddie Mercury would have been honored by Watson's homage. Watson proves that he can hold his own with his strong delivery of \\"Non Ti Scordar Di Me\\". Critics may snub Watson because of his lack of \\"classical training\\" but I only applaude and am in awe of such vocal styling all the more! One only needs to listen to his \\"Nessun Dorma\\" to realize that Russell Watson is a voice that will not go away. He is a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for the best","review":"It is unfair to assess Russell Watson's singing by the standard of those classical singers as he isn't one.But when one assess him and his work by the standard of cross-over, he still is not that competitive. Consider the likes of Bocelli, Safina and Groban. ALl of them boast better voices, a more secure technique, more musicianship and musical intelligence than Russell Watson.With so much to choose from in the market, Russell Watson's album is frankly does not provide value for money as there're much better choices available."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Bocelli","review":"I'd urge those who think that Russell Watson is good to listen to the superb Andrea Bocelli. Both singers are doing cross-overs but Bocelli has a much more beautiful voice, a much better technique and he sings with more charm and, above all, a heart. Russell Watson is just no match for Bocelli, who is genuinely great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exceptionally bad","review":"I cannot believe my ears when I heard this recording. The voice itself is rough and untrained, while the singer's technique is possibly the worst I've heard so far.I cannot believe my eyes when I heard those fans singing all sorts of exaggerated praise for the singer her. In fact, I don't even know if they've actually listened to this CD. If they have, they'd surely be aware of the many flaws in the singer's execution (sample the final cadenza to \\"La donna e mobile\\").I do, however, recommend people to listen to this CD. It's only through this way that they'll know how bad Russell Watson's singing is and how misleading all those hype is. Those who can afford the money to waste should well sample this exceptionally bad recording. After that, just treat the whole thing as a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"Please just compare Bocelli's and Watson's rendition of Misere!! Bocelli's voice is warm and Italian whereas Watson just sounds tinny in comparison. This must be some kind of joke--I think he should stick to pop music in English and not be recording all of Bocelli's repertoire from Romanza. Then maybe he would be able to record a pleasant CD. He also should not be recording opera--an untrained voice cannot do that music justice.This cd is a very unfortunate choice of repertoire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely...THE VOICE!","review":"It's incredible how many people \\"discovered\\" Russell Watson by accidentally coming across his concert on TV. Same story here!I couldn't believe that voice was coming out of that person! I just watched in disbelief as he sang opera and then switched to pop. I bought his CD \\"The Voice\\" a couple days later and WOW! No complaints here. He already has a strong and beautiful voice at such a young age, so in a few years...he'll be even better! (If that's even possible! He's so great already!) I read that his next album which opens today, \\"Encore\\", is excellent also. I'll be waiting to get my hands on that! If you listen to the sound clips and enjoy, then you'll love the album! For future TV viewers....If you happen to be flipping through the channels and come across a handsome, young, English lad singing Italian opera and then crossing over to pop...you've come across Russell Watson. And I'm really glad I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst of both worlds","review":"This singing here is really bad. It lacks the communicative eloquence of genuine pop singing, nor has it the technical polish and true style of genuine classical singing. It just represents the worst of both worlds! Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lap of honor before the race.","review":"Watson has a voice which may, with training and dedication amount to something but it is not in his interest to attempt opera by singing,badly, some well known arias. When he can sustain a whole operatic preformance without any electronic assistancce he may be entitled to make operatic recordings. Rene Kollo made the transition from pop to opera but he did not do it overnight. I had to return to a 1944 recording of Bjorling to remind myself how Nessun Dorma should be sung. Watson delivers a little with too much hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"My comments","review":"As a high school student, I'd just award grades for the various elements of this CD just like how teachers rate my school work:Voice quality: CSinging technique: DMusicianship: DMusic arrangement: DOrchestral performance: DChoice of songs: CSound quality: DCD booklet: CPackaging: BAs the average is around D+ I'll award this CD 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ambitious program","review":"People have been doing cross-overs for years, and therefore we shouldn't discriminate against new singers who prefer to go that path. Unfortunately, the record producers have chosen a far too ambitious program for Russell Watson, who doesn't yet have the strength of voice, the security of technique and the experience of a seasoned performer to pull it off. As a result, the singing here falls flat and some of the tracks are embarrassing. I hope there can be a better program design next time, which can then showcase the young singer in a better light."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a let down...","review":"Russell Watson has professed an intention to give classical music to the ordinary people who're unfamiliar with the genure. That's very noble of him. I therefore have quite high expectations of his 1st album, The Voice, in particular as he seems to have earned quite a bit of praise. But what a let down it is! Frankly, in terms of easy listening and communicative strength, Watson fares even worse than the most staid of classical singers. He is also stylistically rather monotonous in those pop tracks. What an uninspiring enterprise this is! Don't we deserve anything better?"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much padding","review":"russell watson has a lovely voice, and is a magnificent young singer. this CD has too much padding, too many fireworks, is \\"over-produced\\". i await a CD on which mr. watson is permitted to simply sing great arias and tenor-songs...no fancy orchestration, co-singers, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not good enough!","review":"Of course, Russell Watson cannot (and should not) be compared to classically trained singers. However, I don't think he's in the same league as genuine cross-over singers like Andrea Bocelli, Alessandra Safina or Mario Lanza, the reason being that Russell Watson has a far weaker voice than these singers and his singing is also less emotionally true or vivid. Thus, without considering about all those technical points or whether or not Russell Watson can perform classical arias, I would merely say that his singing here has left much to be desired. It is simply not competitive enough in an already well-occupied field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never tired of Watson","review":"Contrary to what the critics say, I think Russell Watson does justice to every song he sings. He's a natural!! I've played the VOICE over and over and never get tired of listening to every song on this CD. The quality of Watson's voice is absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite CD","review":"The VOICE is my favorite CD. I believe the orchestrations are just exquisite and I love the tempo. Russell Watson gives the right attitude and vocal technique in each of his song selections. I love this recording because there is a great performance for every song. \\"Nessun Dorma is just marvelous; not soft and operatic with no feeling like many opera singers make it, but with real feeling. I have yet to hear a better rendition of Caruso. Again, he has real attitude and exudes personality plus. Just an absolutely marvelous recording, definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wretched singing","review":"This is singing at its most wretched! While the singer is passable in most of the pop numbers, he fails to bring off the many intracacies in the operatic songs so that the listen can only experience perhaps 1 per cent of the full potential that the music can bring to a listener. (If some people is satisfied with such a misrepresentation or under-representation, it's their own matter. But I certainly don't think this is adequate at all.) His strained vocalism and the electronically enhanced voice and acoustic are terribly off-putting. A most awful album and a voice which I can't bear to listen to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the voice?","review":"Where is the voice? I don't find anything in this poorly sung album. Russell Watson, who pretends to be able to sing everything, embarrasses himself in this album. He cannot even sustain a note properly, and in faster musical passages, his voice just crumbled.I also don't find that his singing is heart-felt or communicative. His performances on this album is uniformly colorless and emotionally dry.I'm disappointed in having bought this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cannot do","review":"It should be clear to all why Russell Watson is treading this particular path. He probably knows that he does not have the technicall training or musicianship to become a genuine classical singer. He also knows that his singing lacks charm and immediacy to become a genuine pop singer. That's why he can only choose the middle-path and use all those distorted claims to create a sort of versatile image.In truth, he can do nothing very well. Much of the singing in this cd is an embarrassment. Of course, some people will prefer this stuff. After all, this is a pluralistic world and even cults have got a following. Nevertheless, as music, this cd just cannot do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recommended for a different reason","review":"I'll recommend this album for a rather different reason. Much of the singing here is appallingly bad that the tracks can actually serve as jokes in party. I've actually put this on in a gathering at my home with guests who possess very differetn musical taste. But all laughed uncontrollably after I put on this recording. Some suggested that it was the funniest thing that they've ever heard. We all had a merry time at the expense of the singer featured on this ludicrous CD. Thus, although the singing here is undeniably bad, I do think this CD can be treated as a joke and appreciated as such."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrifying","review":"This album is so bad that I can't even find a single song on the CD to justify the inflated price. People: just because the fellow has a soft voice and the music is filled with luscious, bright strings, enhanced with a hefty dose of reverb, doesn't mean that there is any quality music here. I am afraid that a lot of the listeners who gave a positive review of this CD have never really heard quality music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting album","review":"This album is so good! The singing is brilliant and the singer's musical performance has to be heard to be believed.It is all so wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Versatile and great singer","review":"Simple and short review. Watson has a voice that spans both classical and pop. His wonderful \\"voices\\" make him an unique and different type of singer. Just listen to some of the tracks and you too will be amazed by this versatile and great singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"No range","review":"I just don't understand how people can describe Russell Watson's voice as one having a \\"tremendous range\\". If he indeed has such a range, he needn't transpose, and he also won't sing as stridently as he did for this album. In fact, even if that \\"tremendous range\\" description is related to emotion, it still doesn't ring true, because Russell Watson sings everything in the same manner without much emotional variation. And I agree with those who say that by simplifying the music, instead of drawing listeners attention to those interesting details, Russell Watson is doing no service to the music or his audience, which cannot claim that they've heard opera, as opera is not sung in that karaoke-like way. If we're talking about cross over, then Groban and Safina are more honest with their claims. The type of recording as represented by this album is to be avoided."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A\\" voice - but definitely not \\"THE\\" voice.","review":"I find it strange that the album touts the fact that Mr. Watson was not a trained singer. Why would anyone want to listen to an untrained opera singer? Mr. Watson is correct in that he \\"can\\" hit the notes and if the aim is to lure in people who have never listed to opera, then I applaud his efforts. However, I hope they understand that a true professional does not require the studio effects that this album uses to make a voice more appealing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorless voice","review":"Don't understand why this album is called 'the Voice' as the voice of Russell Watson is colorless and lacking in charm. His singing technique is such that he fails to deliver the music properly. An embarrassing album, both for the singer and his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Personal view","review":"Music appreciation is a very personal thing, and I can only express my own view, which others may disagree. The first thing is that I found Mr Watson's voice to be not that beautiful. The timbre is very ordinary indeed. I also found his singing to be rather charmless. It doesn't communicate. I often found the performance here bland and strident. I believe I listened with an open mind and these are merely my personal observations. Hope they won't cause any offence to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong direction","review":"To populise something doesn't mean that you need to dumb it down or simplify it. Russell Watson's claim to be the \\"people's tenor\\" is simply absurd, for, instead introducing people to classical music and its many joys and intricacies in a proper way, he just simplifies the music and gloss over the details (which he probably cannot manage with his limited vocal resources and unformed technique). By turning those classical arias into pop tunes, he cannot claim to be promoting classical music, and my singing it in a pop way, he cannot claim to be a classical musician or even a tenor (which does he need to transpose the music down if he's a real tenor?). The whole thing is just proceeding at the wrong direction and it's music which will suffer in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor technique","review":"The singing documented on this recording, the debut recording of Russell Watson, is riddled with technical imperfections. It should be immediately clear to all that the voice or Mr Watson has insufficient amplitude and a rather narrow range. The quality of the tone is uneven, and the voice sounds especially strident on the top of the range. Mr Watson can't even sustain certain notes properly or securely. Breath control is a severe problem to Mr Watson, too, as he has to chop up musical phrases from time to time to snatch some breath. Many of such technical problems don't even exist in decent pop singers, let alone classically trained ones. I believe Mr Watson should take more singing lessons first than to rashly parade his many inadequacies on commerical recordings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype (especially on TV) can sell almost anything","review":"and this recording is proof of it. I've heard it only on the radio (many times) and I had to agree with the announcer who said, \\"That was Russell Watson attempting ... \\" (I've forgotten what it was he was trying to sing.) \\"Now,\\" continued the announcer, \\"for some REAL tenor singing.\\"It obviously isn't discerning opera lovers who have turned this recording into a bestseller. Opera lovers expect not only a decent voice but also good singing technique. Russell Watson has neither. But clearly he has a superb manager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad recording","review":"The singing here is mostly bad. Sometimes very bad. The singer also has little talent as he cannot make the music come alive. I don't know why the producers have allowed such bad recordings to be released. But maybe many people nowadays actually like bad singing such that the singer and his com;pany want to make a fortune out of this substandard material. But there is actually nothing in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Voice Of What?","review":"I regret that there was no option to give this recording ZERO stars. It certainly earned the rating. I really hope this guy didn't sell his welding gear -- he may need it to make a living."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to listen more","review":"I hope that people who admire Russell Watson and appear to be so intolerant to his critics can listen and see more widely. The world is much bigger than they may have thought. I'm quite appalled at the suggestion that Russell Watson is better in some respects than \\"the average opera singer\\", who according to some ignorant ones, appear to be invariably ageing and generously proportioned men. In fact, there're many young opera singers around who not only have a much better voice and technique than Russell Watson, they can also act naturally on the stage and are more communciative as singers/stage performers. In fact, some are much more handsome than Mr Watson. Even as a subject matter for pure idolatry, Russell Watson simple doesn't make the grade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little wonder, no charm, not even handsome","review":"I have listened to this album. In my view, there is nothing remarkable about Russell Watson's voice. The only thing worth mentioning are his smallest sound, his coarse delivery and his defective singing skills. The singing in this album is charmless. The classical songs are sung in all the wrong style, and the pop tunes are belt out in a strident and unfeeling manner. I don't even think Russell Watson is handsome. Even ignoring the many good-looking pop artists, there are many young opera singers who are much more handsome than Russell Watson. (Obviously, fans of Russell Watson don't/can't see them.)As regards those praises in this website, I think they're written by more or less the same 1 or 2 persons. In any event, they sound like promotional statements from a commercial record firm. Well, so much for the \\"artistry\\" of Russell Watson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please","review":"Come on people, this guy sounds like Kermit the Frog. Makes Andrea Bocelli sound like Pavarotti. Listen to the cuts before buying this CD. This is another \\"new, best, voice ever\\" kind of marketing scheme - innocuous music that reduces the pieces to muzak."},{"rating":"1","title":"An album with no musical substance","review":"I'm gravely disappointed with this album, which has no musical substance at all.Judging from what I heard on this CD, Russell Watson is merely a technically deficient singer who has little interpretative talent. His performances are vocally clumsy, mannered and uncommunicative. I can only conclude that the fame of Mr Watson rests almost entirely on commercial hyping. There's really little or no merit from an artistic viewpoint.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone to their opinion","review":"We all have different tastes. To each his own. I can understand opera buffs, Bochelli and Groban fans disliking Watson, and I understand Watson fans getting upset about the somewhat harsh criticisms, but everyone should do their own thing on this recording, buy it if you like it or dismiss if you don't. I love this album no matter what anyone says and I will continue to buy Watson albums because I think he is an exceptional singer who brings a new perspective in the music scene. Of course, I recommend this album but, in my eyes, he can do no wrong. Others may see it differently, but that's their opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 - Stars","review":"Music is for everyone. It's felt in each individual's heart and soul. For me, Russell Watson has that heart and soul. The Voice is a wonderful collection of songs ranging from classical and pop. I would give it 10 Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing Voice","review":"This is the best album I have ever purchased. I am also looking forward to his second, third and future albums. Needless to say, I am a Russell Watson fan. I saw a concert of his recently, and he is even better, in person. People should listen to Watson with an open mind and you will enjoy his beautiful voice. I was absolutely mesmerized by his singing of Caruso, both on this album and in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a great coaster","review":"It upsets me to see a man with clearly little talent acheive such 'heights'... he's a marketing miracle - that's for sure. It's a shame really, there are so many REAL tenors with REAL training and REAL talent and here, to see this gasping, untalented, flash-in-the-pan obtain a record deal over others.. it's so upsetting. His album? Greatly disappointing, the man and his 'music' makes me feel sick to my stomach -- needless to say, I'm not a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly produced CD","review":"After hearing Russell Watson spotlighted on CBS Sunday morning recently, I bought this CD to hear more. Unfortunately, I can't tell what kind of voice he has, the CD is so poorly produced with the arrangement/musicians overshadowing his singing. Sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironic title","review":"I found the title to this cd to be very ironic, for the singer, Russell Watson, doesn't really have any voice. In fact, not only is his voice of poor quality, his singing skills is even more defective.What a poorly produced cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"STAR TREK","review":"This is the person who sings \\"Faith of the Heart\\", the theme song to the new Star Trek series on UPN, Enterprise.Its going to be included on his next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst singing of record","review":"I'll make it brief: This CD captures some of the worst singing ever recorded. Anyone who has the slightest sense of good singing will laugh at the many vocal blunders of Russell Watson. Better avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"If you are musician with any training or taste, don't waste your money! A friend and I bought this cd a year ago in Europe, and found it quite funny. Watson claims to be the 'next Pavorati'. He has a terribly inconsistant sound, and it's simply not an attractive instrument to listen to. And - though surely no reviewer noticed - the end of his Nessun Dorma is rewritten so he can sing another shoddy high note. If you're looking for a tenor who's not among \\"The Three...\\" , try Marcelo Alvarez or good old Franco Corelli."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voice out of whack","review":"As a singer and voice teacher I want to say that nobody these days would know a great singer if they walked up and bit them.His singing is very uneven and his passage is a mess (D - f#)He sounds like somone who listened to to many records and never found his own voice. May he make all the money the record lable hopes he will and may Mr. Watson some day find his real voice not the manufactured one he has now. God help us if people think this is good singing. The voice has some good tones and he likes to sing so he is on the right track, but I really hope he finds a better teacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"No match for Bocelli","review":"Listening to this album side by side with the releases of Andrea Bocelli, one immediately realises how bad Watson sings. Certainly no match for the Italian, who possesses a finer voice and an infinitely better technique."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up to the hype","review":"After encountering so much hype about Russell Watson, I finally decided to give this album a try. Unfortunately, I was mostly disappointed by what I heard. No matter from what angle one looks at it, Russell Watson's performance here is just ordinary, sometimes less than that. Just like the inexplicable attachment of certain dedicated fans to some voiceless pop singers, the hype surrounding Russell Watson can probably be explained in the same way. But it is unfair to say that everything Russell Watson does isn't of an acceptable standard. For example, contrary to some of the views here, I actually like his \\"Bridge over troubled water\\". It is sincerely sung. Unfortunately, most of the tracks here aren't of such quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Background music","review":"I recently bought this album and, having listened to it, am amazed by some of the comments here. I agree with one of Mr Watson's fans who've written here not too long ago, that he'd play this CD all day whenever he was working. Actually, he has actually hit the nail on the head - this CD is of such quality that it can only serve as background music, just like those flimsy tunes aired in shopping malls and hotel lifts, really that being fit of serious appreciation. However, if you concentrate on it without being distracted by other pursuits, its many flaws will at once become apparant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore those fans","review":"Those who wish to know what this CD is actually like should ignore the views of fans, who always write in a patronising manner. In fact, the mere fact that those fans claim that Russell Watson is a 'tenor' reveals that such fans are willing to distort the truth in order to promote their idol.No, the singing in this CD just won't do. It is in truth unspeakably bad. Just sample it in record stores and you'll know the truth within a minute or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot be recommended","review":"I can only consider this recording a joke. Of course, jokes abound in this world. Yet, this is one of the more surprising ones as this Cd features a singer who hasn't got a voice or technique but somehow is allowed to record a commercial recording which, thanks to all the hype, has sold quite an amount.Nevertheless, one should ignore all these hype and sales when assessing this recording. The truth is that (and such truth will be evident to the objective ear) the singing here is vastly substandard and also charmless. The choice of music, though good by itself, is also unsuitable to such a voiceless singer. The result is disappointing, but it can only be expected.I don't think I can recommend this sort of stuff to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for me","review":"I like pop music, but I don't think Russell Watson has succeeded in introducing me to classical music. For Domingo and Pavarotti, I do have respect for them, although I don't like what they're singing. With Russell Watson, I don't even have any respect, as he doesn't have any real artistry! In fact, I find the same music sung by Pavarotti to be more involving than when sung by Russell Watson? No, it doesn't work for me at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Russell Watson - The Voice","review":"The more I hear items from this record repeatedly plugged on the \\"Classic FM\\" program, the happier I am for not having bought it. You cannot prop up a voice such as his by mere sensationalism and elctronics. I would say that there is a good deal of promise here that could have been rewarded by hard training, but I doubt that he and his bankers would consider this. As one brought up hearing such tenors as Gigli, Tagliavinni and Bjorling, I have to pass this voice by. His \\"success\\" is purely financial."},{"rating":"1","title":"What voice? What a joke!","review":"All singers' voices have a number of qualities that determine if that person is a good singer or not: Power, clarity, range, and (most ambigously) beauty. Watson has almost none of any of these things. Any halfway decent tenor can manage \\"La Donna E Mobile\\" without straining himself, but apparently Watson can't. It's idiotic to think an unskilled, untrained pretty boy with limited talent could ever be a rival for even the least talented professional opera singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds nasal","review":"Russell Watson is a pop singer trying hard to be an opera singer. His voice sounds too nasal for the respected genre, and he mangles these beautiful arias with it. He shouldn't do opera. He lacks the proper training, does not have the finesse that (like so many other reviewers have said) Bocelli has. If I would recommend an excellent tenor, I recommend Alessandro Safina. Don't waste your money on this \\"The Voice\\" Rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worthless recording","review":"This recording offers nothing: The voice that it features isn't of any great quality. The singing is terribly substandard. There's a serious lack of musicianship in the performances. The singer brings no new interpretative insights to the music.A totally joyless and unenjoyable release."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good","review":"The number of cds sold often has no relationship with the quality of the recording. If so, then classical music must be of a much poorer quality than pop music as pop releases usually outsell classical recordings many times over.Russell Watson's debut CD The Voice is highly unsatisfactory as the songs there, whether pop or classical, are so poorly sung. Also, I can't believe some people would describe Watson's singing voice as beautiful. I do hope that people can listen more and make a fairer comparison. They may then know that they're here given singing that is less than their money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watson is the people's tenor","review":"Watson is the people's tenor. Listen to the VOICE and you'll understand why this label has been attached to Watson. His clean and crisp tenor voice makes classical music accessible to the non-classical music fan and his pop voice draws us to him like a magnet. How can anyone not love this man with such a beautiful voice. He's great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great album for the non-purists out there","review":"I have enjoyed this album immensely. I would never have thought that I would buy an operatic CD as I find the style and singing quite grating - apologies to opera lovers out there - but I heard Russell Watson on a television show (in the UK) while I was napping and was overwhelmed with the beauty of his voice and the song he was singing and felt compelled to buy the album.While there are a lot of beautiful songs on the album I'm not a big fan of the poppy aspects of the album as I think it detracts from the more operatic elements of the album. For his detractors out there I would say listen again as he does have a fantastic voice and he has really opened up the world of opera to those that wouldn't consider themselves fans of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Really Matters","review":"I have had this CD for about a year now, and it is the most listened-to CD I have. I love the incredible versatility in Watson's voice. Frankly, I don't care what the purists say, whether the album was hyped, or whether of not the orchestration augmented the sound. \\"Nella Fantasia\\" thrilled me the first time I heard it, and I still love to hear it today. That's what really matters.P.S.: I felt compelled to speak my piece after noticing that someone is on a mission to trash this CD with repeated negative reviews. Why wasn't once enough? Well, I'm using my one vote to say, \\"I love this CD!!!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watson might have a future in \\"pop-era\\"","review":"If I were to suggest that it is inappropriate to take a high school athlete -- let's say a basketball player -- blessed with a lot of raw talent, and then put him on the court with Michael Jordan, no one would call me a \\"sports snob.\\" In fact, everyone would nod in agreement.Mr. Watson's handlers are to be blamed here. The singer has a lot of natural ability, and could, one day, be a good singer. But to assign an untrained vocalist a challenging repertoire of arias is unfair to the singer, and could, ultimately, hurt an otherwise steady career.It has nothing to do with elitism. A singer simply has to have breath support, modulation, intonation and dynamics.Again, I think this young man shows some promise, and his story is truly inspirational. So many people wouldn't love him if he didn't have some degree of talent and artistry. He just needs to acquire some semblance of a technique to really join the big leagues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described, but LED light quality is unpleasant","review":"LED light quality is just too 'cool' (appears blue) compared to incandescent or good fluorescent.

He investigates how medieval theologians perceived the role of Islam in Christian and world history, and outlines the intellectual and theological ramifications of the west's introduction to Islamic philosophy, along the way introducing the reader to some of the major religious and intellectual figures who played roles in the encounter.The entire book is just over a hundred pages - you'll wish it was longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for your personal library","review":"A comprehensive look at Pentecostalism, its roots, and \\"3 waves\\" of history.

I found \\"The Avengers\\", however, disjointed, trite, and a far less enjoyable read. The most compelling thing going for this book is the story itself, which is remarkable, but I did not care at all for the fictitious conversations, the oversimplifications, and the generalizations which are sprinkled liberally throughout the book. The writing is somewhat staccato-like, and although I learned what the characters did each day, I didn't learn enough about what motivated or caused them to become the heroes they were. I'll look forward to the next one by Cohen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book very badly read","review":"The book is pretty good. The reading is awful.

There may be lots of updates SOMEWHERE in their map files, but in the Louisville Kentucky area the map files are more than two years out of date. I'm not talking about some back road out in the country or a brand new subdivision.

Also, if you only buying music from known artists, do not buy this album. The tunes are good but unheard of. Most of the songs are usually from the ending scenes in P3, Piper's club, and some are shown in the starting scenes of the San Franscisco citylights. If you've liked a particular song while watching the show, get its title and match it with the songs on this album.

Is it even possible this was meant to be taken seriously when it was made, or is it all just a clever put-on: a spoof of the genre by winking jokesters? Fans of Japanese monster films might want to avoid this for several reasons: the creatures are, to be kind, from hunger--and their action scenes are few and far between. As for the rest? It's either the worst kind of mess or it's brilliant, depending upon your state of inebriation or tolerance.

Bear in mind that I'm not too fond that they had a cute little dog involved in this movie. I mean, it made me think they were going to have it killed or eaten or worse and that really doesn't sit good with me.

Includes builder's photos, an action photo and specifications of each locomotive.

I made the mistake of buying quality salt and vinegar kettle chips, then thought, hmm Pringles have way less fat and would do a decent job. No way, these were terrible. Ate 3 chips then threw the whole can in the garbage. I can't even describe the pathetic falvor because there wasn't any. Just a chalky salt taste. Waste of money.

Nobody. These salt and vinegar chips taste pretty good, but you just know you're eating junk. My kid knows these can only be eaten alongside something healthy and we eat mostly good stuff. And just to be sure, this case of Pringles will be stored high on a shelf. So these are \\"special occasion\\" snacks. Definitely not healthy, but tasty, satisfying junk food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another excellent read in the Fables saga","review":"\\"Fables: The Mean Seasons\\" is the fifth volume in Bill Willingham's 'Fables' series and provides yet another compelling and engaging read for fans of the series. While 2/3'rds of this book is required narrative for the advancement of the storyline, this book includes a few chapters of side stories and flashbacks that I found to be the highlights of this volume. In particular, 2 chapters are devoted to a WW2 flashback of Bigby Wolf's adventures in Nazi occupied Europe. Don't skip this book if you've been following the series up to this point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Willingham's done it again!","review":"This book continues on from Volume 4, and we see the birth of Snow White's children by Bigby Wolf, and their move to the Farm where they must now live. Prince Charming's now in as Mayor, vice King Cole, and is finding that there's more to running Fabletown than he may have thought.In addition, we have a one-shot about Cinderella, and her private dealings...and a two-part story about Bigby Wolf in World War II.A worthy addition to the Fables line."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lull in the war, but plenty of new plot twists","review":"Since the Adversary's first attack in the previous volume, it was obvious that the war had come to Fabletown and that this would be an ongoing theme for the rest of the series. However, aside from the first story, which features a treacherous Fable, the war with the Adversary hardly figures at all into this volume. Instead, we mostly get to see what happens as Prince Charming takes over Fabletown, and Snow White tries to deal with her litter of flying babies. There is also another murder mystery with a sad ending, and a flashback story featuring Bigby Wolf behind enemy lines in World War II. A great collection of stories, but a bit slower-paced than previous volumes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for getting lost","review":"Other reviews address the poor quality of the writing and textual information in this book.

I never thought how linguistic inability would affect cross cultural relationships. I just assumed everyone was bilingual in Mexico. Apparently this is not so. Neither did I consider how obtaining drinking water in central mexico would be so strange. You have to read the book to find out.

The authors use lots of generalities. They do provide plenty of good cautions, plus criticisms for ugly American syndrome. They also do not gloss over the sizeable differences anyone living in Mexico must expect and accept--or be miserable. This book was a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"editorial intrusions","review":"There are many good data points in this book, however, the author insists on revealing that he comes from a disfunctional family, suffers from The Fatigue, and harbours a (sour grapes?) dislike for automobiles and well-heeled gringo retirees.

I agree wholeheartedly with Doug and Cindi's suggestions about preparing for the move to Mexico by developing language skills IN SPANISH and making every effort to befriend the locals and honor their culture.

His effort would have been better spent explaining the pros and cons of Mexico itself or the ins and outs of how to get things done there.

Not to mention all the details of the author's health problems. I didn't pay good money for this, nor do I appreciate the time wasted wading through it. Even the ranting about Ugly Americans, which I completely agree with, was repeated ad nauseum--there's no need to tell us over and over and over.

No doubt a judicious editor should have taken a very large axe to the original manuscript. It is continuously repetitive and the constant! use! of! exclamation! marks! wore! me! down!If there is another edition of this book I hope the author focuses his energy on explaining important things we should know about moving to Mexico and less on tangential diatribes about what is wrong with America and modern society."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Is A Disappointment","review":"This book is a disppontment to me.

Fortunately,the class included lecture because the textbook lacks coherentexplanations for the most basic principles. As an engineeringtextbook, it is quite poor. Explanations are vague and contain little relevant detail. Perhaps the worst feature of the entire book is the index. For a 434 page book, a two page index is not even close to enough. In defense of the index though, those 434 pages are all large type with many useless, cartoonish, redundant illustrations. As a brief overview, this may be adequate. But, for the price, I certainly expect more meat and less fat, something with the quality and content approaching that put out by Stallings or Tanenbaum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"I think this book is not suitable for the beginner nor for the advanced reader, while reading this book you will be totally lost, and many of the questions that arise while reading will not have an asnwer, no in depth coverage for important topics like ATM switching (26 pages) is avaiable.By reading this book, you will feel that you didn't acheive much and that you should read another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A broad but disorganised coverage","review":"The preceding panalopy of one star anonymous reviews for this book seem somewhat false to me. In truth, while there is little order or sense to the content of this book, it does contain useful information, and is not wholely indecipherable. Having worked with ATM during the period when forum White Papers were nearly the only real informational resource available, this book does represent a step foward in that it forms a viable shortening of the information load needed to comprehend ATM networking.

Try the versions by Mravinsky, or pretty much any other version, for that matter, it is hard to imagine this symphony played worse than in this recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turgid Allegretto, too-slow Allegro non troppo make a bad symphony, offset Largo","review":"To me, the Allegretto, though not an Allegro, needs to be taken much faster than Bernstein does.In essence, I hear and feel this as Shostakovich doing a scherzo-like parody of a Mahlerian Austrian Laendler slow movement. If you listen to a good interpretation of this symphony, in this movement, or listen **through and below** a not-so-good performance, you'll soon grasp this.Bernstein occasionally gets the drive of a parodic dance rhythm, but it's often just too slow.And, in the finale, yes, the Allegro is tagged with the \\"non troppo\\" modifier, but \\"not rushed\\" does NOT mean \\"dragged out.\\" Nor does \\"majestic\\" mean \\"put the brakes on.\\"Unfortunately, does any of this surprise you? This is Lenny.The older he got, the more inconsistent and even bombastic he became.The Cello Concerto is very good under Ormandy's direction and Yo-Yo Ma's performance.I wavered between two and three stars, but finally fell on two."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Fazal","review":"This is a response to the previous review by Fazal Majid.I couldn't possibly agree with you more. So slow, so dull. I had never heard another version before this one, and I thought that I didn't like the symphony. But actually, the symphony is very nice - it's Bernstein's rendition that I don't like. This symphony, like most of Shostakovich's work, needs a little speed to give it some life. I subsequenly bought the Ashkenazy 2004 live recording, whose timings by movement are almost identical to Mravinsky's. I'm waiting for it to be delivered now, and have high hopes for it. I already own Ashkenazy's recording of Shostakovich's 7th, and it's very good - fleet, unemotional, direct and exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Rubbish","review":"I put one star because amazon wouldn't let me leave it blank, but the one star is totally undeserved.

It's not an airy-fairy book (no holds barred when it comes to pointing out the powerfully obstructive nature of our identities), but it also presents real hope for returning to the soul level of self...and eventually to true nature. As Patanjali might have said, where there appears to be distortion, there is that which was never distorted--that which is just waiting to be rediscovered in its purity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the Spirituality?","review":"This book is so negative about the aspects of the different types that it is painful to read.

The author may have some knowledge of the system, perhaps a lot, but she does a poor job of showing it through writing, something which makes her a poor candidate for authoring a book on such a tricky subject as self exploration. Organization for each chapter describing personality types is nearly non-existent: Maitri wanders from observations to citations without a clear notion of where she's going, or what the Big Picture is. She loses herself and her reader in vague verbiage. This makes reading the book painful for longer than a paragraph.I strongly suggest the books of Helen Palmer, Don Riso and Russ Hudson, all lucid and rational writers who do their theory justice.

If this is by design it is really horrible, since it has splashes of pink, purple, and yellow scattered throughout the band. However I didn't give this a one star for it's looks... I am not sure if it is because of the size of my head, but these do not hardly block any sound! I guess there is a gap where the plug inserts in my ear since I can still hear everything.

You don't have to do much with a one regular format all day. And last, this guy's voice just isn't very good. I will say he performs well live. He exudes lots of energy and really knows how to entertain. The production quality is very good, thanks to Eddie Kramer.

The entire recording sounds like a high school band playing off key. It is not the fault of the orchestra, still one of the top wind ensembles in the world, but of the conductor who has very unusual taste in music. We personally detest his music selections.

But that does not mean his performance lacks fire and energy.Romeo & Juliet played by Chicago SO is one of the most exciting and powerfully moving accounts on record, and the sound is sumptuous and every part of the score is articulated and vividly captured.4th Symphony is not top-recommendation if you seek truly exciting performance, but very persuasive and eloquent with some magical moments in the slow movement and in the pizzicato section."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN BUEN TCHAIKOVSKY","review":"La interpretación de la cuarta Sinfonía de Tchaikovsky, por la orquesta de Chicago bajo la dirección del Maestro Claudio Abbado, está llena de hermosos colores orquestales bajo una concepción correcta de la obra, no hay detalle que le falte, todo en su lugar.

The lyrics aren't as cutting edge as I thought they would be. I did chuckle a few times, but overall I wasn't as amused as I was lead to believe I would be. This soundtrack should NOT be compared to Rent, as it is not even in the same leauge. The only similarity to Rent is that they are both broadway musicals and both take place in New York city. I'm sure the live show is spectacular, but I am sorry I bought the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"This makes me sick","review":"Watching the 2004 Tony Awards, I have to say I was whole-heartedly rooting for \\"Wicked\\" to win best musical...and still think that it completely deserved it. But seeing that Avenue Q won, I thought it must have been completely amazing to win over Wicked. And after listening to the recording, I was perfectly appaled at the shallowness, profanity, and degrading nature of Avenue Q. I am a firm believer in the power of theatre, but Avenue Q really upset me. It doesn't tug at any heart strings, it doesn't inspire any emotions, and really isn't humorous unless you enjoy things like puppet sex, porn, homosexuality, and all those wonderful things. I would've given it zero stars, but it wouldn't let me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hardest I've laughed in a long time!","review":"I didn't know what to expect when I went to this show. It's muppets for adults, but very clever, very creative, and above all . . . very funny! The songs from the show are incredibly apropos and relevant to these modern times. I laughed from start to finish. I recommend the show and the CD highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I love this CD. While it is not for the kiddies, adults can enjoy the humor in the songs from this Tony award winning show. I laugh everytime I hear \\"It Sucks to Be Me\\", \\"Everyone's a Little Bit Racist\\", \\"If You Were Gay\\", and \\"The Internet is For Porn\\". The performances are terrific and the whole CD is a lot of fun, with a traditional love song thrown in as well (\\"There's a Fine, Fine Line\\"). Try it, you'll laugh, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Soundtrack For Adults Only","review":"Unless you've been living under a rock (or a red state) you've all heard at least of of the fun, but, twisted songs from Avenue Q. The soundtrack is a refreshing, yet, slightly demented collection of humorous songs for people that may have grown up watching Sesame Street or The Muppets, but, maybe not so much for kids who are currently watching Barney or Dora The Explorer.The songs defintly push the politically correct line which is one of the things I love about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great soundtrack and great show!","review":"I saw this show, not expecting much. After all, it had puppets- I thought it would be stupid. But, like many things on Broadway, it was amazing. The music is great, the show was funny, and I love every bit of it. It is a lot like The Producers, or Spamalot. This CD keeps every great bit of the show. Totally 100% worth the price. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Puppet Show Ever","review":"When does one sit down thinking about ideas that would make it on braodway, and come up with an x-rated puppet show? I dont know either but it happened and thank God it did. Avenue Q is so much fun (as long as you can take the crude language) But they dont hide that its in there so that shouldnt be a surprise. The Lyrics are wonderful. The songs are campy for the most part. The show deals with life and many different aspects of it. From hidden fantasies, to useless college degress, to racism, to, well, porn. Even if your not into broadway this would make a great addition to anyone comedy CD collection. If you are into musical theater you should definitly have this one. Enjoy! Favorite songs (other than the WHOLE THING): \\"Purpose\\" and \\"Everyones A Little Bit Racist\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't suck to be me!","review":"I got this cd awhile ago and love it! The songs are witty and hilarious. I think to truly understand Avenue Q you have to see the show but it is still a great cd. The performances by John Tartaglia and Stephanie D' Abruzzo are delightful. Keep in mind that you have to have a certain sense of humor to truly enjoy this cd(some may find it offensive) but if you're like me you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful...","review":"Avenue Q pushes the boundaries that Broadway is afraid to cross at this time. Having seen the show, I knew I had to have the soundtrack. The straightforward lyrics slap you in the face and let you laugh at the life. If you are looking for some deep and meaningful, this is not for you. But if you are some one looking for a chance to relax or some fun taboo, Avenue Q is definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Damn Deranged Children's Show For Adults Ever!","review":"After listening numereous times to Avenue Q in the same day, week, and month. I've learned that I gotta find my purpose. Learned that it was okay to know that the internet is for porn. And that I could be as loud as the hell I want when I'm making love. Thanks Avenue Q:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your dollar spent = A laugh and a half","review":"A funny, witty and \\"cute\\" musical. By \\"cute\\" I mean that the you won't find anything particularly amazing or deep in this musical, but the child like tunes of the songs in Avenue Q have a way of sticking in your head. It isn't the most cleverly written musical around and is somewhat predictable and cheesey, but it is definetly a must have (if you are willing to accept the dirty nature of some of the songs!). :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely my new favorite CD","review":"I'm a big theatre geek, and out of all the musicals I know, Avenue Q has become my favorite.Avenue Q is certainly not the most musically complex show out there, but it ranks among the most original and clever, without a doubt.Beyond the hilarity of the show, there are so many aspects of Avenue Q that everyone can relate to -- having a college degree but no skills like Princeton, being unemployed like Brian, going to where the grass is greener but still not getting what you want like Christmas Eve, being a slacker (aren't we all?) like Nicky, hiding from our true selves like Rod, being cute and smart but still single like Kate, having social issues because of our background like Trekkie, or trying to re-establish ourselves like Gary Coleman.But, mostly, how can you resist songs like The Internet is for Porn, It Sucks to Be Me, or those ones where Rod is trying to convince everyone he's not gay?It's a fun show and a fun CD. Definitely worth every penny :o)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Out Loud Funny!","review":"I just had to get this after seeing the show in Las Vegas recently, and I was so very pleased to find the cd for less than they were selling it for in the gift shop (even with the \\"have it right away\\" shipping charge). I think I've about worn it out by listening to it constantly on my commute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sesame Street Meets the \\"REAL\\" World!!!","review":"I haven't seen the broadway play,...but I have seen a flash cartoon for one of the songs \\"The Internet is for Porn\\"....and I just thought it was funny for all the wrong reasons. After listening to the tunes....I'm sure that somewhere Jim Henson is laughing out loud. It is a great soundtrack to listen to and you'll be finding yourself listening to it over and over again and trying not to picture Cookie Monster or Kermit the Frog doing something totally adult. It really takes a look at the real world from relationships, the work force, homosexuality, porn, etc and makes you laugh at it. I recommend this CD to anybody."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very funny little show","review":"From \\"It Sucks To Be Me\\" through \\"If You Were Gay,\\" \\"Everyone's A Little Bit Racist\\" and \\"The Internet Is For Porn\\" - one great number after another. I tip my hat to composers Robert Lopez and Jeff Marx for coming up with this utterly disarming, witty and raunchy little gem - easily the most original new show on Broadway since \\"Urinetown: The Musical.\\" A treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"You buy things on amazon.com","review":"Even without the little plug for Amazon (I love amazon, who doesn't really?) in the song The Internet is for Porn, this is a fantastic recording and I believe, signifies the arrival of the new Broadway.As an early twentysomething myself, I can relate to the lyrics of many of these songs, especially Purpose, For Now, There's a Fine, Fine Line and What do you do with a BA in English? and to the plight of Princeton, the main character of the show and to all of the characters' neverending searches for jobs, love and money. The explicit humor and jokes only add to the realism of the show and display the new sense of reality that is coming to Broadway. No longer will the Great White Way be populated by huge spectacular productions but by the type of theatricality of a show like Avenue Q.Great cast recording and a great show. A must listen for anyone, even those who enjoy traditional Broadway and those who can't stand it. Give it a shot!PS Much better than Cats!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind your P's and \\"Q\\"'s","review":"I guess you must have to see this show in order to appreciate it, as it doesn't translate well to just the score. Personally I find the thought of muppets having sex rather disturbing. I enjoyed some of them like \\"The More You Ruv Someone\\", \\"Everyone's a little bit racist\\" and the amusing \\"The Internet Is For Porn.\\" BUT this show just gets old after a while. I don't see how this could get an award for \\"Original\\" score. It's not original--it's based off \\"Sesame Street.\\" Even the character's voices are nearly identical making it even more disturbing. If you want a better score (which should have won the Tony) that deals with homosexuality and other aspects of society check out Boy George's \\"Taboo.\\" \\"Avenue Q\\" just is NOT worth the money. Sorry if I o ffended anyone who likes this show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Letter Grade: Q","review":"I'm basing my review on both the CD and having seen the show. The performers have a great deal of energy and talent and some of the lyrics are very clever. However, I find nothing memorable about the music. The CD and show start with some good lessons in life expressed in a comical way, but in my opinion it's unnecessary to move into offensive topics and lyrics to get this across. Maybe I'm old-fashioned but I prefer songs that both my children and parents can listen to. On a grading scale from A (the best) to Z, I give this a Q."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Sesame Street\\" Meets \\"South Park\\"","review":"I own several albums of various Broadway shows, but this one has to be one of my favorites. I can't stop giggling every time I listen to it. The lyrics are witty and the score will get stuck in your head. Word of warning to those of your with kids--this is NOT a musical for children. That parental advisory sticker is there for a reason, and if you choose to ignore it then don't complain. You were warned. Other than that, the sound quality is amazing and so is the cast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laughed my ass off","review":"I saw the show in August, and I couldn't wait for the soundtrack to release. Has there ever been two better back-to-back comedy tunes than 'Everyone's a Little Bit Racist' and 'The Internet Is For Porn'? Some may think the show juvenile, but behind the laughs is a story that strikes closer to reality than most dramas. Buy one for yourself and one for all your friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muppets gone wild?","review":"I first heard about 'Avenue Q' from a Muppet Bulletin board, and at first thought, \\"Didn't Peter Jackson already do this?\\".How wrong I was.I'm not given to most Broadway shows, or even musicals in general. This soundtrack, though, was funny to listen to, and has made me want to see the show in person. (if it ever makes it down to Texas, that is)If you like funny songs, and even some thought provoking ones (what DO you do with a B.A. in English??) then this just may be the soundtrack for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple fun","review":"The music doesn't satirize Sesame Street, it imitates Sesame Street. The lyrics to the songs are obvious and not nearly as clever as the song titles. But, Damn It - It was FUN!I've grown tired of it after just a few listenings, but a few good listenings is better than most albums available today.Buy it, listen to it. Stop trying to figure out the ambiguities of Sondheim and have a little fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Puppets of Seseame Street Turn Dirty-and Musical!","review":"When i first heard of Avenue Q, everyone kept going on and on about how funny and amazing it was. Even people who said they disliked musicals loved Avenue Q. When i first heard it , i like every other clean friend of mine, was shocked. '\\"The Internet is for Porn\\" and the Intro to \\"You can be as Loud as the Hell you want (when you're making Love)\\" were praticularlly crude to us. Many of my friends did not like it at first, as did i. But soon, the cute songs that were slightly less crude (such as, \\"The More your Ruv Someone\\" and \\"The Money Song\\" along with \\"Mix Tape\\") made the CD addicting. Soon, every single song on the CD becomes your favorite as you sing them under your breath. Its quite funny when someone asks you what you are singing and you must admit that it is \\"If you were Gay\\".Overall, while Avenue Q may not be the best musical in the world and SHOULD NOT have one \\"Best Musical\\" over Wicked, this musical is worth whatever price you pay."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Place To Visit, But You Can't Live Here","review":"Avenue Q adresses issues in a way we can all understand. So what if there's a gay puppet? That's not what the show is all about, if I may dispel the rumor. Each of the characters go through some tough ordeals, even if it is really, really funny at times. The songs posses sharp wit and hey, Everyone IS a Little Bit Racist, so stop denying it. This a great track if you are at least, hmm, let's try thirteen years old. You will be laughing out loud and then singing along with the song. Who says a puppet show can't be a Tony winner?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank God!","review":"After catching the show in NY, I've been dying for the CD to come out.

How can you not love titles like \\"Everyone's A Little Bit Racist\\" and \\"The Internet Is For Porn\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance - That's It","review":"Avenue Q is probably one of the best musicals Broadway has seen in years. It's clever, heart-warming, hilarious, and, oh yeah - TRUE TO LIFE! (I can't tell you how many times I've gotten into fights with my guy friends about the Internet.) And that's something you don't find on stage everyday - particularly not in the much weaker, over-blown, unoriginal and thoroughly disappointing Wicked. Q pays homage to many forms of entertainment, using typical theatre flair mixed with the simplicity of Sesame Street tunes. For those of you who are too blinded by spectacle to see the brilliance in honesty, take the words of Kate Monster, Princeton & the rest of the Avenue Q gang: \\"Don't stress. Relax. Let life roll off your backs.

Look at the difference between Tom Lehrer's \\"Smut\\" and \\"The Internet is for Porn.\\" The former has brilliant rhymes, hilarious barbs and goes somewhere. The later, like everything in the show, just sits there like a commercial jingle that cannot do anything.

The merits of the music alone make Avenue Q worth buying, show unseen.It's the perfect antidote for a crappy day. Just look at the song list. They're even funnier when you hear the whole songs, and the best ones aren't sampled here. They're funny, smartly observant, and the explicit lyrics just add to the fun.

The strength of the show the muscis which reflected the spirit of the show: catchy, subversive and sometimes downright mean(here's looking at you, Gary Coleman). Love it.

It covers job dissatisfaction, homosexuality, racism, internet porn, money and Gary Coleman's woes, among others, with a few profanities thrown in for good measure. After one gets over the initial shock, you'll enjoy singing along with some of the songs. I suppose attending the play was akin to watching Sesame Street for grown-ups. (Hopefully, one day, I will see myself!)Winner for best musical of 2004, I'm glad that others agree with my opinion about Avenue Q.My guiltiest pleasure is track 2: What Do You Do with a B.A. in English + It Sucks To Be Me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Original Broadway cast on the CD.

The people behind advertising were greatly going for sales. I thought that American Pie 2 had great music in the background. Full of a mixture of known and not-so known artists, but the music was quality for what it was. I think the greatest music is the more adult music. Your Joseph Arthur, Wallflowers , Matt Nathanson cover, Norah Jones, etc. fits perfectly with the whole growing, marriage vibe that's demonstrated in the beginning and end of the movie.

For extra flava, there's Matt Nathanson's cover of the James classic Laid, and The Wallflower's version of Van Morrison's poetic Into The Mystic.Throw in the first new music from Avril Lavigne in a year, and you got the Mopo soundtrack of the summer.

That was so horrible! Delorme and some other 'reviews' claimed the 2006 version was a total overhaul. It ISN'T. Delorme's Street Atlas 2006 is nice software for a PC/laptop...it just really sucks on a PDA. I don't know why everyone else under the sun has created nice GPS products for PDA's and why Delorme can't. Maybe they will get it together in the year 2020.Some benefits have been added in this version. Honestly though, if you have a GPS unit, just go buy Tom Tom's PDA software for $150. It is accurate, detailed...gets updated and is versatile. If you don't have a GPS unit, you can buy the package deal from Tom Tom for $300. I know it is alot of money, but you won't be disappointed.

To bad MS doesn't make a Palm client.Routing: frequently tried to take me off road between curvy sections of an interstate.Bluetooth GPS: This is my biggest complaint. It FREQUENTLY loses connnection to my bluetooth GPS receiver. I've run other software on the same Palm T|X without ever losing connectivity. DeLorme represents reinstalling the package. Sure.

It worked, but performance was so awful that I didn't use it.It's perhaps worth the money if you just want to compute a route on your PC and download it to the PDA.If any route computation is required on the PDA, I suggest you go out for coffee while you're waiting.Want to download a map of your state to the PDA's memory card? Forget it. With a 14 Megabyte map of two New Jersey counties, the PDA is already on its knees.This software might be a tolerable alternative to using MapQuest and taking some printouts in the car.

The voice commands are very nice (along with the routing), making the program a better choice for those who need those features. Otherwise Streets and Trips is a better choice for handhelds and definitely a better choice for laptops since it has the routing and voice commands for laptops. Overall I am pleased with the program due to the added extras that S&T does not have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain awful","review":"This software is simply unusable.

Downloaded is slow for any large metropolitan map area like Boston or San Francisco. Once a map in loaded one can route on the Pocket PC but I had the Axim never complete many times after waiting over 15 minutes. I had to do a hard reset to get out of it. Cancelling the routing did not work.Also, when the routing did work I found that it often made poor route selections. For instance routing from Southborough, MA to a zoo in Southwick (only about 40 miles), it chose to use a state route parallel to I495 and jumped on and off the expressway rather than using I495 for the entire route.Not worth your money in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incompatible wit Windows Mobile 5.0","review":"Street Atlas 2006 Handheld will not connect to your bluetooth port if you are running Windows Mobile 5.0, so if you're using a bluetooth GPS you're SOL with this product.Delorme is aware of this huge issue, but continues to sell the product.

I would expect better from Fleming, but after hearing this, I think she has really lost it. I guess her album of Disney tunes will be coming soon.She should stick to opera, or whatever it is that she can do well. This cheap imitation of Phoebe Snow does her no favor. Even in the classical selections here, Mahler etc, she sounds so artificial and overdone. She also has a tendency of trying to color every note, to the point that any sense of musical line, or meaning behind the words, is totally lost.And why does she have to sing so close to the microphone? So close, \\"the world is your laryngologist.\\" I guess it's because she cannot really sing that low without resorting to studio tricks.I can see why opera fans would be baffled and offended by this album. I don't see how any jazz fan would like it, either, not when there's so many really great jazz singers out there, in the real world. Pass this one by a wide angle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Here is why I love this cd: most opera singers, when they decide to delve into other styles, sound like opera singers singing jazz, pop, rock, what have you. Renee fleming does not sound like an opera singer trying to sing jazz with a big vibrato and no feel for the style. I didn't even know it was her when I first heard it! She lost herself in the style and sounds great. Her voice is low and sexy--a far cry from her opera voice. I love singers with great versatility--most are one trick ponies!Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eeeeeeeeeeewwwwwww","review":"Ugh. Like a manufactured home vs. a stick-built house, Fleming's manufactured (aka \\"training and technique\\") blues voice compares unfavorably to other jazz/blues singers/lounge acts.

Took the CD on a road trip and had to pull over and remove from queue--either that or drive into a wall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fleming Should Not Be Singing These Songs","review":"Renee Fleming is a remarkable classical singer, but this music is not for her. One need only listen to a few bars of \\"In My Life\\" to realize that she's trying much too hard and completely missing everything this song is about. She tries to make up for her insecurity by overemoting and overdramatizing virtually every song. It just doesn't work. One doesn't have to copy the original versions or even styles of these songs, but you do have to have some sense of their rhythm, meaning, etc. Dawn Upshaw is someone who gets it. Unfortunately Renee doesn't, and it's really quite painful to hear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lovely, But Empty","review":"I am not upset with Fleming's choice of material - she is ever tasteful - but I am upset with the fact that she approaches this material as she does everything else she sings. It is too thought-out rather than felt. She provides a glimmering, glamorous surface to each song, many of them sung at funereal tempos, but invests these songs with no depth, only a self-conscious, self-regarding - if lovely - pseudo-serious generic polish to each number. She is a singer who is all affect, to little effect. Everything here is beautiful, but she reveals not one moment of emotional honesty or artistic risktaking in this entire high-toned enterprise."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the albums of the year","review":"Having read in Ms. Fleming's book about her beginnings as a jazz singer, and the great love she has for contemporary music, I was very curious about this album. So few contemporary pop and/or jazz singers have really good voices, and most opera singers who try to sing pop/jazz are clueless. Renee handles this material with style and grace. I hope to hear more from her in this genre. Give \\"Haunted Heart\\" a listen-I don't think you'll be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I was disappointed in this CD.

I am surprised at the recording company for letting this release out to to public."},{"rating":"1","title":"bizarre vocals","review":"Why is she trying to sound like a third rate Sarah Vaughan? Fleming's performances are scratchy sounding, tired and dead. This album is an embarrassment. It's only too obvious that she has no feel for the material and is faking it. Perhaps this is some contagion she caught while working with the increasingly sloppy singing of the boob-baritone Bryn Terfel on their live duet album. For a start, sing in your own voice Renee (p.s. you're not black), and just get the feeling right. If you think you're slumming, your listeners will also hear you slumming. I guess next we'll have Ramon Vargas boo-boo-boo-booing like Bing Crosby.

One of the best jazz/ballad discs I ever listened to. Her voice and sense of melody and swing is in the level of Sara Vaughn's and Ella Fitzgerald. And Fleming's voice is far ahead than those of her present competitors. Abstract: Mrs Fleming, PLEASE make a new CD (and I would add: SACD) with serious Jazz people. Look at your marvelous performance in your track in Charlie Haden's group \\"Sophisticated ladies\\". And please, don't listen to the blind guys that speak abourt \\"crossover\\". And coming back to this CD: It is one of the best jazz/ballad discs I have listened to (and they are a lot)A word about her second intent: Dark Hope.

I really enjoyed this cd with the lights turned down and a glass of wine to relax after a very stressful day at work. Renee could definitely have another singing career outside of opera should she choose. Hearing her drop that gorgeous voice down one octave rivals the best chanteuses in the business - Cassandra Wilson, Nancy Wilson, Regina Belle, Sarah Vaughan, etc. This cd of different musical styles reminds me of Nina Simone and Cassandra Wilson, two great singers whom could interpret any song genre and make their versions special. I loved all the songs and the standouts here are \\"Haunted Heart\\", \\"River\\", \\"My One and Only Love\\", \\"My Cherie Amour\\", \\"Cancao do Amor\\", and Beatles \\"In My Life\\", and \\"Hard Times Come Again No More\\".I hope Renee keeps recording whatever catches her fancy because I'll certainly always listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"I really wanted to like this. I am not a great fan of Ms Fleming's opera work. I find her pretentious, syrupy, sugary and sentimentalized. Also, I watched her last year sing \\"Silent Night\\" on TV and it was just awful. I know she has lots of fans, and I am so sorry because I so wanted to love this new style for her. But, yet again it was just impossibly earnest. No lightness of touch and pathos for the material, just a dirge, especially \\"Answer Me\\".Even \\"River\\" -- husky and long breathy notes does not a style make. Apart from the great Joni Mitchell, just listen the Sarah MacLachlan's recording and it breaks your heart. Renee Fleming does not convince. Overly rehearsed and too pre-conceived without any spontaneity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, I am a die-hard opera fan","review":"People say such ridiculous things about this album! On one side, you have opera fans who are ringing the tears out of their hankies and on the other side, you have some pop fans thinking 'Well, that was a nice attempt.' People need to stop being so judgemental and realize that this opera singer would be nothing without these songs. These songs were there for her in the very beginning when she was moving through Juilliard. Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, Renée was not always the vocal star we know and love. She had to work to get through school too; so Renée sang in night clubs to make the dough. She's singing songs that speak to her soul...Isn't that what music is about? The emotions that are stirred within us? These emotions aren't only within the listener but also within the artist. I love all of her albums. Bring 'em on again, Renée!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking","review":"Though a diehard Renee fan, I have to admit this CD took me by surprise. Having heard classical singers apply their well-meaning and solid techniques to music outside their normal realm of performance, usually to disasterous and comedic result, I was immediately skeptical. This album is in a word astonishing. Haunting, indeed! - the first two tracks alone are worth the price of admission. Once you pick your collective jaws off the floor after exclaiming \\"THAT's Renee FLEMING??!!\\", you will settle into a wistful, possibly melancholy mood of gratitude and awe at a performer who is an inspiration to singers of all generations."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is absolutely horrendous","review":"I can't say I know much about opera. I purchases \\"Dark Hope\\" based on a NPR interview and thought it was interesting. So, I thought I'd give this puppy a try. I am a big fan of several of the composers of the pieces on this disk. (Jimmy Webb's \\"The Moon is a harsh mistress\\", Joni Mitchell's \\"River\\", Lennon and McCartney's \\"In My Life\\".) Renee does not know how to sing these with any sense of intimacy or they type of feel that this material calls for. She just tries way to hard to sound emotional and sincere and just ends up sounding silly.Bill Frisell does okay on the album, but if you want to hear him play, you should just get on of his disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Renee","review":"I did not like this album one bit, or one song. I had a hard time listening to it all the way through. I certainly would never listen to it a second time. Affected and pretentious. Miss Fleming has a beautiful voice, but not here.

Bravery, fun, and talent combined by artists and for people who are listening. Hearing long time favorites Mehldau, Hersch, and Frissell is all the more sublime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly beautiful!","review":"Finally - an opera singer who doesn't have to \\"cross over\\" to sing jazz! Anyone who has read Ms. Fleming's book (The Golden Voice) will remember that her original career path was going to be jazz, and she performed regularly with a jazz group. In this album, Ms. Fleming simply returned to her roots and brought to them her flawless technique and seasoned understanding. Her voice on this album is sensuous and warm and invites the listener to share experiences rather than just listen to a collection of songs. This CD is not only good listening, but it is a textbook in singing in general. Classical singers and the young group of jazz singers coming up - please listen carefully.

It's a cookbook where half the recipes are from well-reknowned chefs exposing their true form, and the other half are Bittman's adulterated versions that are nothing like the original. In some he doesn't have the same method or technique; in others he doesn't even use the same base ingredient. It's like comparing apples to motor oil. Complex to Simple? Of course it's simple if you remove 90 percent of what was in the original!

I tried both and at the end decided to go with the MD671. I agree with the Pros and Cons of the other reviews already posted about this phone and have the following to add:One thing that irks me about the MD671 is that caller ID numbers are not looked up in your phonebook entries. That is to say, if an incoming call matches a phonebook entry, the name is NOT displayed -- only the phone number is displayed. I don't understand why they left this out. All of my old (cheaper) phones did lookups... sigh.However, at the end the Pros outweigh the Cons. The MD671 has a nice feel to it (although the KX-TG5100M is thicker and thus is easier to keep between your head and shoulder), and it comes with a NiMH battery and not NiCd. The voicemail indicator and blue glow is nice too. :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great phone","review":"I think this is a great phone, worth the money spent even without the rebate. I love it's many features that are similar to cell phones, like being able to store a number after dialing it and giving it the person's name whose number it is.I like being able to delete a single number when you've mis-entered someone's phone number (you meant to hit 4 but hit a 5 instead). You can delete that 5, and re-enter a 4. No need to hang up and start over.I also like how it has a ring/vibrate feature. Handy when I'm outside mowing grass and waiting for a call but would never hear it even if it were clipped on.The only con I see with this phone is it's heavier than other cordless phones I've had.The reception is clear and it has a long range.I'd give this phone 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not attractive as wall phone","review":"I bought this to use as a wall phone.

In order to make the hiss go away I have to turn the handset volume way down, and then I have trouble hearing the person on the other end of the phone. And my hearing is just fine. So back it goes.

I am tired of having to buy a new phone every six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability not great and where's the service?","review":"I purchased the base unit plus an extra handset. The functions are nice, but I've had some problems that bug me. When the phone is in use, a blue light flashes on the base unit. There have been several times when the phone indicates that it is in use, even though no one is using it. I check the handsets and other phones in the house and all are properly 'hung up'. After pushing the on/off button a couple of times on the Motorola handsets, the phone 'hangs up'. This is a pretty big problem because the line is busy during this time, which means missed calls.The second problem is with the speakerphone on the handset. Great feature, but sometimes it fades in and out, I notice this happens when the handset moves,like when you go to put it down or walk with it.So I sent two emails to Motorola's customer care about this and have received absolutely no response."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived quality","review":"The phone has cool features that worked fine while it lasted...1 year 9 months after purchase, base stopped charging the handset.

I previously had a 900 MHz phone which worked fine until the keys failed and I was looking for a replacement. I selected the Motorola phone as it was advertised as a pure 5.8 GHz phone. Some other phones sold by AT&T; and Uniden identified that they use other frequencies like 2.4 GHz in addition to 5.8 GHz and so I eliminated these from consideration.Overall the performance has been good.

That means, for all you wireless network users, that this phone will most likely play havoc with your signal until you play with your network to fix it. You CANNOT modulate the phone's signal to fix it. It's a real bummer.Everyone should know this before buying it -- it's a pity Motorola chooses to hide this fact, because for someone like me, I had to choose between my wireless network or the phone.

After about a year, another phone was becoming noisy. Now after 14 months, I have 3 phones that are unusable because of noise (the basement one got worse). This is two months after the warranty period and Motorola has no interest in replacing phones just out of warranty. I had previously respected Motorola as a good name in communications.

As a former evolutionist, I can tell you--the book is not as full of bull as most evolutionists will insist. A realization that the fossil record cannot account for creation invokes fear and hatred from those who hold that theory dear. This book does a fine job bringing that theory into question with consistent focus on the lack of evidence in the fossil record. As Gish aptly states, the fossils don't support the theory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"How can one rate highly enough this fantastic book by Dr. Gish? Indeed! When it comes to disproving evolution, there are few books which can equal this one in both science and logic.

Instead of looking at facts and trying to come up with a model to explain them, it combines out-of-contexts citations with a very selective look at the massive amount of fossil data that is available today to try and sell its doctrinal message.This book will no doubt rejoice those who view the creationist agenda as a praiseworthy religious endeavour. It will be discarded as nonsense by serious scientists (or even by serious 8th graders, as was illustrated by one of the other reviews). It will definitely not be helpful to someone who wants to understand what the theory of evolution is about or whether it makes sense; for that, one would be better served by actually looking at the fossil data and make up one's mind. Even a cursory glance at human fossils is sufficient to realize that Mr. Gish's arguments aren't based on much solid evidence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete nonsense!","review":"It is difficult to believe that someone with the credentials claimed by Mr. Gish could exhibit such a lack of knowledge concerning the fossil record and evolution. Mr. Gish cites example after example claiming \\"no transitional fossils exist!\\" when in truth many examples exist. He also finds it convenient to quote evolution scientists out of context. I'll quote Gish out of context:\\"we have biased our choice of examples in such a way that only those cases have been cited where transitional forms have not yet been found, while failing to mention many other examples where transitional forms between basically different kinds of animals or plants are known.\\" (Page 229)This book, while amusing in its naiveté, is a waste of reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would've put down 0 stars!","review":"THis book is nothing but a load of misinterpretations, misqoutes, and general misinformation.

At one point Gish compares the plight of creation science to that of Galileo... carefully omitting that Galileo had to fight against church doctrines to get the truth out. Using outdated quotes and facts she tries to prove that Evolution is utterly wrong. Anyone who actually considers this information factual should read the original edition, which has even more ridiculous claims. Of course, those claims were left out in this edition, I wonder why... A good companion book is \\"Science on Trial: The case for Evolution\\" as it destroys the arguments presented in \\"The Fossils say No!\\" and presents a factual basis for its own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hogwash? The Facts Say Yes!","review":"This updated version of his earlier book provides nothing that wasn't already nonsense before. Gish continues his long-standing tactic of misquoting out of date books and simply ignoring or even distorting the actual data regarding the fossil record. Even hard-core creationists are unlikely to find much worth saying about this book since it simply repeats the standard creationist dogma (\\"no transitional fossils....no transitional fossils\\"...repeat until your audience is bored) without even trying to force more recent evidence to fit into his twisted version of pseudo-science. It seems that he merely removed parts of the original version of the book which were so astoundingly false that even he was unable to defend them with a straight face. I might classify this table leg-leveler as humor if it weren't taken as real science by so many naive and uninformed members of the public. Suffice to say that science isn't the least bit worried.

That pretty stupid, Causes have effects evidence exists because there where events that cause it to spring into being.

Another reviewer says that mammal-like reptiles are mosic fossils, perhaps he thinks they are conglomerations of two fossils, but sadly(for christians) they are only one. And these fossils contain both mammalian and reptile charctaristics, so dispite there transitional nature, they aren't transitional forms.

Most of the time he played beautifully, but for this recording it doesn't sound like he put in 15 minutes making sure the notes were securely in place. His trademark elegance & brio are undermined by technical sloppiness. Imagine a great actor who learned a famous role long ago and has agreed to perform it again, but doesn't bother going over it to make sure it's going to be good.Instead, go for Rampal's other Mozart recording (with Paillard, on Erato) or Emmanuel Pahud (with Abbado / Berlin Phil., on EMI)."},{"rating":"1","title":"SUPER GROUP?

Heavy rock watchers should also notice ex-Gillan bassists John McCoy's involvement. I've always loved Terry Smith's guitar playing, fluid and exceptionally fast he should be spoken of in the same awe as say-Allan Holdsworth (proof? 'sector 47' on If 4) on this his guitar playing is fine paticularly on 'hungry horse' but te whole album is let down by below par songwriting. It just isn't very good. The Osibisa influence outweighs the If's and it shows 'Mr J' is plain tedious and Dave Quincey's tenor is used more as a background influence which is a shame, his solo's with If were always a high point. I brought this on vinyl when it came out and wasn't impressed and now thinking maybe i made a mistake i've brought this reissue. It still is a mistake.

Not only is it nearly impossible to get all of the soap out with you shower, but the crap is making me dreads frizzy and causing them to come undone. I have had my dreads for YEARS and never run into something like this. You definitely get what you pay for.

Nope. As everyone has stated the picture quality is HORRIBLE. Unless you have the perfect light then don't bother taking the picture. The flash (like stated) washes out faces or it's dark. The time between flash and actual picture is crazy. I have bought brand new batteries only for it to shut off 30 seconds later. The settings reset with every picture. It's a horrible, horrible camera. I have lost many photos with this camera and would do better with a disposable. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst purchase ever","review":"We got this camera for a very low price, but never have I stayed so bitter about a purchase for so long. Photos without flash are invariably blurry, photos with flash or outdoors are ridiculously overexposed, and sometimes still blurry! Even the simplest photos in ideal conditions come out horribly. I have bought and used several different cheap/lower end digital cameras, but this is the most horrible product I have ever laid hands on. If anyone knows how to file an official complaint with Polaroid (that they'll pay attention to), let me know. I should never have opened that packaging."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"The camera arrived with such poor instructions that I was baffled about all of the specifics. Everything clearly labeled on the camera was identified in the \\"User guide\\" but the more detailed functions were not described anywhere! I did some research from the Polaroid site, but it did not help either. I thought I was crazy because I could not make the pictures come out right (even though I have used digital cameras before!)-then, I finally realized that the thing was broken and the company refused to take it back because I was past my 30 day return allotment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"I purchased this camera 'on sale' as I didn't have previous experience with a digital and didn't want to spend a lot of money. Wish I had spent the extra money as I will now be doing so anyway. The picture quality is not very good. Even using a flash indoors when the lighting is not 'perfect' the quality of the photos is bad. The best pictures you can take with this camera are outdoors in the daylight, and don't think of using at night -- even with the flash, pictures don't show. When using a flash indoors, don't get very close -- they come out way too bright; however, without you can't even see one's face!

This kit is really junky. Besides the tint itself, it came with some really cheap half hearted wax strips on plastic that I don't see how one could use for accurate waxing - just a long rectangular strip. No ones eyebrows are straight like that.The tint itself is more like almost black. I don't know what their \\"light brown\\" is like. I found that as a natural blond, in a pinch, if I leave it on for 10 SECONDS it will not look weird.

I was reading other reviews and there are a lot of people saying that it dyed their skin. You can not use the wooden stick provided to apply the dye. It will dye your skin. I use an old mascara brush washed out. You dip in in the dye wipe off the extra like you would mascara. You brush it on without getting it on your skin. wait 1-2 minutes and wipe off. Works great.

I thought for the price I'd try it, maybe do it as an easy workout on days I don't feel like it, but it really is a fun workout, and it got my heart rate up. With all the jumping and strutting around I felt like I worked harder than some of my other dance workouts. The instructor is fun and the people she dances with are cutesy without being over the top annoying. The moves are fun and easy to learn. I didn't realize how long the workout was when I ordered. I enjoy when you don't have to do the warmup select a section, select another section, select a cooldown. You just kind of jump in and keep going! Fun moves. Fun all around. Very enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets your heartrate up, but is complicated","review":"I'm sure this is a great DVD for more coordinated people, but it makes me feel even more clumsy than normal. It gets my heart rate up, but is hard to follow. I always feel like I'm a step behind. Plus, the girls on the video are rather obnoxious (not only because they are skinny and perky). It may be more enjoyable once I did it enough to learn all the moves, but I don't know if I will ever use it often enough for that to happen. Overall, I would not recommend this DVD unless you are a skilled dancer/ athlete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Intolerable","review":"I work with my hands and develop a lot of stress in my upper body during the day. I would not do this workout if you have shoulder or neck tension on a regular basis. There are a lot of bizarre shoulder rolls, and I am in absolute agony right now.Beyond that, I cannot stand the instructor's voice or demeanor, which is a huge consideration for videos that are meant to be watched repeatedly. I participated in the warm-up for two minutes before I had to eject the disk to escape her squeaky voice (the pain set in a few minutes later).I like Crunch workout products in general, but this one is a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I agree with the 3 stars, and I'll even go lower. I LOVE most of the Crunch workouts - I have a bunch. This one, though, was really disappointing. Like another reviewer, I didn't think there was anything \\"go-go\\" about it - the music was something you hear at a retirement home, the women in the workout were absolutely ridiculous, and the dances were far from challenging - even the warm up didn't warm me up. If you really want a workout stick to the Boot Camps, the Total Resculpt and the Cardio Sculpt. I also really like the ones with Ellen Barrett which I alternate with the more challenging ones - and my latest favorite is the Bikini Body one. I didn't care for the Salsa one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best crunch video out there.","review":"I get easily bored with exercise, so it's always a struggle for me to find something that I like. I also, admittedly, am a bit on the lazy side, so if there's something I find boring, I tend to stop right away. This video kept my attention for about 3/4 of the time. The routines were a bit too repetitious for me. But the real reason I had to stop was not because of the dancing itself, but because the girl in the pink pants and green top annoyed me so much. I couldn't help but watch her. It was like a bad accident where you couldn't tear your eyes away. Honestly, I think that if I wasn't so fixated on her, then I would have enjoyed the video a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Colors","review":"This head wrap definitely looks better on the mannequin than it does on me or would on anyone else. I think there must be a bate and switch because the wrap I got is more of a yellow leopard print and does not even look close to what is shown in the picture.

This phone has great features and is attractive and expandable. We picked this one on a whim at the store because it stood out as small enough to fit into a pocket, yet had every feature we wanted. We loved everything about it except for the fact that it didn't reach from one end of the house to the other. A phone that can't do that in a 1500 square foot house isn't any good to me. Even with the phone in the middle of the house it lost reception in parts. If you have a small or medium sized apartment this is probably a great choice, especially if you want multiple mailboxes. I do agree with a previous reviewer that there was static in the background which I noticed right away. It was more like low-volume white noise then static, and thus it didn't really bother me, and I would have kept it if it weren't for the limited range. A phone shouldn't have that happen either, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've not had the reported problems","review":"I bought this phone without doing my research before hand based on the great features, sale price, and the look of the phone. Got home, and read the two reviews here. After about six weeks, I can not report any of the problems the first two reviews reported. If I start to have problems, I'll update this review. For my part, I am very happy with this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!! Bad reception. TWICE!","review":"I bought this phone because I thought the three mailboxes would be nice to have. But when the reception is so bad that no matter where you put the base or how close you are to it there is static, it is not worth it. It also has a feedback that causes your words to be echoed back to you. I bought two of these phones, each from a differnt store to make sure that I had not simply gotten a defective one and found the problem to be the same on both. Also I charged both phones for 16 hours, per the instructions, before trying them. This phone is a failure. A lot of great features, but the most important reason you buy a phone is to be able to hear what the poeple who are calling you say. Who could use a phone for more than 30 seconds with so much feedback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad range, noisy reception","review":"It looses reception easily once you get to the other side of the house. Motorola tech support had us power it down, etc, but nothing improved. Basically, he said too many devices use 5.8 Ghz frequency, so there's higher possibility for interference. I doubt that though, as other phones seem to work just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Bad But Not Worth It","review":"My wife and I purchased this phone from Best Buy about 6 months ago and ran into some of the same troubles as the ones listed above(and below), but we have a few more interesting problems that are really annoying. First, the second handset doesnt sit correctly in the base and makes the connection to charge noise constantly! you have to set it in there just right to make it stop. Secondly, our numbers are extremely hard to enter and when it does enter, we get a few extra numbers added to the sequence. not a bad phone but i think were going to try a new set very soon! hope this review helps"},{"rating":"2","title":"I can talk to my parents now!","review":"I am a student from outside the US and I study here.

The shipment (international) was for free and so was the first month, so we can try this thing out. it's really cool the way it works. I call them from my home phone at the price of a local call, and they pick up the phone at my home country! if they want to call me, they do it for a very low rate (we bought a plan that gives you a phone number and 800 minutes a month to the US for $15 total). to sum it up, i'm really happy with this service. the quality is good and i can talk to my parents whenever i want to, without thinking of the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Linksys Phone Adapter PAP2 - VoIP phone adapter - Ethernet, Fast Ethernet","review":"I needed an unlocked liksys pap 2, this one is locked and its useless for me.

It cleans and revitalizes my face like nothing out there. First, it gets rid of all the gunk in my pores including blackheads. Never before have had such clean, clear pores. Second, it helps with sun damage and overall look of your complexion. My face really looks younger and more glowing every time I use it.Finally, it only takes 5 minutes or so. The directions say to do this 2 minutes on each area of the face. So I do it for about 5 minutes and cover all of my face. There's no need to overdo it - in fact, I've read it's bad to overexfoliate so just limit to 5-10 minutes on your whole face and you're on your way to a new you!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do a thing","review":"Can't believe I ever wasted money on this thing. I used it twice and ended up donating it to Goodwill. I didn't particularly care for the scent of the cleanser and found it labor intensive to use, the product also lacks a timer to let you know when to move on to another part of your face (like the clarisonic does).

Neutrogena MicroDermabrasion System gently exfoliates without leaving undesirable traces on my face - no red spots, no breakouts, no dry flaky skin.

In one of his few interviews, he said that he had only intended to release one album, but after he got a few good reviews, he decided that he better keep on going. Since this album has come out, he has released an average of two albums a year. Anyway, Jandek's second album is even less accessable than his first album, if that's possible. It has a similar sound to the first album, with strange lyrics whispered/mumbled while accompanied by seemingly random notes plucked on an out-of-tune guitar. But somehow, it is even harder to listen to than the first album. Jandek is definitlely an acquired taste. Here is the track listing:1. Feathered Drums2. Point Judith3. I Knew You Would Leave4.

When he finds out his dad had a sister he never heard about, he tries to figure out what happened. He's in a play, and the whole script of the play is at the end of the book. He feels invisable with all his brothers and sisters, and he imagines a lot, which gets him the name \\"Fog Boy.\\" I really don't understand what people see in this book. There is a lack of feeling from Leo. He doesn't really say much in the book, and he doesn't replay things in his mind like he's supposed to. Instead, he imagiens what he wished would've happened.

Otway is bulging with \\"characters\\" and apparently, this is not a change from past days.While this little volume (mine is in hardcover, a green binding) is not terrifically authoritative, being self-published, the author still does a great job of holding one's attention.

Thnaks to my linguist friend Doug for giving me the Q-T on that.Back to the album. The addiotional tracks not found on their full length previous cd's Mysterious Drug Store and All I Want For Christmas are a mixed bad. Mysterious Drug Store is not a great song.

The consist of Gemma- Drums, Alex- Guitar/Vocals, Sam- Bass/Vocals and Shelly- Guitar/Vocals. There vocals are beautiful, nowhere is this more evident then in the rapid fire change between layedback feel to thrash feel in 'Distinction'. Gemma can way hold her own as a drummer, she is fantastic. She gets to show off her chops with some awesome tom fills in 'Allergy', which is more subdued, as is Mountain. Overall, this single is a good buy, but if you're not really a hardcore fan, wait for the album. These girls can rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD every violinist should have in his/her collection","review":"I agree with the review that Felix Perng wrote concerning the annoying G string buzz due to bow pressure. That is really my only complaint about this recording. I have compare Midori's recording of the Paganini Caprices to several other recordings. This one has a more \\"live\\" sound quality than many other recordings. Midori performs with a sparkling tone and bullseye accuracy. Caprice 24 in a is truly a marvel to listen to. Midori's left hand pizzicato is nearly divine. If you are looking for a masterpiece recording that showcases the violin and ways of exploiting the violin's capabilities, look no further. The caprices are for violin solo, meaning no accompaniment, not even piano. This allows for every nuance and subtlety to shine forth. Midori took on this challenging music with stunning results."},{"rating":"2","title":"simply the best","review":"This 24 caprices totally marks all the requirements. Her expression comes so vivid through perfect control of the music. She really pays attention to all the details Paganini specifically marked, and she does it so perfectly.

I strongly recommend this one to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astounding Paganini Caprices from a 21-Year-Old Violinist","review":"Ouch! Midori recorded the complete Paganini caprices when she was only 21 and still young enough to think that they are just another bunch of tunes. She spins them off like an old pro---full of gypsies, pyrotechnics, devilish double stops, and a lot of scales in-between. Occasionally she overplays her instrument, causing a harsh scratching sound. Who knows--maybe this is intentional and faithful to the way the devil, Niccolo Paganini, played them himself. I found Midori to be everything she has been cracked up to be: a true wunderkind virtuoso on the violin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A flawed recording","review":"Midori is quite capable technically of playing all of these very difficult pieces, she is fluid and graceful (if passionless) but I have one major beef with this recording, there is very annoying \\"tick\\" sound throughout the recording. I'm not sure if this is something wrong with her bow or what, but it drove me crazy the first time I listened to it and I can't listen to it any more because of that. I can't believe that made it to the final recording. Try the Salvatore Accardo recordings, you've never heard such passion in violin playing, the man is possessed."},{"rating":"1","title":"How We Got Here","review":"Chuck it.

An awful lot of traditions, and social norms, and political, civil, and infrastructural trends were forever broken or altered in the seventies, a lot more than the sixties, the supposed great decade of radical change and revolution.Overall, a good read. The sections on activist judges and the civil rights movement and the school riots in Boston was especially enlightening. A good book, but hard to categorize--not truly a history book, not popular reading, and not especially light reading or fun fare.

There is little or none of that, so what's the point? I've read histories of the '70s before (cf. Peter Carroll's \\"It Seemed Like Nothing Happened\\").

The first CD contains 25 minutes of audio interview with Manson, the sound is good, except when everyone starts talking at once and the sound is just not clear, but when Manson speaks induvidually you can hear what he is saying clearly. The concert footage is of early Spooky Kids stuff including White Trash and Cyclops. There are two sections with interviews with Missie Romero talking about Manson and how they met.

When I need to use the printer I have to pull the cover from the back to the front and roll it down like a pair of pants leaving the bottom of the cover still tucked under the front of the printer. While that's not a major problem, I did expect the cover to fit differently. That's why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5.

He is descriptive and interpretative. His voice is gentle and melodic and can also boom like a sonic blast basically riveting me in my chair with awe as tears well up. Go figure! He brings forth a compelling intimacy to his songs that I really don't know how to describe. As though the timbre of his singing tells a story as much as the lyrics. It works for me so much I can't fathom those that revile his music. Its like he's from a different generation. Perhaps a different genre.

Normally I love a good ol' southern novel and the thought of one with psychological trauma sounded too good to be true. (It was!) Very poorly written, and I have enjoyed Siddons before. Unbelievable, yet also boring story line, very stereotypical characters. Just not worth the time or money. Start with another Siddons: Low Country, Peachtree Road or Downtown. If you start with this one, it will be your last, I'm afraid. Pure southern crap with a dollop of boredom, topped off with a bit a racism. (So sorry, Ms. Siddons!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Saga of the Old South","review":"Fox's Earth is a great read centered in the old south with a host of dramatic and interesting characters. I love a good novel that takes you through the generations and teaches you the character's history along the way. Ruth, the main character, is so domineering and mean-spirited, but in the tradition of the old south, she plays a role where she hides her dark side very well. Rip, her long time servant, knows all her secrets and schemes and makes it her mission to protect the family. I would haven given it 5 stars but for the fact it does tend to go on and get a bit wordy in spots (you know the type....where it takes the author 3 pages to describe a tree). All in all, a great read and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Appalling, shocking . . . dreck.","review":"It is well written, with southern period vocabulary.

Now it no longer records on the DVD side, and you can't rewind VCR tapes anymore. Of course this all began about a week after the warrantee expired.

The walls seem to be reinforced to a degree that there is no danger for the little drives to break if dropped or crack inside a stuffed computer bag but they are likely to be crushed if stepped on. This holder is not expandable.I find the drive shuttle useful if one needs to keep up to 6 USB drives in one place and one is disciplined enough to return the USB drives to it when not in use.

Sure, it will hold six flash drives with no trouble, but if you have slim USB thumb drives, you can double them up in the middle pouches and stuff eight in with room for the neck straps.Like most Case Logic products, the JDS-6 is extremely well made, with a semi-rigid case and a stout zipper. I showed it to a coworker, who asked me to get her one, and I bought a second one for my home-collection of zip drives. I now have 14 drives nestled cozily in their pouches. That's way too many thumb drives -- now I'll have to buy some 64 GB drives.

These drives a slightly thicker than a pack of gum and are rubber coated. The size combined with the rubber coating makes them difficult to get into the mesh pouch. Not impossible, they don't just slide in like all my other flash drives.Overall I am very pleased with this well had flash drive carrier.

There is no extra protection this case provides. Of course I returned the product, but somehow it's my fault that the website doesn't give the dimensions of the actual HOLDING part of the case or say that this case doesn't really protect anything, I had to pay shipping to return it.You're better off putting your USBs in a dollar change purse."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke and waste of money","review":"Re: Case Logic USB drive holder.

Each drive fits snugly into an individual elastic net type compartment within the case then the case zippers shut. It's made for the full size drives but all sizes will fit. Here's a cool tip: Use labels to identify what's on the drive. I have a Brother label maker and I set the font to really small and attached the label to the drive so I can easily identify what's on it without placing it in the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"this lowly human bridge player has been educated :-)","review":"There are certain categories of bridge books, to which most of the genre belong; bidding, declarer play, and defense being the most obvious, of course. Bridge as entertainment is a category that is rarely attempted, and the best such books combine this entertainment with interesting deals or lessons. The exploits of Chthonic are probably more in the \\"interesting deal\\" category, but well worth the read. Of course, Bridge World subscribers will be familiar with a number of the stories, but having all of those together, along with some new ones, is a nice bonus for the reader.

It works if you are on a budget. If you get any fungus gnats, you will have a problem. There are a lot of wood bits and shavings in it along with some sand.I got an infestation of fungus gnats recently. The plants I used with this soil were doing fine until I got the infestation of fungus gnats. Because of the wood, there is plenty of opportunity for fungus to grow. I can't get rid of it, so the fungus gnat larvae has plenty to feed from. I'm trying some pesticide/fungicide that comes in granules. Hopefully it will work.I've never seen potting soil with wood and so much sand in it before this. I've seen other types that are amazingly worse than this potting soil. There isn't a lot of sand in it, but there is a decent amount that shows up after watering it over time.Overall, It is ok if you don't mind the wood bits all over the place. If you don't want fungus and soil that doesn't hold much water, stay away from this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for masonry","review":"After planting a peace lily in this soil I noticed a a complete lack of growth, it actually started dying. With no other options I pulled it out of the pot to be met with a mixture of clay and sand that could only be described as brick-like with a few twigs embedded in it. After breaking off the soil-like substance with a hammer I re-planted it with a different potting soil and had much better results. Stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good at all","review":"I really don't understand how Hyponex has been in business so long with such a bad product. It's like dusty sand, just awful. The best thing to do, if you can't find another brand, is just buy some good top soil at the lawn and garden store, some vermiculite, some perlite, and make your own blend. By the way, I've also tried the Hyponex Organic mix, which is an under-composted bag of clumps, and has the added bonus of containing fungus gnat larvae... I ended up having to throw away the plants that I potted with it in order to get rid of the infestation. I would avoid all Hyponex products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst potting soil ever","review":"I ran out of potting soil and this was on sale at my local store. Boy do I wish I had spent an extra 3 bucks! I potted three plants in this and two of them died, while one is in the process of dying from root rot. This stuff is like clay mud. The plants I put in it were the kind that need nearly constant moisture and need a soil that is always wet. Even they died. You'd be better off with ANYTHING else. Do not buy this unless you're trying to murder your plants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This \\"potting soil\\" is more like clay. You open the bag and it looks like a brick. You literally have to break it apart instead of pouring it out of the bag. I had to mix it with other soil just to be able to plant anything in it. I don't think it has any nutrients in it either. My plants seem to grow very slow in this compared to other brands. Do not buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Rain Soil?","review":"This soil felt and looked amazing when I first opened it. It was light and airy, seemed to hold moisture well without drying out too quick. But, the second it was rained on, it compacted down a full 2-3 inches. The only plants that have even manage to sprout were plants that were kept inside, away from the rain. They are now starting to wilt, droop, and turn yellow.Unfortunately, I used this soil for all of my containers. I will now have to spend nearly $200 (in addition to what I've already wasted on the Hyponex) to attempt to get a round of seedlings sprouted this season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than Dirt","review":"I'm reviewing dirt, here, let's keep in mind. And it's because the stuff is so bad, you'd do better to get dirt from a concrete island separating a 4-lane road than to purchase this product. The bags I bought were ~$5 at a local hardware store, so the price here is 2X that. Second, it is full of chunks of clay, wood, ROCKS -- several really large rocks were in the bags, that's how they get to 8 lbs... But the main problem is that I've never had success growing vegetables using Hyponex potting soil. I've had stellar success with enhanced/composted dirt from outside and from other potting soils. But vegetables (tomatoes, cucumbers and even peppers don't do well) consistently fail with Hyponex, so think about that before you invest in a porch garden with Hyponex! It's on my boycott list for life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible on its own, useful as a mix-in","review":"Ive used this stuff several times, usually purchased at a discount store. Learned long ago that attempting to grow anything in it on its own was a terrible idea. The soil is almost water repellant, almost fascinating really. But I discovered that it works great as one component of a mix when trying to grow desert plants. Tossing in a few handfuls of this with some coir or peat, bit of perlite, and some compost, makes the soil drain faster and help avoid drowning plants that are more suited to dry arid climates. Only reason I mention this at all is the soil tends to be cheaper than buying gardening sand. You may want to sift out the wood chips though. A bit of shaking and the stuff ends up with an inch deep layer of mulch on the surface."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted Potential","review":"This book had the potential to be very insightful and interesting, however upon reading it I found it very unsatisfying. While the concepts in it are interesting and deserve further attention, I found that there was little evidence for the claims being made. For a book preaching critical thinking about religion, the information was presented in a way that only a scholar of Ancient Egyptian culture would be able to verify. Also, most info was credited to only 1 or 2 sources, which left me wanting more. It seemed like a limited view was being presented. I was expecting a more thorough, in-depth look at this issue, not a glossy introduction."},{"rating":"1","title":"harpur is strange","review":"I am amazed at Tom Harpur.He knows nothing about Christ.I suggest that he should get in contact with some peoplewho are baptised in the Spirit to give the lost soulsome assistance.I never knew that trash was acceptable for publication.I suppose when you have a doctorate you have the rightto say anything.Throw the book in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"Mr. Harpur clearly doesn't believe in a literal interpretation of the Bible and that's ok because neither do I. But to imply that the stories in the Bible were written as a kind of collection of \\"myths\\" which nevertheless contain wonderful lessons we can learn from is absurd. Why then all the admonishments in the New Testament like \\"this is written so that you shall believe\\"? You are very, very wrong Mr. Harpur. Most of the Bible was meant to be taken VERY literally. Problem is that a literal reading of the Bible is incompatible with a modern worldview, so Mr. Harpur like other liberal theologians has to envelope himself in a theology which is little more than conjecture and personal opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshing addition to the thinking person's library","review":"This book satisfied my thirst for knowledge about the origins of Christianity.

Most of its points can/have been refuted by real academics, and it serves little more than to open up the discussion of pagan influences on Christianity.

The hood is impractical to use - it's literally putting a bag over your head. And that strap on the outside is short, which is not really convenient.

But if you are looking for a decent, versatile picnic blanket to keep in your car and put down when you want to have an impromptu stop at the park with the kids, this is what you want. As a \\"blanket\\" it would only be marginally functional because I don't think it is all that warm but better than nothing in a pinch. As a poncho, it is a bit awkward but again, functional in an emergency situation. As a picnic blanket it's just right and the size is much larger than most other blankets out there. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars is that it is a bit tricky stuffing it back into the built in pouch. I can see the pouch splitting over time if a person is not careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as blanket","review":"I bought this for its good price and the large size and its waterproof quality. But when you put it flat on the ground, the pocket thing in the middle along with the string and plastic piece holding the string together is extremley uncomfortable to deal with. It basically feels like you are sitting on a bulge right in the middle of the blanket and the plastic parts hurt whatever you are sitting on. So I end up putting another blanket over the middle of this blanket to minimize discomfort. Also, the fleece inside may be good for warmth, but as a summer picnic blanket it does not work so well because it's hard to clean it from grass and sand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product","review":"This is a very nice, warm, convienent blanket for the trunk of the car. Its a little tricky to fold the first couple of times, but after you've done it a few times its not bad. We have taken it to the beach, to the races, and a few other places. I highly recommend one for each person tho, because they are not really big enough for 2 people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"For the price, this is a great blanket. But for function, it's hard to figure out how to fold it. Kind of wish I got one with a separate pouch that I can just stuff it into.

Whatever the liner is made of, I doubt it's edible. The end of the relationship was swift and my lack of judgment embarrassing, but I've learned my lesson.

The dust cover, which is the dome-shaped plastic piece that pivots to allow you to drink, is incredibly fragile. I have broken two of these in the last month. I use the bottle while swimming and all I did, was to knock over the bottle on the pool deck while reaching for it. I didn't even drop it. To top it all off (no pun intended), the dust cover shattered into razor-sharp shrapnels, which cut my finger while I was cleaning up. Just imagine these shards on the pool deck with all these people walking about barefoot.The choice of plastic for the dust cover is a very poor engineering decision, given that the bottles are marketed to \\"Active\\" individuals.In general, the bottles are sturdy, albeit susceptible to dings, scratches and other exterior damage.

Why? It's more flexible. Use your thumb to press down on the release to allow sucking the drink from the bottle. That allows one-handed drinking from, say, a bike. Or, if you need to guzzle a lot of water, uncrew the sport top as you would with the loop top. With the sport top, it's easier to screw and unscrew because there's more for your hand to work with, IMO.

Part of the appeal of the exhibit was seeing the actual original manuscripts, jotted notes, and correspondence right in front of you, and in that regard, the book can not live up. It is, nonetheless, excellent in its scope and interesting in its reproductions of the material from the exhibit. It would be particularly appealing to students or enthusiasts of poetry, that is, those with a prior background knowledge of the poets included. It would be of less value to someone looking for an introduction to poetry.

A great book if (1) you want to use it as a source book or (2)want to know what stereotypes have plagued America's understanding of India, for the author regurgitates a lot of such stereotypes. The book makes notable departures from mediocrity, as when it discusses Nehruvian antecedents to Indias present policy, but is on the whole uninspired.

I challenge the author to provide evidence for his claim.The Tamil Tigers are not fighting for the separation of the Tamil Nadu state of India.

The style that he brings to LoTR is not present here, and it was very reminiscent (to me) of George McDonald, who is one of the authors that Tolkien grew up reading and enjoying.If you like George, I think this book will appeal to you.

Now I have to buy a new system, since I can only dial out on one of the four handsets.I purchased one of the extra handsets seperately at Target and its keypad is dead as well, so it wasn't just a bad batch from one run.

I had actually read reveiws and had told people to get Dora and Winnie the Pooh but they were unable to find them so they he got these games instead. The Wiggles and Bob the Builder games both lived up to their horrible reviews. Too hard for a three year old and they won't be interesting for an older child. However, the Barney game was a different story. My three year old loves this game. Yes the fundamental learning skill are very basic- counting, colors, letter recognition, etc- but the activities are really geared toward three year olds. There are actually some parts of the game that my son can play all by himself.

In January of 1943 General Groves ordered the commandeering of 670 square miles of Washington State land as \\"necessary to the public interest.\\" On it he built the Hanford plant to produce plutonium.Everything was done one a rush basis, and by 1945 something like 30 pounds of plutonium had been produced. No one knew if a bomb produced using plutonium would even work. About thirteen and a half pounds of it were used on July 16, 1945 at Trinity site. It worked. A duplicate of that device, with some streamlining and tail fins added was dropped over Nagasaki. It worked there too.This book is an oral history, a series of discussions with dozens of people who were working at or in conjunction with Hanford. It's a unique side to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting read","review":"Now the story can be told........For anybody who has an interest in the Manhattan Project, or the precursor to the DoE, the AEC, this is a great read. Not many people actually know the role of all the plants around the US, and this book pulls back the drapes on the 'canyons' that comprises Hanford.This book is a good addition to the library of any peron with an interest in the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this","review":"This product is made from quality ingredients, u need very little and it moisturizes your hair and scalp.

This seems true for all of the composer's work, as varied as it was. The 1st Symphony, a student composition, in Tilson Thomas's hands seems exactly the proficient but minor piece it was long regarded as. Mehta's rendering on Decca is infinitely more compelling, revealing it as one of the first outstanding American symphonies. Likewise, Tilson Thomas's rendering of the still astonishingly radical 4th does not come close to Stokowski's premiere recording on Sony (I hardly know what to think of the reviewer who finds problems with that recording's audio quality--it's powerful and absolutely first-rate) or Ozawa's thrilling version on DG. That last is paired (along with Ozawa's definitive take on \\"Central Park in the Dark\\") with a Tilson Thomas \\"Three Places in New England\\"--once again, unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"overpriced","review":"The attraction offered by the book is that within its covers, you can find a mass of detail about various IT companies. With various projections made by the author's company. Yet you may want to be cautious. A lot of the data about companies can now be easily obtained on the web for free. The basic financials and specialisations and product lines should be accessible this way.Now, for a small IT firm, getting enough information on it via the web can be problematic. But this book won't give it to you anyway. It only covers the top 500 IT firms worldwide, with an emphasis on US firms.Perhaps only if you have found in the past that the trends projected by Plunkett were accurate and useful for your needs, should you contemplate getting this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"was used :(","review":"Was very disappointed with the item.

After researching both on the net and on the web, I did not find anythying that was more sleek. When I got the bag it lived upto the reputation. It is real value for your money without compromising on the quality.I like the fact that in this stylish and small handbag there is just one compartment. Subdividing a small handbag is the way to render it totally useless because then nothing fits. It is just spacious enough to hold my wallet, a few accesories and a small water bottle and that is all I need when I have an occassion that needs a smart and small bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headache Case Studies","review":"This book is an excellent review of the spectrum of migraine and the current theories of pathophysiology.

The only way to communicate with the company is through e-mail on their web site. I left a complaint about the problem - they simply do not answer. There is no other way to reach the company, to get the device rapaired or replaced.Even when it \\"worked\\", I never could rely on it. The device does not know the differences between highway and downtown street, and always sends me to a very long way. Sometimes, the route it suggests has loops in it.

It always says that it can't find where we are and the screen goes gray. I am very frustrated with this product and do not reccomend it to anyone.I have found that the GPS systems built into cars work 10x better than my TomTom.SUGGESTION: When you buy your next car get it with navagation and in the meen time try a Garmin product instead. I've heard those work lots better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't see the screen during bright sunlight","review":"I bought the 700 and installed it. When I plugged it in, the light on the plug-in device didn't come on. Tried it in my car and one other....I then started to drive out on the road during a sunny day and couldn't see the screen. I had to pull under an interstate highway overpass to read the screen in the shade. This may work well in clouds or the dark, but not well at all in the sun. Sent it back next day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device","review":"I have used the TomTom 700 on a bunch of occasions, and have always found it to be a great device. When I describe the product to friends of mine that aren't familiar, I usually tell them about the time when I used it to find a B&B way outside of town in the boonies. I had forgotten a map, as I found out later, but the 700 helped us find our way it the middle of nowhere - which was really surprising and great. I don't know what we would have done if we didn't have it - I might have actually had to stop and ask for directions - but then again, who knows if that would have gotten us further lost. I won't go on long road trips without one. They are a lifesaver (especially when you need to re-route in a pinch), and are so easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY TOM TOM!!!!","review":"Well...this product looks great, but the love affair ended there. I was very shocked when I recently bought this unit and found out that the maps are very, very, VERY outdated. It seems as if they are from around 1990 as so many highway updates are not included. Subsequently, the device is more or less useless as every time it hits a new stretch of road or new on-ramp, it gets \\"lost\\" and stops giving directions.I contacted Tom Tom and even though they have newer maps and that they admitted that the maps in this piece of garbage are outdated--they had the audacity to tell me I had to purchase a new set of maps for $110.So, make sure you add $100 to trhe purchase price, because it will be completely useless out of the box!!I am a professional who drives daily over a 3 state region and will buy a Garmin and surely encourage you do the same!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"not a bad gps... but you can find something better.","review":"Despite other reviews, this gps nav isn't that bad at all. The menu system isnt as intuitive as a garmin, but overall it's pretty comprehensive and easy to learn. So far I've used a toyota nav, a garmin 2720, and the tomtom go 700. The handsfree calling via bluetooth is a great feature and so far it's given me great directions without the run around that sometimes happens with the toyota or garmin nav. i actually really like the 3D view of the maps... its very clear and pretty straight forward. Of course this unit doesn't come close to the ease of use or features that the other two have, but for the price it's not a bad deal.overall, i don't mind this unit at all(esp since i got it as a gift), but if you're gonna buy a nav, get a garmin nuvi."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy Product and No Customer Service","review":"I purchased this product on the recommendation of Amazon.com and have regretted it ever since. It's the worst consumer electronic item I have ever purchased. No wonder the price has dropped 50% since my purchase. They probably can't give them away. After about 90 days, the product goes completely dead. After contacting customer service, I was told to reset the product. Two weeks later it went dead again. The last time I went to the manufacturer's website, I couldn't even find any contact information for customer service. They must have so many complaints that they can't handle them. Not to mention product returns. Save yourself some money and a lot of grief. Buy a Garmin system. The graphics aren't as good. But at least it's reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible GPS and sub-par customer service","review":"I purchased a TomTom Go and have had problems with the touch screen ever since. It malfunctioned within 6 months of purchase and I had to send it in to be repaired, they said they were unable to repair it and sent me a brand new one. The new one began malfunctioning in exactly the same way within another 6 months. After the subsequent 6 months, I sent it back again for the same problem and they told me it was out of warranty and they no longer repair the TomTom Go but they would send me a newer model for an additional $300-400. Ridiculous, I have been trying to get some sort of satisfaction to no avail. I paid nearly $1000 for this unit when it came on the market and it never worked more than 6 months at a time. It would be best if this company went out of business in my opinion especially after reading the other reviews listed here. I am now having to \\"trash\\" my unit and buy a different, more reliable, brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs help","review":"My husband bought me this for Christmas because we were moving to a new city. He picked it out because unlike Garmin and Magellen it was created from the ground up for use on the road. The features are easy to use, the directions are great and when you need a new route because of roadblock or traffic - it really comes up with a great plan. However - my first one lasted 3 months before it died, I then replaced it with another one and it died 3 months later as well. I was very reluctant to buy a different brand - but had to for dependability. I still don't like my Garmin as much - but at least it works.

The tomtom website provide free update only for 910/510/One. I can not understand why this model is excluded from the free list. To buy a new map, you need to pay more than $100. It's terrible.

A trip to my work which is a straight shot with only 2 turns and 7.2 miles it planned a trip with over 15 turns and 11 miles out of the way. It also took me to the middle of nowhere on 2 different trips using their database of POIs. It had every store in the Oakbrook Mall as 5 miles south of their actual location.

Actually there is no way to do this except to off road. The whole area was well established more than 20 years. I do not know what kind of map system TOMTOM uses. I have to call this instrument a lethal weapon because it has asked me to do off road for many time. Maybe it is designed specifically for SUV.By the way, its customer services is unacceptably mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"device nice, but the maps are horrible","review":"TomTom has made a great device and nice interface, but the maps used in this device are horrible. To save money, they went with the very sub-par maps from Tele Atlas, rather than the much better maps from Navteq.Many of these Tele Atlas maps have parts that have not been updated in over 10 years.I encourage you to save your money - paper maps are better than the ones with all TomTom devices.

I tried it in three different states (MO, WI, TN) and it failed to get me to the correct address every time. Oh, it would get me in the general area OK, but the last turn or two were never right, usually sending me in the wrong direction and requiring me to get my bearings the old fashioned way (call, ask, or follow street numbers).

I continue to be surprised with the new routes I learn when using it, and am getting around much more efficiently.

Instead of presenting the designers' stationery on a neutral background so that it can be clearly seen and appreciated, the book's designer(s) fill the space around and behind the examples with bright colors and shapes, blown up logos, and other distracting clutter. No shadows, borders, or other delineating marks are used to distinguish the stationery from the background, making it difficult at times to even pick out what parts of the page are examples and what are just background \\"flourishes.\\"I recommend that instead of this book, people interested in designers' stationery and other self-promotional work look to design magazines like Step, Print, and Communication Arts for their annual reviews of the best in this and other design areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!!

Depends on what you are looking for!","review":"This book is beautifully laid out, the photography is well done and it would make a coffee table sparkle. But its usefulness is limited to new house construction, to people who like open floor plans, and for those who have the money to spend. I believe it will be of little help to anyone who is working with an older home and is remodeling rather than gutting it and starting over. Also I disagree with some of the layouts in kitchens, etc. as to how easy they are to access with a wheelchair or with a person whose disability prevents them from bending forward or side to side. There is inefficiency to have a person open two doors and then extend drawers. You can design drawers with a lower side to view contents. There were two photos that helped me to visualize concepts I had read about elsewhere. Is it worth your money?

The book it was based on was wonderful and informative. And Berlin itself is one of the most interesting and historically important cities in the world. So how can the film be so bad? It shows many, many buildings, landmarks and sites without telling you what they are and why they're important. I only know, from having read the book. This film seems to focus more on medieval history than on the last hundred years. It offers no insights and very explanations of why the building or site you're seeing is important. What a waste.

On merit, this release should already have hit the remainder bins."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Recording Is A Total Dud","review":"This recording is a total dud and is to be avoided at all costs. I think this is the worst performance of Scheherazade I have ever heard. It is the worst conducted and the worst played, even worse than the many quick, budget-label runthroughs going back to the 1950's with unknown orchestras and unknown conductors. Each of the standard Scheherazade recommendations vastly exceeds this lame performance. For a good unknown recording, try the Dorati/Minneapolis Mercury recording. Just about any performance from the past is superior to this. If modern sound is a major criterion, get the Chung on DG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Although I am a huge 24 fan, I was very disappointed with this book. This is not 24. First, there is too much vulgarity and profanity. I do not remember Operation Hell Gate being that way. Also, I was distracted by the writer's left-wing political views. Clearly, this is a person who opposes the Patriot Act, and the way we are fighting the war against terrorism. Can you really see this Kelly person being at CTU? Can you really see Senator Drexler being a \\"good guy\\" on a 24 episode? There were times when I felt like I was reading something by Michael Moore. Someone who thinks that the Patriot Act is the greater threat to our freedom, not people who want to kill us. The action was great, but when looking at the total picture, I would advise you not to buy/read this book. Marc Cerrsini has a new 24 novel coming out this Spring. He wrote Operation Hell Gate. I look forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really related to the show","review":"I agree that this book wasn't very well written. As a thriller, it wasn't that bad of a book, but as an 'episode' of 24, it wasn't good at all. The characters may have been named Jack Bauer, Nina Meyers, Tony Almeida, etc., but they weren't at all the same as the TV characters. They might have been named Joe Smith and Mary Jones for all the resemblance they had to their TV counterparts, which is none. Also, some of the mistakes made in this book were just plain stupid (check the president's itinerary, people!), and Jack and CTU really came off looking bad more than once. Lastly, there was no conclusion or closure, no tying up of loose ends; it just.... ended. I've read \\"Hell Gate,\\" and it was pretty good, and I'm looking forward to \\"Trojan Horse.\\" I'm sure I'll be able to give it more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a fan of the TV show I looked forward to reading novels based on '24'. The first book I read (Operation Hell Gate) was a decent novel and it supplemented the down time between seasons. With respect to this book, however, I would agree with other comments that have been made - generic thriller, plot holes, confusing timing, poor character development, inconsistencies, and some editing errors.I also have a personal gripe with this book (and others that are based on popular TV shows). Television is obviously regulated on what can be said and shown to viewers, and I wish authors would adhere to these same rules for the sake of consistency. For example, the language in this book is very graphic. Jack finds himself in the same stressful situations as seen on TV, yet in the novel he (and others) let the expletives fly. I found this to be very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is 24!","review":"The second of the declassified series, this books is far superior to the first, and keeps the tension going as fast as Jack's heartrate. Jack starts with a raid on a domestic militia group, but that same group has been tracking a terrorist sleeper cell. Hour by hour the plot unfolds, with Jack trying to stop the events planned for the day.The book only has one small problem, and that is with continuity. The EMP weapon has been used on the TV show, and with a reduced range compared to the one in the book. Still, the book is enjoyable, if somewhat pulp fiction, and fits into the world and theme of 24."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super DSL filter","review":"I bought this to replace a broken DSL filter and it is absolutely excellent.

For anyone living in California, it seems ironic that this book can touch on so many of the problems facing California now. It almost seems as if it were written yesterday. I find it strange that the author could have gotten this much information at a time when none of us gave a thought to where our power was coming from.

All the while his wife is suffering from cancer. Talk about misogynistic melodrama. The few snippets here and there of the fascinating world of electric power generation/consumption, politics and the environment is all lost in a hazy summer smog.

Witnesses are called, including his father Joseph, his mother Mary, Pontius Pilate, Charles Darwin and even Sigmund Freud. But then the ending! I really was hoping for so much more. It just ends, with a flash of lightning, and a one liner comment. Even with the one liner all in CAPITAL LETTERS, it didn't do anything for me. I was very disappointed. The authors should have been able to do a much better ending to this book than what they did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lights and Warn quality","review":"These lights are awesome.

The source of this was easily verified by substituting another power supply with similar rating I had laying around. The noise was even present when nothing is connected to the switch and all devices that would be connected are powered off.

So I plugged that cord into my htc's phone charger and plugged it into the switch.Back in action.It also worked via the pc's usb slot, which is surprising since I believe usb only gives 100ma if it does not give a data signal or something from a computer.

I was wrong.The 5-port model emits high-pitch noises when any of the front panel LEDs are turned on or off. The noise is emit from the base unit itself and not the power supply. Safe to say some people won't be able to hear this noise, but it's quite noticeable to those of us who have sensitive hearing. I had Amazon send me a replacement unit, which had the exact same problem. Interestingly enough, the DGS-2208 uses the same power supply as the DGS-2205. Therefore, I'm left to believe there's a hardware engineering flaw in the 5-port model.Other than this problem, the unit seems functional.

For me the cadence took some getting used to, although 20-odd years ago when I read more of the older fantasies and original materials it would not have seemed so odd. The wounded hero, Finn, is not weak, but a mixture of ignorant and arrogant, the way youth and beauty can and should be. I think it is a very good book, but it is not fast and easy going, and it is not just the same old same old rehash of Americanized pop pseudo-Celtic themes.

By today's animation standards, this series is almost unbearable to watch. The scripts were obviously written by people who only had very superficial knowledge of the characters. Dialogues and situations are so clumsy that they verge on parody. Although the characters designs are faithful to their comics look of the time, the animation is mediocre and \\"action\\" is reduced to a minimum. Limited animation was used way better on other Hanna Barbera productions such as Johnny Quest. So my advice is : if you have not watched this when you were a child, and if you enjoy \\"Batman the animated series\\" , \\"The adventures of Superman\\" , \\"Justice League\\" and the other great series produced by Warner in the 90s and later on, dont inflict this on you even by curiosity."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS SERIES ROCKS","review":"I REMEMBERED TAPING THE ENTIRE SERIES ON TV BACK IN THE 1990,S.THE STORY,ANIMATION,SUSPENCE,EVEN THE MUSIC WAS TERRIFIC.LEX LUTHOR ,THE RIDDLER,GROG THE GORILLA,CAPTAIN COLD,BLACK VULCAN,SUPERMAN ,AND MANY OTHERS WERE GREAT.THERE WILL NEVER B ANOTHER SERIES AS GREAT AS THIS.THEY JUST DON,T MAKE CARTOONS THIS GOOD ANYMORE,WHICH IS SAD.

The worst is the wonder twins. These aren't in the comics with good reason. Its a shame they had to put childish characters like this in place of the real heros.

The movie fails as comedy because Nello lacks any gravitas and his lust is merely pathetic. The movie fails as tragedy because Nello's experience does not change him. Instead of gaining maturity from his experience, Nello ends up happily sewing garments for the Pope in his father's shop - no more having an independent, creative life in Bologna.Most damning, it is impossible to identify with the main characters since they are so unrealistic. But perhaps in Berlusconi's Italy, a whorish young beauty and a feckless,immature man who never grows up are standard fare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless love, Italian style . . .","review":"This bitter-sweet love story is like a folk tale from another era - at least a century before the 1920s in which it is set. A 35-year-old tailor's son, played superbly by Neri Marcorè, with a modest innocence almost never associated with Italian men, is sent from Rome to Bologna to take a job as a classics teacher and to find a wife. There he meets and falls hopelessly in love, for the first time in his life, with a self-absorbed society girl, who happens to be blind - and in love with another man. Their relationship is both painful and poignant - played out at an almost dreamy pace against the more comic sexual antics of the supporting characters. Veteran actor Giancarlo Giannini, as the father, provides a comic energy of his own. As tailor to the Pope, he represents a vocation that has to my knowledge never been seen in a film before. The photography is lovely and the music rapturous.

This somewhat slender volume is a collective biographical portrait (not quite a study) of more than two dozen important figures surrounding the king, from the Catholic chaplains of his early reign to the calculating older men in his later years who made their fortunes from the acquisition of monastic lands. He also draws sharp distinctions between the pietistic old Yorkist families and the much more subtle \\"modern\\" families of the next generation.

Please Rick go back to the studio and perform your own songs...This album makes me want to \\"Cry\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rick Springfield-Rock Pro1","review":"I've been a Rick fan since 1972 with his, Speak To The Sky. You can still hear his encouraging voice throughout every song on this album. Getting his take on these ROCK CLASSICS is a must for any true Rick fan. say what you want about him, but he's got more guts than most of the pandering rockers out there. He's been at it so long, he has no need to pander. A truly unique songsmith/singer. I'm glad he has let his own skill/talent, drive his train and not something as fragile as an ego. Artist that are driven by that always end up ravaged by the idot \\"Rock Press\\" and the fickle taste of the record buying public. This album is a gold nugget of great grooves, songs that connect on a level few Rock musicians can pull of for an entire album of Songs.[...]."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job!","review":"Though I'm still waiting for a cd w/ all-Rick-penned songs, I really enjoy this cd. I like all of the covers. I especially like \\"I'm Not In Love,\\" \\"Holding on to Yesterday,\\" \\"Waiting for a Girl Like You,\\" \\"Let's Go Out Tonight\\" & \\"Miss You Nights.\\" But my fave from this cd is the only \\"new\\" song & the only one writen by Rick, \\"Cry.\\"Take care & God bless...~Rox"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!! A MUST HAVE FOR ANY FAN!!!","review":"This is a truely wonderful cd!! It truely showcases Rick's voice... It can't be compared with any other cd he has put out..it stands alone, as he only wrote 1 song from this cd \\"Cry\\", but is still a must have!!!! It's a Rick Springfield like you have never heard before. The Day After Yesterday has been described as warm and soulful and I must agree! You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Raspy Rick???","review":"As a die-hard Rick Springfield fan from the 80's I was eager to get this album. The songs are well done and the music is very nice, but Rick's voice sounds like he's smoked WAY too much for way too long. A little rapsy is one thing, but this album sounds like he was choking the whole time. I'm sorry I bought it and am thinking of reselling it. I couldn't even listen to the whole CD without being annoyed at the crackle of his voice. It almost doesn't even sound like him. Sorry, Rick."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},x={class:"card-container"},W=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function N(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",x,[(a(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(a(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,W)):b("",!0)])}const H=d(O,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-d0da6bf2"]]),G=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"people/35.md","filePath":"people/35.md"}'),R={name:"people/35.md"},j=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{G as __pageData,j as default};
