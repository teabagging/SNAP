I actually read the book of esther while reading this. It's amazing how she made this story. She stays true to all the information about Esther's story in the bible and adds in accurate information about the time. Everything works seemlessly together to create an interesting and complex story, developed characters and a real world the reader can feel, see, and touch. My favorite part about this book is that it helped me understand the meaning of the book of Esther. An engaing and captivating must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over Rated","review":"I found this book poorly written and edited in the first few chapters. Also some factual details are wrong. Many sentences were grammatically incorrect. Garrett wavered between Esther living in a small village in the vicinity of Susa and living in Susa itself. Persia is nowhere near the Arabian Peninsula so it is incorrect to say \\"under the Arabian sun\\".When Esther first arrives at the Harem she eats a meal with chicken and tomatoes! Tomatoes are native to the Americas and were unknown to the Persians. If the author got this wrong how can I trust anything else in the book?Mistakes like these pull me right out of a story and I am unable to continue reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best in Christian fiction I've ever read","review":"WOW! I couldn't put this book down ... Ginger Garrett easily led me into the life and times of Esther, from her life in the village to the time in the king's harem, all the way to becoming queen. It truly brought to life a story I didn't know much about, and kept me turning page after page to find out more! Can't wait for her next book ... Ginger Garrett is now one of my favorite Christian authors ... right up there with Terri Blackstock, Janette Oke, and Lori Wick. (Written by Anthony's wife Terryl)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading what she thought.","review":"The premise is that some of the diaries kept by Queen Esther have been found and are now being published. It was quite a different way to present the story of the biblical Esther but very appropriate with the focus on blogging today. The story reads just like diary entries, the situations are believable, the writing easy to follow as well as suspenseful. The details of the Persian court are facinating, her beliefs woven into the story without overpowering it. It is the story of a poor orphan who rises to the top to become queen because she is true to herself. A very good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I have read in a long time!","review":"Father Under Fire is a hilarious book about life in a 1950's Roman Catholic Parish in England.

You will feel as though you are there in the rectory of the parish of St. Jude.After I read the first story I could not put the book down. I cannot wait to read the other books in the series. It is truly one of my favorite books.I wish the book would be brought back into print. It is truly a shame to have this wonderful book overlooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It has nice pictures, however, it doesn't give any price guidelines.

Unless you understand French or can also watch the DVD of this show, you may not get the political satire. You will, however, understand the tragic love story.

You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"C'est Paris, gotta love it, n'est pas?","review":"It is an old musical, do not apply the standards of contemporary productions to it. I like it very much, it is high energy and great for those learning the language. Garou is outstanding in the role of Quazimodo!, Pelletier is also great. Hélène Segara is not my favorite,I find her annoying for no particular reason. Some of the music is beautiful (Les Temps des Cathédrales; Bohémienne; Danse, mon Esmeralda), and some is a bit repetitive. I'm glad I made the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe Farrell Takes Flight","review":"For fans of Joe Farrell's work with the first version of Chick Corea's Return to Forever band and Elvin Jones' trio work on Blue Note, this is a real treat. The album finds Farrell at the peak of his powers during his tenure with CTI records. Although CTI did a lot of big productions, this is a quartet album recorded at Rudy Van Gelder's studio in New Jersey in 1972. The rhythm section is made up of Herbie Hancock on electric piano, Stanley Clarke on bass and Jack DeJohnette on drums. Fans of Miles Davis' early electric work ( such as \\"Miles in the Sky\\" or \\"Filles de Kilimanjaro\\") will enjoy this, as will anyone who enjoys fusion in its early experimental phase when funky backbeats were evenly mixed with Coltranesque modal patterns."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY on CD","review":"this album is the greates one of the series made for CTI (see my review of \\"Outback\\"). Lots of swing and drive, and great solo performances... in fact, everyone's contribution by itself would be worth buying this album (Herbie Hancock on the Fender Rhodes... hmmmm....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"See my review of the adult sized ponchos","review":"I like this product for several reasons: 1) Ponchos that come in such a small package are usually disposable. Since this one was labeled reusable, I thought better for the environment. I opened it to check the material. I stretched a small portion. Of course doing so damaged it, but that's the point. I want to make sure it won't break in a real emergency. It seems durable enough. 2) Polyethylene - Many other ponchos are made of PVC, which emits a toxic smell. You can at least recycle polyethylene. I haven't tried this on any kids, but I have tried the adult size one.

You don't have to put anything together, it comes right out of the box as you see it...and it's not rickety in the least bit.

They said they could send me a replacement but that it would take more than one week to arrive. I asked for a full refund. I was lucky enought to get the refund within 10 business days.

And how come the package was parked at the USPS office for almost two weeks without Amazon noticing something was wrong !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well researched, broad coverage of practice and theory","review":"I've only giving this 4 stars because the early part of the book is a little disappointing. The coverage of alchemy is sketchy and the pneumatic chemists are given short shrift. You feel that Brock didn't really have his heart in the pre-Lavoisier history.By contrast, the treatment of nineteenth century chemistry is suberb, giving broad and balanced coverage of laboratory practice, industry and theoretical developments. The text conveys a real sense of excitement as the discoveries unfold; Brock does an excellent job of organising a wealth of technical detail clearly.There is also a good coverage of early twentieth century chemistry, about up to the point where quantum mechanics took hold.Overall, highly recommended. But you definitely need a background in chemistry to get the most out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Checkbook Cover","review":"This checkbook cover is beautiful (I have the red one).

Just having the register, checks, and 6 cards and I think it is maxed, so don't plan for it as an all-purpose use unless you carry little. Quality construction and the eel skin is gorgeous. Love it!

It is colored outside (I got the rose), and natural white inside, visible in the shawl, the cuffs, and one side of the belt. The rose color is even less pinkish than on my computer screen, it's a real antique rose. The belt is stiched on on the right side, so it stays attached, not loose and going through loops. I found this very practical when washing.I looked in many local stores to find a cotton terry bathrobe and found none.

No one tried to hide the miniscule budget, they just do their best with what they have: pure comedy material. Some of the jokes are so bad and so original that you will lose your breath laughing. The theme song is priceless.The plot is self-explanatory. Two guys are sent to Earth to conquer it in a few days. They have swords, and the entire human population to decapitate.If you want to \\"experience art\\" (said with an arrogant and better-than-thou tone), avoid this movie. If you want to double over in laughter, get it.Also, you can hear the theme song on the Myspace page of the band that created it, Nerf Herder (you will need to skip down the playlist a bit).

The book could easily have been twice as long and retained interest, even so, the focus on the top few generals is well worth the price asked for this book.

Invisible Connections was released in 1985. Three compositions are contained: \\"Invisible Connections,\\" \\"Atom Blaster,\\" and \\"Thermo Vision.\\" This is atypical music--perhaps minimalism.

They said it was \\"like playing barbies, but you can bend these more\\". They did tend to \\"break\\" the models by trying to twist them in ways that the joints didn't allow, but the 7 year old got the knack by the end of the night and was actually looking at how the limbs moved so she could rotate them as she wanted without popping the joints apart. Fair warning, large sections of these models are preformed and can't really be adjusted much. Still, I can see some way so \\"tying into\\" what is here and adding some details if you wanted.

What results is a blaise collection that doesn't live up to past success; the attempt to be contemporary with material/assists from more recent vintage artists fails, as in PU x 11.

Momma's Boy? What a stinker of a song. Actually none of the songs sounds like a hit, so they are perhaps but a last hurrah for this songstress who started in the early 60's and is now the same herself. As this one marks the second consecutive sub-par release following the last collaboration with Lee Hazlewood, the future doesn't likely promise much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"; O yawn...","review":"Nothing new or memorable here, just endless banal filler that fails to satisfy or excite. Honestly, there wasn't one song that really stood out on this cd. I had expected more as a lifelong fan of Nancy's but this leaves me puzzled and quite dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"Mostly dissapointing is my finding for this collection from Nancy Sinatra, and mainstream success is not likely.

Though I was hopefull beforehand I have to cast my lot with the reviewers that are less than thrilled with this. The final song especially Two Shots of Happy and One Shot of Sad might have worked for Frank Sinatra, but not here. A cd of questionable quality and based on the low energy singing and no frills production it appears to be just another tired excuse to make some bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"My gawd this is awful","review":"Eleven songs in all and from the very first titled 'Burnin' Down the Spark' all the way through to the last 'One Shot of Sad', sad is what this mish mash of a cd is. Not near the quality or creativity of Sinatra's early work, listening to this is like being subjected to one of those horrible PBS shows where old singers and old groups alternately perform and embarass themselves. This wasn't as unbelievabley expensive as Nancy & Lee 3 but it is unfortunately just as unbearable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe an 'e' for effort...","review":"On second thought no, make that 'e' as in eeee, what a racket! This has to be one of the worst releases of this or any year, featuring as odd sounding a collection of songs as you'll ever hear. The disjointed styles herein make no sense, i.e., too many cooks with their fingers in the mix. No cigar. Rating: D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN EVER","review":"I'm loving this CD! I was hooked from the first song BURNIN' DOWN THE SPARK. Haunting. Nancy sounds great. She sound like she has fun singing these songs. I got more than I was hoping for. Not only did I get the Nancy Sinatra I know, I got one I didn't know - like on MOMMA'S BOY. The vocals on LET ME KISS YOU are exciting. There's not a bad song on the disc but I think my favorite is ABOUT A FIRE. You gotta get this CD and hear for yourself. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I fell in love with Nancy's music back in the 60's. Love her stuff to the day. She could sit back and recycle her oldies and do very well for herself. She could go the Ronstadt route and reinvent herself as a chanteuse. But Nancy was and remains a rocker. Let Me Kiss You is a heartbreaker. And Momma's Boy is as nasty and sublime a song as you're lucky to hear anywhere. A great album. The only thing better is hearing these songs done live. And the unreleased tracks with the Doves, Elvis Costello and Blondie will hopefully see the light of day as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Icon Returns-Witness for yourself.","review":"Let me first quote from a 5 STAR review in a well respected music magazine, \\"Throughout, Sinatra carries herself like a legend should:...poised,...ready to be worshiped again\\". That really says it all. Those without an axe to grind will give an honest listen to this CD and tell you that it has lustre. And like most good music, it gets better with every playing. Here are more potential hits from an artist with 22 songs on the charts. She made successful recordings collaborating with artists who didn't make the charts without her, yet they alone have gotten all the praise and credit for Nancy's chart busters. After 40 years in the business, give the lady her due repect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"This privacy screen is great. It is shades very dark at an angle, which is what you want in a privacy screen in an office full of people. It fit great, except for about a half an inch excess at the top which I just measured and cut off. Would recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Purchase, Great Value","review":"I purchased this for use at my office which has a lot of traffic. Since I do the bookkeeping I was always concerned with security/privacy issues. This filter really provides the answer. Unless someone is standing directly behind me, they cannot see what's on my screen. It doesn't diminish the quality of my viewing either. And at probably 1/3rd the price of other vendors, the value can't be beat. I couldn't be more pleased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as I expected...","review":"for $90, I expected this privacy screen to block the ability to see my screen from anyone standing 5+ feet away. The truth is I can stand 30ft away and still see my screen perfectly.

They were brand new and the instructions were in the package. One side is lighter than the other. I didn't even use the tabs that came with it because the screen just fit right on top of my monitor. It does darken the screen but how else would the privacy thing work? Would recommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with this product","review":"I installed this screen on my iMac. I immediately noticed the display quality is degraded by 30% to 40%. The character on my screen used to becrisp and clean, easy on the eye. This screen pretty much destroy that. It is also dimmer than it used to be. I turned up the brightness of the monitorand it did not help much. I was hoping I can get used to the lower quality display after a while, no luck. After ten minute staring at the screen, I decided it is not worth it. I simply uninstalled it. For me, this screen it is total waste of money. I want privacy, but I do not want to take a big hit on display quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this purchase","review":"I was very disappointed with the purchase of these privacy filters. Neither of them fit the screen at all (too short for the size they were supposed to cover). Also, what is given to attach them with does not work. As for creating privacy, they do except for the area that is not covered, so if you stand to the side, you can still see the screen and that is what we were trying to prevent! I would not recommend these at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WISH I could return it!","review":"It is useless! It darkens the screen a little but there is nothing \\"privacy\\" about it! In fact, it darkens the screen TOO much! I can stand anywhere and at any angle and can see the screen as clearly as I would if I was sitting in front of it. What a colossal waste of money. Sometimes inexpensive determines the quality of the merchandise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"Not worth the money. Cannot use. Had to return it. Scheduled return then they never shower up. Ended up taking it myself to UPS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, stay away!","review":"I bought this product because it says only people sitting directly in fornt of the screen can see up to 45 or 50 degrees. I stood up from my desk, behind my desk, crouched and stand on my chair and I could see everything on the screen. However, if you are standing on the side, it does blind it out. I though privacy screens where just that but not this one. Also, don't be fooled by the picture, it is not anywhere near as dark as the picture. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"This is definitely not worth the money. If you think this screen will black out if someone stands 3 feet on either side of the screen forget it! For example if someone stands say 4 feet behind you and 3 or 4 feet to your left or right they will be able to tell that you have an IE window open easily!! It may be a little fuzzy but they can clearly tell what you have open. Another words, you don't have to be directly in front of the monitor to see your screen. No privacy there! Maybe my expectations were too high but I had a privacy screen before this one but my screen was updated at work to a bigger screen so it wouldn't fit and a new one of the same kind cost more than the new monitor so I got stuck with this thing! Too bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...I returned it","review":"Was anxious for this to work - I put it on a 19\\" flat panel monitor in a very busy office setting. I was tired of my snoopy co-workers making comments about what I was working on. Some of the material I work on is extremely sensitive. I attached it to the screen and looked at it from every angle and was able to read clearly what was on the screen - from near and far. I was disappointed, but I had no choice but to return it. I since have purchased a much more expensive screen that works just fine. Returning the product to Amazon, however, was hassle-free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price","review":"I bought this privacy screen for the monitor in my office (at work). I didn't want to spend too much money and was concerned that maybe I was going to get what I paid for. I was surprised by how well this screen protects my privacy. Not only does it help block out the view for others, but it also greatly reduces the glare I get from my monitor, reducing strain to my eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a reason","review":"One reason to like it, that's all. Here's why I don't:- WAY too costly for a piece of plastic.- Tabs supplied to install are awful both in appearance and functionality- Unless the filter is 100% pressed against the screen, the image becomes blurry.So, if you want privacy that is way too expensive, looks like a 2nd-grader stuck it to your screen, and ruins your eyesight, then I guess this product is for you. I have it on my screen as I type this and I'm already getting a headache."},{"rating":"1","title":"its ok","review":"I purchased the screen protector for my 27inch Acer monitor. The privacy it provides is great, but the actual screen itself isnt well made. It bubbles out from the screen and the corners peel out from the top. I thought the screen was supposed to sit flush on the screen and you could remove it when ever you wanted? I used the \\"tabs\\" to keep it in and although they do a decent job at keeping it against the screen you can see the filter trying to find a way off of the screen. The tabs look ugly on the screen and they privacy filter is always falling out from the tabs. Not sure if I could find a better replacement for this filter."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's okey!","review":"Works great!However, the Gold Privacy Filter works much better.For better results check out the Gold Privacy sceen. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't block anything!","review":"i got this PRIVACY FILTER expecting to actually get some privacy upon putting it up. i put the screen on... and it blocks absolutely NOTHING. only at extreme angles from the screen does it actually begin to darken and blur some things out. other than that, it just darkens the screen a tad and serves as a screen protector, but why pay $90+ for a screen protector?totally not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I use this filter at work as I am in a cubicle and frequently have sensitive client information on my screen. If you are not facing the monitor head on you won't be able to read it. Even clients sitting in my office can't read the screen! I've not had any major problems with it. It cleans easily, installs fairly quickly. I have some vision impairment and have not been able to use some filters as they make the screen difficult to read. Not this one. It protects privacy while maintaining clarity. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Privacy from Whom?","review":"I had high hopes for this product because I have seen privacy filters working great at places like the DMV. After installing the filter I noticed it only dimmed the color of the screen and did not provide much privacy. I walked around the monitor testing the different angles that would make the screen readable. The only angle that made this filter useful was when I was standing 10% from the plane of the monitor. So out of 180 degrees of visibility, this filter was only effective for 20% (or 10% on each side). A screen isn't even really readable at 10% but it was the only angle that actually produced significate distortion to the monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great solution","review":"Not a terribly easy to use or effective solution. It is challenging to mount with the included mounts, which don't hold it flush and flat against a monitor screen. This leads to a drastic loss of sharpness where the filter and screen don't touch. Additionally the filter cuts the screen brightness by approximately 30-40%, and also vignettes the screen badly. The benefit is limited to cutting viewability to just oblique angles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"The 3M Privacy Filter does not work unless you are at a 50 degree angle or more to the screen. Otherwise you can see the screen. You can see the screen clearly from any distance if you are directly behind it. All the filter does is make the screen a little darker. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISLEADING LISTING","review":"I just ordered and received two of these privacy screens for one of my co workers. There are a couple of issues between what is represented and what is actually being sold:1. The image displayed for this product is NOT the style of screen that is actually being sold. The screen being sold is the kind that comes with adhesive tabs, it is not the clip on kind.2. the screen being sold is actually for WIDESCREEN monitors, which is not indicated anywhere in this listing, besides a seemingly random W at the end of the product name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Useful","review":"One of our colleagues wanted use this for reducing glare from her monitor. It did reduce glare but at the same time, it reduced visibility and so she could not see the monitor messages well. It was too dark and so it was not useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in portrait mode","review":"In traditional landscape mode, these filters work just like they're supposed to. However, if you prefer to rotate your screen to portrait mode like I do, they become less than useless. The screen can be seen from just about any angle, except sitting right next to the user, and the screen is darker, but without any privacy benefits."},{"rating":"1","title":"3M Privacy Filter","review":"This item did not fit my monitor.

Cant believe this is 100 bucks. I returned it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good privacy/anti-glare screen","review":"This does exactly what the description says it will do. It keeps your screen private, and blocks out some glare. I have a problem with glare, setting off migraines, etc., and this helps. I read some reviews saying it doesn't work and I disagree.

Three inches of both left and right sides are vignetted so much that it's distracting. I'm returning this.

However, the dark tint of the filter and the clarity of it are horrible. It made my Viewsonic 24\\" HD monitor look grainy, and like it was set at a low color setting (i.e. 256 colors like the OLD days).

They list all the screens based on the diagonal dimension and some vague term like \\"LCD\\" or \\"laptop\\" screen. Often they do not show the Length and Width of this rectangular product. It was a chore to use the Amazon website to find the wrong item to order. Because as suprising as this may sound, you can have a variety of Lengths & Widths that give the same diagonal. Also color pictures of a grey plastic rectangle really don't help. What would help is a simple table of dimensions so I could at least find a privacy screen that fits my monitor. So I am ~$60 poorer, and going to use Google in the future. Oh, and nowhere on the Amazon site is there any place to give feed back, suggestions or complaints. So I had to go complain about this specific order. I am certain Amazon will pass this along to the manufacturer and ignore their website problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I ordered this privacy screen to use at work so patients couldnt look onto the desktop and was so excited to receive it 2 days after purchase. then once i got everything out it was missing the 8 clips that hooked it to the screen. on top of that in chatting with someone from amazon, they didnt seem to care about my unhappiness and did nothing but offer to see me a return mailing label. be cautious on who you purchase from, Amazon, will stick by their customer service satisfaction only when you order from them... order from an outside or subsidiary company and they could care less if you are unsatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I bought this because I work in a cubicle with a busy passageway behind me.

There are 2 sides to this filter (which doesn't stick on the actual screen), one glossy and one matte. I used the matte side to face me, and from a distance the screen looks completely black. At closer proximity to the computer monitor, things are visible and if someone's standing directly behind, the screen is clearly visible. However, it has immensely increased the level of privacy and I can work happily knowing that no one's watching me from behind. The filter can be lifted for cleaning and the see through stickers that you attach to the screen are to help keep it put. Even without the stickers, the filter will stay put.Buy it, it's totally worth it, although HIGHLY priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"privacy filter","review":"highly recommended product. function exactly as advertised.got 2 for my work computers, shield my monitor display from bystanders. but the sticky tabs not strong enough to hold filter.had to add additional tapes."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC Screen Filter","review":"The filter simply does not work and is not worth the money.

No prying eyes on my monitor unless they stand directly behind me and stare."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little pricey, but worth it!","review":"This privacy screen does exactly what it says it will do. It fits right inside the rim of my widescreen monitor, and I don't even need to use the sticky plastic pieces to hold it in place. It does make the screen a bit dark when viewing it straight on, so you may have to turn up the monitor lightness. But it definitely does the job of turning the screen black when viewed from an angle.

I like that the light shuts off on it's own but three minutes is really way too short.

As much as I thought it was a nuisance as a kid to take the outer screen off to put the page under it...now I see the benefit. On the flat-screen lite-brite you just lay the paper over the lighted holes and use pegs to hold it down. The pegs popped out very easily when the child's fingers accidentally pushed on the paper as she was putting pegs in. Also, it was nearly impossible to tell the difference between the green pegs and the yellow. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea","review":"My son received this Lite Brite for Christmas and it is a really kool thing, the only thing wrong is the holder for the pegs is alittle to small. overall the best Lite Brite available now.

A heeler to be precise, and Jack was a hell raiser bent on practical jokes with a distaste for anything mechanical. Shaefer nailed it. You can read this book and know that his description of ranch life is genuine. Shortly after reading this book(for the first time)I spent an afternoon with Louise Schaefer, Jack's widow, in their Santa Fe home. Jack had died about a year before our meeting, and Louise,still smarting from Jack's numerous peccadillos, which mostly involved women, said \\"Jack was such a liar.\\" Well, I replied, most good writers are.

She sounded good live in that CD especially the accoustic moments with her and just her guitar. The accoustic set on this new live CD does not sound as sincere and as intimate as it did back in the 70s. Perhaps it was a different era and she was just starting out. Nevertheless it is still good to hear her sing live after all these years. Her pitching is good live as well as on CD for a female voice. I was disappointed with her choice of songs for this live set. The only song I truly enjoy was Simple Things. But overall not a bad live CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disaterous editing","review":"This rating is not for Amy, whom I love, or the concert which would have been great had I been there.

It is a fine exposition of Isaiah. It provides enough material to clarify its message and put it in context without getting the reader bogged down in technical details. It treats the book of Isaiah as a unified whole rather than a fragmented collection of writings from 2 or 3 sources.

Reading the other books would probably have made some of the confusing parts less so, however the book would still have been awful. I kept waiting for the author to tie everything together and get to some point or conculsion that he never did. It reads as if he just stopped writing. The story was not entertaining in the least with the plot bouncing around all over the place. I don't claim to be an intellectual so perhaps this book was not meant for me.

Will we ever arrive? That some of the plot moves toward climactic scenes that never get fully developed was a disappointment...I can't help but feel that if we had all the pieces as one novel I would feel that this is one great story.

Alvin Lee is a terrific guitarist, and he had the reputation of being the fastest in the world at the time, when Ten Years After was at the height of their populairiy.Lee wrote almost all of their music, and he had a skill of writing catchy blues-based guitar riffs. One of their best known songs of that type \\"Love Like a Man\\" is the key track on this 1970 album. Though his songwriting is somewhat uneven, probably because of pressure to constantly to come up with material for new albums and singles, their best songs still sound great today.On Cricklewood Green the highlights, besides \\"Love Like a Man\\", are \\"Working on the Road\\", \\"50.000 Miles Beneath my Brain\\", \\"As the Sun Still Burns Away\\" and the great acoustic ballad \\"Circles\\".

It sounds VERY good - dramatically better than the Chrysalis issue. It also has a nice booklet where Chrysalis gives you a folded paper with the outer album art on it.

Of course a book in itself cannot teach you the secrets of meditation. However, like any other art-form, books can open your mind in a wonderful way if they are well-written and thoughtfully crafted. This book certainly fits that description. I read this several years ago, and reread it several times because of the depth of insight it offers. Anybody interested in links between Eastern and Western philosophy will find some real gems here, and anybody practising meditation will recognise the central themes. Personally it helped me particularly to see how the koan form of meditation operates, something I find difficult as I follow a non-verbal kind of practice. It shows how the initial paradoxical concept leads deep into the conflicts in the human psyche and ultimately beyond the egocentric viewpoint. \\"Arouse the mind without resting it upon anything\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the way to learn.","review":"This book annoyed me. I went on to read other books in the same vein, though, and found it to be better than most; hence the extra star. I have a fundamental problem with the idea of teaching readers about no-mind and other truths that cannot be understood through words . . . through the vehicle of writing. If you want to learn about Zen, then by all means, talk to a Roshi or another person who has grasped something of its nature. Meditate. Look at sumie paintings, build a rock garden, learn the Tea Ceremony. Don't expect this book--or any book--to show you what you need to know about Zen."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important conversation with your little ones.","review":"An incredibly simple and fun way to teach our little ones important truths about our God.

With others I've read in the series, I am usually hooked relatively early in the story line. I was 1/3 of the way through this iteration before becoming mildly interested in the outcome. Even the subplots were not overly attention grabbing (Kinsey has little contact with immediate family, ergo she substitutes others in her life--Henry, Rosie, Pitt family, the criminal elements in this book--as her family...). I also found it hard to believe that some of the characters that appear in \\"L\\" could be so dim-witted on one page, and great possessors of vast knowledge with incredible powers of deduction on the next.

Against the opposite end of the more angsty tone, it's quite pleasing to read something that clearly was fun to write. Here, Kinsey finally takes a job for her landlord Henry, a simple task of investigating old army records.But since Sue Grafton is writing this, nothing stays tame. It's a roadtrip/plane ride adventure across the country, where Kinsey is forced into various disguises and meeting with various and insane characters.Grafton creates an extremely pleasing joyride that holds all the heart and soul of Kinsey Millhone's nasty personality that delves into military secrets and personal secrets of all sorts. I enjoyed the development of Henry's family--all great characters in true Grafton style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of Grafton's downhill trend","review":"I thought perhaps the dissatisfying conclusion of K is for Killer was a fluke, but L is for Lawless leads me to believe that Grafton is tired of the series and is anxious to fulfill her contract. I suspect she's secretly writing on another project that she really cares about.Lawless was completely uninteresting to me. The ending was rushed and didn't answer all the questions it brought up.

Still, an OK read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too linear and derivative","review":"I'm a Millhone fan but the plot in this installment was too linear. It went straight from the beginning to the end with each twist neatly foreshadowed by some previous detail. A careful reader could tell exactly what was going to happen at every step without any real surprises - won't spoil it with a list.Secondly, the plot seemed derivative of Donald Westlake's Drowned Hopes (a great read BTW). At one point Kinsey and Ray even contemplate that the loot might be flooded when a dam was built - the exact premise of Drowned Hopes. I hope this was a deliberate nod on Grafton's part.In summary, it seemed to be a tribute piece written according to a simple formula."},{"rating":"1","title":"L is for Listless","review":"Grafton lost momentum in this book, though she regains it in M is for Malice.

Anyone who saw Tyne Daly, Angela Lansbury, Ethel Merman or even the miscast Rosalind Russell will find this wanting. Particularly a shame as Daly was a major television star she wasn't used; or that Midler, who's a delightful comic personality, didn't have the chops, but this is a \\"Gypsy\\" only for those who don't know the work. If Midler is the only Rose you've seen she may cut it; for the rest of us, a major disapppointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gypsy","review":"Bette Midler as always is an outstanding performer and this film is no exception.

WIth the price you pay for Unforgivable you would hope it would be worth it! Not this one! Ir is NOT WORTH IT. Sean John picked the right name for it alright...It is an UNFORGIVEABLE fragrance that I would put at the bottom of my list.

Perfect, pristine sad pop songs that aren't disgustingly sugary twee (read: Sarah (Lee) Records) nor transparent. Beautifully crafted, occasionally redolent of the Lemonheads' (circa It's A Shame About Ray) softer, mellower moments. But with better vocals (dig the harmonies - gorgeous). Songs like Sign The Letter, Greyhound Bus and So We Go are some of the prettiest heartbreak songs you've heard. A classic.

This collection gives us (especially in the US where MTV rarely, if ever shows Morrissey videos) a look at Morrissey takeling the art form of music video and he does it excellently. Morrissey is fascinating to look at and watch, these videos give his fans a chance to see him in a new light...I hope they start making it again soon. While he is no where near the artistry of Madonna(Who is?) when it comes to videos, Moz handles these selections with humor and they are a fun trip through his world, where many just concentrate on his meloncholy tendancies.

The author sets out to prove, with a vengeance, that we lost the warrior ethos before the war and lost the first battles because of it. To do this defames the brave men of Task Force Smith and others. Fehrenbach mentions how the troops ran, but never mentions the scores of troops that repeatedly picked up the inadequate 2.36\\" bazookas from dead comrades to have their hand at it. Not the action of cowards but brave, trained, veteran WWII non-commissioned officers in an impossible situation.Those men deserve better than this book gives them.Don't read this book to learn the truth, read it to learn the authors large twist on the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"a long story","review":"Shows how disfigured the Army was.

Mark Twain one said, \\"A classic is something that everybody wants to have read and nobody wants to read.\\" Well I tried, and after about 75 pages, I had to put this book down. The reason? A curious writing style more attuned to an historical novel than serious history. And although some may appreciate this style, I found it longwinded and short on substance. Additionally, the course of the war, in general, is difficult to follow because it is told via interconnected vignettes as seen by lower ranking GIs; there are no references (and many times no attribution at all) as to where the author gained his information or how they fit into the bigger picture. My impression is that the author simply assembled a skeletal framework of facts and filled in the rest with imaginative prose which may be accurate or not.

So many of the projects assume you already know what you're doing and just need a reminder, and while there's a picture on the cover of someone replacing a doorknob, it's not covered in the book at all.

I havent seen this movie for years but the impression it left the first time seeing it has been left in my mind ever since.This movie is seriously underatted. The concepts are well presented and thought provoking, although some may be a little controversial. As a concept artist myself, I am envious of the level of imagination put into this movie.I would only recomend this movie to those seeking a true sci-fi brilliance as oppossed to someone seeking an action packed blockbuster.

I originally bought this to use along with the conditioner for the seats in my car based on the recommendation of the previous owner who had used it religiously. The car is 7 years old, and the interior is flawless. Definitely get the conditioner to use after the cleaner as it helps to prevent drying and cracking which can happen to leather, especially in a car where the temperatures fluctuate so much. This product works so great, we also use it on our couch at home and also leather jackets. I've also recommended it to my family and friends and everyone loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good stuff","review":"I purchased this because our 16 year old and 9 year old cars both have leather interiors, and, ashamedly, I've never done much with them other than go over them with a \\"leather wipe\\".Plus, I have a wallet which I really like, but after 4 years of carrying it, age is showing.The Lexol did well getting everything clean, and it was both easy-to-apply and easy to remove. I can say this size is a little difficult to get just a little on a rag or heavy-duty paper towel. Actually, I found a wet, and I mean wet, not damp, paper towel was the best applicator.A little goes a pretty long way. I see the back seats of both cars on the docket for next weekend, and then, after recovering, I'll tackle the L-shaped leather sofa. That'll take a couple of hours, at least, but it'll look great.Tip: Follow up with Leather Honey. Just go check out the reviews...they're not exaggerating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product.","review":"This stuff, along with the leather conditioner, works great. I picked up a cheap leather couch for the basement, but didn't realize the previous owners were heavy smokers. The day after moving it in, I could smell it from my foyer. This handled 90% of the smoke smell, and made it presentable. The conditioner got another 5% of the smoke smell out, and made the leather much more pliable and soft. It also worked great on my leather car seats. Good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best leather cleaner I've found","review":"We always used this for saddles & tack growing up, and I now use it for leather shoes & handbags.

The product removed dust and a bit of dirt, but didn't work on tough spots where some elbow grease and warm water are actually needed.

The first track, written for viola da gamba, oboe, and countertenor, is gentle and heartwrenching. Tavener's beatiful, sustained accompaniment in the strings perfectly compliments the high duet between the oboe and the voice.

The premise of the plot was classic with being in Hell, fighting for redemption, with guns, and all the blood you can ask for in a game. From the very first 'level' it begins to become repititious and so bleeding boring. You do the same things, over and over and the plot ceases to develope itself after the opening scene. You simple go straight from level to level shooting or sawing up demons so in reality its hard to imagine how one can go SO wrong with that.

Eugene Pota, an established writer, now seventy, is trying to write his last great book. The only problem is . . . He has nothing to write about. The story is a unique experiment of what a writer goes through and the false starts he attempts. I originally had an idea similar to this, a book consisting of nothing but false starts, but looks like Joseph Heller beat me to the punch. Well played, good sir. I bow out of the project, respectively. It's a quick read. About 233 pages. Pick it up, you just might like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Reflections, Too Obsessed with Sex","review":"Like many novels in our postmodern world, Heller's final work is interesting and engaging, but also very caught up with sex. His reflections and humour are still as good as ever, and especially profound are his insights into what it means to grow old and the pressure on aging writers to produce a(nother) masterpiece. The novel runs the intellectual gamut from the Illiad to Tom Sawyer, plus offers a compendium of other works that I intend to pursue. Overall, a worthwhile find in the mode of contemporary, male-authored literature ala Updike and Roth."},{"rating":"1","title":"poignant last words","review":"Although Heller's trademark irony, self-effacing sarcasm and appreciation of the absurd are rife throughout the novel, \\"Portrait\\" is a radical departure from his previous work. A biographical account of a writer penning what he hopes will be his final masterpiece, the protagonist (obviously Heller himself) fears the inevitable descent into mediocrity. The book, unfortunately, is indeed solidly mediocre in both prose and plot, but is imbued with a certain sadness and poignancy. Fans of \\"Catch 22\\" should not expect a sequel in any form, but diehard Heller fans will nonetheless appreciate his literary swan song, which throws this private author into sharper relief than any of his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"esthetic propensity, no satiety","review":"Richard D. James has truly lived up to the maxim, \\"do not throw what is holy in front of pigs\\" with this album, a collection of musical tripe.

His music is genius; but the curse of genius is that mediocrity is fool's play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey Mr. James, How 'bout a buy-back?","review":"After reading all the glowing magazine and online reviews of this album, I finally broke down and shelled out the twenty-five bucks to experience the sonic masterpiece I was promised. I have never been more dissapointed in an album in my life. I can't for the life of me figure out what all the fuss is about. This is an album of random noise that has no form or structure whatsoever. My impression of the creative process involved in the making of this tragedy is a bunch of children being allowed to play with sophisticated recording equipment. I would love to be more technical and give a song by song critique but I can't find one redeeming quality on this album that would warrant a deeper look. It is pure noise without affecting the listener on any level..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense and rich. John Cage would be proud.","review":"This new double CD set by Aphex Twin offers more of the kind of electronica one should expect from RDJ. However there is a much more dense and varied texture involved in many of the more intense pieces. What is surprising is the focus on piano in these albums. Many of these pieces on piano (both prepared and otherwise) sound like the melodic and harmonic tracks from the electronic pieces, without drums. There also seems to be a surprising lack of form to the piano pieces, whether you view that that as a plus or not (\\"jynweythek ylow\\" being the best piece). Overall, this set isn't Aphex at his apex, but I does create some speculation as to what he'll do with the piano in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aphex returns","review":"Though there is nothing groundbreaking on this album, I still really love it. There are three 'themes' which emerge over the course of the three discs, quiet piano interludes, frentic aphex acid style tracks, and more experimental stuff. There's something for all Aphex Twin fans here. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because RDJ doesn't seem to be as interested in pushing the envelope anymore like bands like Autechre, but when you consider the fact that he laid the groundwork for all those bands... The man is a genius. The only other thing I didn't like about Drukqs is that I guess I've been spoiled by two hour plus double disc sets, and this clocks in somewhere around an hour and a half, and I know from interviews that Aphex has more unreleased material (initially he wanted to release a 4 CD set!) that I feel could have rounded out the set. Still, the technical wizardry is evident in full force, and again, the man's a genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Maddening","review":"Tracks 2 & 4 on disc 1 are insane - and are also the perfect songs - not perfect electro or ambient songs - just songs in general - a good album to get tweek'd to - also to have sex to - or both at the same time - its just so chill and weird and unlike anything you've ever heard - its pure art - sometimes calm and soothing, sometimes loud and jarring - a wondrous amalgamation of sound, rhythm and vibrations - a fun listen for electronic, ambient, trip-hop, experimental or other fans - i personally listen mostly to metal but i like this"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dense","review":"After listening to this album about 10 times, I fially realized how good it was. It is probably his most dense album to date, and the most musically accomplished. He doesn't rely on catchy melodies, but uses subtle beauties that take time to reveal themselves. I can imagine why many Aphex Twin fans might be turned off by it, but fans of Autechre or other more experimental electronic music should enjoy it. I thought that it might seem a bit redundant since there are two discs, but it really isn't. The arrangement of tracks provides a wondeful listening experience full of surprizes. I realize this review sounds sort of stuffy and scholarly. I dont mean to be so dry, but I just feel this is an album worthy of intelligent discussion- and that's rare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drukqs delivers...","review":"Those Fukqs at Rolling Stone don't have a clue...This album is great! A very nice collection ofsongs indeed:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning! Do NOT play when driving.","review":"Whenever I listen to an Apex Twin CD for the first time, I feel like holding onto something just to brace myself. Richard James can come up with beats and rhythms so unpredictable, it's like getting hit on the head by a flying object unexpectedly. Nevertheless, this album is a beauty to listen to. One moment it's ambient, and the next it's drum-and-bass. Like the Cocteau Twins, Apex Twin is like an inside joke: you either get it or you don't. Rolling Stone didn't seem to get it, since they gave the CD one star. But what can you expect from a magazine that gives Britney Spears three-and-a-half stars for her 2000 album? (no disrespect to Britney, though) All in all, I recommend this CD to fans of Apex Twin like myself, as well as those who have a taste for hyperkinetic, oddly beautiful electronic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drukqs Are Good!","review":"The title of this double album accurately sums up everything about this cd. 'Drukqs' is the latest album from one of the greatest experimental workaholics in the world. It's laced with chaotic rhythms and beats, as all Aphex albums are, but this time around there's a bit of melody to it. Apparent in bits on all of his previous albums, Richard D. James now infuses his album with piano breakdowns. These are some of the most beautiful sounds I have ever heard, which just proves that Aphex Twin isn't just chaos and random sounds (which he prides himself on), but also a glorious musician who his always ahead of his game. If anyone is raising the bar for musicians everywhere, it's Aphex Twin."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pinnacle of Ambient music","review":"To me, this is definitely the best Aphex Twin album. James alternates his signature programmed meltdowns with calm pieces for piano/tape loops, synthesizer, and prepared piano (it sounds like he's listened to John Cage's \\"Three Dances for Prepared Piano\\" [1944] a lot). As usual, on many of the tracks the drum machine becomes the lead melodic instrument, processed halfway to incoherence with delay and chorus and probably every effect he could muster.

James's continuing musical evolution, especially after the brilliantWindowlickerwhich kept me on the edge of my seat during the seemingly endless 2 year wait for his next release.No point in highlighting out any track in particular, no track stands out enough for me to bother deciphering the confusing chicken-scratch layout of the cumbersome song titles. The drum-n-bass pieces are merely good, but not great. (There are other musicians who are doing more exciting things with beat programming, some are even Aphex's label mates!) On a positive note the quiter interludes of piano pieces are actually quite good, which range in a variety of moods, and have more character to them than the rest of the material.Overall, the record feels like and endless series of outtakes from Aphex's past glories. If it was marketed as such, then perhaps I could trust in his talents again and look forward to his next release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consolodation and Innovation","review":"Not being a regular fan of the work of Richard D James, I approached \\"Drukqs\\" without much enthusiasm, especially since many reviews claimed that it was a substandard release in which he merely emptied the remnants of his hard drives in order to complete his contract with Warp Records. Nothing could be further off the mark: \\"Drukqs\\" is an extraordinary collection of sonic inspiration and is probably the first mainstream album to provide a viable fusion between post drum 'n bass fallout and the rarefied confines of the classical avante-garde. The quieter pieces are definitely reminiscent of Erik Satie, but their prepared-piano format also lends them well to comparison with Stockhausen and Cage. The more hectic excursions are superb examples of what awaits electronica pioneers beyond the world of The Beat, as surging textures blur into melodic washes and challenge prevailing musical sensibilities in their wake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Suckqs","review":"There is some amazing stuff on drukqs (Meltphacc 6, vordhosbn, omgyja, taking control) however I keep having to skip through tracks simply because they are just unlistenable.

Aphex Twin's style is really unique in this album...... words cannot really explain the extreme complexity of this specific work. I recommend listening to this album with headphones.... It gave me a totally different listening experience. Every time I listen to this album I hear something new. If you liked \\"Windowlicker\\" then you should pick up a copy of drukQs.

It starts off fairly happily (as far as these things go), then just gets progressively darker. Even the tracks with the manic drumlines start to sound downbeat after awhile. The last half or so of CD-2 alternates between depressing and violently depressing.But, as I said, there's no real style changes here (except for the use of what sounds like a prepared piano, which works well).

A 22 would probably be ok but who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed....","review":"I thought that I would give this scope a shot as a cost effective addition to my Mosin Nagant. It took two days longer to arrive than what was stated in the estimated arrival date time.. I can get past that. What I can't overlook is it arriving with a scratch/crack on one of the internal lenses. With the scope on 2X power there is a crack running accross the upper right quarter of the reticle. When you zoom to 3x and 4x power it starts to go away. From 5x power on up to 7x power you can not see the scratch anymore. When I looked at the warranty information that came with it, the manufacturer will allow you to create a claim but you have to ship it back and pay them $10.. really? The scope was only $40. That would be 25% of what I paid for it not counting the cost I would incurr to ship it back. I think that it would have made a good scope had it arrived in the condition I paid for.

Lo and behold, I was within the inner ring! Next shot...missed the paper. Every shot after? Missed the paper. After 10 rounds between me and my Dad, I decided to check the sighting again with the bore sight. Scope was completely off again. Resighted it again, and after the first shot it was off again.

It is blindingly obvious that he should have got a female co-author in to complete the job. It's a big and real omission. That said the model couple featured look good and the drawings are tasteful.

The book is very nicely organized appetizers, main course, sauces, etc. and the subdivisions are helpful as it keeps the reader focused on what Mr. Comfort is talking about. A good deal of Comfort's sentences are oddly phrased. One has to re-read several of the passages and really focus to really understand what Comfort is saying. Comfort does give some safety tips especially in the bondage section. Inatersting comments about having a bed for sleeping and one for sex. The 30th Anniversary Edition includes some comments about AIDS and diseease which one should keep in mind.

No, I'm not kidding.

Embryo was a suspenseful, fast-paced medical thriller that kept me on the edge of my seat. The technology used to grow embryos outside the womb was explained in layman's terms so that I pretty much understood it. And like great science fiction, it seems to follow real-life scientific developments (i.e., Dolly the sheep). What a scary thought that events in this book really could parallel real life! Charles Wilson always gives me something to think about. In addition, toward the end of the book, just when I thought I had it figured out, the plot took a totally unexpected turn. That shows a truly great suspense writer. I agree with reader from Newport News that Wilson can easily join the ranks of Robin Cook and Michael Crichton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast & Fun Read","review":"This is sort of basic type of thriller. It has an interesting premise and plot, with solid enough characters for the genre, combining to make a fairly entertaining and fast read. And while the artificial birth seemed more fitting in a science fiction novel than a mystery/thriller novel, Wilson manages to present his crazy-sounding science in a fairly realistic way. The plot held some unpredictable turns and the book ends in an absolutely eerie fashion. Wilson is a writer with a sense for entertaining plots and seems to be a safe bet for a fun thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too trashy to be gripping","review":"The subject of this book is very interesting, and the story engages at first. But it tries too hard to keep the pace going, at the expense of credibility. It's also let down by poor writing in many places. Subjects like this need more insightful treatment, and less schlock horror. And strong writing wouldn't go amiss either. Sadly most of the other medical/bio-tech authors I've come across, don't provide this either. Or maybe the publishers think that to get a mass audience a thriller needs to be dumb. Pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"I do not underrstand the prior review claiming the disc had only 2 symphonies; this is a 2 disc set, 4 Symphonies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a survival guide, but a study guide","review":"I purchased this book becuase I administer several WinNT 4.0 servers of varying size, cost and importance. I wanted... no wait... needed a book that would accomplish what the title says - A SURVIVAL guide, (i.e. There is a problem, or a situation, or a request, and you need a reference to help when you are clueless).THIS BOOK IS NOT SUCH!I have looked at this book countless times and not once did it provide an answer. I am not kidding here, it really helped me 0 times.I recommend Mark Minasi's Mastering Windows NT Server 4 if you need an answer to a question or problem. It has never failed to provide an answer.I read the other reviews of this book and it suddenly became clear to me, this book is probably better suited as a study guide for budding MCSE's as opposed to people actually supporting live NT boxes. Since that means it probably serves a useful purpose, I will upgrade my 1-star rating to 2-stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crazy cool book","review":"I bought this book as a gift for my husband at his request. Its huge...and fascinating. I have skimmed through a bit and realized a couple of things. 1)You can't skim this and make any sense of it 2) There is a lot of interesting material here. 3)This is a second book in a set of two. You don't need to read the first in order to read this one, but we will probably go pick it up anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a house bible","review":"Alice Waters, in an interview, explained this book as indispensable, so I bought it. It is a bible for any thoughtful person whom wants to make a better life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't build home without it","review":"There are certain design principles that are self-evident truths, commonsense but uncommonly applied to modern towns and buildings, painfully evident in characterless and cheerless houses. Most of us have these evolved truths deep within us but we rarely think of them. Given here are 253 patterns, each consisting of a design challenge, discussion, illustration, and solution. Your knowledge of these patterns can help you to create a home that is a pleasure to live in, one that is imaginative, inspiring, healthful, and psychologically satisfying as well as fully functional. I cannot imagine designing any building without refreshing my memory of these wonderful patterns. First published in 1977, this book has already attained the status of classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Blueprint for Utopia","review":"As opposed to people who have written more detailed reviews of this book, I'm not an architect, but a software engineer. Nevertheless, I found this book fascinating. Its form lends itself very well to casual reading, as each of the patterns is only a few pages long.Some of the patterns give great explanations of why some of the structures I live in every day don't work all that well (in Silicon Valley, you can find more or less every pattern in the book violated, some of them pervasively so). Other patterns exmplain why some of the structures *do* work. Yet other patterns are thought provoking, even though I don't agree with them (Would I want to have an outhouse instead of a bathroom and compost its products myself? I don't think so. Does Alexander have an outhouse for his own house?).I recommend this book highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent ideas though a little political and outspoken","review":"This is a wonderful resource for any project. The authors present good ideas on how to improve any design but the political and direct tone sometimes question the validy. Overall, a must have for any planner, architect, or home-improver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for architects - good for software engineers too","review":"This book talks specifically about what works and doesn't work when building cities and towns and how to take the human element into consideration when doing so. However, I found its conclusions and most of its patterns applicable to software engineering. There are good books on software design patterns such as \\"Head First Design Patterns\\", and there are some good books on user interface design such as \\"Designing Interfaces: Patterns for Effective Interaction Design\\", but this book really helped me merge the idea of software design patterns with the user perspective in a way that other books I have read have not.If you are a software designer, read the book all the way through, make notes as you go, and see if it doesn't help you write better organized code that is more responsive and coherent to a user who walks up to your user interface completely uninitiated in your method of design. I know it helped me."},{"rating":"2","title":"a patatern language","review":"This is an amazing book for anyone interested in building, remodeling or buying a home. It points out basic tenents of architecture that go across cultural lines. It is easy to read and retain."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pattern Language: Towns, Buildings, Construction","review":"After skimming this book it seems to me that it is a book about building theory and how buildings fit together to make a community. Definitely not my thing. I'm not saying it is a bad book, it just isn't my thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the way we look at designing our house","review":"I borrowed this from the library first, since it's an expensive book but, after reading it, my wife and I both wanted to buy it. It is incredibly deep - the \\"patterns\\" weave together to make up a truly human whole. Alexander talks about the design process as organic. Reading through the patterns and implementing them as much or as little as one is compelled to do makes for buildings and towns that are truly a reflection of the people who have designed them.This is a great \\"volume\\" of material and worth every penny. It will never be sold at one of our yard sales!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Placemaking Guide","review":"One can find the answers to most of life's little (and big) problems in this classic work. It does everything from helping one determine why the backyard just doesn't feel right to describing the problems with sprawl. I hesitate to label it as an architectural work because it can be so much more. Certainly, it illustrates how architecture can play a much larger role in shaping our lives than it has during the past fifty years.The format of the book is effective in that it allows one to follow the connections between various design rules/patterns that might otherwise not be obvious. The use of these \\"links\\" within the book could have been a source of inspiration for web designers. This book will appeal just as much to the lay person as it does to the legions of architectural professionals who use it as a guide on a frequent basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality + Book","review":"Great quality and service! Bought the book for school and it is a helpful resource! Great for designers!

No such luck. Because it's all in rhyme, it doesn't really make much sense to a small child. And it gives trivia without explaining well how babies are actually made. Example: it tells you that \\"a male octopus captivates/the interest of intended mates/by changing into shimmering stripes/which pleases even the shyest types...etc. etc. How do they actually mate? It doesn't say. If you're looking for a cute little book that could spark some conversation, this is it. If you're looking for a book that is heavy on factual information that will teach your child about the birds and the bees, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 5 year old loves this book!","review":"The whole book is written in funny rhymes. Each page gives a little short factoid about the mating behavior of many different animal species. The part on humans is only about two short pages, but it does give a brief overview of \\"the birds and the bees\\" in a humorous but straightforward way without going into great detail. You will have to fill in the blanks for your child. My daughter thinks this is a great book, and I agree. The illustrations are hilarious! However, if you are looking for a book that goes into more detail about human reproduction, I recommend the classic, \\"Where did I come from?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book approaches the subject in a very subtle way. It makes use of rhymes to explain to kids that the mating process is natural to all animals. It does not put unnecessary stress on the mechanics of human reproduction and it makes for an easy, fun read. I read it along with my daughter when she was 6 years old and now, at 7, she still likes to read it out loud and enjoys flipping through the pages before bed. I am a beginning psychotherapist and this book is sure to make my bookcase at my future practice! Just fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A slower sort of 90's Alternative","review":"The Radar Brothers - This is the first and only album I've heard by them.

Anyways, they are a pretty good band. I kind of want to say they area a mix between Nick Drake and Semisonic. Although the poetry isn't nearly as good as Nick Drake's (no one's can be) its main focus is the soothing vocals and the lyrics, while they aren't as upbeat as Semisonic, but they have a similar voice, and they are from the 90's."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no shippment to Iraq","review":"It was good book but unfortunately till now there is no immediate shippment to Iraq, I asked a friend in US to receive the book from Amazon, then ship it to Iraq.

Boy was I surprised that a whole chicken does not fit as I used to have a sixx litter European and a whole chicken fits just fine. Anyway, I can't recommend this, because of the material and because of the size.

My fingers and towel were left black after rubbing against the cover, the sealing ring, and the inside of the pot.I am completely confused. What the hell does this endless tarnish come from?!

Second time it was worse, I filled the water, careful not to exceed the safety mark and closed the lid. Soon, water droplets started coming out of the edges. Thinking that it'd stop soon, I let it go. This time, the steam started coming out from the edges and more heavily from between the handles.

The large one I own can handle the big cooking projects. All turned out well and a definite time saver. Even though I have a larger pressure cooker for canning tomatoes and sauces from backyard produce, this pressure cooker definitely looks capable of handling some of the overflow of canning jobs.Some of the question marks or to be determined reviews might have to wait if any parts need replacing, and when it goes through its first official scrubbing - where some parts may need to be taken out to be cleaned.

The six quart size is big enough for a whole chicken. The package comes with a few recipes which are a good starting point, especially since cooking times for different kinds of meat are provided.My main issue is that all the ingredients in a recipe will be cooked for the same amount of time, so that some of them will be overcooked. A workaround is suggested. Items like vegetables which take less time to cook than the main meal cooking in the pressure cooker, can be prepared seprately in the normal way, and then added to the rest of the meal. A few minutes of cooking will then blend in the flavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pressure Cooker","review":"Pressure cooker is very very essential for my kitchen.

I needed to repay a bunch of favors a friend did for me recently, so I bought her one of these. She tells me she really likes it and uses it all the time. The reason for 4 rather than 5 stars is that these are a little light weight. People who would be using a pressure cooker more than my friend and I may want to go to a stainless model. They cost more, but would probably give longer service. However, there's NOTHING wrong with these units. They do everything you'd expect them to do.

You're not supposed to fill the cookers beyond the fill line, so you need space at the top for air/steam, and to keep the release vent from getting clogged. I'd forgotten that. The cooker without the lid is great for making pasta, too--an added plus. It's a Presto, so getting new parts will be easy.

A mishmash of new age fluffy bunny mixed with rehashed psychic information that can be found in books as far back as you care to go. Lots of stuff from the 60'and 70's mixed with all that new ager stuff that started popping up in the 80's and 90's. Also the book is off putting in it's arrogance, as well as being erroneous, in regards to how the author's generation is somehow more gifted psychically by somehow being \\"preprogrammed to be more psychic\\".

Unfortunately it takes him around the corner to the milk store and back until he makes his point. This book is over 400 pages long, and although it's well-written and documented, it could have been at least 100 pages shorter. Stephen Fried has definitely done his homework, but this book feels more like a documentary of the 70's fashion world than a biography of Gia. He goes a bit overboard in detailing EVERY SINGLE person in Gia's life and it gets frustrating for the reader who really doesn't care much about every hairdresser, photographer or lunch lady that ever entered Gia's life.For those of you out there that are interested in every aspect of 70's fashion--read this book, you'll love it. For those of you who could care less--you might want to skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this about Gia or all the people around her?","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to read about Gia. Not her agents, hairstylists, photographers and various other people. It seems that Gia is only mentioned in a few paragraphs of each chapter. Personally, I don't want to read about the details of the aforementioned people's lives with the exception of Gia herself. This book would have been a much more enjoyable read with a few hundred less unimportant pages. I found my mind wondering off while reading the book because there is little mention of Gia through many of its chapters. I hope that someone else writes a book on Gia and leaves the focus on Gia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great discovery...","review":"I am still chocked because of her story. What a waste of life and health... The drug addiction and AIDS are hard to swallow... Many of these problems could be avoided by everyone, but they don't. What a pity... By the way, the movie is only a romance. It is very good to watch on your TV...and cry a river for her. The book is better...if you want to know her and also the backstage of discos and modelling. I really recomend the book for everyone..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Gia","review":"This story is probably the closest anyone who hasn't met Gia will get to know the truth about her. This book goes into great detail explaining not only the life of Gia Carangi but the life of the fashion industry. By doing this Stephen Fried makes many things understandable that the tv-movie did not. He also doesn't use composite characters (like the movie). It is also shown in here that Kathleen (Gia's mother)is even more cruel than shown in the movie (or in interviews). Gia is shown here with all her flaws, and all her beauty. If anyone is really interested in Gia's life this book is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gia was typical of modern youth","review":"As I learned more and more about this woman I was extremely taken by how much of her I see in so many of my young counterparts today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Look at the 70's & 80's NY Cultures","review":"It is about Gia but all the supporting characters make this extremely interesting. A very sad but detailed account of what drugs can do to people's lives when they are on top. Reading this will have more impact than \\"Just Say No\\" ever did."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Shockingly True Account","review":"I have always been interested in modeling ever since I was younger and after reading this novel by Stephen Fried, I have a few very different opinions. First of all, the book was quite long and at times very drawn-out. There were pages when Gia's name wasn't even mentioned and Fried went on about a specific photographer or hair stylist for page after page. Still, the basic story about this tragic, young beauty is captivating and it was very difficult to put it down, once getting past all the irrelevant details. If you are interested in not only Gia Carangi but the fashion industry of the 70's and 80's, then this would be an ideal read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Documented","review":"I've had this book for years but never got around to reading it. Gia had a mesmerizing beauty in an understated way that was difficult to describe. The author describes in great detail how her sessions produced magic as shown on film. Unfortunately, the sessions could be excurciating as Gia's work habits were horrible as she found herself controlled by drugs.The highlight of the book is the excellent research from so many different and disparate stories. Of most interest is the relationship between Gia and her mother as told by her mother as well as friends who have a different take on this relationship. Like many others I became more interested in Gia after seeing the movie where Angelina Jolie played her. The movie clearly followed the true story but only contained about 20% of the history. The book fills in the rest and does a great job. I recommend this book to learn more of Gia or the model culture in the 70/80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book","review":"This back is on my shelf, the pages are dirtied and the book is worn and used. I've read it nearly 3 times. Everytime I cry (I'm such a girl).I think that anyone who has made mistakes will connect with this book.It tells a beautiful story, of tragedy. A gorgeous girl who lost it all.I loved it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain B O R I N G!!!","review":"I gave it a 1 star because as far as writing and grammar goes it was good. The content was little about the life after Gia became a model and too much about who's who in the business. There was nothing written about her struggle with drug use or her contraction of the Aid's virus. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in nothing more than names of modeling agencies, photographers, and others who worked behind the scenes and very little about the models themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating but sidetracks too much!","review":"I knew nothing about Gia, so it was fascinating finding out about her, but this book spent way too much time on details that I was not at all interested in. (this hairstylist's life, that magazine's history, this photographer's divorce, that designer's vacation home, this modeling agency's whatever...and on and on and on) I skimmed through a large percentage of the pages just looking for Gia's name! I liked the varied selection of professional and non-professional pictures in the book. I liked how deeply the author went into Gia's personal life. Aside from the extraneous details, it was an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thing of Beauty","review":"Thing of Beauty is a Biography on the late Gia Carangi, the first supermodel. Gia Carangi, better known as just Gia, graced the covers of all the top magazines of the 70s and 80s. Vogue, Cosmopolitan, and Christian Dior just to name a few. But it wasn't all glam and riches, Gia struggled every day with a bad drug addiction, which spiraled her career down wards to a hult. Gia's struggl didn't begin when she moved to New York City form Philladelphia to persue modeling, they began right at home with her disfunctunal family.Her life inspired the HBO movie Gia, staring Angelina Jolie, which gives you just a glimps of the tradic supermodels life. The movie inspired me to read the book and find out more about the short yet facinating life of Gia. Gia was one of the first known about women in America to die form the extreamly deadly virus known as AIDS.

I wish the dividers were like more sturdy box type compartments.

Psychological changes came about in ways that were too abrupt to be believed. The lawyers, without revealing any plot twists, behaved in ways that no ethical lawyer _could_. The computer comments were laughably inaccurate at times (a small gray box described as a \\"Norton Utility\\" with a straight face). It's hard to believe that the author is really a lawyer, unless someone else wrote everything but the courtroom scenes. Even the scenes in chambers with the judge didn't ring true.

Each chapter included multiple voices of charcters and provided insight into the thought of each chracter. Because of this, the book was not very suspensful, with a couple of exceptions. The killer in this novel was also not presented as diabolical as he could have been and therefore did not add that much to the suspense. I especially did not like the mentality the author gave for why the killer was doing what he did. It was very unbelieveable and should have been in an x-files episode.

It may be in pieces, but my dog still plays with it. He enjoys the disassembly. First the squeaker dies, then the fuzz is removed, then the chunks of rubber are found here and there. Finally one ball is lost and now it looks more like a thick handled lollipop. Usually at that time I throw it away and buy him another. Depending on how many other toys your pet has, this may last 2 weeks. Let's face it, almost nothing is going to last with a dog gnawing at it non-stop.

Less than 10 minutes later the squeaker and the middle of the toy were practically gone.

My solution is just to give the Air Kongs a curfew of no play after 9pm or before 8am.

She runs for it, then squeaks it a couple times, then brings it back for another toss. That is where the problem begins. The squeaker disappeared - it is just glued into one end, and suddenly it was no longer there. The dog began to chew to find the squeak, and started to remove the cover. The squeak is irresistible, but the toy is made like a tennis ball, and the cover can be easily chewed off. I don't think that the dog is a hard chewer, but this toy certainly did not stand up.

In fact, the sprays were bare in some places due to all the seeds that had come off them. I uploaded a picture to show what I mean. I assume this was partly because the stalks were very dry and broke easily. Another concern I have is that the seeds were pale and looked unhealthy when compared to sprays from the bulk box at my local pet store. The uploaded picture shows them side by side.Realistically, this stuff won't go to waste.

The rather stereotypical view we usually get is that of a hardworking nation, dedicated to family and tradition. The presentation of gay Japanese cruising each other was thought-provoking, to say the least. As educated as I think that I may be, it is always an fascinating surprise when one of those vestigial presuppositions comes to light, and I am forced to alter my thoughts on the world around me. Mishima's well-crafted style and use of language provide a penetrating and valuable look into an intriguing, though somewhat obscured, example of humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"He tried hard but didn't get there!","review":"I'll give credit that at least Mishima tried to tackle the subject of homosexuality from a broader perspective. You can understand the world of gay men, where they go, and what's happening in the minds of these men during the early post-war era of Japan. The ending, however, was no surprise. However, I also give credit to Mishima for pushing the issue out there as best as he could. I'm not sure whether or not he understood his sexuality. During that time, I don't think a lot of men could have. But he tried, and I think through that he helped a lot of other gay men to try, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Debut!!","review":"The wait has been well worth it. This album was originally slated for release early this year, but was pushed back several times. I remember hearing \\"Divide the Hate\\" for the first time last year and it immediately took me in. The whole album reflects that same feeling. Every song has its own \\"feel\\" and the music is very melodic. The vocals are great and the guitar is just as good. There is a good balance of heavy and soft songs. This is one of the best debut albums that I have heard in a very long time.

The CD itself has water spots on it, and the pamphlet on the inside cover looks like someone dropped it in the tub. It's stiff and the pages are stuck together. It gets a 0 out of 10 for appearance. This was my first 'used' purchase, and may be my last. I care greatly about the appearance of my belongings, and knew that I would need to make some exceptions for a used item, but this is pathetic.

There were moments of great writing and prose, but not enough to carry the book. Claire was superficial, whiney, and so stupid that I had no cause to like her. Tristan was a spineless pet without any likeable charactoristics. Paul, I wanted to like, but I just didn't find enough depth in his charactor to become attached to him, either. Rachel was just a witch, and to be honest, I'm not really sure why she was even in the book, except to have someone else to torture poor Tristan.Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"exasperating and eventless","review":"When I read the prior reviews to this book, I was really excited to get my hands on a copy. I was gravely disappointed. Instead of an exciting tale I read endless pages of exasperating flowery drivel.The characters are all unlikeable. Claire a self-centered tease has no brains or compassion when it comes to her faithful lapdog Tristan. And Tristan is just that, an ignorant lap dog with nothing better to do than to pine away for someone he has no chance of getting.The story is DULL! Nothing happens in the book. Things are told in retrospect and never is active in any way. It's just pages of how the lap dog feels about his Claire or how Claire feels about Paul or her lap dog.

Completely nonconsensual on everyone's part and dysfunctional mind games seemed to be the order of the day.The characters were all extremely annoying. Paul, the Dom, was just obnoxious and I couldn't see what Claire (or anyone else for that matter) would see in him, Claire was completely self-absorbed, Tristin was pitiful and Beth was the worst excuse for a best friend I've ever read about. I didn't care what happened to any of them and only kept reading hoping for some kind of happy ending. The ending kind of drifted off and a \\"Thelma and Louise\\" might have served these characters better!If you want to read some great D/s fiction, I would suggest Laura Antoniou's Marketplace series, Claire Thompson's Sarah's Awakening (a romantic bdsm story) or Anastasia Day's Bodice Rippers (three excellent novellas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the erotica???","review":"This must have been the most boring book, I've ever read in my life.

There is no story and the characters one dimensional, and annoying. There's not a modicum of eroticism in this book at all! I forced myself to read on though, hoping and PRAYING for something interesting to happen, but it never came. The more I read, the angrier and sleepier I got.

I will say that if you are a big fan of \\"The Story of O\\" or the \\"Beauty\\" series by Anne Rice, then you might enjoy this book. The sex is not explicit at all - it's vaguely mentioned. I found the characters to be very one dimensional and boring. Also, the relationship between Paul and Claire really turns out to be the same old S&M; thing.Although the book skips around between the different characters (often in mid-scene), their personal experience is very much lacking. No personal thoughts or feelings are ever really described. But what I have to say I disliked the most about this book was the rhyming! Ugh.My impression after reading this was that it started out as a poem or a play that the author then attempted (very unsuccessfully, if you ask me) to develop into a novel.

So I plugged it into my HDTV and I got the same line, I don't get it with HDMI. So I tried a different component cable with my computer and the line was good. I'm not sure what the problem was but maybe I just got a bad cable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk","review":"Don't waste your money. This is junk. It's barely worth the $9 I paid. The connectors look like old RCA plugs from my dad's 1970's-era RCA turntable. The plugs fit loosely on my VCR, so not optimistic about getting a good picture out of this one.Another Amazon thing that I didn't realize it was a 3rd party seller until I submitted payment. Would send it back, but return shipping would be more than the cable costed in the first place. Only bright spot was that shipping was fast, but as usual with lots of these 3rd party merchants, no invoice in the box or any type of receipt identifying the seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Axe to Grind? Ommisionist History? You decide.","review":"It would appear that the two authors have some kind of axe to grind against the NYPD. If one is to believe this book, all New York City cops are corrupt, or inept, or just lucky bumblers who when they do solve a crime, do so by sheer luck. This is omissionist history at its worst. As an insider in the NYPD I feel I know what I am speaking about. These two authors seem to be the type of person who, once having been denied entrance to the police department, set about tearing it down. It is a one-sided look at the police department, with absolutely no in-depth look at how the \\"job\\" actually works. Don't waste your money on this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort or the money","review":"From the title. one would expect an in-depth review of the New York City PD, its officers and its problems. What one gets is a ranting history of the NYC police from day one. Most of the book zeros in on a few unknown police officers who the authors tell us were the heros of their day.(Their day being 1850-1940) The last few chapters bring us to \\"modern day NYC\\" and again-with the exceptional addressing of modern police problems (during the mid to late 1960's the NYPD experienced over 100 police officers killed in the line of duty-this book makes quick light of that)we are again rewarded with the tales of 2 more \\"unknown NYPD heros\\" that the authors force feed us. In essence, this is a poorly written, totally uninteresting book devoid of any clinical insight into the modern day NYPD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Dixieland Album","review":"There are lots of albums with perhaps more famous artists, but this is my favorite Dixieland album, and I've listened to a lot of them over many decades. Playing clarinet and tenor sax in a community band, I really appreciate the nuances and all-around professionalism exhibited by the players in this band.First heard this album in a Virginiana store. Talk about serendipity -- never expected to find such great music there among all the glassware and wooden souvenirs.If you've ever heard a better Dixieland album than this one, please let us know the title in this thread.

Sucks you in regardless of your mood, but best for down time. The band's most consistent album, and their best; \\"You've Become My Big Excuse\\" ranks with \\"Mr. Somewhere\\" among the best of the band's songs. This is an outstanding example of what is sometimes called Chamber Pop--and though labels are the death of creativity and imagination, 'Chamber Pop' is a perfect description of what The Apartments are up to. But appreciation of the term is no substitute for the experience of hearing The Apartments."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can Leave Your Hat On Single CD","review":"I've always enjoyed Randy Newman's song \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\" since I heard it many years ago. I've heard a number of artists do the song live and recorded. When I heard Tom Jones' version I finally heard Randy's song for the first time, and in a way it was meant to be sung. Where most artists sing this song as a writer or observer of the lyrics, Tom Jones lives in the lyrics and becomes the song. No one I've evr heard do this song does it as well as Tom, including Randy Newman. Then add one of the best musical arrangements, hot and sassy and a sharp stable of female backup singers and you have the very best arrangenmt of this song since it was introduced by Randy Newman. If you like rock, Randy Newman's songs, Tom Jones or just a great addition to your music collection-This song is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I love Tom Jones and the movie \\"You Can Leave Your Hat On\\", is one of the funniest and cute movies ive seen. The song sung by Tom Jones just sets the scene and suits the movie perfectly. Having said this, I was so excited to find the CD of the same, but its a waste of your money. The ONLY song on the entire CD is Tom Jones singing the song and the quality isnt all that great either. The rest of the CD is garbage and just wasted space."},{"rating":"2","title":"TMBG, they might be great","review":"I never listened to They Might Be Giants before this CD, but I heard about them from one of my friends, so I bought this CD. A lot of the songs are so-so (or worse) but some are really cool. Don't expect to get 72 great songs, but \\"Don't Let's Start\\", \\"Ana Ng\\", \\"Youth Culture Killed My Dog\\", \\"She's an Angel\\", \\"Put Hand Inside The Puppet Head\\", and \\"Rhythm Section Want Ad\\" are realy cool songs. Some of the bonus tracks are cool like the critic intro and kitty intro. It is worth it if you like TMBG or are patient about finding a good song. I think it is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun! Exciting! Silly silly silly!","review":"I was listening to one of these CDs today and was once again bowled over by how MUCH I love TMBG. This is the definitive early collection (when are they going to do \\"Now: The Later Years\\"?) and for those of us who used to listen to them on old copied tapes, this is a VAST improvement. Not to mention the extreme silliness of their lyrics and the amazing musical differences between the songs. The Giants always take musical risks--there's nothing I like better than a guitar and an accordian playing in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"The songs from their Lincoln CD were the best from this era!","review":"The cd set clearly shows that they were terrible at first but then started improving after their 2nd album. Most of the ep and bonus songs were also terrible and only ensane or drunk people can possibley enjoy any of them. Save your money and get the Lincoln and Flood albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Might Be Genius","review":"This is a great way to explore the pre-Flood album magic of TMBG. Immediately you will recognize the voices of the two Johns trading songs that defy virtually all conventions of songwriting. While the earlier material doesn't contain the polish of Flood or Apollo 18, nor the full band of their more recent albums, it is an incredible collection of pop/avant garde/art rock that belongs in everyone's collection, unless you're a \\"color inside the lines\\" type of person in your musical tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a CD! An essential start to any TMBG collection","review":"Start your collection with this double CD, and you'll find yourself in the midst of TMBG's best work. From abstract love songs about Shoehorns to young children singing the Particle man theme, TMBG are the preeminent pop creatives. _When_ you like it, get other great albums like Apollo 13!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best albums released by the best band ever","review":"I fell in love with TMBG after seeing 'Particle Man' on Tiny Toons years ago, and promptly went out and bought Flood, deeming it the finest album I had ever heard. Over the years, I played the CD frequently, yet did not chance to update my ties to the Giants. Then, on my fifteenth birthday, I went to the store to purchase a present, and thus found 'Then'. I bought the two-pack, and now play it every other day at least. I know of no other band that create such a variety of sound, matching that with surreal yet highly symbolic and sensitive lyrics. My favorites are 'Cage & Aquarium', 'Ana Ng', 'The Biggest One', 'The World's Adress Remix', 'Piece of Dirt', and too many to mention here. Also, the recording of schoolchildren singing Particle Man was also quite nostalgic for me, seeing as how that's where my love for this band began. Long live They Might Be Giants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge album","review":"I swear there's almost a hundred songs on these two discs. It's a must for a TMBG fan. Most are very good, some not, but I found with TMBG music, the more you listen to it, the better you like it. Very weird and quirky stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summary of the Japanese American Experience","review":"This book is one of the few that actually tries to tackle the long story of struggle and assimilation by Japanese Americans into American society. It starts off with an intro by George Takei and then dives into the history of emigration, era of laborers in Calif and Hawaii, settlement by families, the concentration camp experience, and the post war assimilation. The best part of the book is the numerous pictures and quotes from books/newspapers from famous figures in Japanese American lore: Yoshiko Uchida, Daniel Inouye, Isamu Noguchi, Ellison Onizuka, etc.. For somebody looking for easy reading material (without the philosophical discussion of racism that you may find in Takaki's books), I recommend it highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The King in All His Glory!","review":"This is a great collection in great sound. It's not the same ol' greatest hits type package with Hound Dog, Don't Be Cruel, Blue Suede Shoes, etc. Those are all great songs but this album expands the horizons for the casual listener and introduces songs such as \\"I Got a Woman,\\" \\"It's Over,\\" \\"You'll be Gone,\\" \\"My Way,\\" and \\"I've Got a Feeling in My Body.\\" You even get a 1977 live version of Blue Christmas. In other words - this CD contains the songs that are cherished and loved by the diehard fans such as myself. These are the songs that \\"hook\\" you on Elvis. And once you're hooked you can never shake it.Elvis is the best entertainer in the history of music and it's about time he got the respect is due."},{"rating":"2","title":"A more intimate musical portrait of Elvis...","review":"I am not a fan of Elvis but do recognize his artistic merit. This set makes a good introduction to novices and provides a few sentimental tracks(disc two)that will please collectors and fans alike. Furthermore the advanced SONY engineering techniques are applied, providing pristine sound like their acclaimed Columbia/Legacy series. Tracks are segemented by developments in Elvis's life, such as his work, meeting Priscilla, genersousity, etc. The 24 titles on disc 1 are varied and are not all hits. I think the songs recorded during the seventies come off best, transferring him from the \\"king of rock\\" to a mainstream Sinatraesque Vegas pop singer. Fans will cherish the demo, alternate takes, and private recordings on the bonus disc 2. Nice annotation and family photos round out the package."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money Grubbers!","review":"What is this? .....by the Presleys. Are you saying, WE knew Elvis and you didn't? (Would E approve of Michael Jackson OR that make-up-your-own-religion church of yours?; I don't, so I'm one up on you). The songs on this superfluous package are so random as to be distracting.

They told me they changed production and there was no going back to the old way. Too bad, they lost a customer. Also, the last case I received went rancid before the expiration date.

I walked away only mildly entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot, Mr. Folsom ?","review":"If you like 667 pages ( paperback version ) of endless and senseless violence, this book is for you. If you are already past the sub-teen years and you are looking for a believable plot, recognizable characters, sensible people doing sensible things, you will search in vain through page after page of violence, violence and more violence. The central theme, that the Vatican plans to become the superpower of the twentyfirst century by first converting 1.3 billion Chinese to Catholicism and then enslaving these new converts to enrich a cadre of aging Italians, defies all sense ! And the story goes downhill from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page Turning","review":"This is my favorite Folsom novel to date. It is much better paced than The Exile or Day After Tomorrow. The main character is better developed and you get the sense that he truly is confused, which is important. It makes him more believable. Some of the other reviews have mentioned that the plot is improbable, which it is probably is. But like The DaVinci Code, it is just a story. I don't think Folsom is claiming his novel is true. It is a good page turner. My husband bought this for me to read on vacation and made the mistake of giving it to me a few days before we left. I had finished it before boarding the plane.....it's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing style and syntax are juvenile.

As soon as I saw Day of Confession I grabbed it anticipating an equally enjoyable read. What a disappointment! A very weak story, not believable and written in almost an \\"afterthought\\" style.

I hope he shows more respect for his readers next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow & disappointing","review":"Having read Folsom's first novel, The Day After Tomorrow, I anxiously awaited his next.

The first few chapters were okay (eg, background, historical, and geographical stuff), but it's all downhill from there!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Preposterous","review":"I enjoyed Folsom's debut novel, THE DAY AFTER TOMORROW, enough to try this follow-up. I found it quite the disappointment.DAY OF CONFESSION is a pretty bad book. It starts very strongly, but the plot eventually spins out of control, with one preposterous event after another. I found my jaw dropping at the outlandish stuff that Folsom came up with to move the story forward.Even worse, most of the characterization in DAY OF CONFESSION is flat and stereotypical, and I cared for nobody in the story. There's a lot of action in this book, but it is repetitive and boring for the most part. Folsom tries to spice things up with a lot of violence and graphic sex, but it isn't enough to save the over-the-top plotline.I think Folsom is a novelist of great potential, but I wish he would invest more time in creating realistic plots and likable characters. I would give this book a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite and Salacious","review":"More from a left-wing loon. Like its predecessor \\"Day after Tommorow\\" this book reeks of propaganda. Just when more legitimate scientists have rendered man-made global warming as political,and not scientific, this clown takes another shot at an institution that has done more for the oppressed of the world then any entity in history. If anyone was going to poison the people of China, it would be the government of China. The writing is erratic and errotic(in a cheap sleazy sort of way). Maybe this guy got his start by writing for Penthouse Forum. Don't worry at least there wont be any crazed Catholics issuing a fatwa on Folsom."},{"rating":"1","title":"VIOLENT!","review":"The other reviewers have said enough regarding the book and its rather lame presentation. What I want to emphasize is the violence. The main killer just kills and kills and kills--something like twenty people. And the reader gets all the gory details.

The story seemed predictable and just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell Me Allan Folsom Isn't Catholic!","review":"I'm a pretty devout Catholic who loves suspense novels, so when I saw \\"Day of Confession\\" I was thrilled. Unfortunately, disappointment isn't strong enough to describe my feelings after finishing the book. Offended might be a better word.A meglomaniacal cardinal planning murder on a massive scale? A nun who has sex? Complicitous cardinals whose only concerns are ascending to the papacy? And my only hope for a redeeming clergyman revealed in a surprise twist to be something else? There wasn't a shred of faith, devotion, prayer or priestly sacrifice among any of the religious characters. Except maybe for the Pope who is depicted as a naive simpleton manipulated by evil cardinals.I have no problem suspending some amount of disbelief for the sake of the plot. I'm even willing to accept evil in the Vatican leadership for the sake of the plot, but at least give me some sense of balance to make the story somewhat believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Act of Contrition should follow \\"Day of Confession\\"","review":"I thought \\"The Day After Tomorrow\\" was excellent - everything a thriller should be (I eventually bought five copies - one hardcover to keep in my \\"favourites\\" library, three as gifts and my original dog-earred paperback). I was looking forward with eager anticipation to Allan Folsom's second novel and, when \\"Day of Confession\\" appeared, I snapped up the pricey hardcover instantly. I am sorry to say that it was a complete let down. There are too many reasons why to list them all. Nevertheless, \\"Tomorrow\\" made me a fan and I hope that, with the pressure of producing a follow-up to a hugely successful first novel behind him, Allan Folsom will put all of the creative energy that was evident in his first book into his third. A knock-out new book soon is the only appropriate Act of Contrition for \\"Days of Confession\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good writing spoiled by an implausible premise.","review":"I finished this book because of the strong characters and plotting, but the goal of the bad guys (inside the Vatican, no less) is so silly that is makes this effort tiresome.

Let's switch to Catholics","review":"This is a sad, sad follow up to Folsom's first terrific book. In this book, Catholics are open season: We've got several Cardinals at the right hand of the Pope who are poisoning water in China to help their own investment portfolio; an ex-marine priest who breaks his vow of secrecy; a nun who decides she likes sex better than her vow of poverty, and on and on. Even if you can get past all the above, the plot is weak and the story telling (with about a ga-billion 2-page chapters) is lame. Save your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Allan has made a fan out of me!","review":"I had never read any of Allan Folsom's books until 'The Day after Tomorrow'. I really enjoyed it, but after I read this one 'Day of Confession' I knew I was snake bit. It was worth reading every page and keep my interest all the way. He has a great way on ending his books. You don't want to miss this one. I must recommend this book to you. I could easily see a movie made out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Typical hype and then let down.

Love your style."},{"rating":"1","title":"let the buyer beware","review":"His other book, The Day After Tomorrow,was really enjoyable, and I was looking forward to reading this one. Unfortunately, it just didn't meet any of my expectations. The only good things I can say about it was that it was an easy read, I didn't have to think while I was reading it, and I didn't waste a lot of time on it. The characters were ridiculous, and I didn't care whether or not a character died. The plot was silly, and I found myself laughing out loud at some of the so-called \\"twists\\" and \\"developments.\\" This book is not up to the genre standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"I confess -- I hated it.","review":"Implausible plot. Unbelievable characters doing astonishing things. A bad guy who would make Judas Iscariot look like a choirboy and Superman look like a 72 lb weakling. An ending that is predictable and boring and thoroughly unlikely.Even Harlequin Romance novels provide better reading. Even \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" provide better plot lines. Even \\"The A-Team\\" provide better entertainment.This is a novel that should have been a comic-book.Read this book. Get absorbed by the plot. Believe that The Pope is guarded by the Keystone Cops. Believe in a bad guy who is *so bad* he'll rot your teeth. Believe that a millionaire American lawyer, a unchaste nun and an ex-military Priest can save the world......or believe in Space Aliens instead.

Folsom's first book (DAT) was very entertaining and pretty muched wrapped all the plotlines together in the end. Tis is a similar story. Lone wolf american (with his team of justice do-ers) jumps about europe seeking the answers to a diabolical plan set in motion by a sect of power hungry evil folk. It is fun to read, a metric ton of adventure and action keeps you reading. But when it is finished you realize something is missing. Then you realize NOTHING WAS RESOLVED. Only two plotlines of this over layered novel comes to an end. Actually after finishing it you come to think that the bad guys won. Mr. Folsom kind of forgot to solve the complex plot that he created. for shame allen. for shame.if you liked DAT read this but don't expect much. except a dissapointment at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Paced Thriller","review":"This book was quite enjoyable.

I was quite mistaken and got more than I bargained for.The references to the cities and areas I am familiar with were accurate, but the story line was so engrossing that I lost sleep a couple of evenings when I stayed up too late in order to keep reading to see what happens next.This is a \\"dark novel.\\" Some aspects of the storyline strained believability.

Some were disturbing.But the author keeps the reader involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total let-down!","review":"I bought this book thinking that I'd get a good, if not better read than his first book.

One long chase that leaves you thinking that something exciting is bound to come out at th end of it. Well, don't hold your breath! You're in for a disappointment.

In Folsoms defense this was published 2 years before 'angels' and 4 years before 'da vinci',but its just the same stuff over and over. I was raised a catholic and its all very interesting and intriguing at first but becomes EXTREMELY boring very quickly.

You start off by riding Alpha...I'm telling you!! When you get the chance, try to get Cocktail or Barbie to try to beat Melissa's horse, Comet.Horse-lovers??This is a MUST-BUY!!!

That's all I have to say.","review":"This game \\"Lets ride Rosemond Hill collection\\" is creepy.The horses scared me compared to other horse games I have.They move REALLY SLOW and it takes forever to finish a riding course on time.The graphics are hideous and this just makes the poor horses look creepy.The controls in this game are terrible and its very hard to maneuver the horses towards a jump correctly.It looked nothing like what it described on the cover.This game also has A LOT of errors in it with the graphics.I got tired with this game on the second day I brought it and if I were you I would not waste your money or buy a better game series like Horse Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Ride: The Rosemond Hill Collection (2 games)","review":"This game is very fun but has a lot of problems in it. Both games are terribly hard to play and I'll tell you why. Legacy: Alpha is really hard to train and ride. He rears about every 10 steps in practice! In practice, the horse moves slower than normal. In the first competition, you get to choose from four horses: I like Do It the best. It 's always hard to get the wheel barrow back into the barn after mucking the stall and dumping it. Sometimes you get stuck in the walls and then you can't get out. I warn you, do not ride John's horse; you can't get off! When you sweep the dirt out of the barn, it appears again in about 5 seconds. Melissa is mean, but Comet is smooth and nice to ride. Competitions: The horses will NEVER jump! Then you have to back up and TRY to jump again. Somtimes you will be successful, sometimes you're not. I really hope this review helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"an O.K Game","review":"This is an ok game for some one who is very patient and and dosn't want a challenge. one of the hard thing's about this game is not getting stuck in walls. This game is ok for maybe a younger kid. The controls are hard to get the hang of. Ok so those are the bad things about this game but there are some good things.The game is pretty realistic. The horses look pretty real(for a 15 dollar game) You can pet your horse and you can talk to other people. You can laso make them mad. Fun fun.Over all this is a great game. and worth buying if you don't plan on keeping it long. you could probaly finish it in 2 or 3 days. I hope my review was helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's Ride the Rosemond Hill Collection","review":"First we have been unable to access the Legacy of Rosemond Hill part of the game, the answer from Value Soft being useless. The Competitions part of the software features lousy graphics, soft focus, and so far we haven't run through a game as you can't read anything to set up your track. We have loaded it on an older laptop and now our newer desktop and this is the first software that hasn't worked on either computer.The limited instructions given are useless at this point. I had purchased the other Let's Ride game for my daughter and it will be returned unopened. I really appreciate paying $25 for software that is this shoddy giving me the joys of a pouty kid who doesn't understand why the game isn't working well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS GAME.","review":"I HATE THIS GAME. IT IS VERY HIGHLY ANNOYING. IT TOOK ME FOREVER TO PICK UP A SADDLE OR A BRUSH TO BRUSH THE HORSE'S HAIR, but on the way to the stable, guess what? I get stuck in a wall! My computer exeeds the requirements and I am just staring at the screen, pounding on my mouse trying to get my player out of the wall! The \\"3-D\\" images are just crappy. It's like a play made out of cardboard props that are transparent that you can walk through. I don't know if I have a faulty game or what. Then I try to ride the horse and we all get stuck in a bush or tree. The horse then loses all of it's health and I am like, yelling at the computer. I am not really a horse rider myself, but this is probably not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good game","review":"this game is sooo good,i just have trouble with it.its hard to get Annie into the stable after dumping the wheelbarrow.also,its hard to jump close enough to really get over it.HINT:when you can get her,get Do It.She's fast,and can run at full speed for about a minute.I say this is a good game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What an AWESOME GAME this is!","review":"This is a really fun game! It's so fun how you can take care of your horses--feed, groom, put them in the pasture, ride, and more!If you win the competitions, you'll get a chance to get a new horse! And they all have different speeds--some slow, some fast, some jump more far than others...they're all so interesting!And if you don't take good care of your horses, they won't perform as well in the competitions. So you have to take good care of them if you want to win the competitions--and new horses!This is such a fun game, because it's YOUR responsibility to take good care of your horse.This is a great game--you should get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but fast","review":"I thought it was a great game but it went by to fast. I mastered this game in 1 day. It was pretty cool, then I wouldn't have gaven it 4 stars. It's cool how you can ride 5 horses in total, you start out with 1 horse, but you can ride two of your friends horses. As you go threw competitions you get to choose out of some horses if you come in 1st,2nd,or 3rd,but you can only win two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would be fun but...","review":"Besides the bad graphics this game would be tons of fun but it always crashes. The horse heights are all wrong, the horses don't have different personalities or anything like it says, and it gets tedious and boring trying to get to the next competition in Legacy. The Competitions part isn't even worth installing. You don't really get to build your own jumping course. The steeplechasing in the game is just basically like a cross country course only they called it steeplechasing. It's incredibly hard to turn the horse towards the jumps in show jumping and sometimes the game skips a few frames and your horse ends up knocking down all the rails. Cleaning out the stalls is pretty hard because they made the door going out to the place you have to take the stuff really narrow. Overall the game just isn't even worth buying, I'm lucky I got it really cheap on sale a couple years back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad to worse","review":"This game had really bad graphics and some things you could not understand and it was to easy it had no challenges at all I would never let anybody play this game at my house!"},{"rating":"1","title":"its okay","review":"only one out of the 3 games is worth while. the legacy of rosemond hill is lots o fun, but i always get stuck in a wall or something like that. competitions at rosemond hill is just plain dumb. dont play it. too many gliches. and whats with the mystery game? the game pack is called \\"lets ride\\" and there are no horses in the mystery one. its dumb. and also its not too hard to have dressage because the \\"lets ride champion collection\\" has dressage. i can't really complain though b/c jumping beats dressage any day. overall the games are okay but there are way too many gliches. happy riding."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun.....if u like crashing into walls","review":"My sister got this game for her birthday. I always \\"test out\\" her games before she plays them, and this one was the most disapointing one she has ever received. I viewed the tutorial. I red the manual all the way through. Did that help me? No!First of all, these people odviously can't count. It says on the package: \\"choose from 25 different horses\\", when you only get 1! The controls are awful. All I could ever do was get the character to crash into walls and punch people. (who didn't react, of course) Fun! Eventually I just said \\"Why am I wasting my time on this?\\" and put the game away. Don't buy this game. You have heard it from a real live kid.

The other reviews don't help.I'f you write a letter to the people that made this game thay won't help you.I hate this game but I would like it if I had help on it. The way thay say the horses act thay don't act that way.You can't give them any water.Thay said it is the best riding game when it's not.When Annie canters on the horse she leans forword and your not suppose to because that will only make the horse go faster and I should know that because I take horse lessons.

I got this as a birthday present a few years ago and was not dissapointed. I found it easy to control, and even though not created by equestrians, interesting courses and activites. I did have a bit of trouble at first-took awhile to load, get the hang of navigation, but afterwards it was fun to play! The aim of the game stays interesting and the graphics were nice. I especially liked how you weren't limited to just showjumping, dressage and cross-country. The creators were slightly more creative--even though they had to sacrifice some of the \\"realism\\".I did accidentally break this disc when I stepped on it. I tried playing the mystery game, but it never loaded so I threw it out. I would love to play this game again, it gives me something to do one those days I can't go ride!As for people who are bad mouthing this game-I didn't find it that horrible. Go ride a horse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Concept, Serious Issues","review":"The graphics aren't that bad, the video isn't bad either, but like what everyone said before, this game has stuff that makes no sense. Like the developers left out the little details.For example, for the tasks, one person will ask you to clean out\\"Comet's stall\\" but the person never says which of the, what, maybe 10 stall stable is Comet's. Same with being asked to take someone else's horse to pasture.. I later noticed his horse looked the same as the horse I chose on the second level. So many gliches as well. For example, it won't let me let go of the horse, or let me put the horse in its stall, drives me nuts! Its ashamed because the game has so much potential. It just needs to be more user friendly and logical."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this game","review":"This game is cool because it's almost like having a real horse and the graphics are cool too.You can train your horse by practicing on the jumping course, Steeplechase, and Cross country course. After you go to competion you can choose another horse.You can talk to the other people that give you helpful tips. You can brush,feed, tack and groom your horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Not as good as their previous albums, but definitely worthy work.It's actually surprising to me how good Mark Feehilly is.

Trust me, if you liked albums one to six, you should have absolutely no problem what so ever with this. My favourite songs are Amazing, Colour My World, Hit You With The Real Thing and Change Your Mind. Amazing - the best out of the bunch - is exactly what it says it is. It sounds alot like a Backstreet Boys (BSB) song to me. Speaking of which, Colour My World, was originally recorded by BSB, though their version is spelt color. It's a brilliant song, and they get their voices fairly high. Hit You With The Real Thing was a immediate suprise for me. This is Westlife like you've never heard them before. It's an uptempo number, though it's not like songs like Uptown Girl or World Of Our Own at all. Change Your Mind has a feel of 70s retro pop, and the other tracks are absolutely overwhelming aswell. Get this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Title should be \\"200 games you can try\\" (and then buy)","review":"I really hoped this cd would contain 200 games for my palm. Instead it contained perhaps three, the rest were shareware and trialware -- but NOWHERE on the package does it state that but inside, after it has been purchased and opened.

He no longer seems to possess the ability to express himself through his fingers. Over and over again, it appears to be a strain on him just to maintain a regular tempo. Sonorities no longer appear to be chosen; they are just arrived at due to whatever Serkin is able to achieve at any given moment. Abbado really strains to hold things together. Often, in orchestral tuttis, Abbado feels the need to press forward, then has to slow down for Serkin's entrances, since the pianist is unable to maintain the orchestra's tempo. All of this has a derogatory effect on the London Symphony's playing, which is fairly drab and lacking in sparkle. The sound engineering captures all of these procedings fairly realistically, which may not be such a good thing. If you want to hear what Serkin could do with Mozart in his prime, search out his recording of Concertos 19 and 20 with George Szell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only for those who like to laugh.","review":"If you like to laugh get this book. Otherwise, just move on, and go back to your copy of Great Irish Love Songs. \\"True Story: A Comedy Novel,\\" by Bill Maher, is a tale about five young comics who are trying to make it on the stand-up circuit, back in 1979. It is also a total riot.From stories about playing ping-pong in the nude, to acid induced conversations with God, Maher keeps the reader laughing and waiting for the all important next joke. While it may never considered to be a literary masterpiece, Maher has written a book that just plain and simple fun to read, and an absolute must for those who have dreams of becoming a stand-up comic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny peek behind the scenes of early 80s US comedy.","review":"Being a working comedian for about 7 years now, I might well be biased, but I found the book not just very funny, but also interesting because it so obviously draws on personal experience gathered by Maher in the time preceding the comedy boom - hey! it IS after all a \\"True Story\\", isn't it? And the book is actually also quite poignant in places.Looking for a healthy share of laughs and a pretty good story, too? You could spend your money a lot worse than this.Read this and liked it?

The world of comedy is fascinating, and he has some insights into human nature in general. I hope he writes more novels.I also thought that the focus on multiple characters instead of one central protaganist was very effective, and his style of writing was very entertaining, elegent, and literate. I especially enjoyed the excerpts of comedy acts that he worked into the narrative."},{"rating":"1","title":"People Think This Guy is Funny?????","review":"I had never heard of Bill Maher when I picked this book up about 4 years ago (I didn't get Comedy Central on my cable at the time), but I thought a book about comedy by a comedian would be, well, you know, comical. Far from it. I don't remember laughing at anything in the novel and the story didn't have a whole lot of meat to it. And the jokes were mediocre at best. It wasn't until Maher's Politically Incorrect hit the network that I saw him in action. He's a smart guy, but he can't tell a funny story or joke, either spoken or written. Sorry, Bill, but you're overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with this book","review":"Rather than describing the generalized structures and algorithms involved in neural networking etc, the author presents very specialized code examples.

I can't recommend this book any less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title, obsolete code","review":"With an impressive title as that, you'd expect some solid code interspersed with good explanatory notes. Instead this admittedly older book utilizes C++ solely to employ a hopelessly obsolete DOS-based Borland Turbo Vision interface. C (no C++) is used to somewhat clumsily implement all the actual neural networking code. If you are well-versed in C -> C++ porting, and are willing to ignore all the references to Borland & set up your own UI using e.g. Visual Studio, you will be able to extract some useful knowledge from this book.

Just a personal opinion but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not my favorite flavor","review":"I saw that this flavor was on sale and since I've tried the other three flavors and loved them, thought I'd give this a try. MISTAKE! This is by far the worst tasting of the four flavors. It has a bitter, almost metallic taste. I suppose I might be able to use it in fruit smoothies, but I definitely won't be taking it on its own like I do with the orange, orange-chocolate, or tropical flavors. Really gross, but at the same time better than a cod-liver supplement, I suppose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I give this only four stars because I am trying to find an omega-3 supplement that all my kids will take and only one of them will take this. The once a day pouch is nice and the ratio of DHA and EPA were what I was looking for too. My husband and I don't mind the taste. My four year old who will take it has gotten it on his clothes and they smell like fish after washing. The perforations on the packages in this box were defective and won't tear all the way across so we have to cut it but that's not a huge deal. If you or your kids think the tart lime flavor is okay it's overall a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"The taste is SO terrible","review":"I was one of the few reviewers who did not really like the orange flavor of Coromega's fish oil, so I thought I would try this lemon/lime flavor...Bad idea! The taste is so awful. Like old, stale, lime skittles soaked in vinegar. Won't buy this flavor again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Coromega=Great! : Lemon Lime flavor=No-Go!","review":"Listen, Coromega's products are great and provide easy access to a vitamin (or is it a mineral?) that can be hard to come by sometimes. I bought this Lemon Lime flavor because my wife once told me that she hated orange-flavored ANYTHING. I am the opposite and love orange-flavored products. So, I got one box of each so that she could have 90 days of Lemon Lime and I could have 90 days of Orange. Well, she hated the Lemon Lime... and so did I. We compromised and agreed to alternate between ingesting both flavors so that they didn't go to waste, but we will not ever be buying this flavor again. You have been warned! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Let me be a little more direct than the other reviewers. The orange flavor Coromega is the best thing to come along since God invented fish. If there were 6 stars, I'd award it all six.But I have no idea where the Coromega folks were coming from when they released the lemon/lime flavor. I think I'd rather eat raw fish like Gollum to get my Omega-3.Thank goodness I bought only a very small quantity of the lemon/lime just to try it out. My wife refused to take any after trying one and, not wanting to throw money away, I was stuck with the rest of them.

She goes through nine basic positions, shows you how to move arms in space at different speeds, giv es you some arm designs and throws in some combinations as well. The reason I don't give this video five points though is that the menu system is very nice and mixed up, and overall the video seems to have no replay value after a short while. However, that may be because I didn't get it when I was an absolute beginner. If it's for beginners, it should probably say so. If you've danced for a while, you end up realising some basics--and then you're done. Another reason is that lots of the well-known arm poses are not covered. All said and done though--am I glad I own the video? Yep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New York sampler","review":"Not quite an anthology, not nearly a history, and yet, in its own way, a very satisfactory sampler of New York culture and history.

Don't look for any depth or probing information here; this is strictly for the coffee table. Still, the quality of the prints and the printing is superior, and the literary selections are a little off the beaten path--which makes the book more interesting than one would think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic rock covered by MIDIs.","review":"This album is like listening the background MIDI music on a 1996 Geocities site...it's the greatest and best reproduction of classic rock that can be achieved by the world's worst synthesizers.End result: rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total stinker","review":"This is the most dreadful listening experience to which I ever subjected myself.

Granted, you have to be open minded to different genres of holiday music to like this to begin with. The opener \\"Christmas Time is Here\\" is a gorgeous reverb instrumental of the Charlie Brown special theme song. It never fails to remind me of the two holiday seasons I spent in the Philippines. This is not generic surf music, most of the songs employ a lap steel, to give the album an exotic/ loungy vibe. The sound quality and production are great. There are vocals on a few of the songs, but they are separated by the instrumentals to give the disc a fresh, balanced line-up. It's beautiful, professional, and fun with just a hint of cheese!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fabulous New Christmas","review":"This album is fun, and perfect for those looking for a different, sunnier, type of Christmas vibe.

The case is made of genuine leather and is thick and sturdy. It is very high quality in feel and look. The case is actually quite large, and measures about 6.5 inches x 3.5 in x 1 inch. If you know what VHS tapes are, that's kind of what it looks like.It securely holds the watch, and there is no moving around of the watch once it is inside the case and fastened with the belt in front. The slot for the watch is quite huge, and would fit a huge assortment of watches. However, it does not fit my Omega Speedmaster Day-Date. The Omega case is so thick that it doesn't allow the case to close. However, most casual watches will fit.I took a picture of my Seiko in the case so you can get an idea what it looks like and how big it is.

I still enjoyed it, but it just wasn't 'dark' enough. The use of slang from the future made it kind of ridiculous and the fact that the book is really just one continuous chase scene with a helpless hero is pretty absurd too.You'll need to stretch your imagination quite a bit on some of the ideas but all in all it was fun.

I guess it depends where you are in your faith. Are you just into the show, who puts on a great show or does the words to the songs reach down inside ya and fill you up. I could have listened to the DVD with my eyes closed and the spirit in the music would have have found the place in my soul that needed the nourishment. Twinkie did look a little under the weather so I prayed for her and asked God to give her great health and long life. (she's my favorite Clark Sister). The only complaint I have is I wanted more, more more. To those who didn't like the video I would like to point out, it was a concert and it didn't look like it was in a church. There are music lovers who don't go to church but love good music and this may appeal to them in a way the church atmosphere doesn't. Sometimes we have to go outside the church to reach the lost.

I would have prefered to pay for this book and have it end 17 chapters early than have submitted myself to this visual tripe.

The capture went well for 118 movies (still have another 60 or so to do), then a very loud back ground noise of static was introduced into the files and is a constant input into the computer speakers even if I'm not recording. I've swapped out the VCR with another, recorded other tapes but the static only stops when I unplug this USB device.

That's because the audio card uses an onboard crystal timebase to set the audio sample rate, but the video encoder uses a sample rate derived from its internal timebase and sync'd to the video frame rate. These two items can and do vary. If you are recording from tape, especially old hi-8 camcorders, they can vary a lot.This is the CHEAPEST way to make a card like this and it almost never works.

It was way too short, so the tail of the skunk was laying on the middle of her back. The front fit alright around her head but because the costume was too short overall, it kept pulling back thus the skunk ears were on my dog's neck. There also isn't enough velcro to secure the costume onto the dog and the one velcro strap that goes under the belly was too big.

She and Baltazar (with a Z, I can assure you) help some visionary priest in 16th century Lisbon to build a flying machine propelled by human will (which Blimunda gets from what she sees inside people).

Trough beautifull metaphors and a very adequate baroque style, Saramago tell us about the people who made the monastery, especially Baltazar and Blimunda. The strange couple live a life lasting, simple love, that contrasts with the cold, indifferent and political relantionships of royalty. The arrogant aristocracy in a healthy land, enough arrogant to pay it's debts with human lives is ironically described together with the cynical religiousness and the misery.

Then come the \\"comedy bits,\\" which feature jokes such as this:INTERVIEWER: What's your name?GUY: I don't know!Followed by hysterical laughter from the audience. I can only presume that the audience consisted of these guys' friends.The most bizarre bit on the CD is \\"Ve Found You Adolph,\\" which features three guys yelling at each other in mock-German accents, listing Nazi war criminals and occasionally playing \\"cuckoo\\" sound effects.

I believe those Words are appropriate in describing the whole content and intent of this film. By trying to discredit His Life and Mission it just reaffirms by trying to do this it just strengthens ones belief because of the lack of integrity in presenting the facts in an objective manner.

It portrays the scientist and his actions in the context of his psyche, the political environment in which he operated, and through the eyes of the scientists who participated in the program.The reader will come away from this book with a much better appreciation for the factors that went into some of the major decisions affecting SDI.

I consider myself a huge fan of B5 and the Rangers carried enormous respect. The theme on this that there is a group a misfits that can do some great things when they overcome their unruly behaviors seemed more like chasing the popularity of FarScape. A ranger spin-off could have been cool if it maintained the same dignity as B5's version. The rangers lived for the one and died for the one. They were not whiny misfits.

The mysterious alien race threatening the Liandra's crew were too much like the Shadows of the series.If you're a die-hard B-5 fan you'll want this film, but if you're looking for an introduction to B-5 go with the season box sets.All-in-all not JMS' best. Which is sad because it had promise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing release in an otherwise great series","review":"This DVD is by no means up to the standards set by the other Babylon 5 discs. The picture quality is VHS-grade at best, with obvious analog chroma noise (\\"rainbow snow\\") throughout - particularly noticable in darker scenes such as the Grey Council. I've checked this by playing it on a PC and it is clearly in the recorded content and not a playback issue.It is also the most expensive on a dollar/content basis - $14 for a single special with no extras whatsoever (not even a paper insert with a chapter list), versus $50 for a slick boxed set of the other 5 specials, with various bonus features and a booklet. While this might be unavoidable due to its seperate release, it does make the poor quality even less excusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Unexplained...Explained","review":"This is a very good chapter in the B5 movies. It explains to us the Earth/Minbari war, which the show only skimmed over. I was also pleasantly surprised that it fit in with the original story.

The acting is terrible, the plot is OK, the special effects are consistent with the old series but look dated by modern standards.Andreas Katsulas, as usual, is fantastic and his short scenes are the only thing to reccomend this movie.

Otherwise? probably not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lets hope this isn't used to remember the B5 story","review":"I felt embarrased just watching the combat scenes with the gunner flailing around like a drunk.Storyline was decent but some of the dialog was seriously lacking especially in G'kar.For an attempt to revive B5 and start a ranger spin off they did a horrible job.

Worse than \\"Grey 17 Is Missing.\\" Worse than \\"Infection.\\" Preposterously bad. The acting is terrible. The dialogue is incredibly terrible. (If someone said \\"We live for the One, we die for the One\\" one more time, I'd have gone the kind of mad Lovecraft wrote about.) The effects . . . well, they're actually quite good. But effects do not a good movie make.I'm still buying this one, of course, because I'm a completist.

As a stand alone movie set in the B5 playground, it's worth watching for no other reason then it delvers a very good story to the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst of B5...too bad.","review":"It is just too bad this has any connection with the series BABYLON 5. I loved all seasons of B5, the third and fourth are the best, and this movie is the absolute worst. Buy SERENITY instead. or any season of STARGATE or the seasons of B5, but not this."},{"rating":"2","title":"BABYLON 5 CONTINUED?","review":"I saw this pilot when it was first released. I enjoyed the entire BABYLON 5 series and was sorry to see it come to a close. I was very impressed with this PILOT and was hoping to see it as a series. I would have rated it as a 5 if it had continued! But even though it didn't make it, I'm glad to have it in my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can see why its a series that never was...","review":"Whats to say. If I had to hear, 'We live for the one, we...'yada yada yadaHonestly, it may have gotten better if allowed to go forward but LOTR cast, story premise and acting just wasn't up to par with B5. When I say that I mean it wasn't even in the same league. Although, season 1 of B5 sucked and I can't see why it wasn't cancelled. It wasn't until season 3 (John Sheridan's watch) that I began to watch it. I later went back and viewed season 2 which I also enjoyed and became a big Babylon 5 fan. But season 1 sucked! Okay where was I? Oh yeah, Legend of the Rangers sucked twice!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish SyFy had picked this up...","review":"Many Babylon5 fans dissed this movie, but I loved it. The interplay between the main characters, especially the captain and his first, was brilliant and the addition of G'Kar to bridge the gap between the movie and series was inspired. The special effects leave something to be desired because the movie was done by SciFi, and Warner Brothers didn't want to share its CGI with them. This movie was scheduled against the Superbowl --started out with a 1.5 and ended with over 4.0 in the ratings but SciFi didn't figure that meant anything and didn't pick it up for a series."},{"rating":"1","title":"This thing sucked!","review":"I loved B5 and Crusade. I hated this. Well, maybe hate is too strong a word. I strongly disliked it.I'm gonna make this short and sweet.The plot stunk. The idea a race as old and powerful as they presented in the pilot could've gone un-noticed by the \\"first ones\\" and not have an influence in the Shadow wars of the original B5 series is completely ludicris to me.The acting was far from normal B5 universe quality. That hologram targeting system thing was totally and completely disaterous. Gawd awful!!!The story never went anywhere. The whole time I was waiting for the movie to progress. It never did.The special effects where fantastic though. A+ work there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Somme/Gallipoli/Poland of the Sci-Fi world!","review":"A damn good film. Whilst not perfect it is superior sci-fi. The space battles look amazing, with inventive colourful effects that serve the story well... (take note Armageddon)... and the acting is of a pretty good calibre. The emotional content is a lot higher than it's brethren as this time no hero is going to save us from a literally invincible enemy. What makes this stand out is that it portrays the war from both sides, with interesting revelations. The best scene is undoubtably the final assault... thousands of Eart fighters and hundreds of destroyers against equal number of Minbari. The sight of the Minbari flooding out of the jump gates in the hundreds to the horror and despair of the humans is brilliant! Yet facing CERTAIN death the humans still engage them. Fantastic! Although the battles are short compared to Hollywood's they are seared on to your brain and carry a larger impact.The boys done good."},{"rating":"2","title":"New life for B5","review":"It's been a while since this DVD, let alone this movie, has appeared. Its appearance has been thanks to a loyal fanbase: way to go people!In my opinion it gives new avenues in the B5 universe. In a short while a new menace is being introduced that brings mystery, intrigue and a new challenge along with it. A pity it had to be put in so short a movie; a series would have been nice.Also, it is the last appearance of the great Andreas \\"G'kar\\" Katsulas. What a great loss for the world of acting in general and B5 cast in particular.Personally, I prefer it above the Crusade mini series. I certainly hope there will be a new B5 series incarnation in the future. Please continue your excellent psychology, mr. Straczynski."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst B5 EVER!!!","review":"This awful entry in the usually wonderful Babylon 5 series is truly attrocious. Its crimes run the gamut from bad acting, to stumbling meandering plot, unneccessary uber powerful alien beings of the week, zero chmeistry between the cast and the all time worst moment in the entire film and the B5 universe in general - I defy you to watch the scene where the female gunnery officer hops into the full environment weapons system and proceeds to Kung Fu and scream her way through a firefight and not laugh yourself into a frenzy of tears and frustration. Absolute unintentional comedy gold much to the detriment of this movie.But in fact don't watch it, avoid this mess and do yourself a favor and stick to the regular series. JMS should have known better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, terrible, terrible.","review":"I'm a huge fan of the series and popped this into my cart to get free shipping for the first Lost Tales DVD. What a mistake!Lets just say that no-where near the full potential of the rangers was realised in this one. Don't go here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst. episode. ever.","review":"How could one of the best sci-fi shows on television at the time spawn such a wretched, lackluster offspring? Oh yeah, remember \\"Galactica 1980\\"? NOW it all makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better then I thought they would be...","review":"My personal favorite was \\"In The Beginning\\". This movie really did an excellent job going over events that became pivotal to the later story. Acting, sets, and special effects were also \\"top notch\\".The only movie I didn't really enjoy was the \\"River of Souls\\" and the first half of Lost Tales. JMS did too much about religion and the supernatural overtones with these stories was excessive."},{"rating":"2","title":"The true successor to Babylon 5","review":"I may be in the minority, but I regard LotR as the true spinoff successor to B5, and enjoyed it a heck of a lot more than Crusade. That being said, it was not without its issues- the Ranger chick Sarah throwing the ship's weaponry with her hands and feet was somewhat cheeky as an example. Though to be fair with this criticism, I kinda liked this concept of VR ship control.But, like other issues with LotR, I think this could've been worked out better had the pilot been given the chance the original B5 pilot was. After all, \\"The Gathering\\" was not that endearing to me, but after some tweaking and a slight revamping, season one of B5 became something that I really enjoyed and went on to follow to the end of the series five years later.Over time I believe LotR would've become something B5 fans would've been proud of too, and quite frankly wouldn't mind seeing redone even today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I thought this was a wondeful tangent to the Babylon world. As a Babylon-5 fan, I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought this - I want my money back!!!","review":"This was absolutely awful. My wife and I gritted our teeth hoping it would get better. We're both Bab5 fans and have watched all the seasons more than once on DVD. When it was over we were both relived (that it was over) and angry (that it was so horrid, and that we paid money for it). Quite frankly, I feel ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Babylon 5 has gone really downhill","review":"This movie was by far the worst Babylon 5 installment. Where the series and previous movies were well thought out, Legend of the Rangers seemed geared towards a younger audience. Visions of Babylon 5 meets Power Rangers was what stuck in my mind as I watched. I couldn't recommend this show to anyone, even if I disliked them."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't go back again","review":"I miss Babylon 5. I miss J. Michael Straczynski. As it has been said by other reviewers: the weapons system controlled by a woman in a virtual reality chamber was pretty ridiculous. And the writing was awful. It's like they tried to hit every note that was in the full 5 years of B5 in one desperate story. I got the feeling it was written by committee...a committee formed of people who saw the series as homework and came up with this script in an all-nighter. I'm afraid we have to just let B5 go, and enjoy our DVD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Completists Only","review":"Strengths: Soundtrack by Christopher Franke, performance by Andreas Katsulas in 1st half. Interesting idea of weapons system.Weaknesses: Plot was mostly stupid. Tragic underutilization of G'Kar as a character in the second half. Unconvincing sense of scale for the Leanndra (Why call for \\"a healer\\"? How many healers are on board this tiny ship?). Felt more like a pilot for a new series than a standalone movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Spinoff","review":"This \\"movie\\", which was obviously meant to be a pilot but was aired as a stand-alone feature, lacks nearly everything that made Babylon 5 a great show. It's set in the same universe and contains the same races and ships, but the plotting feels like, well, a failed pilot.G'Kar's scenes in \\"Rangers\\" are an embarassment to the character. After a spectacular sendoff on the original B5 series, he re-enters the universe apparently having regressed two or three seasons' worth of character development. There is no reason for him to be present except to spout off some gratuitous quotes from Babylon 5 and remind us that we are watching a B5 show.Overall, this show would be without much value if it stood alone. As an episode of the B5 mythos, it is worth even less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy","review":"This is a terrible product. I may have to consider requesting a refund.

Lousy product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs, unless you enjoy rotting, moldy wood.","review":"I bought this chair about 6 months ago because it was made of Teak wood which is supposed to be water/mold resistant. Well, I'm not sure who did the research on this product, but the wood began to weaken and tear apart as well as grow mold all over it. It also never turned the \\"handsome silver gray patina\\" that they claimed it would. It's a shame that I have to throw away a 60.00 chair after only a half years worth of use.

I have tried in vain to get it to work without rocking back and forth even setting the leg adjustments differently in the front. Also, the legs and the whole product do not seem sturdy.

It works like a charm. Have had it for about 6 months and no signs of rotting or rusting. the legs are adjustable to height. Had to put one leg at a different height than the others since the shower is on a slant. Wish the small angle was more acute so that it fit more perfectly on the edge, but I'm being picky. Very nice. I also like that I can take it out to create more shower space unlike building a shower bench.Purchased one as a gift and had to return it because the leg was broken. Received replacement promptly and without incident."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Upon Arrival","review":"The first bench I received arrived with the teak seat broken in half. I sent it back only to have the replacement broken in the same way. Rather than try again, I fixed it with glue and metal braces underneath.

If you have just this, a good knife, and proper clothes you can survive in the wilderness with good survival skills. This fire starter is best used when dry although it will spark in wet conditions. To make it easier to start a fire you need to have fine chipped wood shavings as tender to ignite. A good thing to take with you is an Altoids can of pencil shavings or napkins as tender. You have to be able to ignite the sparks from the FireSteel. If you don't carry the shavings with you a good knife is needed to do it before you make a fire. This model would be ideal for scouts, backpackers, both woman and children could probably use this and it would be less dangerous than other alternatives.

It's a good thing that there were as many illustrations as there were because it would have made reading the book more of a chore.

Size: They are small enough to fit in a wristlet/small purse or larger wallet even, or can be easily put in a pocket without being noticeable.

At the same time, they are plenty big to fit quite a few small pills and at lesat four or five (maybe more if you stack them) big pills (multivitamin size).

Price: you get 6 containers for the cost, which is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice but....","review":"These are handy and well-sized pill containers, but they are slightly pricier than others available on Amazon, some of which are made of aluminum unlike these which are made of plastic, which means the hinge is likely to fail over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a college student","review":"Got for my freshman college student, and it was just perfect to give some fun munchies at college during finals week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I purchased these bits in order to switch out some screws on my motorcycle. I used the T45 bit and didn't have any problem removing the screws but putting the new ones in was a different story. I needed to torque the new screws to 21 ft/lbs. the first one wasn't a problem. On the second one the bit twisted to the point where it's unusable before it reached 21 Lbs.

Secor provides a great range of reliable information. The first time I depended on him, I came to a high pass and wondered if it really was the class 2 he claimed (doable without equipment and great risk of falling off). It looked harder. I cautiously decided to give it a try--and he was right. His descriptions are brief, but sufficiently precise to be useful. Anyone hiking in the Sierra will want this book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Guide","review":"Easy to read and well organized. Useful for trip planning as well as arm chair hiking and climbing on a rainy day. A little something for everyone, including permit, trail head, trail, and climbing route info with useful photos showing the various routes. It is a bit more of a nuts and bolts (cams and biners??...sorry)guide for the mountain climber rather than a hiking guide. Lots of info on first ascents as well. My only criticism is the maps, which are a bit lacking in detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice update to the best book on the subject","review":"Overall, the best climbing guide to the High Sierra. Still a bit misleading in places, e.g., Southwest Slope route on Mt. Humphreys is better entered via start of the Huthinson route. Addition of GPS UTM waypoints is useful, but could be improved by adding more digits and more waypoints now that GPS accuracy is better and more users carry GPS units."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disheartened Climber","review":"This book contains the least amount of useful information that I've ever seen in a guidebook. It more or less is a historical document of routes that have been done and who did them. A prime example is what is written about Fishhook Arete - \\"follow the arete to the summit\\". That's it; if I knew where the approach was, what gear to bring, and how long it would take I'd also know to follow the arete. Fortunately I borrowed this book from a friend who also has the same opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly useless book.","review":"A lot of maps, pictures and wording. Absolutely no precise information about trailheads, approaches to the picks, trails and routs itself. A failed attempt to tall all about everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch your back!","review":"It was fun to get hold of this book which was published in the thirties. There is some good information but...at the same time it is written and produced by a government trying to sell the \\"elastisity\\" of the Constition of the United States, that is, make it bend, squeeze, and stretch to accomodate FDR's desire to socialize the nation during his administration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another horrible release from Madacy","review":"Count Basie is an American legend. His recordings are legendary, and during his 40+ year career, he made some of the finest recordings in the history of jazz music.And since he's so important, he's got tons of compilations. But 'Golden Legends' stands out, and not in a good way, either. Why, you may ask?Well, it looks really good. It's got most of Basie's standards and some underrated songs. And it's cheap, too. So you may be thinking, \\"What's so bad about it?\\"The sound quality is HORRID! Count Basie is considered an American icon, and he deserves SO MUCH BETTER!!! Why anybody would actually pay $$$ for this is beyond me. Madacy, just like all of their other releases, makes no effort whatsoever to clean this up.Overall, buy 'Greatest Hits (RCA).' Buy 'Ken Burns JAZZ.' Buy 'The Complete Atomic Basie.' Anything else will do.

I thought it would give food a taste similar to using vanilla extract, but it doesn't. When used in liquid it tends to sink to the bottom as it does not stay evenly mixed. I won't buy it again. I prefer using vanilla extract."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pathos, obsession, and inner human depths","review":"Adroitly written by Jillian McCade, New Orleans Nocturne is a compelling novel of pathos, obsession, and inner human depths. Julia Grant is a woman who fled to the festive city to escape her past, only to find it gradually catching up with her, permeating her new life and her new friends, while a wise yet reserved voodoo mamba named Sister Lula watches it all. New Orleans Nocturne is highly recommended as an original, darkly twisted, deeply satisfying story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not meet expectations","review":"I was impatient waiting for this book to come out. But it ended up being a big disappointment. Lynn Kurland's best book is This is all I ask. This certainly does not measure up. Gwen was a disappointment. She was forever getting into scrapes and thinking she could save the day, but all she ever did was make things worse. Rhys was interesting, but lacked the charisma of some of Kurland's other heros. Overall, I am glad I read this book because it explains where the de Piagets come into the picture, but otherwise it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bottom line; pretty bad!","review":"I don't like to speak poorly about an author's work because at their worst they write better than I could even imagine. Another Chance To Dream by Lynn Kurland is just such a book. Gwen the heroine annoyed me from the moment I met her and Rhys the hero is so gallant he appears to be a wet noodle. I thought a book about Rhys' parents would have made a much more interesting story. I enjoyed their small cameo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Kurland!","review":"My first Kurland book was Stardust of Yesterday and it made me hooked on her work. I agree that Another Chance to Dream is not a happy book, but Lynn does not dwell on the tragedies. Unlike so many books that make you suffer, usualy with the heroine, as she endures the most dreadfull situations, Another Chance to Dream focus on the good moments rather than the bad ones and though Gwen and Rhys wait a long time for happiness, it does come their way. It is a very good book and describes very well the way of living in medieval times ( it also enlightens us, Lynn Kurland readers, as how Artane fits into things). Please don't be discouraged by all the negative reviews. If you like Lynn's books, you know that there is always depth in her writing and this book is no exception and believe me, it gives us all the hope and warmth feelings of her other work.Enjoy it and keep it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING","review":"Every other Kurland book is a five-star, without a doubt. This is the one glaring exception. The book was depressing. Yeah, yeah, the characters end up together in the end but by then who should care? They've been through so much at that point that you almost rather Kurland kill them off and allow them to be done with their misery.If you like depressing authors like Danielle Steele then you will be in true nirvana with this sad tale. Otherwise, skip this one and wait for Kurland's next one. Her other books are so good that I'm convinced this is going to be a one-time mistake. Hey, nobody's perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have to agree...","review":"Unfortunately, I have to agree with the other reviewers who gave this a one or two star rating. This was definately not one of Lynn Kurland's best. I loved her other books, especially \\"Stardust of Yesterday\\", \\"A Dance Through Time\\" and \\"The Very Thought of You\\". Until this book, I had not been disappointed by anything from Lynn Kurland. It is filled with misery rather than the love and humor her other books contained. It was very difficult to get through. I kept hoping it would get better, but was sadly mistaken.Take mine and others advice, don't bother with this particular book, but rather read her previous books - they are very good. I will chalk this one up to a one time mistake, and eagerly look forward to her next books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little disappointing...","review":"I am a fan of Ms. Kurland's work and very much wanted to like this book, but it was disappointing. I found it so silly that all the drama and heartbreak could have been prevented if Rhys' grandfather had just told him the complete truth from the beginning (I don't want to ruin the ending for those who haven't read the book yet). And I also didn't like the fact that Gwen was given the role of \\"dumb, helpless female\\" whose schemes always cause more trouble then help, and then she would have to be saved by Rhys. The only character I liked was Rhys, and only because he was such a good guy and you felt bad for him. Poor guy, he deserved a better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE HAS DONE BETTER.","review":"THE CHARACTERS WERE FLAT THAT EVEN THE HUMOROUS STUFF WAS LOST. IT STARTED OUT GREAT AND THEN AFTER THE MAIN CHARACTERS BECAME LOVERS HE HAD TO SIT OUTSIDE HER DOOR WHILE SHE HAD A WEDDING NIGHT WITH SOMEONE ELSE I WAS FINISHED. I HATED IT AND EVEN THOUGH THE ENDING WAS HALF WAY DECENT I ALREADY HAD LOST INTEREST AND DIDN'T CARE. I HAVE READ ALL HER OTHER BOOKS AND LOVED THEM THIS WAS A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Chance to Dream","review":"This book was a delightful way to spend the afternoon, much better than the movies. The story was heart wrenchingly touching. It was not like other books where you know pretty much where the story is going and you just go along for the ride. This book produced twists and turns that I was not expecting. Deffinatly a must read for Lynn Kurland fans. Bravo for Ms. Kurland, who knows how to create a good love story with passion and desire, while at the same time keeping it suprisingly clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good humorous characters","review":"This book contains Lynn Kurland's excellent humor. I love the dialogue she writes and the funny characters she creates (in the twins here), but this book also had a very sad plot line. Much bad befalls the two main characters -- more than someone would like to see in a romance novel. I was depressed through the first 2/3 of the book for the unthinkable things that happened. It picks up after that, though. I have read most of Kurland's books and this is my least favorite. Still, I highly recommend her other books such as Stardust of Yesterday and Dance Through Time."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!","review":"This is the first book I've read by Ms. Kurland and I loved it. I thought it noble that Rhys would wait for Gwyen and do anything to make her his own. Thru all there troubles, they stood by each other and gave their love for each other freely. I was only dissapointed that Rhys never knew that Nicholas was his son. Overall, it was a wonderfull book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trying but not quite there.","review":"I read this book after hearing of it on an email list for another author. I was expecting the same type of writing...descriptive and completely engrossing. This was just okay; not nearly as well written as the books written by the other author. If you want to read WONDERFUL books by an author who is great with a good story, history, and romance, try Diana Gabaldon's 4 books beginning with \\"Outlander\\"...they're the real thing!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I loved Kurland's first three books. However, this one -- bad. Kurland wrote the book as though it were an effort -- the characters were dark and weighted and the story line was creeky, depressing and not at all \\"magical\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. Ms. Kurland is such a wonderful writer and has created such wonderful heros and heroines that I was truely shocked at what a weak hero Rhys was. Not only did he pledge his loyality to a man who had him whipped but he sold out his true love into marriage for the promise of land. Year after year he did nothing as she slept with another man, having her husband's children. He should have protected her. I was really really disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I expect wonderful stories from Ms. Kurland, but this wasn't one of them. Her other books are terrific, but this is one to miss. The main characters were flat and the events they endure are not what I want in a romance novel (e.g., the hero standing guard outside the bedroom door while the beroine has a painful wedding night with her abusive husband). The ending was surprisingly interesting (I finished the book only through sheer determinism), but I think I would rather she told the story of the hero's parents or grandparents. They were much more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"two stars for effort","review":"I was so disappointed in this last book by Ms kurland. I have read all her other books and adored them. This one starts out very promising and then dies and drags on to a very slow death. The characters are all wishy washy and you can care less what happens, you finish it just to be done. Rys and Gwen fall in love as children then he goes away, she trys to find him before she has to marry someone else. He meets her they confirm there love and then she gifts him her virginity. After that she has to marry someone else and he stands guard while she has sex with her husband and then the book goes down the drain. We want fantasy not dry boring reality. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Having A Hard Time Finishing This Book","review":"I'm just at the halfway point of this book and having a very hard time trying to read it. Once again Rhys and Gwen are trying to open their hearts about each other, but,yet again, cannot due out of loyalty and what's right for everybody else. That's good and all, but do you have to drudge it out every 5 to 10 pages? It's nice to know that they both end up together at the end (don't they all?), but getting there is bad. I strongly suggest \\"Star of Yesterday\\"...very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 Stars. 1 Hot mess of a story. 2 Wimpy main charaters.","review":"Quite simply, one of the worst books I've ever read. Most of the book revolves around the lead female marrying a jerk and having his children. Through years of this, the hero follows her around and acts as her protector while watching her make a family with another man. Each time he tries to convince her to let him attempt an escape for the two of them and the children, she starts balling and refuses. Why the heck did he want to stay? In the end, I suppose they deserved each other. A couple of wet noodles. A man who is celibate, and a woman who \\"services\\" her jerk husband. Ah... so romantic. NOT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not sure I will finish it.","review":"This is my first Lynn Kurland book and I am definitely not enthralled with the characters.

Where was the magic?","review":"I couldn't understand how they fall in love to begin with, so how did they stay in love? Who wants to read how Gwen is getting married to another man, sleeping with him, and having his children?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn City!","review":"I was truly disappointed with this book. It was not up to the standards that Lynn Kurland set for herself. The story was flat and reading it was tedious. I was halfway through the book before it became slightly interesting, only to lose interest after a few pages. The only reason I didn't toss the book was because I don't like to leave things half done. I was really surprised at this \\"Another Chance to Dream\\", considering how wonderful her past books have been. I hope the next book that Lynn Kurland puts out will be better."},{"rating":"1","title":"great light, almost impossible to change battery","review":"It works great, but to change the battery, you have to open 4 microscopic screws that strip easily.

The switch is cleverly set up to be convenient, but nearly impossible to accidentally turn on. LRI's newer Freedom models are worse off here - one unlucky squeeze on those can drain your battery.The only downside here is that it is a bit tricky to change the batteries, but I find it a fair trade for how simple the guts are. There is no switch to fill with lint, no electronics to fry, just the plain LED leads that straddle the battery. Add a coating of dielectric grease to the leads and the Photon II is invulnerable to liquids."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST LITTLE LIGHT EVER!","review":"These lights are phenomenal! For such a small flashlight, they have the same brightness of most larger well known lights. I've purchased about 7 for me and one for a friend.

This light is amazing. It's lightweight, you hardly notice it at all and the clip on design is durable and easy to remove if you want. The light itself can easily light up a room and can be seen from far away. It's even bright enough to walk by through the woods or a dark road if your in a bind. Just read the product description, I will attest to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little light!","review":"I've used these for years, always keep one on my key chain and in my travel kit and always have several in reserve.

Very few items I've purchased in the past few years have served their intended purpose as well or better than these little lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Switch requires a very tough fingernail.","review":"Slide switch requires a *very* tough fingernail. I often have to use a key or something to move the slide switch.The LRI FMW Photon Freedom model works better for me. It uses an integrated circuit in the flashlight to detect that you have held the pushbutton down for a while - thus preventing accidental turn-on. No need for the tiny slide switch. Because of the electronic circuitry instead of the mechanical switch, the \\"Freedom\\" model costs a little more than this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked","review":"After years of purchases, this is the only thing I've ever ordered from Amazon that didn't work.

Since I have it on my keychain, it's instantly available (no searching for a flashlight). I use it daily. The switch for locking the light on makes this one superior to the \\"squeeze only\\" version. The light it bright, and the two CR2016 batteries last for months. Changing the batteries is a little bit of a nuisance - you need a very small Phillips screwdriver and the procedure requires careful fiddling, but I change them so infrequently that the annoyance level is pretty low.

Subsequently, I bought the 10 pack of lighted key chains from LaFemme for $14.50 total ($1.45/chain) vs. this one which was a total rip-off at $8.50 delivered.

I can't remember which way is on, and it requires some force to move it. But that is good because you don't want to turning on by accident and killing the battery. The switch is small and requires a thumb nail to move, but again, that is a good thing.I use this often when leaving my office late at night. I have to fumble with my keys to lock my door and the hall lights are already off (complete darkness). I could use my office light to find the hall switch, turn the light on, lock up, open the door at the other end of the hall for some light from the street, turn off the hall switch, and then leave. But it's so much easier just to use my super bright key chain light. This is where the on switch is a major benefit."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Problems","review":"Contrary to other reviews, the many Photon Micros I purchased here are perfect - not knock-offs.

I do agree with those who say that the large Liddell and Scott (LSJ) is also very useful. My study so far has been in ancient Greek generally (from Homer to Koine) and I have used LSJ (and the abridged editions) extensively; it a good tool to give New Testament readers a wider view of particular meanings.So if you can afford it I say buy Danker and LSJ, and if you don't know your Greek accents, get a good book on that too (such as the one by Probert)."},{"rating":"2","title":"#! scholar's lexicon","review":"Briefly, this lexicon is a scholarly lexicon. Some of the other reviews have criticized that its definitions are inappropriate for beginning students, and that is true becasuse this is the most advanced and comprehensive lexicon that does justice to the imprecisions within the greek language. More often than not, a Greek word cannot be exactly equated with an English equivalent. This lexicon does justice to the broad semantic ranges of even the most obscure Greek word. This is recommended for scholars and serious students of Koine Greek. This lexicon is also an outstanding reference for scholarly publications concerning the Greek text. There is also a version available for the Logos software suite."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will never read the New Testament the same way again!","review":"Walter Bauer spent five hours every day of his scholarly career working on this invaluable lexicon. This lexicon will open up the world of New Testament Greek to even the beginning scholar. With only a little help and looking through the introduction to the lexicon, this volume will unpack the meaning of all the words in the New Testament and other Early Christian texts. If you are a seminarian, pastor, or interested person, this is a must have volume for your shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is a CD-Rom version available now!!!!!","review":"Logos software now has an CD-Rom edition of this as well as the unabridged 9th of Liddell and Scott. It makes it a lot easier, no more flipping back and forth between the abbreviation lists if you hover over the abbreviation with the full title will pop up.

I was VERY disconcerted by the printing of the letters kappa and chi - they both were the same! Was this a typo by The University of Chicago Press? At any rate, I would still recommend this book as it does seem to cover much of the most important words of the New Testament such as \\"predestination,\\" \\"spirit,\\" \\"baptism,\\" and some others.

First, it is packed with the most recent papyrii and mss finds. Such additional comparative philological references are indispensable for accurate contextual studies. This 3rd edition is highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"over-rated and not worth the $","review":"For much less than the price of this lexicon, one can purchase a copy of Thayer's, AND Trenchard's vocabulary guide AND a Greek concordance. People make a big deal about how Thayer's lexicon is out of date because he did not have access to the papyri, but for 99% of New Testament words and meanings this is not an issue. Trenchard's book is actually MORE helpful, in my opinion, than this or any lexicon because he simply lists every possible meaning of each word. One way to get to the essence of a word's meaning is to look at the cognates, and Trenchard lists them all. A Greek concordance will actually print all the NT uses of a word in Greek. Bauer's lexicon tends to be wordy. It's helpful, don't get me wrong, but way over-priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greek!","review":"This is all Greek!

And that album rocked my world for 3 months straight. So of course I enjoyed \\"Skaleluia!\\", but it wasn't exactly new material. I was so psyched for \\"Fight Of My Life\\" that I was actually the first person to buy it from the local Christian store! And when I put it in, I liked it...but didn't love it. Songs such as \\"The Hunted\\" and \\"Fight Of My Life\\" are chill, but the rest of it just doesn't impress me much.

They sound like \\"Less Than Jake,\\" or \\"The Mighty Mighty Bosstones.\\" My favorite track is \\"Jigsaw\\" this song has a cool rap session at the begining and in the middle of the song. For this ska band it works very well. Although the down side to having a good song is they play the music vidoe all the time, with luck I won't get sick of the song.

I have his 4 symphonies in Sawallisch interpretation which I like very much (the Dresden Staatskapelle is wonderfully caught), but in the case of the 4th, I have always found his tempi were too quick. This is particularly evident in the first movement, where Sawallisch seems too hurried and also in the beautiful slow movement. In contrast, Furtwaengler tempi in the four movements immediately win you over. The sound is dated, of course, but the ears quickly adjust, and musically it's a wonderful experience. The Haydn too is a joy to hear. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book!","review":"The Visitation was a good read, just a little too long. It had some good parts and interesting ideas. The characters were well introduced. I would recommand it to my Christian friends. I discovered another book called, 'The Fist of God' by A.T. Nicholas. One of the best novels I've read in a long time. I would also recommand this book, but it does have some strong language. I wouldn't let that stop you from reading it, because the moral message and plot are too good to pass up. Plus, the positive out weighs the negitive by far. If you like good against evil stories with some bite and fresh twists, than, 'The Fist of God' is for you. Even the so-called non-believers would dig this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Classic By Peretti","review":"I can not get enogh of this writer. I just finished The Visitation and I cannot wait til his next book is done. (WARNING! - Improtant plot point ahead, do not read if you do not want it revealed before you have read this book) The only book I have not read is Tilly. Its is amazing that I read his books at the exact time that I find similar things occuring in my life. As an employee of a Christian organization (4 letter-Village People song) I have recently struggled with good and evil in the community I work in. This is again the basis for this book. I sat reeading and thinking that this guy had to be JC, but I kept waiting for the other shoe to drop. Anyway, it does and I see how easily we are swayed by what we want to believe is good. I have to stand up constantly and be a moral leader in my community. I know that Peritti is always inspiring and this book is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't stop reading!","review":"I must admit that after reading the first 100 pages I was ready to put the book down because the plot develops slowly at the beginning of the book. I am glad, however, that I read the entire book. I would like to encourage anyone who decides to start reading this book not to stop reading because the book picks up momentum and develops beautifully in the last two-thirds of the story. After reading this fictional account, I understand how important it was for Peretti to slowly develop the characters. As the happenings in Antioch become more intense, I found it hard to put the book down. I really felt empathetic to the main character, Travis. His cynicism and faith struggle are something I think most people in their Spiritual Journey encounter. I look forward to reading some more works by Frank Perreti!"},{"rating":"2","title":"false messiahs shall arise and deceive many","review":"I'm a big fan of Peretti's novels.

Is he of God or the Devil?

The ending was pretty good, although not as climatic as Frank built it up to be. I read House before this and i wasn't all that big a fan of that book, but i would strongly suggest House over The Visitation. In all, the book spends way to much time dealing with the main characters past, which has little to nothing to do with the actual story, where as it should of exemplified the main plot instead.

BUT GOD BLESS PERETTI'S EFFORT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it in the garbage","review":"The story dragged, and Peretti seemed to focus a great deal of attention on the weaknesses and inconsistencies in Christianity. We all know about them, but the Bible says to dwell on those things which are uplifting, pure, lovely, and of a good report.....and this book definitely was not. Why draw attention to the negative, so the unchristian world can see the worst? I wasn't sure what Peretti was trying to accomplish in writing the story, but I considered it a total waste of time. I could not have a clear conscience in giving this book to a neighbor or a child, since it drew out so many doubts and negative questions, so I threw it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Novel","review":"This was different. Mr. Peretti attacked the evil that can sometimes be found even inchurches. I often find a story interesting if I can feel sorry for the villain.

Mr. Peretti just keeps gettingbetter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pastor I Would Love To Have","review":"While reading this book, I kept thinking that Travis Jordan was a pastor I would love to have. He's real, he's multi-dimensional, and yet I do not feel that this character compromises his Christianity in any way. As for this being a \\"Christian Novel...\\" who cares? As a Christian, I enjoyed it, but as a reader, I found it to be up to par with so many great novels of secular lineage out there today. I literally cried when he began telling Morgan the stories of all the people in his congregation and his town that he had touched and ministered to throughout the years. The story of Bruce Hiddle was extremely encouraging, to see and almost feel a pastor care so much about the people God has placed in his life. As for the Brandon/FakeJesus character, God help us all!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to put down!","review":"Truly impossible to put down!

I learned a lot from Travis describing his own life and I really identified with the doubts and troubles he had. I loved the human touch the book has and the way the characters are so real. For me, the book started off slow, but continuing on it became so exciting I couldn't put it down. I really commend Peretti in this wonderful book and will recommend all my friends to read it.

Peretti addresses many of the wild currents running through not only the Pentecostal movement today -- but the charismatic movement in general. He also does an excellent job of showing the transition of moving out of a binding, guilt-ridden, legalistic life and into a life of freedom in God's grace. I was so pleased that he showed how a believer can have an active ministry, be used by the Holy Spirit and not speak in tongues!! I would definitely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most exciting spiritual fiction. Peretti's best book!","review":"As you read through this book the main character is brought through a number of situation that test his faith and bring him closer to GOD through which he must question all his beleifs.

Peretti gets a thumbs up for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Visitation is not up to usual Frank Peretti style","review":"I was disappointed in the Vistation. It was not up the the same line as \\"This Present Darkness\\", \\"Piercing The Darkness\\" and \\"The Oath\\". It does not have the spiritual side in it like those do. I would not give this to anyone that was a fan of Frank Peretti it was a disappointing book.Thank you Lynn Davis"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story! Great characters! Couldn't get any better!","review":"This is probably one of, if not the, best novles Peretti has ever written. I loved it. Frank is very real and it shows in all the characters. You couldn't ask for a better novel. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves great characterization and a great story."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have given it 6 stars, but they wouldn't let me!","review":"I didn't think it possible for Frank Peretti to outdo himself, but The Visitation was difficult to put down from the very first chapter. With his seemingly heightened skillful, thought provoking illustrations, he waltzes the reader into the most colorful scenes with vividly whimsical characters. This fast-paced, brainy adventure helps the Christian community see itself as the disjointed body that we are, in hopes that we will wake up and unite as one body while there's still time.Not to be compared to his previous books which intriguingly fishtail you in and out of the spirit realm, it's evident in The Visitation that Mr. Peretti did his homework on human emotions!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down...","review":"I purchased this book one day after being blindsided over something happening at the church I attend. Frank Peretti is so on target with his observations about contemporary American Christian culture. He uses the main character, Travis (and his observations about the churches in town and those in Travis' background) to illuminate much of where we as Christians have strayed into \\"programs\\" and \\"putting on a show\\" and clinging to \\"the way things have always been done,\\" allowing such things to take priority over our own personal relationship with Christ and the core relational action of making disciples. Catholics, Pentecostals, \\"mainline\\" Protestand denominations, mega-churches and fundamentalists all are all included in this hard look at the state of American Christianity. It is Travis' journey from disilousionment with the institution of the church to a revitalized relationship with God that is the core theme of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and realistic","review":"From one who has ministered in the charmastic circles for the past 12 years, this book spoke to some of my own struggles in the faith. The bigger ministeries appear to be impersonal and the smaller churches seemed to be filled with sightseers and pew sitters that want a bigger and better \\"dog and pony show.\\" There is a balance we need to come to in the pentacostal circles where we are not ministering in \\"hellfire and damnation\\" and having to work for our own righteousness; but we need not be in the ditch with \\"greasy grace and unity at all costs\\" either. Thanks, Mr. Peretti for addressing these issues in such a compelling,forthright way. The book gives much food for thought for all the saints of the Lord. What we do to each other and our families in the name of ministry must make our Saviour very sad. No wonder there is and will continue to be deception and falling away from the faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brought healing to me, an \\"outsider\\"","review":"Each page I read of Mr. Peritti's book was like reading a page from my life the past few years. The pastor's thoughts were my own. I could not put the book down. This is truly Mr. Peritti's finest work. I cried, I prayed, but most of all I healed. I have never read a book that has touched me more than the Bible itself. This book is truly inspired. Thank you Mr. Peritti for writing it for all of us \\"outsiders\\". The irony is that once you figure out you have been an outsider, miraculously, you are no longer there! I recommend this book very highly at the Christian bookstore I work at. Customer response has been great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Take","review":"As a man currently struggling in the faith - I have to say that this book has truly been a blessing. Not the greatest ending - but I think the book is more about Travis' personal struggle than it is about weeping crucifixes and false messiahs. I got the point - right to the core.Also - Chapter 19 - been there... done that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book","review":"Have not read as of yet.

The tone seemed very darkand went places I didn't care to go if that makes any sense.

In my opinion, nothing more than an effort to profit in the marketplace. There is nothing interesting or redeeming about this book --- not to mention that the prose is kindergarden level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for people with sensitive spirits","review":"I read the whole book in 3 days and stylistically it was very good. But when I finished I realized that I felt fear inside because there was no scene where demons expressed terror of the name of Jesus like in previous books that Frank Peretti has written(which ARE uplifting). These demons were described as powerful and angry. My mind has been troubled with some of the grotesque scenes that reminded me more of Stephen King books I used to read before I was saved. I have personally had encounters with the power of the name of Jesus against demons, and I KNOW that they are TERRIFIED of the wrath of the Lamb. This book seemed to emphasize all the destruction that the devil does without the restorative power of God. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU DON'T READ THIS PARTICULAR BOOK (read \\"The Oath\\" or \\"This Present Darkness\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Me...","review":"I just recently heard Duffy Bishop sing \\"Damn Blues\\" on the radio.

While the main body of the creel seems durable enough, the straps that are attached are not, also the way that the lid of the creel is attached to the main basket is to flimsy. \\"You get what you pay for.\\" I am happy with the creel for the decorative purpose for which it was purchased, and my wife is using it for that purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"fishing creel","review":"not what I expected. it was very cheaply made and wouldn't use it ito fish with only for decoration.

Her research and imagination combined to provide an interesting and believable telling of the gospel story from Mary's perspective. I didn't think I agreed with the way she portrayed Mary's attitude toward and expectations of Jesus, but when I turned to the Bible and reviewed the angel's message to Mary, I could see how she would expect Him to reign from an earthly throne. I loved the way she wove together Biblical truths and historical facts and filled in the rest with a healthy imagination."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Recreation","review":"To leave the Virgin Mary entirely within the confines of the biblical frames of reference is to miss the better part of what she is, and what she has been about for 2,000 years.

The result is that these songs come off to this listener as interesting, powerful, beautiful and romantic.So, for those only interested in hearing the young voice, (yet inexperienced in many ways) of Liza several years ago, I say \\"to each their own\\".

Much of the movie is spent with Buddy, the human elf, attempting to connect with his real father, a seemingly hopeless crank on Santa's naughty list who had no idea he even had a son. The story and special effects are, all in all, so-so.

I was worried, but couldn't wait to be away from work for a little bit. As they movie went along this is one of my new favorite Christmas movies of all time. IT has a lot of heart, and humor.

Between the gum eating scene, \\"For that Special Someone\\" and Buddy with his elf father, this movie is hilarious. I bought it when it first came out, and this is the kind of Christmas movie that you can watch anytime of the year.The only problem with this movie is the \\"love story.\\" Though sweet, it's a little sappy.But the relationship between Buddy and his biological family is sweet. The father, who isn't exactly accepting, the \\"mother\\" who loves the idea (though I wouldn't be happy if I found that my husband had fathered a son out of wedlock) and the little brother who is able to have fun once in his life.If you enjoy great comedy, then you should give this movie a try.

Sure it isn't your typicall Feral movie but its cute and heart warming so everyone will be amused. Feral did a great job at this movie and youll probable agree w/ me 2 once you rent/ buy it.Only thing that seemed fake to me was when the one blonde babe ends up falling in love w/ him.

The story line is jolting, the characters poorly developed, and the humor weak. Will ferrell does a decent job and so do the other actors but they have so little to work with it's a lost cause.I thought their was a really funny scene in the movie with a great performance from the actor who played the outside author the firm hires to write for them.

Santa said do not eat the gum on the road but he then eats the gum on the benches. either this guy trys to hard or not enough to act at all. will the skill-less actor acts like a baby. his day brings him to his work and he elf see a small man and he calls him an elf and the short man did not like that and after a while he said say it 1 more time so he did and got beat up by the little man. see that is how dumb he is. no humor at all. worst to ever be made. if you see this you will see what i mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"I'm not sure why so many others liked this film, but it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.

Enjoy with some popcorn and snuggle close to a loved one."},{"rating":"2","title":"What fun!","review":"Elf is one of our favorite family Christmas movies. We purchased this particular edition for the karaoke, coloring pages, games, and activities that were offered. I really didn't think my kids would be very interested in the games, but to my surprise they loved them. Even now after Christmas, we find ourselves using lines from the movie.

The kids will also enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby, it's cold outside.","review":"Possibly the best and funniest christmas movie to come out in the last 10 years. I wasn't really a Will F. fan until \\"Old School\\" and \\"The Ladies Man\\" came out, but this movie has made him into a bonified superstar Comedian! Looks like Willie can finally make the big bucks. I haven't seen \\"Anchorman\\" yet, but they really should make an ELf 2. Since it'll be on the HOT LIST for a while yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"The first time I saw advertisements for this movie, I thought it looked boring. But now that I've seen it for myself, I can say that it was hilarious! Will Ferrel is great in this movie, cracking jokes and effortlessly acting out the main role of Buddy the elf. Each actor played their part well, and no one slacked off. Buddy's first time in civilization was the funniest part of the movie by far! The second half of the movie wasn't all that funny, though, and I found myself to be slightly disappointed. The movie also refers to some kind of mature subjects that parents may not approve of.Overall, I would say that, though not great, this movie was pretty good, and is one that I would recommend as a family movie to families with slightly older children, though it is possible that younger children may not even catch on to the mildly adult stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Christmas Movie","review":"Got for daughter who likes the movie.

Its still in our holiday lineup but its lost a bit of its honeymoon blush."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Family Fun!","review":"This is probably the funniest Christmas movie that exists. It is one of my absolute favorites and it also has action, drama, romance, and a good plot with its humor. It is one of the few Christmas movies that has it all in it. Again, Will Ferrell has made a great movie, only your kids can actually watch this one. The adventures of the human/elf Buddy is very humorous filled with ups and downs and a good happy ending. If you don't own a copy, you should still at least watch it every Christmas season. It is in my top three favorite Christmas movies. So enjoy watching it. There are many other great actors and actresses in it as well which just add to the greatness of the movie. I hope that everyone here enjoys it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best to Rent for Christmas","review":"This is the most popular Christmas rental. We tried to get the DVD at the local video store but all they had was crappy VHS tape that was bad. We streamed this on our BlueRay for I think $2.99? Fun for my pre-teen daughters to watch, but still has too many gross jokes for younger children."},{"rating":"2","title":"ELF","review":"it was recommended. I like the story line. I have recommended it to friends and family. great movie to watch"},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS a bit corny but really good - a Christmas classic!","review":"Okay, I will admit that this movie is a bit on the corny side but sometimes, you just need something corny. Will Ferrell does a bang job with this character - Buddy the Elf. He is just so nice that you can't HELP but like him. He only tries to do good and help people but it backfires sometimes and he ends up feeling like he doesn't fit in anywhere. This is a movie that I could watch every holiday season, right along with Christmas in Connecticut, Love Actually and The Bishop's Wife. I thought it was delightful and something I could watch with my nephew and not think twice. Yes, it is corny but it really is funny too and well worth renting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great flick","review":"love the movie, an this version is distributed in thin line packaging, which is 1/2 the width of a normal DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anarcho-Christmas cheesey brilliance","review":"First of all, this was the funniest film I have ever seen; I was in tears half way through. Yes, it is a kids' movie, but adults get to watch Will Farrel rip the heart out of Christmas by camping it up and being ridiculously sincere. Watching Farrel start a fight with a fake Santa for \\"sitting on a throne of lies\\" is about as fun as films get.Those reviewers who think that this was cheesey nonsense - duh. It was supposed to be, and that is what made it so funny. And you seem to have missed the whole essence of the film.Oh, and the kids liked it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't put this DVD under the Christmas tree","review":"I got it because I really like most of the other stuff Will Ferrell does.But a jet engine on Santa's sleigh powered by Christmas spirit - come on, please - spare me.If you are like me and are a fan of Will Ferrell, I will say that there are a few funny parts mixed in. (but just a few)Maybe get it used or rent it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of Christmas Spirit!","review":"You know that feeling you get when you're 10 years old, it's Christmas eve and you're tucked up in your bed all nice and snug...that's the feeling you get when you watch this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very impressed :(","review":"The IDEA of this movie is really cute, but the end result was not. I went to the movies to see this, expecting this movie to be filled with side-splitting hilarity, but I was thoroughly disappointed. The MPAA unfortunately showed the funniest moments on the previews. Will Ferrell wasn't even very cute playing a elf who is new to the real world. He just looked like a mentally disturbed man walking on the streets in an elf costume. Ed Asner was also not the most impressive Santa I had ever seen. This is of course a must for Will Ferrell fans, but does not belong on the shelf with other Christmas classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buddy Just Doesn't Cut It","review":"First off, I have to say that without Will Ferrell, the movie would be in the negatives in my book. What happened? Elf is just a bunch of corny quotes (\\"Buddy the Elf, what's your favorite color?\\"..) with a poorly excecuted crappy Disney classic-style ending, with a cheap moral and a lot of affection between characters. It's a childrens movie that wants to be a comedy, and it just isn't happening. Will Ferrell was the only one attempting to make it what it's not, and it's probably just up to you whether or not that's a good or a bad thing. If asked whether to watch Rice Krispies pop or Elf, I would choose the Rice Krispies. xD"},{"rating":"1","title":"Amusing at times.","review":"While Elf has some cute and amusing moments, it plays like most other vehicles of Saturday Night Live players - a skit that goes on too long. Will Ferrell is best when he's alone off doing his weird, absurd schtick; however, the film turns to sweet, sweet syrup (the kind Buddy The Elf likes to put on his spaghetti) whenever he mingles with the other flatly drawn characters. 'Tis the season, yes, but when you don't feel anything for anyone in the film, it's hard to have even an iota of the Christmas Spirit needed to get Santa's sleigh off the ground. This one's for kids and Will Ferrell groupies only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Infinifilm version CRAP","review":"I cannot stand the Infinifilm version of this film. I can't locate the special features such as the commentary or the deleted scenes. It's a HUGE MAZE to get anywhere and I still haven't figured out this Infinifilm stuff.

One of the only Will Ferrell movies I actually enjoy.Zoey is gorgeous and fun, and even the animated sequences are delightful.Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good christmas movie","review":"Great christmas movie, enjoyed watching the little bit I got to see. Not sure why I was charged for it since I have prime."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buddy the elf. What's your favorite color?","review":"This movie was actully much better than I expected...But the funniest line, I can't remember the exact line, but a children book writer was talking about a family of asparagus who went to the doctor, complaining that their pee smelled funny...I know in writing, it dosen't sound too terribly funny, but it had me chocking on root beer in the theater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good nor bad.Mediocre comedy could have been better","review":"Will Ferrel is wasted as the elf Buddy and he is not funny at all and James Caan as a businessman Buddy believes that is his real father is just as wasted,he looks so bored that he wishes he could have starred in a sequel to Misery.The storyline is simple and predictable with few laughs this mediocre comedy has potential but dosen't use it and the two leads(Ferrel,Caan) are mis-casted badly it looks like an embarrassment on both resumes.The only reason this gets two stars is because a midget beats Ferrel up.PS: Jon Favreau should not direct movies no more and stick to his TV show Dinner for Five."},{"rating":"2","title":"A human in elf's clothing","review":"I am normally not a fan of holiday-themed movies that are released each Christmas season. They are just not to my liking. But after reading and hearing about all the praise that ELF has been receiving from critics and the general public, I decided that I should see what everyone's talking about. I am now glad that I saw this movie as it made me laugh-out-loud several times! Will Ferrell does a wonderful job in playing Buddy the elf who was raised at the North Pole. After he realizes that he was adopted Buddy sets out to meet his biological father in New York City. One problem, Buddy's father is 100% invested in his job and is one the naughty list according to Santa. What follows is a fun adventure watching Buddy survive in the big city.ELF is guaranteed to make you laugh out loud, even if you're a fan of Christmas movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Great movie and a great addition to our Christmas movie line up.

There are so many moments in the movie that just make you bust out laughing uncontrollably! From the giant baby in an elf world, to the soda drinking........\\"Did you hear that?\\" to the spaghetti breakfast!It also holds true to Christmas and the true meaning of what it's all about, with a touching moment at the end that gets you everytime.A classic Christmas movie to put in the library to watch each December!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Christmas Comedy","review":"Will Ferrell plays \\"Buddy\\", a human adopted as a baby by Santa's elves and raised at the North Pole. As an adult, he ventures to New York City to find his father. It isn't easy for Buddy to suddenly adapt to the very cynical, harsh world of the big city, but watching him plunge into this environment with his naiveté and unflappable sunny disposition is enjoyable and hilarious. This is a sugary sweet \\"feel good\\" movie that actually works because it's written so well, and the acting is great. Will Ferrell is hysterical and truly perfect as this human running around as a giant Elf, and I also really enjoyed Bob Newhart as well. One of the funnier comedies I have seen, and it's family friendly to boot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this MOVIE!!!","review":"I watch this movie every Christmas and it is still hilarious!!

Plus, I seriously despise xmas and all its various accessories, just die. So, with all that going against it, i still seriously adore this silly gem of a movie.

It has better video and sound quality because its a blu-ray. The picture is more defined and enjoyable I find on blu-ray movies compared to DVD. It has the same humor that ELF has always had. Its a classic Christmas movie for the family and kids every year. One of Will Ferrel's best movies by far. It has a few extra features as well which is a nice perc. I paid $9.50 for this and the retail stores like Bestbuy were charging way more. Overall, a great buy and nice stocking stuffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie! Great HD picture! Volume very low.....","review":"Love this movie and loved the price for a BluRay disk. Picture is great and definitely BluRay quality but the sound is very low/muted. We typically watch our LCD tv at a volume of about 25-30....with this movie we have to turn it up to around 80 for it to be the average volume we would watch any other BluRay disk. Not a huge deal but I was disappointed with the sound quality. It also scares the hell out of everyone when you forget to turn the volume down when switching back to tv programs!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elftastic","review":"This film had my stomach in so much pain and me wetting myself it was so funny.

He is good at acting stupid. It is a fun light hearted movie for the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny holiday movie","review":"Elf is a very well done holiday comedy. I thought the story of a human being raised by elves and then returning to his rightful father was clever and there are many very funny scenes. I know a lot of people like or dislike this movie depending on whether they like or dislike Will Ferrell. I had no opinion going in as this was the first of his movies I had seen and I don't watch Saturday Night Live. I thought he was very funny and was just about perfectly cast in this role. Some people say his character was too stupid. Well, he wasn't a bright light, but I think his actions were driven more by naivete than stupidity and that's how the movie leads you to the Christmas spirit that's at its core."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Christmas Hit!","review":"Elf is a Christmas movie that's actually good. It's cute, goofy and harmless fun. Will Ferrell (Old School) is in top form as a big dork named Buddy who grew up in the North Pole and he..thinks he's an elf. He is shocked and horrified to find out that he's actually not an elf. He then decides to leave the Northpole and find his real father (James Caan) and hold hands and eat sugar-plums with him lol. Caan isn't exactly a nice guy though and doesn't want to believe that Buddy is his son but who could blame him there. Elf delivers laughs as Buddy for example gets hit by taxi's, attacked by racoons and beat up by a midget that he keeps calling an elf. With lame Christmas movies like Christmas with the Kranks and Surviving Christmas in theaters now you are better off staying in and watching Elf."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hit for Mom and Son Alike!","review":"This movie was absolutely wonderful! I took my 10 year old son and I laughed the whole way thru the movie - and I mean laugh - hold your side and really laugh - laugh! It was the best afternoon I have spent at the movies in a long time. It is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Farrels hit","review":"Thsi movie is just excellent for kids of all ages. It's very funny and entertaining.

She picked Elf. I've seen it before and enjoy Will Ferrel's character, but it was much more fun seeing my daughter react to it!Not sure if it was the movie or my wireless dvd player, but about 3/4 of the way through, it stopped. I was able to get it going again, but not until I backed completely out of the movie and then resumed playing it. Guessing it was my machine though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid favorite","review":"My kids have been watching this movie since it came out, and now even at 14 & 16yrs old, it's still a movie we enjoy watching as a family and having a laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Cute","review":"It was cute and heart warming!We love to watch it as a family and my chilren are grown now.

I saw it in theaters and thought it was good... then I saw it again last night and it was funnier than I remembered.

We thought maybe our 6 and 7 year old would like it though, since all their friends do. Well, they didn't like it either. Could just be our sense of humors are different, but it's not our type of funny. We love the Santa Clause movies and other Christmas movies.

But if you want to laugh and enjoy a movie that boosts your Christmas spirit, don't be a 'cotton headed ninny muggins'...check out Elf!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and Silly","review":"This movie is silly and sweet and yes, juvenile at times. These are perfect roles for Will Ferrell and Bob Newhart! Zooey Deschanel is charming with an amazing singing voice. There are also a number of entertaining references to classic holiday films. For me, it has an 80's storyline feel, but it works for this family, holiday movie. It's become a must-see for us during the holidays."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny for the whole family","review":"If you enjoy Christmas movies that are a bit off the beaten track then this is the movie for you. It is very hurmous and unusal but can be enjoyed by they whole family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Comedy...Not Worth Buying","review":"When I saw trailers and clips for the film Elf, I thought it would be a huge comedy production with tons of non-stop jokes and comedic situations. Sadly, this wasn't a reality. Elf's storyline begins with an \\"orphan\\", slipping into Santa's sack during Christmas Eve and ends up being raised by elves. He later tries to find his real father and goes to New York City in order to find him. Though the way he reacts from going from the peaceful and magical world of the North Pole to the bustling streets of New York is comedic at least, but his situations can't make you really laugh out loud. Though there are one or two memorable scenes, the storyline is nothing new and several of the jokes are hardly funny. The climax itself is nothing exciting [Santa's sleigh trying to escape from the Central Park Rangers]or memorable. Rent it if you have to, but don't buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the usual ho-ho-ho fare","review":"Well, this is probably one of the most hackneyed genres, and it would have very easy for the producers to follow the formula, make their holiday profits, and move on. Fortunately, they did not, and this is a surprisingly intelligent and funny film. Fans of the many 'Norelco' Santa TV specials [e.g. 'Rudolph'] will be delighted at the thinly veiled nods to Burl Ives and the misfit toys. Good for a matinee with the kids, or a date with a significant other who has not lost their sense of wonder with life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great - but not bad either","review":"Was pleasantly surprised by this movie - was expecting something much worse. There are several parts that are incredibly funny. If you're looking for a light-hearted movie to take your children to during the holidays, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elf","review":"We have always enjoyed this classic Christmas story.

Quick and ready to watch for no more than any other rental."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Elf is simply one of the best holiday movies EVER. I put this one right up there with A Christmas Story, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the very programme to which Elf plays homage.Will Ferrell is brillant as Buddy, the human orphan who found a home and love at the North Pole with Papa Elf, one of Santa's employees. When Buddy decides to return to New York City to find his birth father, hilarity ensues.Elf has wonderfully funny goofy moments, poignant moments, disgustingly funny moments -- like when he eats the already-been-chewed gum from a subway railing -- and a few serious moments.Zooey Deschanel is great as Buddy's love interest, and James Caan and Mary Steenburgen are solid as Buddy's father and stepmother.Elf is an intelligent, endearing comedy suitable for the entire family. Just make sure your little ones know that cotton balls aren't food, and that no matter what Buddy says, syrup is not a food group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Christmas Film-Will Be A Classic!","review":"Someday this movie will be looked back on as a holiday classic. Fun and smart. Will Ferrell at his best. It's colorful, hopeful, and actually shows just how great it can be to believe in something.My 4 year old daughter has watched this film about 15 times since last Christmas. I'm upgrading to blu-ray for this can't miss Christmas classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Francisco - That's Fun To Say!\\"","review":"ELF is a warm humorous family Christmas tale. Will Ferrell is hilarious as Buddy who in his own words is a \\"human raised by elves.\\" That's elves like Santa's employees not the ones that inhabit Tolkien's Middle-earth. Needless to say Buddy has several differences from his adopted family and friends most notably his size which provides quite a few laughs in the first few minutes of the film. The major plot point occurs when Buddy gets to meet his biological father, a stern man played by James Caan, who works as a children's book publisher in New York City. There are misunderstandings at first between the naive Buddy and his city smart dad but a happy ending is in store for father, son and extended elf family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Always a great movie!

Up there with a Christmas story. Something that needs to be watched every year. I know him! I know him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Will Ferrel Christmas","review":"This is yet another film that you can watch during this time of year. Despite it being far from perfect, it's a hilarious comedy, and I had a great time watching it. It has so many gags that work, and it has Will Ferrel as an elf (well, a human who was raised by elves)! If that doesn't seem funny to you, then I'd be fresh out of ideas. Ferrell gives a surprisingly excellent performance here, and the supporting cast is brilliant. James Caan, Bob Newhart, and Zooey Deschanel really have something here. But I think the greatest thing about this film is that it's one of those that gives you a very warm feeling about the holidays. It's about family, friendship, and most importantly, love. In short, Elf is a funny Christmas film. It may not be as memorable as It's a Wonderful Life or Home Alone, but it's still very entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for All Ages (a 4.4 on a scale of 1 to 5)","review":"Oh what a fun movie for all ages. My mother (70 something) and I (40 something) saw it and laughed throughout the feature. Just the two of us...no kids...The story is adorable.This movie reminded me of two very different films: Miracle on 34th Street and Splash. Its emphasis on the purity of Christmas, on believing in Santa, on the excitement of Christmas in a NY department store recall Miracle on 34th street. Buddy's innocent travails through the New York landscape (e.g., waving to a man who is hailing a cab) are reminiscent of Splash.But the movie also has its own unique charm. Ferrell's performance is a delight. He conveys Buddy's sweetness without any saccharine. Zooey Deschanel as the Gimbel's elf is a revealation. She has a beautiful singing voice and a sly, tart acting style.I recommend this movie for individuals of all ages who enjoy broad, commercial comedies-with a Christmas twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never stopped Laughing","review":"My daughter and I say this movie. Everyone was laughing including us. It was so funny and innocent. It had a great message in all the slap stick comedy that touched your heart and kept us laughing. Can't wait till the dvd comes out to laugh some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, well-written, laugh-out loud comedy with heart!","review":"This movie was extremely well-written, well put together, and just plain fun! Bob Newhart as Papa Elf was perfect for his role. Ed Asner was a great Santa Claus. Will Ferrell was terrific in his role as Buddy the Elf who goes to New York to find his father, played by James Caan. The magic of Christmas comes alive throughout this comedy. It is sad how cynical adults can be sometimes and forget what is truly important. Buddy's persistence pays off in finding his way into his new family's heart. A holiday classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Gym 1700 Club","review":"I really like this for working out in the house.

It stretches your muscles as well. Easy to use, great quality, highly recommended....John Hayes, Kamiah Idaho"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to use","review":"Overall, I really like the design and quality of this machine. However, it is a little difficult to work with the DVD and know what you should be doing. Often if you are following along, your back is to the monitor showing the DVD. I suggest larger pictures that could be posted at the opposite end of the machine from the monitor would be most useful.That being said, this is a great workout home gym and a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great piece of equipment.","review":"I just recieved it via Fed Ex and set it up, but after just one 15 minute work out, boy did i feel it. Every exercise uses your core muscles, plus the muscles used in the exercise. Its very sturdy and I'm not small guy at 6'2\\" and 235 lbs. The only complaint I can think of is that it is not as easy to setup as advertised, it took about 30 minutes to get everything just right while reading the instructions. And the rollers under the board dont glide as well as the more expensive ones, but my guess is that once I have used it a bit it will start to glide better. If not I will lube up the rollers a bit. I cant wait to see how things are going after 3 months. If you are thinking about getting one of these, dont wait the three years that I did to get one. Buy yours today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything and more than expected","review":"I could have bought the basic, 1100 I think, at Academy, but thought maybe it would be too cheap. I decided on the 1700. It came with way more in the way of add-ons and accessories than I anticipated. I use two of the four sets provided.It provides and excellent and fast workout for all the muscle groups. It reminds me of my early days, mid 70's with the Nautilus gear.I am done, sweaty and worked in less than thirty minutes.I can recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"This unit was OK, until it broke and snapped at the weld!!! I was using the unit when it occurred and thankfully I wasn't injured. I was shocked when I heard the LOUD SNAP and I jumped off the unit. It had been working OK, but it was more to tone up your body rather than to build large muscles. Hopefully, Amazon and the seller will make good on the defect and ship me a new one!!! Its been a nightmare contacting the seller and trying to work this out!!!!Pissed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Gym Review","review":"This has been a great resistance training product for me. Setup was relatively easy although the product is not quite as portable as I thought it would be; it does take up quite a bit of space and is heavy to move so you are best off to set it up someplace that you don't have to move it. The exercises are easy to learn and fun to do. The gliding motion is smooth and transition between exercises is quick and easy. It has been very effective for me so far. The one complaint I do have is that the bench apparatus is heavy and difficult to move the incline up and down between exercises; if you have a bad lower back like I do you have to be very careful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, inexpensive home gym","review":"I bought this about a month back. First off, this is a good product at this price point. Its not too bulky and yet seems pretty sturdily built and appears to be built to last a while. I believe this gym is meant to build and maintain good muscle tone and cardio exercising and achieves these goals pretty competently.My goal is to build core fitness, and not definitely not to have rippling muscles(not to say that this machine cant achieve that objective), and i think this machine does that well. Its easy to use, and after a little trial and error, easy to set up too. It has a vast array of exercises that find are more than enough and cover every muscle group very well.And while you can fold it and stow it away, it is not desigend to do that frequently; its pretty heavy and a bit cumbersome to fold away. Best bet is to keep it in one place, and when you really need to make use of that space, you can fold it away. I use it in the basement."},{"rating":"2","title":"total gym 1700 club","review":"My husband and I have been looking for a \\"home gym\\" for almost a year. We have very busy schedules and can not get to a gym. We did not want something \\"cheap\\" and finally settled on the total gym 1700 club. We really like this piece of equipment. The only negative is that the clip for the pulley attatchment is very hard to take on and off. When following a video, it is hard to make the switch with out having to pause the video. Other than that we have enjoyed the total gym, we feel it is great quality for the price and are starting to see the benefits."},{"rating":"2","title":"total gym 1700 club","review":"excellent product, if you follow the routine, you are going to see changes in 3 weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you want to build muscle","review":"The total gym is OK if you are interested in a light aerobic-like muscular work out. However, the resistance is not nearly enough for someone looking to gain serious muscle. Although it can fold to be put away, it is heavy and not easy to move it back and forth for work outs. I've had mine for around a year, but stopped using it after a few weeks simply because I was too strong for it. But for what it's worth, it does work well, hasn't fallen apart, and may fit others' exercise goals. Bottom line is you cannot replace a gym at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"We like it!","review":"The Product is easy to use and easy to set up. Although if you have the room I would suggest leaving it up all the time. You get a variety of work outs with this machine, I'm a stay at home Mom, and I like the light resistance training I get from it, and my Husband likes to use it for his upper body work-out, though he still needs to use free weights to keep with his personal work-out goals. I still continue to run besides using the total gym, becuase I didn't feel that my cardio was being taken care of properly. I only have one complaint with the system, I have medium length hair, and while working out, I need to keep it pulled back and tucked under my shoulders, or it becomes caught and pulled."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Delivery of the Total gym 1700 Club from Fedex","review":"I order the Total Gym 1700 Club and Amazon new feature helped me track my purchase.

This was the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There is no real plot or any point through out the movie. This movie did not hold my interst an I do not recomend for anyone to even think about watching this movie. There was saying that is was a great portrayel of the mines but there was hardly any time spent in the coal mines. The movie was based around trying to capture the Molly McGuires. An there were parts added on to the movie that had absolutly nothing to do with the hardships of working in the mines. That is my review on the Molly Mcguires."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful they're barely even in the mine","review":"I think this movie is a bad Sean Connery movie,its about a bunch of bad miners looking like they are doing the right thing by blowing stuff up.They think they are special because they are imigrants so what we all were at some point in time, they just had bad timing.Plus Sean isnt even the real star of the movie that is a disgrace to movies, he barely even talks during the whole movie thats why it was bad, and the fact they are not in the mine long enough for people to say its a good mining movie.If you got a problem with your boss you dont kill him you ask for a raise, or if that dont work quit dont kil thats retarted.If you dont believe me watch the movie yourself although I dontthink its anygood but who am I to stop you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not such a good movie","review":"This movie was very different from most movies i watch it took place in hard times. Not that I liked this movie at all but, I liked the message it got to me. It showed me what a struggle that many unions had with companys and where we were and where we are. Its really amazing how much they took im supprized that the unions didn't strike more than the acutally did. Sean Connery in my opinion wasn't half as good when he was young compared to now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not by this movie. It was very boring.","review":"What a very borning movie this was, and I don't want to watch it again. It was about the men in the mines and the bosses. Its about how they want different thing from the bosses. If you need the sleep you should watch this very borning movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Migure: a story of coal miners","review":"This movie was an o.k. movie, but not one of Sean Connery's best movies ( if you know what I mean). But overall the movie would be suitable to show kindergardners, it would put them a sleep. The movie itself had a strong plot, but lacked the drama that could have made me be more interested! Im big on American History but this movie made me lose some interest in the past.This movie had alot of historical facts that put some interest in it. In this Sean Connery plays a man that tries to destroy the coal mining business in 1876. Along with other followers, they tried to break out and abolish the work of living and working in a company town. As my final review, I humbly ask you not to go rent this movie. But if you like Sean Connery Knock your self out and rent \\" Molly Maguires\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bad movie","review":"This movie shows how the Irish were treated in the mines. I personaly did not like this movie. It is not a good movie to entertain teenagers. It shows how the secret clubs the Molly McGuires rebeled against the city.

At the end they all got cought."},{"rating":"1","title":"hate ms troutman","review":"The movie was so borning that I all most feel a sleep.It was about men in the coal mines.And about having a guy to tell the police what they were going to do.

The only part that made me start watching it with an open mind, was that Sean Connery in it. However, when I watched the first 15 minutes of it and there was no talking at all, I started to wonder if it would be a waste of my time. As for all the other reviewers saying it was a great portrayal of the mines, THEY ON SHOWED SCENES OF THE MINES FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES!!! It comes off like a tragic story for these very humble miners; IF YOU HAVE A PROBLEM WITH YOUR JOB, YOU QUIT OR SHUT UP!!! YOU DON'T GO AROUND KILLING THE PEOPLE YOU DISLIKE!!! If you need the money that bad, then get a new job or just put up with it!!! It was an extremely excuse for a movie, with a horrible plot. The Molly Maguires showed the murderous miners as the good and rightous side and the employers as the evil ones. The only reason I would recomend this movie is if you want to raise your blood presure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Molly Maguires Movie","review":"This is an extrodinary movie about the coal region in Pennsylvania.

You might want to watch it and see for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This movie depicts the life of the Irish coal miners in the 1800s. I believe it is very histriocally correct. The movie in itself is very boring and I did not like it, but your not me and we may not be into the same types of movies. I really like movies that are thillers and this movie is defintly not a thiller. The only thing that held my intrest was the fight scenes. I would not advise this movie to you if you like thillers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Molly Maguires","review":"This movie was an okay movie, if you are over the age of 50. No I was just joking. It showed how the coal mines were ran in the1870's.It showed how the workers would side with only people that were from the same country. It also demenstrated how the miners would destroy the mine so the company would have to pay extra money to fix things. Over all this was an okay movie, but I don't recommend that you see this movie unless you want to go to sleep or you have nothing else in your life to do. I mean Nothing else to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing..","review":"Very disappointing account of the Irish immigration experience -- poorly written, unclear, with bad acting.

It was not a movie that I would recommend to other people. Although Sean Connery did play a wonderful part it still wasn't a very good movie. There were a few parts that was interesting. For instance, the scene where some of the coal miners were crushed to death in the coal mine. I thought it was interesting to see if they were going to live or die. Of course, they died. The movie was set back in 1876. Sean Connery played a vicious man who tried to destroy the coal miners and their business. If you ever had trouble sleeping then this is the movie to watch. It made me fall to sleep, but like I said, there were a few interesting parts. I wouldn't never went out and rented it. Our history teacher made us watch it. I don't recommend you go out and rent it.

Richard Harris plays Irish man by the name of James McKenna/McParlan. Who is hired as a detective to rat out the Molly Maguires. I think the movie was well thought out just did not appeal to me.

Many of the Molly Maguires were murderers and not particularly noble ones at that. The movie uses real names of the people actually involved in this story.

If the point of the book is to discuss how to become a millionaire and it is waaay to complicated for the reader to handle/understand with out consulting with a financial planner then there is no point to this book at all.

I have never heard a doctor say it is \\"totally curable\\" as it can show up many years later with even a different primary, but yet this book states if \\"caught early it can be totally cured.\\" The book is a good basis for someone that is just wanting to learn about melanoma but not do serious research.

This is great music, and I mean that in a historic as well as a qualitative sense. One commenter compared it to the importance of the Rachmaninoff concertos. I'd agree. One reason I put it in the \\"great\\" class. A lot of music, even complex classical music pieces, get stale with time. But a few pieces always excite me. (I have about 2000 CDs, 75% classical.) Even an old chestnut like Vivaldi's Four Seasons can sound fresh and exciting on the umpteenth hearing. Having lived with the Mozetich for perhaps a year now, its beauty remains, and the pieces startle me. Why are symphony orchestras having a hard time filling the halls? Maybe it's their programming. Here is a new piece that is accessible to the ears on first hearing, is lush and romantic and evocative, yet sounds fresh. Orchestras should be programming all these pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Cookbook I have!","review":"I bought this cookbook when it first came out and have always recommended it to friends who like to cook.

Even did a book report on this very book. Shows my lack of true reading comprehension in my formative years (ha ha )! And even though I am a NRA member and diehard 2nd amendment believer, I STILL think this book is a great read. The author uses a lot of obsure facts and interesting stories that make it an interesting book.

This book is written like a textbook and instead of saying \\"you\\", it refers to you as \\"the mother.\\" It is very easy reading, and I recommend this to a first time breastfeeder or a mom like myself who has breastfed before but didn't have all the information I needed.

Secondly, let me mention that I don't really *hate* this keyboard, just that for me the iGo Stowaway fits the bill much better. Even though the iGo is a \\"real\\" keyboard, as opposed to a thumb-keyboard, I can fold it up and carry it with my Axim in the carrying case.The thumb keys on the Belkin do not allow quick typing.

For anyone who wants to understand autism without adding to the burdens of those on the spectrum, it offers nothing that has any connection with reality.

Let me make this clear, this book is not a reliable resource on autism or any serious aspect of it. It is a collection of superstitious claims used to glorify autism and connect it to a fabricated world.

The Survey Service keeps an eye on pre-technological civilizations, with a strict hands-off policy, but a member of one team takes pity on the personable ruler of a Sumer-like culture and gives her something to cure her cancer. Unfortunately, when the next survey team comes back 1,500 years later, they find the queen is still alive and her kingdom is far ahead of where it reasonably ought to be. The Survey Service has political enemies who would like to see it shut down, and this is all the ammo they would need. And at that point, this turns into a lightweight version of a John Grisham chase story, with a bloodyminded bureaucrat committing mass murder to protect her budget. Speaking as a professional semi-bureaucrat myself, the author is way over the top on this one.

It doesn't matter if it's Fantasy, mystery, non-fiction, what have you: poor grammar, misused words, and plain miserable logic (the symmetry and simplicity of a 3-winged bird?) become nothing short of agonizing.

It is right up there with George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"All I can say is I am glad I borrowed this from the library. The fact that this book was released in hardcover is mind-boggling! To expect a reader to pay that kind of $$ for this garbage is really disgusting. If I could have rated this book 0 stars I would have. Cardboard characters, weak storyline, and a ...-poor world-building effort when compared with the likes of Martin, Kay, Erikson and even the vastly overrated Jordan. I cannot understand why all of the \\"professional\\" reviews are so laudatory. I can only surmise that some of them are in the pockets of publishers who need to watch their bottom lines on a big splashy hardcover release like this. You could walk up to the Fantasy section in any library or bookstore, close your eyes, spin 3 times and pick a better book than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of fantasy","review":"I found this book to be disturbing. I agree with one of the other reviewers that depicting women - particularly strong women - as evil is an age old custom that Newcomb merely encorporated into his book. I have nothing against \\"unPC\\" books, but I do have something against books with old fashioned, boring themes like that. Adam = good guy and Eve = bad woman. It really didn't work for me since as a guy I get a kick out of sexy strong women, and the total evilness of the women distracted me from the few good elements of the story. Anyway, I'll not be buying Newcomb's work, or any other books printed by Del Rey after this experience. I also have to agree that the publishers really could have done better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fear of a Bad Novel","review":"Unquestionably the worst fantasy novel I've ever had the misfortune to come across. Ponderous writing, shallow characters, and extended bouts of violence and torture that only reveal the author's love of cruelty render this unreadable. The only fantasy novel I've ever tossed in the trash.If you want \\"realistic\\" fantasy with adequate sex, violence and suffering, read Robin Hobb or George RR Martin instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Really bad writing.

Seriously, it is probably one of the worst books I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"One Newcomb needs to get himslef a woman or something, because one it seemed that he shied away from the loving aspect and focased so much on the rape aspect that it seems he has some issues with the whole thing. Two i hate the male chovinisum that he protrays by making all the men good and women bad. Sexist anyone. LOL bad writing, he should have had some evil wizards and good sorceresses. But now the way he is writing this it makes futur books even worse. I bet that most people who read this will agree when i say that almost all the characters were kinda tossed in there. It was like he never even bothered to get us set up for a good story, he just jumped in a aruined it. ... i thought it was a good book accourding to the reviews. But i wasted my money the day i bought it. Im never going to by another book by him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Simple Minded Plot","review":"I read a few editorial reviews and thought I had made a good choice. Wrong answer. This book was not well thought out and it did not flow well. The main character (Tristan) changed his mind and attitudes back and forth so many times that I could never really get a grasp of his personality. I feel cheated out of $27.00 and cannot understand how the professional editorials supported this book. I shall pay more attention to customer reviews from now on. This book was a dud!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scarcely worth the paper it's printed on","review":"I've read more books in this genre than I care to count. This book was terrible.

Thus, the most powerful in the book are also the most inbred. This book is so awful it's ALMOST a self-parody. If you find the truly awful fascinating, give this book a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly Disappointed","review":"I picked up this book when I saw emblazoned on the cover \\"Epic Fantasy of the Year\\". Now that's saying something. But I have to say I was greatly disappointed in this first book by a seemingly promising author. He has taken the all of the fun and wonder out of epic fantasy, and made it into a dark and dreary realm where I doubt many people will want to linger. I thought the setup, where the sorceresses were exiled, had promise, but it quickly degenerated into a war between the sexes, and a very nasty one at that. The scene where the sorceresses' army invades our hero's homeland is gratuitious, far beyond what I feel had to be there to get the point across. And the connection that was made between the coven's lust for violence and their sexuality was just too much. So much could have been done with this novel, it certainly had potential and other people may find it complusively readable, but it wallows in depravity, and it is not something I'll be reading again anytime soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this get one good review","review":"I bought this book based on the Publishers Weekly review rather then the Amazon review, should have listened. I hope it is not a comment on the low expectations for fantasy writers as well as their editors that this book was even minimally recommended.Wow, this book is shallow and it would appear not edited. On page 65 Tristan suggests that women allowed to learn the craft operate under a Death Enchantment. On the next page he is stunned to learn of the existence of Death Enchantments, come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Robert Newcombe has characters and plot lines that have a lot of potential. Sadly, none of them live up to that potential. All too often a plot line takes a turn that is either predictably cliche' or so wildly improbable that it makes no sense. Characters have some good detail in their development, but all to often those details lead nowhere.What decided me against reading additional books in the series was the ending: talk about deus ex machina. To me, Newcombe left himself plenty of plausible avenues to achieve what he wanted, and (as all too often in the book) went for the cliche'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I cannot stress what a terrible book this is. I felt like I was reading something from a writer's workshop, where the writer was on the right track but was in dire need of a good editor and several more drafts. Newcomb has a handful of interesting *concepts*, but they are poorly thought out and strung together in an excruciatingly immature fashion. Everything is too convenient: Tristan doesn't have the time to take a bath, but he can lounge around and chat while waiting in the hall, and even make a side trip?The characters are stereotypical and weakly drawn: the amorality of the sorceresses is unintentionally comic, the sister's conversion to their ways is not even remotely believable, and the dwarf is but a poor shadow of Martin's Tyrion Lannister.This isn't even worth a mindless read, because it's so poorly written that you'll keep smacking your head with the book. There's so much better fiction to be had out there. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give me a BREAK","review":"OK, I actually read the reveiws for this book before I purchased it...The concept of most people bashing the book for being well graphic while a small few raved about it; just made me have to read it.Any body out there whoms read Goodkind, Martain, etc... has read graphic books before. Take the first scene in J.V. Jones' Book of Words series!The only difference here is that the tables are turned and now the women are the cruel evil doers and a man is the poor helpless one.I've gone on and read the second and third books aswell. I'm sorry to say though that the author 'lighten' up. I have a feeling all those book bashers had there way and the publisher pushed for a cleaner book! The masses had there say again, welcome to economics... I wonder when books will need parental warnings?Ps. to any 'true' fantasy readers out there the books awsome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Opinion and rating of this novel","review":"...I myself have read quite a few fantasy novels and I found that I could not put this one down. I read it in practically one sitting. The Characters are unique and interesting, rather than 2 dimensional constructs. The world is vibrant and I wish to see where it is going from here. I like the Authors use of Magick and his rather unique flair for descriptions in this context.I am not saying this book is perfect or it is a read this or DIE!, type of book, But I am saying it is a good read and worth your time.Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"I too can publish an epic fantasy","review":"The Fifth Sorceress is a very painful read. I kept hoping it would get better, but the plot line and characterization were cliche and juvenile. \\"Uninterested heir suffers personal tragedy, seeks revenge, discovers untapped powers, destroys evil doers--almost.\\" How about a sequel? Women are either evil, sexually deviant witches or supportive, tapestry sewing homemakers. Come on... Reading The Fifth Sorceress was a complete waste of time and money. The only redeeming quality is that it started me thinking. If Robert Newcomb is able to find a publisher, I think I just might give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful. Just painful.","review":"I chose this book in hopes of finding a fix before the next George R.R. Martin is released. Needless to say, I was PAINFULLY disappointed. This book was nothing more than fantasy schlock written by an author who is way too entertained by overly graphic (and unecessary) violence. I would happily skip over the gore if there was a worth-while STORY buried in there. There's not. And I looked for it. Newcomb also has this INFURIATING HABIT of repeating the same literary descriptions over and over again (i.e., \\"the wizard, Wigg, raised his infamous left eyebrow in disgust/curiosity/scorn\\"). Please, let this one pass you by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Del Rey hits a new low","review":"This book is so bad that it's good. I mean, it really is that bad. It's like one of those low budget TV movies starring Eric Roberts or Morgan Fairchild. I'm thinking Dynasty here, only hardcore. Seriously, at times it's like Newcomb's got his genres completely confused. For instance, when Succiu (pronunciation anyone?) is prancing around in her stiletto heels and leathers I'm like, \\"Is this Fantasy as is Swords and Sorcery, or Fantasy as in \\"she ran her tongue down his hairy, heaving chest...?\\"The word count here prevents me from telling you just how bad this thing is. Let me just say this: Del Rey Fantasy, you've sunk to new lows by pushing this filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ewwww","review":"If I have to hear about Wigg's \\"infamous eyebrow\\" one more time, I'll scream!! This book is a complete waste of time. I don't know how it got onto bookshelves, but hopefully he made some money, because he isn't gettting another dime of mine. Oh yeah...\\"What he saw would remain burned in his memory forever\\" should probably only be used once per book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinko, stinkere, stinki","review":"I really can't add much to the correctly outraged reviews that have already been posted to this site. This books stinks to high heaven. It might not be so obvious if it had come appropriately into the marketplace, with good blurbs and such, but the hoopla, the hozannahs and the banner proclaiming it \\"THE EPIC FANTASY OF THE YEAR\\" set the bar WAY too high for any but the best of books to attain, and this is FAR from being the best of books.Del Rey should be ashamed for not only overblowing the horn on this book, but for publishing such a sexist piece of poorly written drivel in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and a little misogynistic","review":"I got an email from Del Rey a little while ago absolutely slathering over this book, and so I ordered it right away. What a mistake. The book has its good points--it is written fairly well and the ends tie up. But the story is not particularly original, dispite the hype. and can even be downright boring in places. In addition, and worst, there is an undercurrent of \\"men are good, women are evil\\" that the author may not mean or mean to reveal, but it is there nonetheless.It is a bit insulting to gush as much as the publisher has over this book, comparing it to Terry Goodkind and the like. It's not exciting or original enough for all the hype. It's ok. I suggest the library or waiting for the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst fantasy book I have ever read..!!","review":"What was Del Rey thinking??? \\"Epic Fantasy of the Year\\"...NOT!!! This book has very poor character development...a cliche storyline...and the author just does not let up on the rape and sexual allusions in the book...If people wanted to read about all that junk they would buy a Harlequinn romance or erotic book@@!! The most insulting thing in this book is the utterly weak roles the females characters played in this book...either your pregnant,\\"love-struck\\" and useless-bait, or conniving,nymphomanics....give us a break Newcombe!! Why can't a female character be in the book not just to serve as someone's love interest...but more for being a leader and an important character!! He really needs to learn how to develop characters and make them endearing to the reader...not just to be used as fillers in the novel....Anyways I will never buy another of his books!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly one of the worst books in Fantasy","review":"This book was so bad, on so many different levels, that I feel insulted as a fan of Fantasy that. It shows how little publishers must think of us if they believed that this would sell. My only consolation is that I bought it for 1.99 at a used book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"One fo the Worst - Unimaginative story telling","review":"This is one of the worse books I have read. I had all I could do to finish it. Great fantasy should seem real -- this seems like all contrived by an unskilled writer.The heart of the problem is the main character, Tristan, who is weak, spineless and willful. His refusal to obey the Sr. Wizard Wigg is the plot contrivance used by the author to extend the story. Havina a weak central character is simply poor plotting and design.You can foresee every plot incident along the way -- it screams outloud what will happen next. I honestly don't see how any reputable publisher could publish such trash. The only appealing character in the book is Wigg - the rest are boring, uninteresing stereotypes. The fantasy world constructed by the author is as trivial as his writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"I think several of the other reviews hit it on the head, this is a poorly fleshed out pulp fantasy novel. The characters are transparent, the dialog contrived (someone actually said \\"I swear by all that I am and all I will be I will avenge you!\\"), and the story predictable.The one interesting item that I enjoyed was not the origin of magical power (the blood), but the division of light and dark magic into the Vigors and the Vagaries. However, as with the rest of the book, both styles of magic are barely explained. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure about any of that but the WRITING was BAD","review":"I may be \\"ingnorant\\", too, but the reason I have for panning this book is that the writing is simply sub-standard to put it mildly. It's not like I want every writer to match the prose of the classic writers but at least give me college-level sentence structure and logical progression across the page. To be fair to the author I suppose this book is no better or worse than the other ham-fisted grasps at the junior high school fantasy reading audiences. Recommended for those easily pleased and undistracted by jarring sentence structure or awkward dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, bad, bad","review":"This was TERRIBLE!This was simply an awful book. The storyline was a bit mediocre with Good/Male and Evil/Women with no gray area at all. Clear cut and simple. The writing was atrocious with repetitions and cliches. Cliches of bumper sticker origin. Here is an example, a quote straight out of the book, \\"A bastard quotation from somewhere in his past suddenly came to mind: LEAVE ONLY FOOTPRINTS. TAKE ONLY MEMORIES.\\" I had to laugh at this. He must have been writing this passage while visiting a national park. It goes on and on with a neverending succession of blandness and bumper sticker cliches. Save money and time and pass this one up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy Marooned","review":"I was eagerly awaiting the publication of \\"The Fifth Sorceress\\" last summer. Once I began reading, I developed a sinking feeling that this was not going to live up to my expectations. Mr Newcomb's fantasy kingdoms are exquisitely designed from a magical and architectural standpoint. The principal drawback is his spiteful, venemous depictions of women.Either his women characters are wanton temptresses or insecure royal dolts. His one sided perceptions maroon this novel, teeming with promise in a confusing hodgepodge of sordid sexuality and misogynist rambling. The saving grace of this novel is the well delineated fantasy settings and the unceasing barrage of constant action and activity. Mr Newcomb has talent but needs the sensitivity to portray female characters in a more sensitive light."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish","review":"Newcomb had some good ideas here. Unfortunately, he seems to lack the skill to do anything with them. This is written as if it were intended for 12 year olds. The characters are all caricatures and posture like cartoons. The characters also engage in lengthy and tedious speeches explaining things at the end of every major bit of action and book--because Newcomb cannot figure out how to work facts into narratives and make it a part of the book. There is no skill displayed here at all. It is tedious and silly. The old Fu Manchu character or Doc Savage from the thirties had more layers than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than good","review":"After purchasing this book I read some of the reviews on amazon and to be honest I was worried by it's low rating. So I set it aside and forgot about it until just recent. I read in a matter of 2.5 day, I just couldn't put it down. It's an amazing read for both male and female. Robert Newcomb is up there with Robert Jordan and C.S. Friedman as amazing authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Page Turner...","review":"I too, am puzzled by negative reviews of this story. From the first page I couldn't put it down. The characters were very real and likeable (or unlikeable in the case of the evil ones). Robert Newcomb took the time to help you get to know the characters and the land they live in. I found The Fifth Sorceress to be a wonderful story filled with all the aspects a fan of high fantasy needs. From the friendly and brotherly banter of Frederick and Tristan, to the attack on Eutracia, Robert Newcomb kept me hooked into the story. I can't wait to read more by this talented new author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feel sorry for Newcomb","review":"You have to feel sorry for Robert Newcomb. Like so many others, he thought it would be fun to write a book, and undoubtedly had a great time while composing his story. Then he got an agent (wow!), a publisher (double wow!), and a contract that included heavy-duty promotion. That's when it all started to fall apart. The book has received a very negative response from the fans, and unless sales pick up Del Rey may want to drop him after he fulfills his contract for the proposed trilogy. In the meantime, writing the 2nd and 3rd volumes, that should have been a joyous occasion, must have become a very unhappy experience. In a way it's not even his fault. It was Del Rey's, for over-promoting him, trying to find The Next Big Thing instead of just seeking to publish quality fiction. They should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Terry Goodkind","review":"Inside the dust cover this book is compared to the Sword of Truth series by Terry Goodkind. While The Fifth Sorceress IS a book, thats where the comparison ends. The story line is weak. I never felt captured by the characters or the setting. I'll give the second book a chance to change my mind, but I'll get it from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book.","review":"Even though the weight of this book might suggest long winded accounts and descriptions of insignificant details, I was pleasently surprised. The author did a magnificent job moving the plot along. Once I started, I could not put it down. If you enjoy a fast paced novel that avoids lengthy descriptions of every plant and tree in the forest then I would reccomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"Probably THE worst fantasy I have ever read. That is not an exageration. Even if I recieved this book for free it would not be worth my time read."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 years ago - OK, I got it","review":"This book represents what happens when an editor fails to edit. Make a game out of it - How many times do we mention how long it has been since ______ (anything here will do, the answer is 300 years) If you do read this book, expect a strong beginning, a weak middle, and no end. Once you are finished, ask yourself - what riddle at the bridge? The hero did not solve a riddle, he just jumped out and tried to kill the guard.I would give two stars, but the publishers keep comparing this to Goodkind and as a fan of his work, this book offends me just enough to remove a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't think of a reason to recommend it.","review":"Not a flat out terrible book, but definitely a notch below averages. The author whips out more cliches than Mickey Spillane. He even uses the phrase \\"milky white thighs\\" at one point. The characters are uninteresting, and represent nothing new or exceptional in fantasy. The plot's so-so, but then so are a lot of plots. I dropped it about halfway through because I just didn't care a bit about what happened (of course maybe it got better as it went along). About the most exceptional thing I can say about it is that it had more sex and violence than usual, but, trust me, that's not a reason to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wooden","review":"Wooden writing, irritatingly obtuse protagonist, cliches galore. \\"What he saw took his breath away\\" repeated at least three times, probably more. Whenever the protagonist purportedly felt a real emotion I just shook my head. (The only breath being taken away was in my sighs.) Unbelievable. Newcomb has cobbled together elements from successful fantasy novels, figuring if the formula works for them it'll work for him. He doesn't realize it's all nothing without real people, and he doesn't know how to create a real person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easy to predict what happens","review":"I have no idea why the dustjacket claims this is the next Terry Goodkind! The storyline was simple and shallow. Easy to predict doesn't even begin to describe this book. It is almost as if he is ripping off ideas from other writers (a.k.a. Terry Goodkind). Women dressed in red leather ring a bell? He takes pages to describe what could have been said in a sentence or two or at most a paragraph. If you have nothing better to do than to turn your brain off for a couple of days then read this one. I am hoping that his next one will have a little more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate when you do that. . . .","review":"Nice cover, nice premise, but. . .All the hype in the world doesn't change the fact that the story is shallow, the characters flat and undeveloped, and the moral stance ify to say the least. Other than that it's great. To compare this [stuff] to any other readable fantasy would be unkind to them. I did not finish it and would love to have been able to return it. A while back this would have been the \\"b\\" side to an Ace double.

I bought it on the strength of the glowing reviews excerpted inside the front cover, so came expecting something good. Unfortunately, the writing is bad (he uses words which don't mean quite what he seems to think they mean), the editing is worse, a really lazy editor, and I got sick and tired of Wigg's \\"infamous\\" eyebrow! As well, there are inconsistencies that a bit of care should have picked up, the most glaring in the pages I read is the screaming harpy yanking Tristan's dirk from its eye, and then a page later, after it's dead, Wigg pulling the same dirk from the same eye. Yes, it's that basic! I lost patience, and I'm quite a forgiving reader if the story or characters grab me, but neither did, so it's off to the second hand bookstore with ya, Robert!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"I have read Jordan, Goodkind, Card, Le Guin, Guy Gavriel Kay, and a host of others. And I like the majority of their books, so you can use that to judge my opinion of this book.The Fifth Sorceress is terrible... do not believe the hype and the ratherly overly dramatic reviews on the cover and that abound on most standard book reviews.Bad plot, word usage, use of point-of-view, character developement, and \\"author's magic wand\\". The only saving grace of this book is the way the author creates magic in his world... but even that is a rather simple redoing of \\"pureblood,\\" where magic power is basically determined by the purity of your blood.I can't recomend this book to anyone, instead I would highly suggest reading Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea series.I am still in shock at how people thought this book was any good...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully predictable","review":"I've never felt compelled to write a review for Amazon.com, but with this book I felt I must. I started the book looking forward to what the author might have to say and less than 1/4 through the book I found myself predicting perfectly what would happen on the next page. I tried repeatedly to stop reading the book, but I had convinced myself that there must be more to the author and to the book than predictable plot twists. Unfortunately I was dead wrong. If you're 20+ years old, you've probably seen enough movies or read enough books to predict everything that would happen in this book.

This tops \\"The Eye of Argon\\" for being laughably bad. Do I have to give it one star?It was totally incompetent, unoriginal, unbelievable, and just plain embarrassing. Even for a politically-incorrect reader, the gender stereotypes were annoying and preposterous. Lots of unnecessary violence, grossness, and badly-described meaningless sex. About the best thing I can say for this book is that most of the words were spelled correctly.Fortunately, I didn't *buy* this book. The only reason I have it is that (at one time) it was available for free, as a sample download for the PalmReader. But it's not even worth downloading for free. Save your money, and save your time.

The characters may be a little nebulous, but they round out nicely and the story is newly compelling and fresh, though it has been told and retold in fairy tales since the first millenium.

For me the worst part was the rather graphic and brutal violence and the silly depiction of those nasty, nasty sorceresses.... I almost stopped reading several times, but felt duty-bound to finish it.

I wanted to give it a try myself, so I bought the book. It was in great shape and doesn't even looked used one bit. It shipped out pretty fast and I was so excited when I saw it in my mailbox.

I'm the type of person that needs a picture of the finished product to entice me to make a certain recipe and while I cannot comment on the actual food at this moment, I just wanted to mention to future buyers that there are no photos.If you're a savvier cook I'm sure that will not dissuade you from buying this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT worth it! Very disappointed. :(","review":"I read the rave reviews so I was very excited to start cooking! I just went through BOTH books and am VERY disappointed in the AMOUNT of items needed AND the multiple steps--1 recipe for topping, 1 for filling, 1 for sauce, etc... Also, 50% of these recipes requre some sort of unusual item (imported Bovarian Cheese isn't just laying around in the fridge in my house). I think i will do better assembling my own list from online recipes that don't require me to cook the meat for 4 hours or cook or brown the meat/chicken ahead of time. I have no idea how these taste since I don't plan on using the recipes so that's the only reason I gave this (these) books 2 stars. Unless you have LOTS of time and many out-of-the ordinary food items, I would skip this book and look online at places like [...] for recipes you can simply assemble and freeze without cooking 8 items first."},{"rating":"2","title":"No fish or seafood recipes","review":"I just purchased this book and it does appear to have a lot of good recipes in it. But I just can't give it 5 stars because there is not one recipe in it that includes fish or seafood. I assemble at Dream Dinners and Supper Suppers often and I wanted to start making things at home to save money. I can't believe with how healthy fish is and important in ones diet, that this book does not include any fish recipes. Pretty disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"best cook book ever!!","review":"I tried 90% of the recipes in this book, all of them are easy and delicious, I had all the ingredients in my kitchen, I am a teacher and when I come home I am literally exhausted and the less thing I want to do is cooking, so my husband was eating at macdonalds a lot, I spent two days cooking and freezing and is the best thing I could have done for our health, he loves the chimichangas, I love the kaboobs, and the italian chicken, I made the rolls so now we have fresh bread at home every time we just have to open the freezer, I really recommend this book for the busy people, it will save your life. THANKS A LOT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an inspiring cookbook","review":"As a long-time fan of Dream Dinners, I wanted to find a cookbook to help me create dinners that I could prepare and freeze. What I liked about the book was that each recipe, as made, makes a bunch -- usually 6 to 8 servings -- we're a family of 3, so I would have extra to freeze for later. But it gets better. Each recipe includes a set of columns where the authors have calculated the amount of each ingredient you'll need if you want to double, triple or quadruple the recipe.What I didn't like was the \\"blah-ness\\" of the recipes. When the book arrived, I eagerly read it cover to cover, ready to select all of our yummy make-ahead meals. I only found one that I wanted to try, and my family found it mushy and tasteless.I ended up returning the book and hope to have better luck with the two other \\"Once a Month Cooking\\" books I selected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book, Pity About the Binding","review":"This cookbook is great! The recipes use ingredients you probably have sitting in your pantry right this minute. The font is clear and easy to read. Every recipe I have made has turned out great. I especially love the detailed instructions for going about freezing the meals, then preparing the meal from the freezer.My only complaint is the cheap binding that the book has. The spine cracked the first time I opened it to use a recipe, lying partially flat on my counter. Now, two weeks later, pages are already falling out. I'm planning on taking it to my local copy center to see if they can spiral bind the entire book. Otherwise, I'll 3-hole punch it and use a binder.Perhaps for the next edition they should consider a spiral binding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Can't wait to try the recipes...my daughter is going to be living off campus at college this semester and along with making meals for myself and husband I'll be making some for her.

I don't like to cook, but with a family of 5, it's a non-negotiable. This cookbook is easy to follow, with ingredients that are easy to find and with yummy recipes to boot. I highly recommend it because sometimes life gets to hectic to cook every day. Just pull something out of the freezer and have a relatively healthy, inexpensive meal that you made yourself...just not that day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed and Below Expectations with too much branding","review":"I had moderate hopes for this guide and cookbook. However, the recipes are fairly blah. The freezing instructions make sense, but are largely just gloss and can be found on the internet for free. Also, there are very few recipes in the book. I'm not saying that the book is bad or poorly written: it's simply not good. My final complaint: Don't Panic.. has too much brand name dropping and product placement. We've already paid for the book; quit shoving brands in our faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Freezer Book I've Used","review":"I have tried several different freezer meal books and this is by far the best.

Of course it does help to have some basic cooking knowledge first. I would highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A cookbook I'm using already!","review":"Bought it on recommendation from a friend. The recipes are basic but tasty. The tips on how/what to store in the freezer, and then make it edible again are even more worth the money than the book!

The receipes are easy and kid friendly (a plus in my house)plus they are easy to adapt to your own tastes. I easily made 15 meat based dinners in less than 3 hours. A plus to this book over others is that many of the recipes are simply assembled and then cooked on serving day which I prefer to cooking and then thawing/reheating which can degrade the texture of many foods. I would recommend this cookbook to anyone looking to start freezer cooking or those looking for new and good recipes"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointing","review":"Not quite what I had expected. A lot of these recipes are simply different marinades for meat, which I've done in the past simply by buying pre-made marinades at the store. Don't be fooled by the title, these aren't simply remove from the freezer and bake meals. They are prep meals for the freezer, with additional ingredients and time added to the serving day requirements. No pictures at all, which was a disappointment. I was also a little confused by the amount of fresh pasta recipes (not frozen). Why they were included in a freezer cookbook is beyond me. I was looking for something to prepare meals for others, just to pop in the oven or heat up, and this wasn't it. I'll keep looking..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cookbook is a disappointment","review":"- No nutritional data. Quite a few recipes contain significant amounts of high fat dairy (cream, sour cream, whole milk, cheese). Anyone watching his or her weight or cholesterol would be dismayed by a cookbook that purports to be an every day cookbook.- Very inconsistent style of cooking. While some recipes contain fresh ingredients there are others that rely on highly processed foods such as cream of mushroom soup and bottled salad dressings.- There are at least a couple of recipes that aren't freezer recipes at all, so why are they in this cookbook?- If you've ever used Dream Dinners and you were hoping to learn how to prepare your own freezer meals (and maybe even kick the quality up a notch) this cookbook is a step backwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't work","review":"This book just didn't work for my family at all. Most recipes call for ingredients that are processed. Then, the prep work is way to long. Made the chicken enchiladas, and they were totally bland, and took way to long to make the double batch.Not worth the effort at all! Most of the recipes are extremely heavy in the meat department, so they aren't much of a savings in terms of recipes. All in all, just didn't work well for my family at all. I gave the book to my friend and she raves about it and uses it all the time, and has a freezer full of things like muffins and soups. Something for everyone I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy & Helpful","review":"I am really glad I finally decided to buy this cookbook. I have an 8 month old and was trying to come up with a way to improve our dinners at night during the week. The recipes are easy (although, in retrospect, make sense to do...marinating, etc.) but overall it makes it really nice to have something you can do that is yummy without a lot of effort. We have made, and frozen, several of the items and it is working out great."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more stress! Grab a meal from your freezer!!","review":"I love this book! Great, easy to follow recipes and so perfect for meals on those nights you just don't feel like preparing a meal! Perfect for taking a meal to a sick friend, one who's had a baby, etc. I have to say that my husband isn't picky at all and he disliked a couple of the recipes, so try them out before you take one to a friend to see what you like! I love the way they let me know exactly how to prepare the meal prior to freezing it--that made it even more simple to do! THANKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Large Families","review":"I bought several books similar to this one. I like it because all of the recipes are single recipes, but there's also a scale if you want to do multiples of a recipe. There's a wide range of dishes covered, including Desserts and Breakfasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for dinner when you're tired!","review":"I've spent anywhere from 2-5 hours cooking a week to two weeks worth of meals from this book. Great recipes. Many are kid friendly and easy to put together. I've enjoyed the \\"one day\\" of cooking for two weeks worth of meals. It saves money, saves time and what's great is since you're doing so many meals, you can get the kids involved at least a little bit and teach them while you're cooking. Would definitely recommend! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Selection","review":"First off, if you like sweet/savory dishes, then you'll likely enjoy these recipes. But if you don't, then the selection in this book is extremely limited. In addition, there are no side dishes that are freeze-able. They all say \\"this dish is best served on the day it is prepared\\" and offer no freezer/thawing instructions. There are way too many drink, bread and dessert recipes, leaving little room for variety in the main dish section. The few main dishes from the book that I have assembled are decent; however, they are too complex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freezer full of meals","review":"I used this book to start my meal planning process and took a whole Saturday with a friend cooking from the recipes. We each made enough meals for four weeks and our total grocery cost (including start up costs like bulk saran wrap and aluminum foil and freezer bags) was $360 ($180 each). Given that I usually spend over $800/month on food, that's a pretty good improvement! We have now used a meal from each of the recipes we have tried and they have all been really good. Can't wait to try some more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Not enough entree recipes and no side items to speak of to make it worthwhile. Far too many appetizers, breads and desserts. As a busy mom that's not what I need. And a lot of the recipes call for 1+ hours in the oven once thawed. Not feasible on a weeknight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most used cookbook I have","review":"I've had this book for almost a year now and have tried probably almost 2/3 of the recipes - all favorites.

And they vary from Mexican to American to Italian."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the same as the great book","review":"the movie was ok, in it's own right. however compared to the book-it's not the same! the only thing that's the same about it is that there were 4 kids who were abandoned by their mother and played in an attic and were mean to by their \\"Grandmother.\\" not even some of the names, nor descripiton were the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average to the extreme","review":"Perhaps if this movie was a mini series,it could have worked. I would hold nothing agains the director or script writer, because I think anyone who has read the book will agree with me on my next point:The novel was too much to cram into just a few hours.It caught the minor details that the novel portrayed of four children locked away in an attic for years, but on the other hand skipped major milestones in the story. For this reason, the characters lacked depth that the novel allowed to be seen, the relationships were not as believable and the plot seemed just far fetched. But if you have nothing better to do, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing however intriguing","review":"This film adaptation of the fabulous gothic novel \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" did the book little justice. Had someone just seen the movie without reading the book they would have probably enjoyed it a lot. But for those of us that read the book, the movie was quite tame. While capturing the gothic theme of the book and some great performances on the part of Swanson and Fletcher, the movie seemed to be more interested in maintaining a pg-13 rating than to be true to the book and risk the R. Where is the incestuol relationship between Cathy and Chris? And if the film is narrarated by Cathy, how is she supposed to see her mother being whipped when she is locked in the attic? Wes Craven's script for this movie would have easily been better and the filmaker's made a mistake in using such a weak script for a potentially fabulous movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!~","review":"I thought it was so awsome!

However if you buy the one put out by \\"Top Ten New Media\\" you will be terribly disappointed. DO NOT BUY THIS VERSION!! You would get a better recording by pointing a camera at a snowy TV and recording it. The picture is horrific, grainy and dark. The scene selections that pop up the minute you put in the DVD actually SHOW THE ENDING OF THE MOVIE. How stupid!Please be aware when purchasing this DVD. I have placed a photo of the cover of their version, its not the same as the good quality version put out by Anchor Bay. Make sure you buy Anchor Bay's version and NOT TOP TEN NEW MEDIA'S!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're familiar with her work...","review":"If you're a VC Andrews fan, be aware that this movie will not have the amount of enchantment that the books had. This movie was made from a series of five books and can not possibly capture all the events in just 90 minutes.The events had to be rushed in order to get to the main plot of the children in the attic and what they went through. In my opinion, things went at the right speed to convey the importance of each thing happening. If you've read the series, be prepared to see that this is will not live up to that. Try to have an open mind. For me, the different ending was sort of cool. It was different and added excitement. It was something new and interesting for a book I had alreaady read. I'm glad they did that. I would just have liked to see a more modern portrayal with better quality. All in all, a new adventure for loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough","review":"Good movie, Terrific book! They should have left the mother alive in order to be able to create the sequels. I enjoyed the movie, and would enjoy movies of many of her others novels. But, as many others said, \\"momma\\" had a much different charector. she should have been much prettier and something about the way she talked was... well, strange. also, Kristy Swansen did not portray cathy at all, and her brother was not as handsome as he was in the book. The part where cathy kissed bart in the book added alot, and started the \\"Love\\" Scene between chris and cathy, this should have been left in. Bart did not seem like the handsome man tha swept cathy off her feet in PITW, book two. all in all, it was a good movie I suppose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was a child when I first saw the movie and I enjoyed it. I read the series as an adult, then watched the movie again as an adult (after reading the series)....HUGE DIFFERENCE. This movie is a terrible adaption of the book. I have tried to convince friends of mine to read the book, but they refuse because they saw the movie and hated it so much, they can't imagine the book being any better. So please, take my advice, if you MUST see this movie, do yourself a favor and read the book first.

Where is the scene where Chris and Cathy go to the lake, or the love scene between them?I am sooo sorry I bought and saw this movie, not one bit how I pictured it in my mind. I am currently reading Flowers in the Attic along with the entire series for the third time, and if you haven't read the book at least once, you don't know what you're missing out on. I recommend the book a 100%, but not this movie, which in my opinion has nothing to do with the book!Please read the book if you haven't done so already, and do not see this movie which shouln't even go by the title Flowers in the Attic, by V.C.

I just happened to watch this film on a cable channel late one night. This flick was presented to the big screen, but may have been better suited as a made-for-television film. It doesn't take a very perspicacious person to see the sets and no-name cast of this film are the products of a very frugal budget. However, the acting produced by the precocious children and the better than average musical score add a little quality to a film which presents a rather shallow screen depiction of the novel. It's just another picture that illustrates the deleterious power of mankind's most deadly sin, greed. I won't spoil it for you by telling you how it ends, but I can say this much; I doubt if anyone will have any remorse for the mother after what transpires in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a way to ruin a book","review":"I bought this movie thinking that is was Flowers in the Attic By V.C. andrews, and to an extent it is. The names are the same and the general plot is the same, but the main points that make this first book great are HORRIBLY altered. There are scenes that were in the future book and the killing of the mother at her wedding and not by an act of fire was one of the few \\"out in left field\\" parts of this movie where i practically SCREAMED wanting to pull out my hair and the horrible crime that had been committed!

Spare me, this is not a horror movie...this a joke!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to the book","review":"This movie did no justice to the book. Anyone who read the book and followed the series should be appauled by the change in the ending and the details that were iggnored in the movie. The movie seemed to be rushed and did not go in depth into the relationships between the characters. In the novel, one of the main points of focus was the taboo love which had developed between Chris and Cathy. There should be a re-make of this movie that should tell the story how the novel tells the story. The movie should not share the name \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" with the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Flowers Have Wiltered!","review":"First off, I had to laugh at one of the earlier reviews that said this was based on a true story. Uh, no it's not, although I SUPPOSE it's possible that somewhere in the world, there were four children forced to live in an attic so their mother could inherit millions. Anyway, this movie is poorly edited, badly written, and unimaginatively directed, with only a few flashes of inspired acting. However, having said that, the movie is also very engrossing and involving, and like a bad accident, you can't take your eyes off of it once you start watching. It's clear from the choppy editing and short running time that scenes were removed, such as the incestuous love affair between the two oldest siblings and scenes involving the mother and her fiancee. How unfortunate that the DVD doesn't feature those deleted scenes... perhaps the movie would have been better if they hadn'd been deleted."},{"rating":"2","title":"To all of those questioning the film's score:","review":"This mellow dry movie was a must to my DVD collection.

The best way to get the music is to download it from a music sight.(Kazza) Many of times it will not show up, but if your patient I promise you will find it. One last thing, I also reccomend the extremely talented artist \\"Danny Elfman.\\" His work is extremely similar. He has composed themes for Edward Scissorhands, Sleepy Hollow, and Dolores Claiborne.

True, it didn't follow the plot of the novel as well as I had hoped, but due to the effectiveness of the casting this movie is, nonetheless, captivating. The decision to place Louise Fletcher in the role of the grandmother was the dynamic that pulled the entire film together and made it work. Her on-screen presence lent that special spark to the role and I doubt that anyone else could have played her more successfully. And, in this day's society of movie and television watchers, perhaps this film's brief glimpse into the world of V. C.

After watching the movie, all I could think of was how disappointed I was that they changed most of the key elements of the story and about all that they left out. I think that they should re-make the movie, this time including the sequels. Sure, it would be about eight hours. But that's what it would take to do justice to this remarkable author and book series. And this movie just doesn't do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must be joking.","review":"That was what I said quite loudly the night I went to the movies to see this. The story portrayed on film does not even come close to the story in the book. The author,I am certain would have not approved with what has been done with her work. Unfortunately she was already deceased and had no control over it. I know some of you are saying how could that be, her books are still being published. They use her name for the books, but she has not written a book since the sequel to \\" Heaven\\", which she didn't even complete herslelf. Other than the performance of Louise Flethcer this movie is a waste of film."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the book - Skip it","review":"This movie was so far from the book, it should have had a different title altogether.The best parts of the book were left out: the fact that Chris and Cathy became the true parents of the twins (Movie Carrie continued to believe in her mother until the end while Book Carrie and Cory come to see Cathy as their mother). Chris and Cathy's romance is essential as a theme of the book because it parallels the 'evil breeds evil' theme that the grandmother believes in and what the children come to realize later: what *true* evil is.If the movie was going to be made, the filmmakers should have at least had the courage to do it accurately. People like the book for a reason. The ending was understandable (there had to be closure to the movie; they weren't making a mini-series) but ridiculously executed. It fit with the rest of this ho-hum movie perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, so verrry, very bad.","review":"I should first confess that I am not the greatest fan of the novel from which this film was (allegedly) made.All I can really ask is, \\"What is this about?\\" It sure doesn't seem to have drawn much from V.C.

In my opinion, the book deserves 100 stars and some."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joanne Bogle Flowers in the attic DVD","review":"Had seen this movie ages ago on TV in Zealand.

They don't go on our DVD players over here but work really well on the computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrible Acting But Still Worth It","review":"This is one screwed up fil that is chilling, eerie, and disturbing. It is a guilty pleasure that most people will either hate or love. Kristy Swanson gives a terrible terrible performance as the oldest daughter, and Jeb Stuart Adams is even worse as the brother. The marvelous Louise Fletcher is over the top and chilling as the grandmother and she seems more upset with herslef by taking this role than with the children. But even with all it's acting flaws this is one of the creepiest films ever made. The incestous relationship between the older siblings should have been played out more but it would have been too disturbing to watch on screen. I do recommend this film for the weiedness and creepiness of the plot, certailny not for the acting ablities. Could go down as some of the worst performances ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing!!!","review":"I read the book and loved it. Couldn't wait for the movie to come out. At that time I usually didn't go to the movies. I would wait for it on video. I couldn't wait for this one. Was there on opening night and boy, was I disappointed. It barely touched what the book had. It didn't have the depth and sadness that is brought out in the book. Maybe if I didn't read the book, I could of enjoyed the movie. But I did read it and I was disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This DVD is TRASH!!!","review":"This DVD is trash! The picture is very bad is had tons of grain and it looks like the DVD was taken from an old VHS. The audio is crappy too just like VHS audio. There are no extra featurs just a sceene selection. And the DVD cover is bad as well. It looks like the book cover and the cover insert is too small for the case. Dont buy this DVD buy the other one. \\"Top Ten Media Production Limited\\" is the company who put out this crap DVD... STAY AWAY!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowers in the Attic(the movie-I have not nor will I read the book.)","review":"I saw the movie recently and instantly on Netflixinstant and the movie is such a dragger.It drags on and frankly it is very depressing(Yes that is the intention.)but My main problem with it is how boring the film is and predictable,it runs more like a soap opera or made for tv movie or something on oxygen or lifetime."},{"rating":"1","title":"So sorry I saw this...","review":"I'm okay with Hollywood taking out the incest.

Andrews","review":"I am a huge fan of her work, and this series. This movie is an absolute insult to her work. I know that movies rarely live up to the book, but that would be an understatement in this case. There are few similarities on the whole. There was no room left for the sequels, and it leaves people with more questions than answers. Even the prequel wouldn't make any sense after seeing this movie. Flowers in The Attic is one of my absolute favorite books, and the movie should be remade. This one should be discontinued. I'm very surprised and disappointed to see how many people actually try to defend this movie. Try being the key word. Normally I don't take something so seriously, but like I said it is an insult to a great author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome movie.","review":"This was a very disturbing spine-tingler that will have u astonished and crying at the same time.

The acting is just passable and much as I love her, Louise Fletcher as grandma is a cartoon villain. The whole story seems under-cooked, but the main idea is spooky I guess? Okay if you don't expect too much (but couldn't you say that about most any movie?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Flowers In the Attic","review":"In this story, the ideal mother, Victoria Tennant takes her four children to live with her dying father in a big creepy old mansion. The kids all get confined in the attic while she attempts to get past their horrible grandma and win her way back to the old man's heart and fortune. \\"Flowers in the Attic\\" is sort of a slow and senseless film that lacks motivation, and flawed by embarrassingly flat acting and directing in my opinion. I would recommend you \\"skip it\\"......."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE BOOK!","review":"If you went to the theater and saw this movie without having read the book, it is a pretty good story line, and fairly well cast.... on the other hand, if you read the book first, WOW what a disappointment it was for me to waste my money and my time on the film. I realize that book versions of anything, are usually better, but when you change a great deal of the story time-line, you have just invented something new, and should then re-name it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music is Excellent!","review":"I recently saw this film on a movie channel, and although the film is pretty decent, the music makes it great!

Took a while to get here. May have been due to the christmas volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Work of Nature is a great work of literature","review":"One of the greatest deficits in knowledge that most Americans carry has to do with biodiversity. Yvonne Baskin does a great job of pulling together a wide variety of ecological research results to reduce that deficit. Her writing is strong and clear (although it is an exaggeration to compare it to a Stephen King thriller, as is done on the back cover of the book). The Work of Nature is worth reading cover to cover, and then keeping as a useful reference book. Take the message to heart, and spread it widely: it is vital that we do more to save the natural world from human devastation. We depend the \\"work of nature\\" for our very lives."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fun read, but alas, it's misleading.","review":"Rather than elucidating the sometimes little-understood relationships between species in an ecosystem, this book works to mystify the gaps in our knowledge. Make no mistake, it's a fun read and will appear to be informative, but you'll get the sense by the end of your reading that we know nothing about how ecosystems could've evolved, for example. But I think we know more than that, and we're learning every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems But No Solutions","review":"We used this book for an Ecological Processes class during my Zoology master program. The books best point was that it was well written. The content was well researched but was very disturbing. The author covers many grim aspects of how humans have damaged ecosystems. From an ecological perspective I thought this book presented problems but no solutions. It is easy to find problems as there are many other books written on similar subjects but in order to be great scientific literature the authors should try to provide solutions. Overall the book left me with a negative view of human kind and a poor outlook on the future of our planet. I give it three stars because it was written well even if the content was lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Makeout CD :-) But Still Great","review":"It's not exactly a Barry White makeout CD unless of course your significant other is really, really fond of film scores :-) ... rather, it's just another excellent collection of Italian cinema music from the 1960's anf early 1970's. While they are all from \\"erotic\\" films, the scores cover a lot of territory but one thing is clear - as usual, the tracks not only hold up well from 30-40 years ago, there are no throwaway tracks or just musical noddling - you can sense the heart, soul and professionalism of each track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I would not recommend these hats.

What a letdown. Don't expect to learn anything that will help you gamble. The most interesting part of bookmaking--making and moving lines--is glossed over (author mentions software to retrieve lines from online sources). Instead, the book is full of inane details such as which color pen to write with while taking bets.If you are looking for a condescending read describing how to run an illegal business which will continue to become less and less profitable as online casinos flourish, this is the book for you. If you're looking for a book to teach you about sports betting, I would recommend Stanford Wong's \\"Sharp Sports Betting\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anybody Hiring?","review":"While the author understandably goes to great lengths to emphasize that this is not a \\"how-to\\" book, that is essentially what it is. Reading this book cover-to-cover gives you a very realistic idea of what the professional life of a bookmaker is all about. While the book is more or less deficient in discussing the capital requirements of the trade, it does go into great detail about many of the other issues involved in managing a sportsbook on a daily basis. Whether the author intended it or not; reading this book gives you a strong sense of the importance of finding an apprenticeship as a clerk before jumping in on one's own. Hence the title of this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"No how to.","review":"I bought this book because I wanted to understand how to set Las Vegas quality lines. Hopes of one day moving there and becoming a bookie. This book does not explain how to set the lines for the numerous sporting events it talks about and your not going to become a good bookie without knowing how to set the lines. In lieu of all you gamblers out there: the knowledge needed to set the lines is very hard to ascertain, and, if you want to be successful at gambling you must set a better spread or line than the bookmaker.

Previous reviews mention not putting in too much air, that is especially true in an airplane as the cushion will become more firm with elevation.

You can't expect perfection but like I say it is the best. The only trouble I always have is that my dogs like to sink their teeth in it and ruin it, but that's far from the manufacturers fault. A word in addition is that it took some trial and error to adjust the air level. A full cushion is NOT best. Like their literature suggests, go with a low volume.

I would recommend this compact stove to anyone who was looking for beautiful flowing heat and the looks of a fireplace (with the incredibly real looking fire in the front). One reviewer made a suggestion of replacing the 60 watt bulb (contained in the unit) with a 7 watt night light, which I did, and got the same real effect of a fireplace - and less electricity.

I wouldn't recommend leaving the heater unattended but its fun for parties,etc The heater works very well and they have had it for several years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Our Electralog!","review":"We first saw one of these in Mendocino and fell in love with its convenience and warmth. We came home and ordered one for oursevles. It's easily portable, doesn't get hot to the touch, warms you up wonderfully, and creates a great ambiance. You do need to be close to it, at least in the beginning, but as you warm up, you'll find yourself sliding it farther back. We love it so much, we bought one for our son's home. Now he says he love his Electralog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very neat little heater. Power for the size!","review":"I'm hoping this works a long time but so far so good! I've had it for abotu a month and it's in my dining roon which also includes my kitchen and it's really heating things up for its size. It's very nice having this little fire by the table at night. So nice in fact I put it on all the time even when no heat is required. Love the coal, better than fake logs. It looks more real. The only thing I am sad about is I was incapable of finding a corner one in this size... so I just angled this one and it works... not as good as a real corner one but oh well...Where I have it I don't mind that it doesn't have a remote but I can see how that would become an issue eventually.You wont regret your money. Good quality/price ratio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"This stove is great for centralized heat when you want that \\"cozy\\" feeling and the ambiance of a real fire.Its economical and does heat a small room quickly.I bought it for my mother in law who endures MAINE winters but it could be used in any climate to get that quick warm up,such as a cabin,outside patio,or garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun!!","review":"Bought this heater to add heat instead of ugly space heater works as advertised, very fast heat up in 13x14 basement room. Great if you don't want to start a real fire. Looks fairly realistic if you don't look too closely. Have used it 2 weeks so far no issues"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Ambiance & Kicks Heat Out!!!","review":"I was hesitant to buy this as I always wanted a real, wood stove for my master bedroom. I bought this since it was not too small and not too big for my room. I wanted the \\"flame view\\" on those rainy nights and also something to heat up my bedroom. I first plugged it in and I love the fact you can turn on only the \\"flame\\" without the heat, great for snuggly nights. Also the 2 seperate heat levels. I set it on high and about 15 min later I could feel the heat coming out from the bottom. I was worried at first about the heat close to the floor and carpet, but I felt the carpet after 1 hr. and it was not as hot as I thought it would be. Great all around heater, very pleased, very sturdy, top does not get hot (I placed photo frames on it\\" I wish I would have purchased the larger one now! It's worth the money and looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful with functional warmth","review":"I have been very pleased with my purchase.The heater looks wonderfully real and the heat is perfect for taking out the chill.The high/low feature is great for saving energy.

I needed a heater and this was just perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks good, not much heat.","review":"I like this little electric stove especially for it's portability and compact size. The artificial fire is very pleasing. I have yet to find another one this small.If heating is the primary desired function, it provides only a little. For me worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice space heater","review":"This is a beautiful little space heater. We have used it everyday since we got it and everyone that see's it wants one. It is smaller than I expected but it warms up the living room very fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shortlived, fire hazard","review":"Heater does look nice and have good flames. I had taken another reviewers advice and bought bed risers to the heater up off the floor, they gave a 4\\" clearance. Without them the heating element was barely an inch off the floor and with carpet, less. It did a great job cutting the chill during the MN months until the plug started overheating. It got to the point that even short times being on would melt the plug.Lasted on 4 months. Ridiculous quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dimplex CS1205 Compact Electric Stove","review":"I love this little heater. I use it in my bonus room that is over the garage and not as warm as rest of the house. I also have the ambience of a fireplace while I am doing my scrapbooking. Great price. I ordered it on a Thurs. at 3-3:30 and it was at my door Sat. morning at 10:00. Also it doesn't get hot so when my grandkids are over, don't have to worry about them getting burned. I wouldn't mind having some more of them for every room just for the ambience of a fireplace in every room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeded Expectations","review":"Placed my order on a Monday evening, arrived same week on Wednesday, very impressed with delivery time.

I saw this book and had to buy it! It is hilarious! Ms. Tilsner captures exactly how my friends and I feel about turning 30, and she writes it in the most charming and hilarious way! I laughed out loud reading this book. A must-have book before turning 30!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny but unreal","review":"I understand that it is a book of humor.But first, this book assumes that the mayority of women turning 30 is single. Second, it also assumes that if you have a stablished career and a confortable financial position achieved by hard work before turning 30, something's wrong with you.I agree with some reviewers that the targeted readers are teenagers or those who have not passed yet their teen's years.Please do not take this book seriously.Even though it's funny there are much better funny things to do with your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knock em dead right on!","review":"I loved the author's wit. Even though I am post 30 (not by much), I could relate to most every topic. I highly recommend this book. There are far too many serious books out there covering these issues (aging). When does the next book come out?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh Your Way to 30!","review":"Although I never felt any qualms about turning 30, I know many women who did. This book is a wonderful way to help them make it through this milestone. Laughter, after all, is the best medicine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Targeted at a small demographic group","review":"The Reader from Athens said it very well, and I agree completely with every part of her review. I was barely worried about turning 30 until I read this book. Let that be a word of warning to potential readers - now it's as if all these other people's fears of turning 30 have been implanted in my brain. And the author's reassurances fell flat with me - too many were based on just some chatty conversations with the author's many \\"girlfriends\\". I think there's some helpful information in the book, and it's often interesting to hear about other people's experiences - but I didn't like the author's implication that we're all \\"chicks\\" hoping to get \\"preggers\\" before the dreadful age of 30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but insubstantial","review":"Tilsner's book gave me a few good chuckles, but there's not much substance to it. It left me with the feeling of \\"Is that all?\\" Although I'm definitely a member of Tilsner's generation, and can identify with her humor, I was turned off by Tilsner's constant references to her friends and herself. She even plugs a friend's website in the book--a gesture I found somewhat unsavory. If you're looking for something thoughtful and informative, this book isn't it. But, if you're looking for humor and \\"lite\\" writing, you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Chicks\\" a Glib Look at 30","review":"Though I appreciate what she's trying to accomplish (make women feel better about turning 30), Tilsner's book is a turn-off. The author's \\"wacky\\" tone is SO present as to offend. This book is for a small sliver of women in the US -- the \\"popular crowd.\\" Her advice? Better get a man, an SUV, and a facelift ASAP. Don't bother with this surface fluff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not easy to relate to as a 30 yr old","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book and the fact that none of the reviews I read seemed to mention that the author is highly un-relatable unless you happened to be a binge drinking, drug taking, promiscuous girl in your 20's. She mentions many times the use of recreational drugs and talks about drinking and sleeping with random friends or acquaintances. She is shocked when she finds out that one of her girlfriends has only slept with two men in her life, \\"gasp\\"! This was hardly my experience in my 20's so I wasn't having her same fear of \\"growing up\\". I have been responsible most of my life and was more looking for a book with guidance about \\"where does it go from here\\"? There were a few funny or poignant moments here and there and it was a quick read so I gave it 2 stars rather than 1, but if you are a married woman on a decent career path at 29, you will not find this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur writing","review":"My suggestion to other readers is - do not waste your time or money on this book! When the big 30 began to approach I ordered the book from Amazon. I couldn't wait to tear into it. Unfortunately, I was very, very disappointed. The best part of this book is the cover, and that's no lie. I ordered this book thinking I would get good information and it would be funny. Instead all I learned was that you can string together pages and pages of drivel. With the constant hysteria about turning 30 in this book, it will make you have a mental breakdown. The book feeds into this false culture of fear. Also, the book reads like a college term paper - a bad college term paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"good gift","review":"i buy my nephew a mini helmet just about every year, depending on who will play LSU in any bowl games.

The brakes gave out long ago - luckily they are not essential. One of the wheels came off and my brother-in-law had to drill some holes to put a screw in sideways ( the original holes were stripped). Over all I would still recommend it. It makes a huge difference to my mobility. I don't lose my balance and fall, and I can sit whenever needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Very one sided, kind of hooey-ish. You're better off using common sense. If you eat apples and you have a reaction, don't eat them again. It's that sort of thing. Plus the author is also trying to brain wash you into leading a vegan lifestyle, which I have no problem with. However, the book should then be retitled as such."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book I ever read!","review":"This has to be the most informative, yet easy-reading health book in existence. The author has excellent credentials and is obviously very well educated. Being sick for 23 years, this book has filled in many missing pieces to the great puzzle of my condition -- something 20-odd doctors have been absolutely no help with. If you have ANY chronic health problem or just don't feel as good as you'd like to, READ THIS BOOK! It gives you valuable information on a broad spectrum of interrelated topics and then concludes with a distinct plan of action. It kindled hope for me that I can regain my health and have a life for the first time since age 17."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably Won't Help","review":"The book is okay, and I already live a lifestyle and with a diet like the book suggests, but still I suffer from pretty bad air-borne allergies. I am healthy overall, so I can attest to the benefits of a high vegetable lifestyle, but for that there are plenty of other books. This book is seriously lacking in references. The author often states her opinions as facts. When research is used, it is weak from low quality journals. There is no JAMA or Lancet stuff in this one.I would love to support the author as I am a huge fan of a healthy lifestyle, but this book is not the way. For that I would stick with something like Dr. Weil or Dr. Ornish. They are much more rigorous doctors."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Floetry, It's Floetic","review":"i'm going to make this short and sweet, this cd is everything from things people go threw to things in a nut shell to where you can just sit down in a dim lit room with a drink in your hand alone;listening and thinking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I love this cd and recommend it to anyone.

The CD has just the perfect balance of smooth R&B tracks and banging beats, while at the same time satisfying one's need for a lyrical soothing, something that is lacking in much of today's music. \\"Floetic\\" is simply a feel good CD, it's positive, and speaks about real things that real people can relate to. There is no doubt that Floetry has outdone themselves and put their mark on American music that it sure to turn heads. Don't think twice about it, just buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT!!! HOT!!! HOT!!!","review":"First of all I wanted to rate this a 10 but couldn't. This album is on the top of my best albums list. Floetry is the one cd that has me open more than any of the others. When you can mix Opera, Rap & the vibes of R&B; together you know it's HOT. These girls has opened the door for my love life like no other cd has. Getting Late, Say Yes, Hello, Hey You, Opera, Butterflies (better than M.J. OH Yeah It Is). Hey I can't say nothing but buy it, listen to it, LOVE IT, then come back and give your review. But first tell about 100 friends to buy it. Trust me it's worth buying. IT'S JUST HOT. ALL TRACKS ARE HOT! HOT! HOT! (WHEW..I JUST LOVE IT) EVERY DAY & EVERY NIGHT I LISTEN TO THIS CD.

With a new group-I was worried that maybe they'd only have 1 or 2 good songs but I was more than pleasantly surprised with their style and uniqueness. They are very creative with their music!!! Real music lovers will appreciate this CD. My fav songs are MS. STRESS, SUNSHINE, ITS GETTING LATE, SAY YES, HELLO, and HEY YOU!!! That's alot for one CD by a new group. So support these young ladies and buy the album-you'll be happy with your choice and won't feel cheated."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD I've heard since Jill Scott","review":"This cd is soothing,and romantic.

When I first heard Butterflies, I loved it and did not think that anyone could render as beautiful a version as Michael Jackson but they nailed it.

All you gotta do is say YES and buy this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a listen","review":"My ultimate favourite track is Say Yes. This song first introduced me to Floetry.

I couldn't find it at the CD stores..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack album","review":"I thought this cd was garbage...it's cliche' and the chick who does the rapping is monotonous and boring. She reminds me of those people who are always referring to \\"African kings and queens\\" same 'ol same 'ol at the poetry readings I used to go to around Philly (not everyone, of course). I like British soul (i.e. Omar) and was hoping for better vocals (i.e. Ledisi) and better lyrics (i.e. Meshell or Lauryn), but was bitterly disappointed by this album. Once you have evolved past just blindly and immediately knee-jerk responding to all things \\"Neo-Soul\\" and begin to look for quality, the transparency of stuff like this becomes apparent. I can't taste the juice in this watery, pulpy mess. The only redeming quality to this cd was that it was a gift. Too bad...my wife could've saved her money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Beautiful Music!","review":"WOW!

Marsha and the Floacist are a lethal music combination! They killed it on this one! Loving it. Been playing it alot since I got it.

This album is consistently well-performed, well-written, and just-too-cool.It truly deserves to walk sex-ay away with R&B;, Rap and Pop Vocalist awards. Which makes it sound dull.All I can say is, if history repeats itself, there is probably some kid out there, without quite enough coin in their pocket, hunting this album down right now, just like I did for the queen many, so many years ago.Love you... ladies.

But it is a great Cd after i gave it a chance. There acccents are wonderful and they make me want to be British. \\"Butterfly's\\" is better with there voices, this is the song that they wrote for Micheal Jackson orginally. Besides Micheal Jackson they have written songs for many other artists that have hit the top 20's. The Cd is a funky-upbeat, hip-hop meets London funk. It is refreshing and Floetry defintely has something good on there hands. Songstress's voice is eloqent in \\"Opera\\" and \\"Getting Late\\" is a great song and shows off both of the gilrs talents.This Cd would be a nice additon to anyone's collection because they can fit into many genre's of music, R&B (mostly Rythm), Hip-Hop, or Neo-Jazz Funk...Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's Something Amiss Here....","review":"While \\"Floetic\\" tries very hard to establish and sustain a jazzy/boho vibe, the music and voices just don't mesh. Perhaps I'm spoiled by the brilliant work of true artists like Dana Bryant, Ursula Rucker and D-Knowledge and the recent outpouring of terrific work by Common, The Roots and Meshell NdegeOcello, but compared to them, Floetry sounds hackneyed, trite and uninspired. To quote the hook of one the tracks here; \\"this ain't my idea of fun at all.\\" Maybe next time, but for now this just doesn't do it for me. I do give it one star for a cool cover photo, but nice poses do not a good album make. P.S. Michael Jackson's version of \\"Butterflies\\" is far superior to the demo version included here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breath of Fresh Neo-Soul Divas","review":"Along with the gifts of many neo-soul artist this fan base has been blessed once again with the gift of floetry.Talented rated among artists such as Jill Scott, N'dambi, Sade, these sisters blend hip-hop with soul, funk, and a touch of creative flavor that derives from thier reggae, london flavor.

Extremely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just right for the shower","review":"This is the 2nd largest shower organizer for the manufacturer, the largest being a 4 chamber, and is consistent with that product. All plastic bottles and pumps, not exceedingly durable, but without abuse can last at least 2 years. Each bottle holds roughly 16 ounces, easily an average size drugstore shampoo bottle equivalent. Soap holder is average, a lip would have been nice to prevent slippage but grooves are okay. Mirror is a bonus. Keeping it clean is difficult, so I will recommend that you secure it to an area that does not have direct water contact but is still convenient. Slightly pricey, but better than most available in stores. Overall, a recommended organizer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and Missing Pieces","review":"This product was disappointing.

I loved using this to clean up the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Had used this for 5 years in a different color previously and enjoyed it without any problems.

Good luck if you buy one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't waste your money on this machine. It truly lacks any resemblance to a quality machine. The \\"snipe\\" on this is terrible. I have tried adjusting the infeed and outfeed tables, to no avail. I can actually see the cutter head carriage move up and down when the board is inserted. As soon as one of the drive rollers reaches the end of the wood, the cutter head drops down and chops a 2 inch wide by 1/16 inch deep snipe. I have owned other Delta machines in the past and been quite satisfied with their performance, but this is the last Delta machine I will purchase. My advise to all is spend a little more and buy a better quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"TP stands for Toy Planer","review":"Bought this on Amazon a couple of years ago for really cheap. If you are planing pine and soft woods it works okay and the snipe can somewhat be controled by adjusting the in and out feed. Problem. No power. Maple, oak, cherry, bring this thing to it's knees. Just not enough power and you dull the blades so fast on the hardwoods. about 1/3 of a turn at a time is all you can get. Saving my pennies for a better planer.

It is my first planer so keep that in mind.I have run a 12\\" X 20\\" X 2\\" maple cutting board with excellent results. It seems to have more snip with narrower stock. 1\\"x4\\" ash, red oak, and pine seem to have excess, easily visible snipe for about 3\\" on each end. It is best to run long boards, then cut them to size and discard the ends.I like the carry handle, but this unit is heavy and awkward to carry. Minor assembly needed upon receipt was a breeze.

A local lumber yard near my home charged me $15 to plane one 10 foot piece of oak. I figured with 25 pieces of lumber to plane, I could save money by planing it myself with a faily inexpensive planer. The pieces I've planed so far are at least 8 feet long and range in width for about 4 to 12 inches. I had snipe on the first couple of pieces, but found if I lifted the piece slightly when it was about through the planer the snipe was elimated on most of the pieces thereafter. I got 8 pieces to plane yet, but so far I'm very satisified with the planer's performace. Since I running rather long pieces through, I run about 3 board at a time and give the planer time to cool off.

If you have a lot to spray as I do, you'll need a pack of batteries to go with it. The two AA batteries are not nearly strong enough to keep it going for long. I've already used up four batteries, (two batteries, two times) and the sprayer is just over 1/2 empty, so my guess is it'll take about eight batteries to get through the jug. They should have designed it with a 9V or something. I suppose if you have rechargeable batteries, it may be worth it, but batteries are getting expensive. If you have a very small yard and very little to spray around, this will work for you, but then why would you need this large jug for such a small yard...?Also, since there is no long nozzle, you need to bend over to spray and that gets to your back in a short time. As I said the thought was good for a powered sprayer, but the design has much to be desired.

The relationships take on a life of their own, outside of the story, until the story becomes back burner. I highly suggest you read \\"Justice\\" before encountering this book.

I found the story to be bizarre, the Donatti character ridiculous, and it is quite annoying to be asked to remember plotlines from a book you may (or may not) have read years ago...overall, way too many holes in the story.

I have read all of Ms. Kellerman's previous novels, and believe that her last 3 books have been downhill all the way. She is capable of very good writing, but in this book is overly prone to exclamation points and plot confusion. At one point she refers to hair as \\"tresses\\"--ok, are we reading a romance novel here? Get real.I totally agree with the reviews of Jerry Bull and Carolyn Lawrence, above, especially regarding the plodding and confusing plot and the switches in point of view. When the point of view switched to Terry halfway through the book it made absolutely no sense at all, not to mention that Terry is an extremely annoying character.

However, the last four books have shown a serious decline of Cronwellian purportions.It would seem that the Kellerman's are joined in a competition which pits them in a battle to career death. Or stated in other terms, how long will people continue to buy name brand authors who phone in and otherwise pad their creations with stilted and laughable dialogue, stories in which a child can tell whodunit with the first line of dialogue, and more phony introspection about the demands of police work and/or Yuppie Orthodox lifestyle challenges?The challenges of delivering a new book every year to support the Kellerman's lifestyle, might be better spent perhaps writing about two married best seller writers who have run out of fresh ideas, discipline plotting and respect for the people who read their recycled exercises in vanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best !","review":"Before reading this book, I had read \\"The constant garderner\\" of Le Carré, after having read it, I read \\"Death in the holy orders\\" of P.D.James.

The indoor range that I go to uses a single clamp that holds your targets on the top and in the center. So when you clamp your target and press the switch to reel it out into the spot you want to shoot, the target folds in half and stays that way. I do love the large size of the targets because they are the size of an actual person, but they are too thin to be of any use. I had to fold the top of the target several times, enough times to where the head of the target was gone and only the body was showing. This is the only way to thicken the target enough so it does not fold. If you go to an outdoor range then it may be even worse. If a strong gust of wind hits it, it may rip it off the clamp.

Unfortunately, much of China's recent success is due largely in part to the questionable dealings of the Clinton-Gore administration.

There are issues to be concerned about involving China, but this book does not address those issues directly so much as try to stir up feelings of antagonism towards China in the reader. If you are not easily swayed by jingoistic rhetoric, and instead prefer a high quality of critical thought, skip this one. That is the problem with this book: it relies primarily on appeals to emotion rather than good scholarship.

Much better are \\"The Coming Conflict With China\\" by Bernstein and Munro, \\"China Wakes\\" by Kristof and Wudunn, or anything by Lee Kuan Yew that pertains to the PRC for a more balanced and accurate depiction of China's leadership. At times, the book reads a preemptive strike on Al Gore for a possible 2004 presidential campaign. The gory picture of Chinese run over by tanks as well as oversimplified maps contributed little to the book's subject. As vast and complex a country is China, I was also disappointed a detailed map that showed every province wasn't included.I expected more hard data such as numbers of missles, fighter planes, warships, submarines, etc. versus those of the US military."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cold War paranoia","review":"This book seems to have been written more to embarass the Clinton-Gore administration than to inform the public about the threat China's military poses to the public. It seriously overestimates the PLA's strength. For example, it talks about the 50 Su-27's and the possiblity of 30 Su-30's being ordered. While these are capable aircraft nearly 2/3 of China's airforce will still be composed of Korean and early Vietnam War era fighters. Many of these fighters lack even the most basic radar systems.

Second, it appears that many journalists have capitalized on the \\"China Syndrome\\" because it sells and makes for some interesting world possibilities.

I though I was buying a new Prince of Persia game. It's the same exact game as Warrior Within for PS2, except they added in a few puzzles and areas, THANKS FOR THE TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY!!! Also the camera angles in this game are horrendous and you can't move the camera to a desired angle all the time. Which of course makes avoiding certain traps, figuring out puzzles, fighting etc. extremly difficult. I would not recommend buying this game at all. Not to mention the extremly long loading screen, and the pause to load more of the game in the middle of jumping, avoiding traps etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good at all","review":"I really liked all the other Prince of Persia games(except the weird wanna be one) but this game was bad.

Having had a rough, early demo version of \\"Down Boy\\" for some time now, it was great to hear a polished, finalized version of it on this EP. The sound here seems to be somewhere between Fever to tell and Show Your Bones. Zinner is a throwback to what was great about indy music in the 80's and early 90's. His style is so unique and original I often wonder just how these guys are making it in the mainstream. Seems a band this good usually wouldn't last in today's constantly changing face of what's \\"hip\\". But they're doing it quite nicely and deliver the goods on this 5 song EP.

This gimmick was apparently purely marketing-driven, given that Symphony Hall has a wonderful Moeller instrument. Moreover, I think that in the dub the DGG engineers went a bit off the deep end with the volume control. This is not how the work would sound live played by these forces in a normal concert venue sans dub.

I have been drawing with pencil and charcoal for 7-8 years now and this book has helped me improve my techniqe immensely with shading in particular. I learn something new each time I open it and only find myself getting better even with the basic stuff like drawing and shading a ball on a table top.

The drawings in this book are absolutely amazing but I feel that for a beginner or novice it is terribly difficult to break them down into simple shapes and to figure out how to layer the shading. Even though this may have been a book book of drawing it is severely lacking in important basic information and should have been made even larger to accommodate a more in-depth approach."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book","review":"I'm really impressed with this book.

I felt like I was in a rut and could not progress any further, but with the exercises in this book, my drawing world has re-opened and is definitely building my confidence. I feel like I can draw anything! I am SO HAPPY with this purchase.The first exercise in the book (where you draw what you see in each randomly numbered square and then turn your book upside down to see what you drew) is awesome. It is the perfect way to begin the book because after you complete it, you believe in Lee Hammond's techniques and you are truly confident and ready to \\"draw\\" what you \\"see\\"!You will NOT be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like \\"Witch Way to Murder\\"","review":"This book is good and kept me reading.

Rick the 'traveling chemical salesman' is too curious to be a real saleman, and his appearance in town is quite the coincidence with all the chemical fertilizers being stolen.

If you have ever seen or heard of the movie \\"Deliverance,\\" this is the setting and it could not be more skin-crawling. Ophelia, the heroine, is already suffering the symptoms of PTSD from a prior event. PTSD is a very serious psychological condition and is treated much too casually. The town is peopled with backward, rough, rude and crude menfolk. Got halfway through the book. Skimmed the rest.

The main character Ophelia is more complex than you expect for a lite mystery, which makes these books richer for it.

There are 3 levels of bands, which is very nice. I had a little trouble finagling the bands at first, but it gets easy quickly. I could tell right away that if I stick with this, it will strengthen and tone my muscles. And I think as I move to higher levels of resistance, I will see more improvements. As a pregnant woman, I can do almost every exercise. There a couple that are hard to do and some belly ones that I can't do. The video is short, but that is good for someone who hates to exercise.

He's wise, witty, occasionally cranky, and always believably human. And, he holds the rare reputation of being the last honest man in Rome. In this tale of murder on the shores of Baie, Steven Saylor takes our favorite Finder to the pleasure villas of the Roman rich, showing us yet another fascinating facet of Roman life in the 1st century. The overseer of Marcus Crassus' villa is murdered just as the Spartacan slave revolt is heating up, and two slaves are implicated. Gordianus must find out the truth before all 100 household slaves are put to death in the gladiator's ring. Like all of Saylor's Roma Sub Rosa series, this is gorgeously researched and written. READ THIS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good imagery, interesting characters, and a surprise","review":"The Roman history in this book is meticulously researched and very interesting. The surprise at the climax is nice, too. Overall, it is an enjoyable who-done-it. The story stays with you long after you've finished it. The homosexual content disturbed me, but otherwise the story was quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first rate Roman whodunnit","review":"Saylor's story makes Rome of the first century, BC come alive. In the guise of Gordianus, we are allowed a glimse of Roman life and the dealings of some of the most famous men of ancient history. The depiction of Crassus is very true to the historical sources. The book also gives insight into the Roman concept of slavery, a more all-encompassing and more brutal type of slavery than ever occurred in colonial America. Also, its also a fun whodunnit as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Roman Blood, but still a great read","review":"The only reason why I gave this one 4 stars is because I didn't like it as much as I liked Roman Blood, the first book in the series. But this book is a great read. Saylor keeps you guessing right up until the end. The addition of a sidekick(although he is much more than that) for Gordianus in his adopted son Eco is welcome. This relationship is special and has a sweet turn at the end. I love how Saylor titillates the reader with the stories of Mummius and Olympias and their surprise love interests. The author's exhaustive research is apparent in the intriguing details of classical food, potions, funerals, and other aspects of daily life of different classes of ancient people. The plight of slaves was conveyed with profound sympathy. Having experienced two suspenseful and beautifully written books so far, I will be sure to finish the Roman Sub Rosa series with enthusiam."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Slave to Historical Mysteries","review":"Saylor has a surer footing than he did in his first book, though it's still not a \\"tight\\" novel. Gordianius plays Batman to Eco's Robin but at a leisurely pace.Saylor is at his best in describing the unforgettable horrors of slavery which underlie the plot. True, it's viewed through 20th/21st century eyes, but we're talking a novel and not a treatise.Saylor's gay message tends to intrude in his novels. His male-male relationships are complex, but each novel has one canned male-female scene repeated virtually verbatim from his first book. Bethesda, though, is a wonderful character.I admire the research put into the books. While the books aren't yet full literary strength compared to Ellis Peters, I suspect Saylor puts in months of research for any given novel.Keep them coming, Steven."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it could be","review":"The problem with this novel is that the backdrop is more interesting than the foreground. We want to hear more about the Spartacan rebellion, its effects on slaves and how they felt about it, their temptation (to join in) and their fears of doing so. But the slaves in this novel, who are after all are at the heart of plot, are flat -- they are simply the objects that the patricians pretend, in their elaborate make-believe, they are. The result is a narrowly circumscribed who-done-it in a Roman setting (\\"Colonel Mustard in the Billiards Room with a Knife\\"), a slight entertainment that begs for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Color Are You?","review":"As a writer it is so important to give a physical description of your characters. It helps to give them life and a \\"voice\\" they so need. How do you describe skin color/tone? I do appreciate this book because a number of the describtions just opened the flood gates of endless ways to pin point the color of a person's skin. To me it has been a wonderful help...\\"the whispering golds of late summer grasses\\". Now I have thoughts for other description of skin tones. As for my skin tone... the color of walnut. Thanks you Sheila Hamanaka and Amazon -All the Colors of the Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated, Sappy","review":"I truly hate to go against all the other reviews of this book. I was excited to get it but upon first reading, I felt my insides sinking. First of all, the illustrations are really really outdated and they are, in my opinion, extremely corny. On top of that, I found the prose to be really goofy and unappealing. I felt silly reading them to my three year old daughter, in fact. I'm so sorry to say it but I did not think this book appropriately treated the issue of diversity since it does focus on colors mainly, and the way that it conveys the range of colors is shallow and so overly poetic that it actually is not poetic at all because it turned cliche.I'm going to keep looking for a good book about diversity for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of A Summary of Christian Doctrine","review":"In a word, this book is the most informative on Christian Doctrine that I've ever read.

But I still never knew more about my own religion until after reading this book.I have a habit of annotating pages containing information I want to find quickly in every nonfiction book I read. As a rule, I might make a dozen notes or so on the inside title (or blank) page. In the front of this book I made forty-five--each concept as enlightening as another!The book backs up every explanation of the facets of Doctrine by Biblical references to Chapter and Verse. (For Lutherans, the book also references the Book of Concord).I recommend this work to every Christian. Also to every non-believer who wants to gain insight into the Christian religion.

I did find the author jumping around a bit instead of following a logical progression, such as grouping all of the flirting pre-date techniques in one section, finishing with that section and moving on (not as in this hypothetical example: pre-date, date, pre-date, post-date, date, etc., consecutive sections). Despite the organization, this book does take you very completely through the entire dating process, perhaps more so than any other book on the subject. Because of this, I highly recommmend it--just be prepared for several readings and maybe even some note taking to fully benefit from its wisdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, something other than the author's opinion!","review":"As a doctoral candidate, I enjoyed (up to a point) this book from an academic perspective. Well-rooted in current, valid research, Leil takes the mystery out of falling in love. Unfortunately, as a woman, that's my greatest criticism of the book--where is the spirituality? Where is the tenderness? The magic? Are we simply ruled by our hormones, after all? My second criticism of the book stems from her ideas about gaining the love of a \\"Jerry\\" (a never-married man over 35) which consists of fulfilling his kinky sexual fantasies. Her advice here seems glib and does not take into account the complex personal and social reasons behind a fear of intimacy. Finally, if you're seeking marriage, the techniques do not seem to have \\"worked\\" for the author--she talks about various lovers, all former, but never mentions a spouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good advice backed by solid evidence","review":"Despite the somewhat cheesy title, this book shows what most often appeals to the opposite sex in first impressions, dating, sex, etc. Lowndes doesn't just offer her unsupported opinions; she presents survey and scientific evidence to back up her claims, unlike many other books in this genre. Equally good for men and women, all the key points are summarized in a list for helpful review. Be prepared to reread it and consult the list frequently - it's well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book has what it takes! I bought this book and read it cover to cover, I found what I thought was Mr. Right we fell in love, had a baby girl together, and then he changed!! it eventually ended bad.

If you are serious about finding someone to fall in love with, get this book. But please make sure you choose wisely when finding Mr. Right. I will definately use this book again on someone else more deserving of my love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many book like this in market for money","review":"1. firstly, you can't make anyone fall in love with you.2. It's totally not necessary to please anyone like that.3. learn to love yourself, which is the best way that get idea relationship, otherwise you will attract the wrong person.4. Have you heard in many relationships, sex is good, but the relationship is bad? what the author tell us is \\"how to get someone in bed\\". If you want that, this is good reference.There is big difference between love and sex attraction5. when you attract the one like this, the result is he or she will be smart enough to find that you are lowing yourself to please him/her.( no one is as fool as that). What you get is pity NOT love.There is still some scientific information here, So I give 2 star, maybe can be used as reference for people who understand themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly, but entertaining if not taken seriously","review":"While the book is fun, it is important not to take it seriously and have any expectations.To paraphrase Henry Kissinger said to Chairman Mao, when Chairman Mao asked Kissinger (in front of Nixon) how he was able to be involved with so many beautiful women, \\"Money and Power are the best aphrodisiacs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but I've found better books....","review":"It's not that this book is BAD but it's manipulative as other reviewers have said. I read this along with another book, RECRUITING LOVE: USING THE BUSINESS SKILLS YOU HAVE TO FIND THE LOVE YOU WANT and I think those sisters have a MUCH better idea than this author...there's no POINT in chasing around someone who doesn't want YOU....why bother?

The book even goes as far as saying that if things go the wrong way professionally or financially your love will go away. No one can deny that financial difficulties put extra stress on couples, but to start with the assumption that all couples in financial difficulties will fail is the wrong place to start in my opinion.If you really want a meaninful relationship, do not start with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but turned Sour","review":"I downloaded this book off Kazaa (glad I didn't pay for it). It seemed fairly helpful until about halfway where it seems the Author was hurt by a man and feels the need to bash them and make exaggerations. She talked about how important it is to appeal to the opposite sex's ego but then bashes men. As if women are so perfect. These partisan, biased, and bigoted attitudes are not going to help anyone who really cares about making someone fall in love with them. I would never date anyone with these attitudes. Personally I think male bashing comes from women who feel inferior to men anyway. The only people I would recommend this book to are women with low self-esteem. For the rest I would recommend books that do not need to put down one gender, like \\"Men are from Mars, Women Are From Venus.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A temporary solution","review":"I feel like wasting my money on this book. I don't like the idea of faking emotions and interest. Even if such faking does work, it will be only for a short-term.

Any tid- bits that may be worthwhile have been thoroughly covered in other books and are just a lot of common sense. The book focuses on the use of manipulation and doesn't even explain that effectively. It is written from the point of view of a beautiful princess who seems to have been born with a silver spoon in her mouth and is unable to relate to those of us who do not resemble movie stars or make three million plus a year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for men","review":"This book is total useless for men.

This is not about a healthy relationship between two consenting adults but how to better serve your own self interest by controlling your intended victims reactions and emotions while guarding your own motives. Very predetory in feel. Anyone using these methods will hopefully be spotted, rejected, and resented by the more adult population. In other words, you risk having the methods backfire! I would suggest that anyone who would like to defend themselves against these tactics to read this book out of self preservation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't fall for it!","review":"If you buy this book -- as I did -- then you deserve the lesson that I learned. Some people just aren't going to fall in love with you, just as you aren't going to fall in love with everyone.If you learn that lesson and learn to be comfortable with it, you'll save yourself a lot of heartache. Don't try to make that one special person fall for you.

When I called customer service the first rep told me that when I would attempt to top up and the transaction didn't work (which was about half the time)I had still been billed. He said he'd figure it out and get back to me. After 10 days I called again, got a different rep, went through all the bills for the last year and he told me that the \\"broken transactions\\" the first rep told me about had never happened on my account.

This book is based around a little boy and a saint bernard who is well a man eater.

Go to Jonah's site anddownload them. Stripped down, basic music from the heart. Acoustic and non-distorted electric are the background of choice and if the songs on this cd don't move you, you're probably dead. Far fans that dug songs like \\"Really Here\\" will eat this up without cutlery. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"From the first time that I heard 14 to 41, I was hooked. I was a huge Far fan while they were around, and in their absence I checked out Jonah's solo project, onelinedrawing. From the first time I listened to a legal download of 14 to 41, I knew I had to have the CD. Jonah writes the most beautiful lyrics out there, and his music is open and gorgeously honest. Tides breaks my heart every time I hear it, as does Better Than This. I saw him in concert a week ago, and it was even more amaing live. The songs are of unquestionable beauty, and if you like any kind of music, this is quite simply the perfect CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good EP","review":"After buying both Far albums, I wanted more. Fortunatly, Onelinedrawing has decent EP's out. This EP sounds like a less complex version of Water and Solutions, and has an upbeat feeling to it. Jonah has proved himself as talented a vocalist as Maynard from Tool, and uses his melodic skills much more than in Far. The only reason I'd give this four stars is that it isn't as deep as most of the music I listen to. The first time hearing any of the songs except for Tides, you catch pretty much every element of the song, and I like music that goes deeper. But overall, this is a good EP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again, Jonah Has Moved Me To A Place Far Away","review":"Jonah from Far has got to be one of my favorite individuals ever. As I wrote in a previous review, the best music is music is music that you can fall asleep to, and this is no exception. Except with this, I can fall asleep and have a wonderful sleep with Aeroplanes or 14 to 41 (favorite songs) on repeat. 14 to 41 is a great song, mostly about aging, and Aeroplanes is about expectations you get about life when you're a child, I think. The whole record is always in my changer, every day, because the whole record is just moving. Jonah is an amazing musician. If you're a fan of any music at all, from Elliot Smith to the Deftones, you will love this record for eternities to come. Thanks, Jonah, you've done it again.

The travel advice is good, although lacks depth and any real secrets. Of most concern is the brazen nature and gull of disrespecting hotel employees to purely seek self gain. I suspect that the tactics do work to a degree, however, at some point these people much become the wiser and refuse service if not ban one from their hotels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break","review":"What a smug and obtrusive book.

He states to get the best rate is to call the Manager on Duty, Director of Sales or the General Manager. Good luck in finding them! The manager on duty is too busy dealing with all the people that booked cheap rooms but are demanding the Presidential Suite. If you don't pay for it you are not getting it!

Everything in here is about how to cheat and chisel for your own gain. The author states that he has one of the biggest collections of hotel toiletries at home and that he's sure everyone takes towels and trinkets from hotels. He obviously hangs out with very different people than I do, because my friends and I consider this sort of thing STEALING. I think it's pretty crappy to ask for a disability-accessible room when you don't need one because they have a bit more space. So, then, if a disabled person comes along, s/he can't stay at that hotel. That's just the epitome of selfishness!

The dialogue in between will drive you nuts, but a good remote control will solve that problem. The editing is a little wacked, so as to not keep the movie flowing. For the most part, kids can watch. There is one flashback scene that makes you think a little more skin will be shown, but its over pretty quick. Make sure to FF past the pre-show ads as there is an Eric Estrada movie about some rambo type priest that is a little bloody with some risque scenes.Oh ya, look for me in the beginning of the movie.

This enlightening book clarifies the concern of the Catholic Church for the humiliation and pain of so many women who desperately need to be understood, pardoned and given a chance to repair the hurt they have caused and of which they themselves are often the first victims. The book will inspire post-abortive women to witness to the lie of abortion in order to usher in the new culture of life.

Highly recommended for those on both sides of the abortion debate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collection available elsewhere - free","review":"The Online Library of Freedom, under Fair Use, contains Spooner's works in various formats (PDF's too) for free and available to anyone with access to the internet - then again, if you're reading this, no problem in accessing the Library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone Please Kill the Narrator","review":"This is the fifteen book in the series that I have read, and except for \\"Lady, I Did It\\" I've like and enjoyed McBain's books. But, this was about as dull a story that I have ever read. The people in it, especially the ponderous narration, seemed as if everyone was forced at gunpoint to be in this novel. What I mean is that even the characters didn't want to be there.The story itself just plods along, with so much unnecessary fluff and fill (especially the side story with Kling) that you get the feeling (or I did) that McBain had a book to deliver and he was gonna get it done no matter what. The problem is that there is no life in the book, it lays there like a fish washed up on the shore gasping for breath.Every good series, has it's ups and downs; hopefully this is as down as the series gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 87th Shows its Age","review":"This reprint of the 1972 original features most of the main characters from the 87th Precint. Makes you wonder what age these guys are today if they were mid-30s back then.Some unintentional technological humour from McBain, especially his detailed description of bugging and tracking, but the characters - Kling and Carella in particular - are beginning to take shape. The plot is fairly rudimentary and by employing a simple-to-crack code as one of the keys of the case, much of the suspense is missing from a pretty predictable ending.A quick read, and certainly not a boring one for McBain fanatics - and should be enjoyed for its description of a 1972 lesbian bar as much as anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I think this book was too predictable.I am a member of a cool club.If you are advertising one book's sequel and you haven't read the first one you basically know that the good guys prevail.I am the same kid who wrote the review that the 3rd book didn't have cool stuff.It was pretty neat but I like modern stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"A delicious book!","review":"For readers interested in either France or cuisine of any kind, Haute Cuisine is a worthwhile and enjoyable read. Offering insight into the efforts of French chefs to establish their trade as a profession, the book explains how and why the French style of haute cuisine came to dominate within France and, more inportantly, far beyond its borders. The book studies the trade associations and journals of chefs, primarily in the 19th century. The rivalry between France and Britian in terms of culture and cuisine is discussed. It also describes the culinary expositions of the day. I highly recommend Haute Cuisinefor the casual reader as well as academics in history, anthropology, sociology, or cultural studies."},{"rating":"1","title":"overly worshipful","review":"OK, the topic of the book is french cuisine. But Ms Trubek writes so simplistically worshipful that I think the book is not informative any more. She gives as a fact that until today french cuisine has been on top in every respect - and that's too narrow a view in the year 2000. The book should be displayed in every french cultural center and maybe in all the cooking schools mentioned which propagate french cooking - maybe that was the main motivation to write it anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book was good but in additon with real pc experience","review":"HelloI bought a computer for my dad and several books to get him started.

And this one is no exception. These first five collected books are a great look back at how it all began for a man that became such a voice for hard reality, pain and strength. If you don't want to have to think about any of those things, I wouldn't recommend this book to you, or maybe I would, because it's always good to view both sides of the coin in life.Though fictional, with the exception of his journal entries, all the short prose and poems have an edge to them that makes you wonder if maybe they could be true; as if your reading the story of someone else's life or even your own. Rollins has a masterful grip on how people think, feel and interact and he's not afraid to delve deep into the darkest parts to put them on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING: DON'T READ THIS BOOK IF YOU HATE TO THINK!","review":"Whether you agree or disagree with Rollins is a moot point: what matters is, agree or not, at least his work is thought-provoking, and not the run of the mill worn out \\"boy meets girl, boy loses girl\\" junk you usually find nowadays. This collection of Rollins' first five books is especially enjoyable as you can realize his personal growth reflected through his writing from the earlier work to the later work. In turn, it makes you reflect on your own beliefs about the evils of society which Rollins so vividly describes and vehemently attacks. Bang! is the show-stopper, with masterful imagery and a powerful message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great early compendium.","review":"Though not technically his first five books (you'll have to do some serious research), this is an EXCELLENT compendium of the early works. I always suggest that people begin with \\"The Portable Henry Rollins\\" which is a reader of various \\"middle period\\" works, and then proceed to this which comprises \\"early period\\" works.This stuff is not for the faint of heart. You must be in a frame of mind to experience someone ELSE'S feelings and pain and be able to reflect on them and analyze them for yourself.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Drivel","review":"This book is nearly worthless. This is barely poetry, and attempts to label it as such defile the art form. While the suffering that Rollins was experiencing when he wrote these terrible tomes may be legitimate, his ability to express it is sophmoric at best. It's as if he almost tries too hard to capture something and falls flat on his face. The themes of burning and death are so recurrent, the book becomes redundant less than a quarter way through. There are some instances where the writing takes shape, but this is like salt and pepper against a bitter, repugnant main course.

Case is a bit bulky for a 20' boat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for the Price","review":"I have had the speakers for about a month. I am pleased with them. I was worried about them, as it says in the instruction they are not waterproof...even though they state they are outdoor speakers. We have had a snow storm and a couple heavy rain storms and the speakers play just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for Price a no brainer!!","review":"If you are an audiophile, you should know you won't get your desired \\"premium\\" sound from a pair ofoutdoor speakers to begin with. My 5 stars were based on the cost factor and overall quality of thespeakers themselves...ie look, sound and ease of installment. I would easily have paid 100 bucks for thesespeakers and have been happy. But at half of this I know what a deal is. In fact, after installingthem and listening to them I immediately ordered another pair. One of the best deals I have gotten on Amazon and have been perfectly pleased with item!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Patio Speakers","review":"These speakers are so awesome and cheap, that I bought 2 pair for my patio. Not exactly good for big parties but, just enough for a BBQ or a get together in the backyard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depends on your expectations","review":"I guess my sound expectations are greater than the others who reviewed the product. I was expecting much better sound considering the speecifications. The highs and midrange were passable but there was no bottom bass. I hooked them up to my home sound system to check and to my disappointment - Flat. Esthetically they are resonably designed. The construction is white plastic. If you are planning to mount these it looks a little flimsy. Judging from the MSRP I thought the product would be better. Oh well, I will be returning these and continue looking for something better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can Handle Power","review":"An easy task to hook up and mount. Turned on zone2 (multi-room) on my receiver and, WOW, thought my neighbors were gonna call the cops on me. Mounted the brackets and hooked up the speakers in less than a minute. Although it took about 20 minutes to run the wire to them. Installed them under my over hang vertically so I can direct them left or right. Great sounds and definately drowns out the hot-tub. Ready for the game to be played on them Saturday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good Amazon deal","review":"These sound good for outdoor speakers. I put them in my house to test them. The frequency range of these makes them a little better for outside. A bit heavy in the midrange. They are made of thin plastic, but still sound decent. They sound much better than $30 and I don't have to worry If they get damaged. The mounts are very easy to install. I used one screw each against a flat surface. The speakers angle where you want them to. Overall, I'm very happy with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"just my opinion","review":"Very slowwwwwww read. There were a lot of things in the story that were really far fetched and unbelieveable. It took me a few months to get thru this book and it usually only takes me 1-2 weeks tops! Sorry to sound so harsh, but save your $$$ for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read better","review":"Zane has definitely written better works. I normally complete her books in a couple of days. Well, this one took me over three weeks to finish. I'm so glad I checked it out from the library. It would have been a waste of money to actually purchase. To say the least, I'm disappointed with the storyline that seemed to linger on and on. Plus, the writing lacked that of a great writer. Sorry"},{"rating":"1","title":"One woman is lovely; the other is a monster","review":"I usually like Zane, but her lead character Lydia in this book is too repulsive to care about. Totally self-centered, cruel, thoughtless, with nothing going for her except her great sexual imagination. And yet we're supposed to be rooting for her.The other lead, Malina, is quite cool and also has a lot of good sex. But too much of it is about Lydia. She orders her men around, disses her girlfriends, never thanks anyone for anything.Also get the feeling that, while Zane knows a lot about sex from a woman's point of view, she understands little about male homosexuality or bisexuality, and her descriptions of this culture are way lame.Zane, just because a character is female and hot, that doesn't excuse her hurting everyone around her. Do better next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can we have more comments for this book, Damn!","review":"First of all, comming from a man, you all don't know how much I love this woman and her work.She is truely the truth when it comes to the pen and paper. Without given anything away, this book is a masterpiece from beginning to end. Zane always knows what aspects of her vivid mind she wants to express in her novels. The erotic-storytelling formula she asserts makes you forget about all of your surroundings and keeps you focus on the novel only. In conculsion, If you love all her novels then you will love and she order this one. I really enjoyed this novel with all aspects illustrated and I can't wait for: Addicted film version, Afterburn 2 novel, Zane's sex chronicles season 2 to be released on DVD and so much other material from this historical woman.

She never dissapoints. I read it in 2 days. I couldn't put it down.

If you have not already read this book please do so it is definitely a must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hold on to your......","review":"Zane is back!!! This book was so hot and such a good read. Lydia, Milena, Phil, Glen and Yosef were characters that you couldn't help but love.

I'm an avid reader too","review":"I was very disappointed with this read. The story line wasn't much intriguing. I read Total Eclipse of the Heart prior and that book was much better than this one. I don't reccomend this to anyone who hasn't read a Zane book before. Several things in this book was unbelievable, made me think wtf, and the ending was far too rushed. I wish I would have got another book. Don't waste your times ladies/men .I took me 3 weeks to read this book. I wasn't going to finish it, but I did pay for it.

Zane has found her niche of having dick and pussy stories that now have meaning other than orgasms! Just where are our boundaries in sex and lovemaking and where do women actually loose themselves as the result of focusing on sex? How do women hold onto their dreams and how many of us are diamonds in the rough? How far do women allow men to go?This story is right up with Total Eclipse of the Heart. A message in a plot where the characters are women who raise issues that are real: highly debatable and provocative! I love Milena and Lydia and many of us know women in our lives like Milena & Lydia, we see them everyday - now we know them better! We know ourselves better!Tastefully done with a message and still hot good sex - of course with a shocking twist at the end! It's wonderful when an orgasm matures!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The box is hot!","review":"Just replace the word block for box in Lil Waynes song the block is hot and sing it with me.The box is hot! the box is hot!

She seems to have fallen in the same category, as Omar Tyree, E.L. Harris. They are reading, so many up and coming writers, and presenting their stories. She mentioned that her son, is also writing. Something about the Angle of the Dangle. Hope he brings back the Juice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"If you are looking to read a book about written by obviously a African American woman who is angry with African American men and or the world this is it. It is clear she or someone she knows has been hurt and feel inferior to African American men so much so she had to write this book making them gay week and homeless to the point they needed to be rescued by a African American woman and can't keep their small head in their pants. Then went on to portray two African American where one is clearly a slut and the other was not far behind, showing them as victims; therefore, they have the right to sleep around and cheat on their partner. The African American women ended on a high note where as the African American men ended on a low note. This book was recommended I would not recommend it to any forward thinking woman or man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I loved the book, it was great.

Many of her books i've read within a couple of days with every aspect of the story gripping and tantalizing the mind of its reader. Unfortunately this did not seem to be the case with this one! If i'd done more research and read other reviews i would've found that out before subjecting myself to this rendition of another boring and subjuded storyline as with other writers within this category of books. Hope that her next book will bring back the hot,gripping and detailed storylines and scenarios that i loved her for when i first read one of her books in the beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Universal Journey","review":"Aside from the spectacular photography, this book takes the reader on a true journey through our universe.

A multi-light year journey taken within the covers of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read - a big step in the right direction!","review":"Morin never seems to call the erotic mind into question from a position in which morality is suspended. Morality is needed to create the block that fuels arousal by hampering the attraction between two or more people. Could Morin's erotic mind survive in an amoral context? He does an excellent job of presenting the dynamics of the erotic self and then seems to compassionately acquiesce to its logic. Even his quest for a more healthy eroticism seems to fly in the face of his own logic that would seem to suggest that the erotic mind is incurably and inherently pathological. Morin's erotic self tends to be the Cartesian mind who inhabits but is never the body ego. What the body needs over and against what the person desires never seems to get adequately sorted out let alone addressed. However don't get me wrong. I'd recommend this book without hesitation. It has helped me immensely. It is a big step in the right direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of repetition and superfluous use of \\"stories\\"","review":"I didn't care for this book overall. I found it to say many of the same things over and over, but in different ways, almost as if they were trying to simply fill-up the pages.

It is organized in three sections covering weeds, insects, and diseases. Unlike many other texts on pests that deal only with identification, Watschke et. al. actually go on to cover the more difficult issue of control strategies. The use of more color plates, and better placement of the color photos throughout the book would be nice. I'd rate it five stars were it not that all of the color plates are consolidated a center photo section.

This should be required viewing from anyone who even thinks of becoming a filmaker. This film can also educate, not just blacks, but everyone.People can learn how a group of people can be pushed to desperate measures and use what they've been taught agianst the teachers. \\"The spook who sat by the door\\" is one of the best 70's era black films that I've seen in a long time, but to call this a \\"blaxpoitation\\" film to me would be an insult.

It is perfect for those of us at any stage in the journey through fertility challenges and those parenting after fertility challenges. \\"Hannah's Hope\\" deals thoroughly yet compassionately with even the most difficult \\"whys\\" without ever being preachy. It is equally appropriate for those who have never opened a Bible and for those who have walked in the faith for years. Reading Mrs. Saake's words felt like someone putting my own heart onto paper.

The Burden Bearers sections give wonderfully practical advice as well. At the time I read this book, I was going through a very different struggle, but the faith lessons I learned were still valuable.

I wasn't too surprised, however, what with the horrible stuff Almond's been putting out for the last few years. It's a shame that the people responsible for \\"This Last Night In Sodom\\" & \\"Mother Fist\\" and the other sublime albums would put out such dreck now.The \\"Monoculture\\" video was horrendous, one of the worst EVER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not True","review":"I ordered this product because of the load bar, I guess it was my fault because in the description there is no mention of a load bar, but the images shows one.

It also comes up in the search for the toy when it's actually not a toy. This is a gimmick and it is such a shame that there are companies out there -- more and more these days -- whose means of making money is by trickery. If they want to sell this item, they ought to market it for what it is, a keychain. That should be the first word in the description, not the last, it shouldn't be categorized as \\"toy,\\" and it shouldn't be displayed in the exact same position as the actual toy. These three things are the reason I can justify calling this a complete gimmick -- this was deliberately contrived this way and I hope this company does not prosper under this tactic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"This little volume of poetry is delightful.

Cokal should have restrained herself a bit, instead of indulging herself and sending the protagonist on many ridiculous, not to mention fanciful, journeys. A failed picaresque novel indeed.

I would not recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"These glasses lasted about a week. On removing them the frame broke. They were not treated roughly and appear to be poorly constructed.

The polycarbonate lenses probably do qualify these for being safety glasses but the dark tint makes them bright daylight sunglasses only. They are way too dark for any safe indoor use and nothing in the product desciption warns you of this.BEWARE, If you want 'outside only' safety glasses these are a good choice. If you want something that can be comfortable inside as well as out, these are not for you. Who would ever expect 'smoke' to be at or less than 25%??? They are going back because they are not properly described and are useless (for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"sleek looking","review":"picture is dead on.

The covers were compiled into a simple children's book with one line captions. One of the covers is of two little girls on their front porches holding their dolls out to each other. The caption reads, \\"What's your name?\\" (hence the title.) It's worth buying if you can find it. P.S.

I called LG to see if they could fix it and their answer was: \\"WE DON'T DO REPAIRS ON THIS PRODUCT\\". Yes, the volume in it is very low. Another problem I found about it is that it has way too much wire for my taste. You are better off keeping the earbuds that come with the music essential kit. I now know why this product wasn't popular at all. Now it's being retailed for $79.99 on Verizon. Being that it used to be $129.99 If you want an exceptionally good bluetooth headset, look at the new JABRA JBT8010Z which has an excellent sound and many more options. It can be purchased with a seperate ear bud for the whole stereo experience. I have it and I love it!

Equal parts Roger Miller and Buddy Holly, Parker manages to mine the best parts of country and rock yet sounds current and somewhat timeless. He knows there's a little thing called Melody that's sorely lacking from current songwriting. The songs are deceptively simple but hint at an undercurrent of difficult relationships and hard choices. Looking forward to the LP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Del Fan - Very Dissapointed","review":"Wow, I can't believe that this is a Del album. I'm all about artists changing up their styles or doing something different, but this just didn't work for me. This album is nothing like any of the past Del albums and don't expect it to be as sharp or witty either. I find myself wondering if Del even writes his own lyrics after listening to the degradation of the vocabulary and structure that this album is riddled with. Did his writer leave him to fend for himself? If he does write his own lyrics, then I'm sure we'll see some improvement in the future.

The problems are often incompletely stated, and the solutions skip steps so they are difficult if not impossible to follow.

If you like this one, pick up the \\"Elephunk\\" CD, I don't own it but I hear it's worthwhile. However, I think that this particular song is one of their best.P.S.

Many were detailed to Dr. Weinberg. He knew nothing about the meanngs at all. All I got was his feel-good silly techniques designed to solve porblems like stopping smoking.Fortunately I left his therapy which was when my therapy began.He is a very good writer, none of which has much to do with real psychology. The entertainment value of his books is good. The useful value is a big zero. As entertainment high marks. As a tool for growth, change or self awareness a BIG ZERO.

There is fun and games, a thunderstorm, and possibly ghosts! What more you could you ask for in a story?My three year old just loves the Boo and Baa stories and will actually sit still to lisen to them (quite a miracle, I assure you) so I highly recommend this book for those with energetic toddlers if you are trying to teach them to appreciate a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Who Pyramids of Mars","review":"One of TOM BAKER's best with a solid and intence story that can keep one trying to think of ways to help the Doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doctor at his best, DVD at its most frustrating","review":"There seems to be a problem with lots sent by the manufacturer--no sound for the main story! The menu and the extras are fine, but no soundtrack on the episodes. I ordered two DVDs from Amazon (spring 2007) and had to return both for the same problem. Then I tried to rent the DVD from an online source (summer 2007) and, sure enough, same problem. Hopefully, the manufacturer will fix this problem soon.

It's a classic DW adventure. It's dark but with some humor, nicely written and performed characters, and its atmosphere is nothing less than marvelous. The adventure is one of the hallmarks of the Tom Baker era of the show, boundless enthusiasm apparent on and off the screen, and it shows.This one should be required viewing for all new and fairly new fans of the show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great DVD - No Sound!","review":"I have purchased this DVD twice in the past few years.

I started following him while stationed at the Learmonth Solar Observatory in Learmonth Australia from 1972-1982. To me, this episode really put me to sleep (literally). Sure it had the cheesey plots and cheap set designs but the story was too filled with technical jargaon that I found hard to follow. I really like Tom Baker and salute him for a \\"good try\\" in this one, but I'll simply file this one away with my other Dr. Who DVDs and mayb e look at it again some other time. Some people might like this episode but I believe it could of been better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 5!","review":"This is one of the top 5 Doctor Who adventures I have seen! The mood it sets is fantastic, the acting is spot on, and the story is one of the best and most interesting of the entire series. The plot of this story far outweighs those of almost any mainstream sci-fi. This is a video to show someone to prove why Doctor Who is the best ever science fiction series ever(hence it's part in the 'Gateway Collection'). Even the special effects aren't bad, but we all know that great special effects are no substitute for a good story (something they forgot about in ID4). Anyway, 5 stars and all that..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of TVs finest...","review":"Due to great story, writing, and acting, this still holds up as great TV.Need more be said?Oh yeah, the DVD is wonderful. There is a brilliant documentary about the Hinchcliffe-Holmes era of Doctor Who titled 'Serial Thrillers' that frames and defines the golden era of Doctor Who.

I was wrong. The book masks itself as a novel dealing with the issue of prayer in public places. However, it's really nothing more than a love story. The book is rather easy to read, but is also extremely boring. However, it doesn't start out that way. The first few chapters are quite exciting, beginning when teacher Robert Farr inadvertently says the word \\"Amen\\" at the end of a moment of silence. What starts out as a fight against a hard-hearted principal ends up leading to a battle against the United States government. But, that's just the fringe to a budding romance between Farr and a younger teacher at his school.

Not only does the product not broadcast well (I had to hold it two feet from my radio, it didn't even get a signal in the car on any frequency) but it dosent stay in the dock connector. The transmitter actually will not lock into the bottom of the iPod. The transmitter also appears to turn off after 5 seconds of not touching the buttons. The LCD screen turns off so you cannot see the frequency it is transmitting on. Because it worked so poorly I couldn't tell if it was broadcasting or if it was simply broken.

It makes the white area on my Shih-Tzu look bright white and removes stains well. Best of all, it has never irritated my dogs skin. It has a nice clean scent, not like some cheap dog perfume smell.( Smells like baby shampoo with a baby powder scent.) It does seem to dry faster and it leavers the coat soft without using a conditioner. I like it so much that I plan to start taking it to my groomer and ask her to use it when she bathes my dog.

The pace is sustained throughout, not one minute where your mind could wander. It follows the life of an Italian family and two brothers in particular during a period of political unrest in Italy.I was there during this period and can relate to the story from a very close point of view. The movies is long, but as I stated, not a moment is wasted and it is really a lesson of how a good story can be told and how to keep an audience entranced.I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys good Italian movies. I watched it in the Italian version, but sub-titles in English are provided.

Instead, Tony \\"The Cat\\" Martin is singing, and I do mean singing. Tony's voice is similar to Dio's, but is more melodic. Anyway, in my opinion, this is Sabbath's best album. This starts off with the mysterious sound of \\"The Gates Of Hell\\", and carries into the Sabbath classic \\"Headless Cross\\". Every track here is great, with \\"When Death Calls\\" being the best. Black Sabbath needed to replace the whiny voice of Ozzy, so they got better vocalists in Dio, Gillan, Hughes, and Martin. \\"Look to the people, on throught the mist, to the hill...of the headless crooosssss!!!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid.","review":"This disc is definitely not a five, though its a finely crafted album nonetheless. Any release which brought Sabbath back into popularity has to be acknowledged as a successful effort.While catchy, the tone here is sometimes too simple and uninspired (eg. 'Kill in the spirit world' and 'Black Moon'). The title track, the album's single, is appealing at first but ultimately becomes standard Martin fare. Similarly, the lyrics could be a bit more subtle on a number of tracks.In any event, some of Sabbath's strongest work graces the disc including 'Devil & daughter' and 'When death calls'.

He puts forth some interesting ideas, but it is all conjecture. There is no scientific or historical foundation.

She tells the sexual stories of many women: pregnancy, rape, incest, bisexuality, marriage, relationships, polyamory, passionate monogamy etc. Jalaja writes about different woman's experiences and doesn't try to push her opinions onto the reader. While reading the stories you can explore your own sexuality, and what it means to you personally. Jalaja's insights were incredible, and had a profound impact on my life (at a time when I really needed a deeper understanding of sexual abuse and intimacy). This has become one of my favorite books on women's sexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmm slightly disappointing.","review":"I bought this book thinking that since it was written by the same author as the \\"black science\\" it would be just as good.I was very wrong this entire book falls under the realm of common sense for sale, and I am sorry I even bought it.For those who are new to martial arts this may be gold, but I am afraid they are asking for more than it is worth.Things this book covers is destractions, concealing weapons in a matter conducive to attack (appearing as without a weapon).

She has taken Mr. Graves' \\"White Goddess\\" and Mrs. Paterson's \\"Celtic Lunar Zodiac\\" and turned it into a spiritual system. The problem with this is that she strictly adheres to Mr.Graves' 365 day year, so her seasons will migrate backwards a day every three years or so until they are completely reversed. Her history is also off as well: the Celts practised aspects of Buddhism, Taoism and yoga before the Indians and Chinese did (pp. 17 and 213), and could teleport to Atlantis (page 199)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like OEM, easy install on the Ranger.","review":"Bolted right in on my '94 Ranger 4.0 V6 w/ auto transmission and A/C. 30-40 minute install.

They're a pipe thread (tapered) so keep tightening them until they stop leaking but be really careful, tightening a little bit at a time, because they're a soft metal.I'd go ahead and replace your hoses while you're at it. I opted not to then a few weeks later one split open while my dad was driving it. Lost the $25 worth of fresh coolant that I had just put in there.

The main character Christian Brookwater has so many struggles that one can relate to. You find yourself intertwined in his adventures and unable to put this book down. I read the book non-stop and finished in under a day. Mr. Van Patten delivers just enough action and eroticism to keep the reader wanting more.

It offers the excitement, mystery and sensuality Vampire readers seek; moments of true passion and love that romantics crave for; the witty humor that the sarcastic appreciate; all of this in a majestic flow writing and impressive detailed cultural facts. I was taken by surprise with the amount of emotions evoked while reading this book: from laughter to sadness, passion and anger, all the ingredients that make LIFE real. I did not expected to see so many personal facts mirrored in a book written by some one who did not even know me: many of the stories felt like mine and I emotionally \\"owned\\" the book. After discussing the book with other readers, I found out those feelings were not exclusive to me, we were ALL touched and \\"cursed\\" by this phenomenal author's talent.This is a MUST read book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book doesn't know what it is trying to say","review":"This book as assigned as the text for a Knowledge Management course I am currently taking. There are many problems with this text. The level of detail goes from theoritical (i.e., explaining what is knowledge, differentiating between tacit and explicit knowledge, etc.) to suggesting how to dress when performing a knowledge capture interview! Seriously, does a textbook on knowledge management need to get into the details how how to dress for an interview with an expert?The other problem is that it states that expert systems have failed, but the KM systems that are discussed throughout the book appear to be just that - expert systems. I have read over half the text so far and I still don't get what they are really trying to tell me.Lukily, my professor has assigned other readings and I am getting much more from these other papers.

She had finally outgrown them, so I decided to get some skates with real wheels. I found skates almost exactly like these with the Disney Princesses on them, for $44. I am not a fan of them, so I kept looking, knowing I could always go to them as a last resort. When I saw these non-princessed skates I fell in love! When I saw the price I thought I was in heaven. When I took them out of the box I was estatic! They are beautiful, have a nice weight to them, and are easily adjustable. Lots of room to grow. PERFECT for a girl growing at the speed of light. She wears them around the house practically every day and was already skating better the first day she put them on. I HIGHLY recommmend these to everyone looking for skates for a pre-schooler. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent gift.","review":"The measure of a gift is how it is appreciated and used. My granddaughter is using these skates everyday.

They are heavily padded on the inside so she can slip them on without socks for use in the driveway with no discomfort. She has taken them to the skating rink and they also performed well there. They are chunkier than the rental quad skates from the rink (you know, the ones you used to rent as a child), but she skated for three hours with no problems.

She was so excited to have \\"big girl\\" skates. We put them on and everything seemed great. The adjustment button functioned properly and the straps were great. Then she started to try to skate. She pushed off and went about 4 inches. The wheels barely turn. So i took them off her and tried to adjust the nuts holding the wheels on thinking they were too tight and binding the wheels. They weren't. I took a couple of the wheels off completely, held the center spindle and spun the wheel. It turned 1/2 turn and stopped. I thought maybe they needed to be greased a little so i put a little Tri-Flow on the bearings. It didn't make any difference.

There is very little technical info of any value and the understanding of the art seems to be quite superficial. Most disturbing is the \\"Special Student\\" section in which a pyramid scheme is described that requires a student who actually hope to learn the complete system to pay a fee of $1,000 or $3,000.

This was especially true of the arch villain - what exactly drove him anyway? Those of us who seek more in a novel than thriller/suspense scenes were left with nothing for the soul.

If the main character's name switching between Stephen and Steven will really annoy you, then skip this one. However, I thoroughly enjoyed the book and a few typos and editing errors weren't enough to ruin it for me. I think it's challenging to write a book where the plot involves an event that would change history as we know it.

This handbook clearly identifies the new competencies needed and explains how to develop or acquire them.

The format is the same with the concept definition at the beginning, and then page after page of examples. But what really works is that there are more instructional sentences that glue the examples together and summarize the concept, than in previous books. In addition, the rhyme and story telling flows easily, the illustrations pull together the nuances of the similar yet different words that bring an understanding to the depth that word choice can bring to writing.

Salti's collection of stories allows the reader an insight into some of the struggles and taboo's of Arab society. In many ways this makes an area of the world that may be 'foreign' to some, more tangible.

I have never encountered anything like it. Information is so easily stored and retrieved; it would be impossible to lose track of anything! I use it for lists for the most part; but the capabilities are endless. It even comes with a lot of useful information built in. The program is very customizable.For the one reviewer who wanted to give the program 5 stars but couldn't because of the quote/apostrophe key: whatever the problem was, it's been fixed. I am using Panther and have no problems with that. Everything works as promised.As for the other reviewer who found the program difficult to use, I don't know what to say about that. I suppose any piece of software is better for some than for others; but according to media reviews and my own experience, I would say Sticky Brain is very intuitive and easy to use. In fact, one day I plan to read the manual so that I can use some of the features I haven't explored yet!5 STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than Karajan's digital recording","review":"Karajan made very impressive digital recording of Serenade for Strings and 1812 Overture, but these stereo version made in 1967 surpasses it in many ways. The opening chorus of 1812, sung by Don Kosaken, has wonderful coarseness of Russian orthodox church. That is followed by utterly gripping playing by BPO and Karajan builds up the sense of drama masterfully, leading to the overwhelmingly powerful climax.The performance of Serenade for Strings is simply mind blowing and I've never come across any performance of such intensity, awe-inspiring beauty and elan. In the both performances, you can really feel the sense of freedom and abandon - Karajan let go of any restraint and let the orchestra reach its full potential. BPO sounded so gloriously wild and full of life in 60s, compared to the tame sound it makes under Simon Rattle! The sound quality is surprisingly rich and warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"Nothing worse than adults behaving like 10 year-olds. Opening scene....

I needed to refer to the manual to do many of the setup steps and operations. I did not think doing things such as enrolling employees and checking statuses were very intuitive. The reports were only marginally useful. For example, I couldn't figure out how to see all employees currently clocked in.The worst thing about the device is that I found the fingerprint scan to be very finicky and unreliable. Sometimes it worked ok and other times it took 4, 5, 6 tries to read the fingerprint.I give it 2 stars instead of 1 because the product has a great concept and has a lot of potential.

Also, once the clock has some age, the internal lithium battery gives out, but you have to return it to be replaced. In addition, the keypads, which are rarely used, tend to go bad causing multiple entries for just one press of a number button, which makes entering new employees a real pain. The software is clunky and not well written which makes it very prone to errors.

As a major Yes fan, I wanted to have this in my collection despite having seen and heard it before. Unfortunately I realized I liked it even less than the last time I saw it for the simple fact that most of the time Steve Howe's sound comes in either very weakly or not at all. To watch listen to all 3 songs on Relayer played live *without* being able to hear Steve Howe is just *so* painful. I'll give it a 2 for the good camera work, but overall it sucks, because you can watch Steve Howe and imagine what you're missing.

Even buoyant favorites like \\"Winter Wonderland\\" and \\"Jingle Bells\\" go down easy with uncluttered arrangements. Throughout, Jackson has never sounded better, particularly on the hymns.

I thought for such a good price ($16) I would just replace the plastic perk top from the get go with a glass one. Well, this one is not made so that the perk top can be unscrewed; it has to be broken off of the top. Also, the hole it leaves in the top is too small for the \\"fitz-all\\" replacement perk tops. Guess I'll use it awhile only while watching it, and if the plastic breaks I'll just ream out the hole to be able to get a replacement glass perk top into it. It does look very nice but, like all the new percolator manufacturers, they seem to be concerned only with making a pot of coffee FAST rather than really brewing the coffee. That's why the new ones are 1000 watts. I prefer the old 450 watt percolators that really brew the coffee for 15-20 minutes. Anyway, that's my take on this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good little coffee maker","review":"There are so many variables in the making of coffee that trying to get a cup you like is surprisingly difficult.

But this coffee maker is forgiving as to the type and amount of coffee used, and I'm always reasonably satisfied with the result."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stainless Steel Percolator","review":"I am so glad that reviews are allowed. This is the main reason I'm shopping. I inherited a genuine Farberware 8 cup percolator from my grandmother that she had for many years. I started using it before she died and it came with a plastic see through perc top. I've been using the pot for a year and suddenly the little plastic parts that were holding the top in place broke off. I thought I would be able to find the part but have been unsuccessful. However I've learned to improvise. I've placed a heavy small saucer over it and it's working like a charm. To impress someone with it would be horrible, but it's still working and I thank all of those who gave their reviews. I'll stay with my current percolator until it stops working all together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here's how to get a new plastic top","review":"I love my Java Perk, but I loved it a lot more before it blew its top. Here's how I got a new top. I called 800-947-3744 and gave the nice lady there my mailing address and my credit card number. She charged me $4.86 and shipped a new top to me. (At least I think she did. I just got off the phone with her.)The 800 number is for Toastmaster/Salton, the people who contract to have the Java Brew MEP 10 made in China. Oh, the nice lady wants to know the number engraved on the very bottom of your pot, and when you bought it, how much you paid, and so forth. BUT she can live without that info. If you bought your percolator recently, I suspect your fragile plastic top will be covered by warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"substandard parts","review":"I bought this coffee pot on Dec. 28th 2001. We love the taste of perked coffee and was very pleased until the end of Jan. when the PLASTIC top broke under the lid. I called Melitta and was told they would replace it but that it would take a minimum of 8 weeks due the number of people who were having the same problem. I received my new lid in April and today it broke again. It is definitely a defect in the product. Why can't they make them (the top where you can see it perking) out of glass? You cannot find a glass replacement at any store.Want two pots?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Hot Coffee","review":"Purchased the smaller version of this coffee maker and learned that I REALLY needed the 10 cup pot. The coffee is hot and rich. The coffee stays hot for hours. Easy to use. Easy to clean, stainless interior and parts. The top does fit tight, but I think that is standard with these pots. I'm really happy with this purchase. The percolator coffee tastes so much better than coffee made with a drip maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Reliable","review":"Initially, we loved it! However, less than one after we bought it, it stopped brewing hot coffee. Puzzled, I thought I would check out the reviews of this product while shopping for a new coffee maker.

I guess I should have done more homework before making my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"JAVA PERK","review":"This is a very good product, but I guess with everything else, has it's flaws. The problem I ran into is with the clear top. I've only owned this percolator for two months, and already the clear top broke off. It seems to be the way the base of the clear top is formed and the way it sit's in the lid, that eventually it begins to crumble away over a short period of time to the point where it just falls out of the lid top which is exactly what happened to me. Now how do I go about getting a replacement clear top or do I have to get a replacement lid with a clear top?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like Farberware","review":"We had a Faberware perculator since '89 that was passed down from my wife's grandmother that worked fine (although the base was cracked) until over a year ago when the cord shorted out. After an unsuccessful search for a Farberware, we settled for the Merlitta Java Perk.We immediately noticed that the Merlitta was much lighter in weight than the Faberware. The Meritta Java Perk worked fine for about a year but now it does not perculate at and hardly heats water. This perculator apparently is built to barely live out its warranty so that you go out and buy another. I am completely dissatisfied with this product and I believe that it should be discontinued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for heavy coffee drinkers","review":"This initially was a great coffee pot producing good hot coffee in minutes. I ran into trouble after about four months of using the pot at least twice a day. It simply stopped working. I now have to plug the pot in at least three times to make a descent pot of coffee. Perhaps if you don't drink coffee as much as my family this is the pot for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatal Flaw","review":"I would like to echo the sentiments of the other reviewers. This pot is excellent, except for the plastic top. The lid is extremely tight and requires using the platic handle to remove it. Problem is, it just isn't sturdy enough. Very disappointing.

The pot does a good job perking coffee, but the lid and the glass top are bad and enough to void the use of the pot. I think that Melitta should send out, for nothing the glass top. I am like the other reviews, I would not buy another Melitta product unless they make good on this pot. There is a danger of the top blowing out and Melitta could be in for law suits."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Coffee Until The Bulb Breaks","review":"Allow me to be the 30th person to say that the lid is terrible.

The coffee was great, but not good enough to make up for the crappy lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"We loved this pot when we bought it.

I wish I had read these reviews before I went shopping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last","review":"I have now purchased two of these percolators and both times the pot only produces hot coffee for about one year. One or more of the heating elements must eventually burn out and your coffee goes from wonderfully hot to lukewarm.

Designer of pot should have to stand naked under it with legs spread. Why not a glass top?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Melitta Java Perk 10 cup Percolator","review":"I was initially attracted to the design of this coffee maker and it actually worked for a cou0ple of days, but after a short while, it stopped working properly. Now it manages to make rumbling sounds for a short while, then after serveral minutes, produces tepid water only. I have to poor the water back into the basket and wait several minutes for it to produce warm coffee. The coffee that is eventually produced is not hot until after I've poured 1 - 3 cups of coffee. There must be something wrong with either the extension cord, or the internal heating mechanism. The lid is also very stiff and difficult to remove, even after several weeks. I'm very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Last!","review":"We have gone through 3 of these percolators (using it only 3-4 times per week) in less than 2 years!

Instead of the title saying \\"Selling (and renting)\\" it should say just \\"Renting.\\" He discourages selling consistently, so if you are looking for a book on buying, fixing, and selling, this is NOT it. He also seems to completely ignore the power of the internet in the process of marketing and selling houses, doing research on properties, etc. Additionally, he uses terms frequently that are never defined, especially for discussions on financing. Overall, a real disappointment... Too bad I did not read the reviews before buying the book. I would have made a different choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Focused on becoming a landlord-NOT SELLING","review":"This book doesn't go into \\"adding value\\" as the title suggests. He also goes little into selling property.Here is the whole book:Buy a crappy looking house with apartments and slummy tenants. Slowly get rid of the slummy tenants. Do cheapo paint jobs, put blinds on the windows, clean up the trash and water the grass. Now raise rents for tenants. The profit is from rents. Not selling.If you want to become a slum lord this is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed. Really this book seems to be geared to buying apartmement rentals","review":"This book was ok, but could have been better. Most of the content seems geared more tword people who are interested in buying multiple rental units like apartements. Not family homes. Plus the material seems outdated as he recommends scouring the claffied advertisements for properties to purchase.At the beginning of the book, the author recommends marking up the book with a highliter. I would seriously discourage that in case you wish to resell the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I consider this the best CD of my collection.","review":"I have listened to the CD, which I picked up at a show, hundreds of times; and, I still find it full of surprises, melodic and entertaining--definitely a master work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of talented artistry, addictive","review":"These tunes really grow on you.

Some research indicates that the software engine is about 5 years old, which could explain a lot. It does not conform to basic Windows API standards. Things like undo do not work. Selecting objects can be frustrating, if you have several close together (Corel solves this by using the tab key to sequentially select objects). But my biggest complaints are the topography tool, which works in a bizarre fashion, and the help files, which are no help at all.On the plus side, I was able to make a reasonable drawing of my house, so that I could envision an addition. But trying to get the lay of the land right was impossible. So for pretty cheap, you can do basic drawing and planning. I give it the 'high' rating of 2 stars because it's cheap.

I would like to Punch! the programmer. I've used older versions of 3DHome Architect and loved them. I have completely renovated my home using 3D and have added a sunroom with it. I could never completely grasp the stairs feature or roof features. Very confusing. I purchased Punch! because I loaned the 3D program to someone else and didn't get it back and thought I would give this one a try. I am pretty adept at figuring out software, but I really felt angry and frustrated with this program to the point of wanting to seriously throw my whole computer out the window or beat it senseless with a large hammer.

The second disc is the one that I prefer to listen to, but I do like to listen to the first disc sometimes also.This series is great for introducing someone to today's Christian music.

This movie is funny but had a different feel than his others. Dunham's new life of his recent divorce and new young girlfriend seems to have altered his sense of humor. He cut out Melvin the superhero who mainly had perverted jokes, and gave those jokes now to Achmed. Achmed was always my favorite but he fell short in this one, and his son, Achmed Jr appears in it...along with Jeff Dunham the puppet...

It seemed like the timing of most of the jokes was off. I also didn't care for the appearance of Achmed's son with his face half removed. I didn't see anything really funny about that. We've got too many war veterans coming back missing parts of their anatomies and I've never found the conflict in Afganistan or Iraq to be particularly humorous. That part of the act came off to me as awkard, not funny.To me it appears that Jeff has become distracted and his comedy is suffering for it.

The references to his shows in South Africa were over-the-line. Some of the references were hurtful and unnecessary, while some were funny. He knows better.Far too many F-bombs too.

But this show will, more me at least, be less remembered for his ventriloquist act but for his self-disclosure of early life and divorce. Otherwise, not much new ground, Achmed's son - nothing funny there. Peanut and Jose, along with little Jeff and little Peanut were the highlights.Unfortunately the most memorable segment was the intro; his school pictures and commentary were priceless. A setup for the next segment with Walter; where Jeff poked fun at his divorce. I found his divorce diatribe uncomfortable, if not sad, as much as it was funny. Perhaps his next show will touch on pathetic middle-aged men leaving their wives, in this case a 29 year old nutritionist. I think and hope not, best get back to the lives of his dummies, far more interesting and funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't play","review":"I ordered this for my husband for Christmas and it would not play in our Blu-Ray player.

In those DVDs Jeff's stage presentation was simple and fully allowed Jeff to be intimate with his audience and contribute his amazing skills of ventriloquism. Sadly, this DVD takes a plunge into being a piece of Las Vegas junk. The presence of multiple screens onstage, audiences that have been pre-prepared to clap, \\"hoot and holler\\", in phony appreciation that breaks up the flow of Jeff's presentation. Spotlights swiveling back and forth onstage to further \\"jazz up\\" the show. It seems that Jeff has sold out to the phony, slick Las Vegas type of show ($$$) that turns the quality of his work into pure junk.

The latest release of the Yorktowne pattern are now made in China vs. the USA and have a significantly lower quality. In most cases the blue pattern is light and incomplete, and the blue ring around the plate has gaps. The color of the plates is significantly different from those made in the past and can best be described as dirty gray with a matt finish vs. the glossy-light gray of the past.It is a sad to see that another American company has hit the dust and does not have enough pride to even do quality control in their overseas factories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't buy again","review":"I purchased this through amazon since it was cheaper than using the phaltzgraff website, which I usually use. This was a replacement for a broken plate from a set I've owned for a few years. The description of the product is incorrect. It seems Pfaltzgraff decided to go with manufacturing in China and this plate is obivously reduced quality. You can tell right off that the plate is lighter in weight than previous additions and the paint job is not a deep blue as described. It is a lighter blue and the outside ring is thinner in width. I can live with it because I want a complete set but I will not be purchasing any more items from Pfaltzgraff until they start making these back in the USA.

We went through it together and also shared in a group with other mothers and daughters. It is a wonderful way to share the changes a girl goes through mentally and physically as she enters puberty and beyond, very down-to-earth, but also science based. Zenack's style is nurturing, simple and clear. I was so glad to find this book as so many books out there still seem to try to make adolescent girls into sex objects, or they are silly, or too scientific and complicated.

The principle of the item is well thought out and if build quality could match concept they would have an excellent piece of kit. I found the whip to be loose and over a short period of time had dropped to below the horizontal no matter what angle it started, the nano would disconnect if a bump was incountered and the real killer for this item was as I removed it from my 12 volt socket for the first time the end of the 'plastic' socket snapped off with internal spring and fuse flying across the car. Over all I was very disappointed, the cost of the charger does not reflect the build quality, if you are tossing up between this and another product go the other brand, or just get the car charger cable. I found the air play transmitter work well when it wasn't moving around in the shoddy charger.

The beauty of this book lies in the way he uncovers certain aspects of our development as a civilization, and describes the WHY not only the how, every single time. Something not many authors or people really know how to do, and it turns this book into something special. Despite being 20 years old the message within is incredibly relevant and absolutely worth your time.The book is very well written and easy to read.

Again!\\" is able to delve into long-running story arcs that last from several episodes to the whole of the all-too-short 12-episode run. The quality of the episodes on these DVDs is excellent. Any fan of \\"Are You Being Served?\\" will certainly enjoy watching this sequel, which certainly could have, and should have, been allowed to continue for at least a few more adventures before allowing the staff of Grace Brothers to finally enter retirement."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I've Got My Snout In This Trough!\\"","review":"In some ways I found this series even more hilarious then the original AYBS. What a shame it didn't last longer.I love seeing the Grace Bros. Gang in a different more real outdoorsy setting. It really gave the show some air after being shut up in the store for years. The new characters just added to the fun...especially everyone's favorite Mr. Molturd. I imagined him to be just like that in real life..it hardly seemed like he was acting at all. As an avid fan of this entire series, it's just like eating potato chips...you can't (eat)watch just one!

This book really is extremely useful. Whatever level you are you can find some inspiration here. There is an assumption you have an intermediate-level knowledge of the app, but that's ok, cos even if you dont you can just pick up your manual/power PS up and work it out. The key to this book is its insight into the processes of seasoned, acclaimed, professionals. If you aint any of those right now, or even if you are, you will benefit from this book.NB - I'd drop it a half-point as the CD is pretty useless. But that would be unfair - think of the CD as a candy accompanyment.

She uses words as a master smith, weaving pictures and emotions together to create a riveting experience that touches ones soul.In this story, she turns her power to a fascinating time of history, and explores the depth of human depravity.Song for a Dark Queenis aptly titled. With her words, Sutcliff does create a song. It is a poem, but not one of beauty. A song, but not for pleasure. The golden rays of sunshine that peer through the forest leaves in the early chapters fade away. Black night seeps through until no more light can be seen. Innocent childhood is destroyed by horrific depravity. Good motives and familial love is swallowed up in ruthless hatred. The world is evil without redemption.A song with no hope: its end is darkness, death, and despair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay.","review":"Although good, and one of the first ever to be written, Dark Force Rising lacks realism. Timothy Zahn, I have found tends to make all of the main characters look wussie.

I understand its partially supposed to portray the teams that restarted derby in the early 2000s at the thunderdome. What i was peeved most about though is that the main character ditches her bestfriend and leaves here there with a beer to get arrested by the cops while she goes and gets laid and is underage wtf ( by a guy who treats her as a groupy no less and sleeps with other chicks).

This movie will crack you up and maybe tear you up as you go through the highs and lowes in this teen dramadie that is dead on entertaining. As a movie fan it is always nice to find something just a little different that will peak your interest while entertaining.

It's a cute enough story but the acting is incredibly flat and one dimensional. I'm sorry, I love Kristen Wiig on SNL but in movies she's just not that dynamic enough of an actress to hold my attention to be convincing at all. That pretty much goes for all the actors in this film. Decent story but a very slow and boring watch.

Three big problems: script, casting & directing. The script falls so flat - how can a movie about women's roller derby be so lethargic? And yet, it is. Most of the action scenes are destroyed by the horrible casting of Jimmy Fallon who's play-by-play banter is just plain annoying and grating and ... bad. Page is good, but her brittle, smarty-pants schtick is showing it's limitations in a role that calls for more warmth. Wiig and MGH fare best. Then the directing: She tries, but the energy never gets to where it should be. Especially when the off-track scenes go nowhere you haven't been 30 million times before. Take a pass.

It will bore the (sorry to be stereotypical) cheerleader, popular girl type. If you have been to Austin, TX or seen it on TV or in the movies and you just don't get the place....this movie is NOT for you. It promotes individuality, striving to find and practice what you are good at, taking the good with the bad in all relationshhips and that women can be badass, stupid, immature, forgiving, selfish....and everything we allow men to be all the time. Thanks for reading my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute and funny movie!","review":"This movie is very funny and very cute. I would recommend it to anyone.

I found the last episodes the most moving. The final Disc brings it all together with the interviews of the men of Easy Company. The 101st Airborne was decorated as a unit for their heroic efforts at Bastogne.The final line of the disc (I believe it is delivered by Major Winters) says it all. \\" 'My grandson asked were you a hero in the war grandpa?

And there's a lot of good stuff out there: Charles Guggenheim's D-DAY REMEMBERED, Thomas Lennon's THE BATTLE OF THE BULGE, THE LONGEST DAY, PATTON, A BRIDGE TOO FAR, and many, many more. In English language film (based on what I've seen--I've got to work and sleep, too, you know...), I can only think of Ken Burns' THE CIVIL WAR and Herbert Wise's I, CLAUDIUS, as being close in quality and ambition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible insight into WW2!","review":"This has to be one of the best WW2 movies ever made! Since it is a series, the story can be developed in a much deeper way. I also loved that the movie followed Easy Company and had interviews from the actual soldiers. This movies should be passed down for generations to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Series","review":"A very compelling movie. I looked forward to each and every episode! Great plots and very good acting. If you like dramas and war movies, you will really enjoy this series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers","review":"Come watch this movie to learn about the heroes of World War II. They truly are the greatest generation. Without their sacrifice and heroism we as a nation would not exist nor the citizenry of Europe. A must see for those who want to know what WWII was like in both U.S. and abroad. Highly recommended! (Graphic in nature)"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This is the BEST movie I have ever seen! I have the complete set and actually have rewatched it over and over again. The set not only includes the movie but it also includes extra things about the military like maps, dates of each battle, the original bio of the men the movie is based on, etc. The collector tin that the movie comes in is wonderful and it keeps the movie safe. I would recommend this movie to anyone, rather you are a history or war buff like myself or just like movies that have an AWESOME story line. This movie has some funny moments and some real moments that make you think and even cry. You wont regret purchasing this movie!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best miniseries ever made","review":"This WWII miniseries follows the 101st airborne from training through the war's end. It has some of the greatest scenes of battle ever filmed, along with a feel for the bonding that a group of soldier's develop over time. Gritty and unsanitized it shows why these men made up what is known as America's Greatest Generation, and reminds you of their sacrifice. Thank You veteran's from a proud nation."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Brilliant and Superb Miniseries!","review":"Good directing, good writing and excellent performances by the cast.....what more can I say? This has to be the best miniseries I've ever seen in my life. Frankly, I've never been a fan of war dramas, but I'm completely overwhelmed by BOB, because of its realism and complexity. I was really surprised to discover that Damian Lewis (who plays Major Dick Winters) is actually British, because he was so convincing as an American in this drama! Kudos to Ron Livingston (Captain Lewis Nixon), Frank John Hughes (Sgt. Bill Guarnere) and the rest of the cast members of BOB for giving such memorable performances. The special features of the DVD BOX SET are not to be missed ....Ron Livingston's Video Diaries are really amusing, but it's the documentary 'We Stand ALone' featuring interviews with the actual WW2 veterans of Easy Company that one must definitely watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers DVD set","review":"This is a great set, highly accurate portrayal of E Co./506th, 101st Airborne. Every member of the cast truely becomes the soldier they are playing in this work.(The documentery that comes with the mini-series is excellent as well.) A few scenes differ just slighty from the Ambrose book. Perhaps to make the series more fluid or add more value. My only gripe is that the set comes in a neat little ammo can like tin(which is fine). But the discs fold out on a cardboard style bandolier. They are extremely difficult to remove from those sweet little push buttons. Ive seen better designs, cant someone standardize this little push thing in the center of DVD's??"},{"rating":"2","title":"band of barothers","review":"Amazing!

The episodes themselves are superb, as is the DVD of extras with interviews of cast, crew and surviving members of the company. You will simply not regret owning Band of Brothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers","review":"Wonderful movie, my husband and I are watching one DVD a night, very interesting, and heart warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Edge of your seat, thrilling....","review":"Not only did Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks keep you on the edge of your seat constantly with action filled scenes. Starting with D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy,all the way to the discovery of Jewish concentration camps inside Germany. finally to the surrender of the Third Reich and VE-Day. With the mondern day testimony from the actual men from the 101st Airborne confirms it's historical accuracy. One episode directly ties to next and always leaves you yearnibg for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Stars","review":"I have watched the series 3 times on DVD and once on cable. I own both the DVD and BD versions. You can read 100+ reviews exalting the story, camera work, acting and production. I won't repeat any of it. If you are planning to buy it, just do it and be comforted by the fact that this will be the only purchase you'll ever make that you would gladly pay for twice. Enjoy it.....and hug a veteran. We're losing them everyday"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another american war- story","review":"This DVD is another typical american war- story were american soldiers defeat their enemy. Other features in this series are Panther tanks (Best tank of WWII) that doesn't fire when confronted with Shermans, and therefore are blown sky high. A few evil germans who flee as soon as they see a US- soldier are also added, as usual. The americans never loose a scirmish, in the end they are always saved by someone or something. So to sum this up: This DVD- box is a must for those of you who love seeing americans killing germans and looting their pockets afterwards. It also features american soldiers executing lots of german POW's and of course no one is punished afterwards. If you like that, then this is the thing for you, for all of you who have seen american war- movies in the past, stay away, you have seen it all before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Band of Brothers from videos 4 less","review":"Band of brothers from videos 4 less is a pirated very low quality dvd.

This has a great depiction of the first half of WWII and I have to admit from time to time the scenes will hold me suspended, but for some reason I never enjoyed the series. I expected there'd be a lot more blood, but all I saw was shooting, nighttime, profanity, name mix-ups, and quite some confusion pertaining to what was happening and why did it happen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty standard and boring.","review":"This miniseries was pretty boring. Stay away, unless you love to suffer."},{"rating":"1","title":"WWII meets Beverly Hills 90210","review":"This is a show that combines WWII melodrama with modern teen-TV dramas to create a horrid mixture of bad acting and war-glorification. It makes war look like a paid vacation with your buddies. Also: it waaay overglorifies American soldiers, who were far from being the best soldiers in the war. None of these characters/soldiers would have held up for 24 hrs. on the eastern front.I was never given any reason to care about any of the characters. Some were so cuddly \\"terry bear\\" ish that it was sickning. This is a perfect example of America's isolation for the realities of the rest of the world and of war in general.There is no real pathos or drama here, only blood and gut scenes and melodrama(much much more melodrama than B&Gs;). The story is very poorly written and tries to deal \\"sensitively\\" with too many different characters.Makes you feel like war is something the Beverly Hills 90210 teens did on their spring break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie!

The acting and cinema photography is exceptional. Being a Marine veteran, I felt the pain from the loss of each man and the exhilaration of the final victory. The packaging was well conceived.

I remember my grandfather reading to me, the newspaper account of the heavy fighting our airborne troops were involved in. I'm 70 now and have never forgotten what these men did for our country. They were herosEasy Company, I salute you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent WWII series","review":"Follow easy company from training all the way through WWII. Ten 1 hour episodes with lots of action and fighting but also shows some different perspectives of the War. I watched all the episodes more than once and I have found them to be just as entertaining if not more so the second time around.

This was an excellent series on HBO and I can finally see it again at my leasure. $25 for the set and free shipping? This retails for over $50 and I would have paid that as well. A great sale at a great Amazon bargain price is the best of both worlds.For those that haven't seen it, it is worth the money spent to get this.

My father fought in WWII, fought at Anzio and the North Africa campaign under Patton. Seriously wounded. My father didn't talk much about it, but he did say he didn't hate the German soldiers. He said they were just kids like him and his fellow soldiers. He hated Hitler and his crew, but not the German soldiers. And in Episode 9, the interviews with some Easy company vets - they felt the same way. One man said he could see fishing or hunting with them (under different circumstances). These men didn't see themselves as heroes, but they were. So much more than the readymade heroes the media seems to make today. They were the real deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band Of Brothers Blu Ray attention to detail","review":"I have been waiting and waiting until I finally broke down and brought this excellent production.

But I'm not going to review the series, that's been done countless times before. First off let me say that I am a hardcore Band of Brothers fan, and WW II history. When I found out this was coming out on Blu-Ray I wanted it. After reading the reviews of it, I bought a Blu-Ray player just for this series, that's how much I love it. I love the picture-in-picture special feature, where you have the men of E company talking while the show is on. However what I love most is the awesome picture. I have the original DVD set, so I decided to do a comparison. Well there was no comparison. In the first episode where Sobel is grilling them at Camp Toccoa I notice on the original that you can't read his name tag on his uniform, but on Blu-Ray it is crystal clear, but anyway that's just one of the many details you can spot. Excellent, and a must buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sub-Par","review":"After receiving this Christmas present, one of the disk was scratched in the box.

But after viewing this classic series, I feel as if I have seen it now. I have seen it through the eyes and hearts of a cast of characters that I will never forget. This is the greatest war film I have ever seen. It eclipses my previous favorite, the old black and white classic All Quiet On The Western Front. Band of Brothers is, by it's very nature, an unblinking look into the horror that is war, and can only be considered an anti-war film. It does not betray it's cast, it honors them. It abhors that which has brought them together in their moments of greatness. It abhors war. There is no honor in dying, only in loyalty and the ability to survive. Every American should be required to see this any time one of our Presidents start strutting around and preparing themselves to lead us into their version of the next Holy Crusade. It is time we learned as a people that there is no such thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than saving private ryan","review":"spielberg and hanks have made a masterpiece of real stories from Easy Company 101st Airborne.the overall is an improved version of saving private ryan. it is still focus on the americans but you have a lesser feeling of it than in SVP (you're not given a focused image of the american flag)."},{"rating":"2","title":"No English Subtitles","review":"The DVD release is fantastic.

The language, coupled with some realism, make this a movie for adults. Nevertheless, it is one that every American should see.

In fact, even an adult may want to keep the fast-forward button on the remote handy for that one fling in episode Naughty Number Nine.Now the good stuff: this series is an incredible true account of the sacrifices made by Easy Company during World War II. This dramatized documentation of their experiences is riveting - You WILL get caught up in it. Includes brief interviews with the real life veterans featured in the film before each episode.Highly recommended for anyone with interest in World War II era, or war films of any kind. I bought it as a gift for my husband, and wound up at his side, just as glued to the screen as he was.

I had trouble my first time seeing this because you get introduced to the characters early and you are expected to remember who is who. Eventually once you get to the last few discs you are \\"googling\\" the characters. so this is not one of those series you can just throw on the TV and do some homework too because 1) you wont know what is going on and 2) you wont get any homework done.. all that aside this is most definitely worth it! there is so much action and every episode keeps you on the edge of your seat!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Death from Above","review":"I can't say enough positive things about Band of Brothers.

There are depictions of D-Day, Normandy, Market Garden, Battle of the Bulge(Bastogne), and many more. Not only do they show the fighting and all the action of those times, the main focus was centred in on the emotions on the soldiers. Whether it is a loss of a friend, a cold winter morning in the 'foxholes', trench foot, brutal amputations and surgeries, the guilty conscience after a victory, or shortages of food supplies, medical supplies(bandages, morphine, plasma), or other utensils, each emotion is displayed powerfully and realitically so that it dominates the entire show...Definately is the best WW2 depiction of all time and is a must see for war movie watchers...(Warning: Contains intense violence, blood and gore, and occaisional strong language)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tribute","review":"This HBO miniseries portrayal of Easy Company, 506th regiment, 101st Airborne, pays the hightest tribute to the men who served from the Normandy invasion to Hitler's Eagle's Nest. These elite paratroopers were among the best that the United States was coerced into using in order to stop Hitler's war machine. This DVD collection will allow you to traverse with them through the great trials that these men faced on their journey to becoming heroes. This collection is quite simply the greatest war epic ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent","review":"Band of Brothers is an incredible miniseries. It seems no expense was spared in recreating a historically accurate setting. The casting and character development is exceptional, and the directing is superb. Each episode is introduced with snippets of interviews with actual members of easy company, which served as a potent reminder that the seemingly unbelievable events depicted did indeed happen to these men. Im glad that such a work has been accomplished because it is a vivid reminder of what the greatest generation did for our country, and we as a nation should never forget it. Especially in the world today, when it is easy to forget the underpinning values of our country, it is important to reflect back upon those virtuous qualities of the heroic men and women who won the war for us.

I would recommend this series to any one that wants a better understanding of WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Wonderful!","review":"Should be a must see for all of our youth (with a little editing).Technically very well done. Acting also superb. Great message of sacrifice for the common good.Can you tell I like it! Even better than GETTYSBURG. GODS and GENERALS doesn't even come close.My all time favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best WWII Movie/Series ever!!","review":"Truly the best WWII series ever. The Blu Ray quality is absolutely amazing. This truly defines why they call it the greatest generation. They truly are. Dick Winters is truly an amazing man and worth the Medal of Honor upgrade his men are trying to get for him. Absolutely the best Blu ray in my collection. If you have teenagers they should watch this so they understand the value of the freedom we have. For the technical aspects: The audio is awseome with DTS Master Audio and 24fps video. No DNR or EE evident anywhere with perfect resolution and film grain as intended. This is an absolute 10!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I absolutely love this show, and asked for it for Christmas... Funny as it turned out, you do tend to buy things for people that you also want, anyhow, I purchased it for my Father, for Christmas, who loves these types of shows, and my Parents had also purchased it for me too... lol... It was a great Christmas :)I think this would be great to show in school History classes. The kids would definately get a better understanding for how things were during that War, rather than reading some dull text book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!","review":"I could watch this movie on a continuos loop. I rate this right up there with the John Adams documentary. This is a great historical movie that moves me each time I watch it. Do yourself a favor and buy it. It appears as though they have fixed the number 1 complaint regarding subtitles not being in english."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most captivating mini-series I have ever SEEN!","review":"This was without a doubt the best film or series I have ever seen, regardless of subject. I was riveted to every episode, and watched it everytime it came on HBO(same episode often repeated 2-3 times per week). I finally recorded it (am missing parts IV and V... really missing!) As a female I often wonder if I am odd that this series touched me so profoundly. It really brought home to me how much our military personnel sacrifice as they serve our country (past and present). I will never look at Veteran's Day, Memorial Day, VE or VJ Days the same. An amazing piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"This mini series is a moving tribute to the men and women fighting in WWII. It is a must buy for anyone interested in WWII, and in my opinion is one of the best films made about WWII - EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"After hearing people rave about the series, I bought the box set for my dad for Christmas. I had seen clips of it, and it seemed like it would be an OK gift...He and I were glued to the television set for the next 3 days. My mom got upset at us because we tried to skip meals so we wouldn't miss a second of it. \\"What's so great about it? All war movies are the same.\\" Lo and behold, one week later, she, too, found herself glued to the TV as she watched the series from beginning to end.The footage is clear and scenery is amazing. We saw the characters bond and cried when certain ones had to leave. I shared the series with all of my friends and their families.The tin box is pretty nice, too. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Band Of Brothers, Blu-Ray","review":"I was given the older DVD version several years ago & enjoyed same. After reading many reviews on the Blu-Ray Edition at Amazon, I had to have this product. My calculations has Lt,. then Cap't. Winters about 8 years my senior. But for the accident of birth, who knows what would have happened to me. As it was, I served 2 years during WWII, most of it after the war in Europe was over. Cap't Winter has retired to his farm in Pennsylvania.The Blu-Ray Edition in my opinion is far better in PQ & AQ. I must have a very good BR player, because It produces such a good pic and sound, 5.1 DTS. I ordered from Amazon and opted for their 2-3 day delivery. It came in a large bubble type envelope via UPS in perfect condition in two days. I, for one am ecstatic. Shown on my 50\\" plasma HDTV, I have the best of both worlds. By the way, there are many language subtitles for those of us who are hearing impaired. Also Amazon beat other providers by about $20."},{"rating":"2","title":"Band of Brothers","review":"My boys have watched this miniseries on TV many times. Wanted a copy of their own. Great buy and service!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See","review":"I watched The Pacific first. Thought it was great, so I went back and watched Band of Brothers. Very informative; gives you an idea of what WWII was like; you'll learn some history and also be entertained at the same time. Also the special features are really good as you'll meet the real life people the characters are based off of. Our WWII veterans are getting up there in age so it's important to have a product like this to help preserve their story and legacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Story - Well Filmed","review":"My younger daughter encouraged me to watch the first edition of this series. The story was told about a unit and walked you along with them through basic training to the D-Day invasion. They connected the story back to a few of the original company members as they told their story of what really happened to them. Wasn't overly bloody and gave me a very different perspedctive than I've had before about that awful yet glorious day."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Band of Brothers!","review":"This is the best mini-series ever made! I've wanted to buy Band of Brothers for about ten years and I finally got around to doing so. I am a history buff of World War Two and this series hits the nail on the head. I can not say enough about Band of Brothers. There are several segments with the actual survivors of Easy Company through out the series. If you’ve never seen Band of Brothers you are missing out on a great piece of work!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great WWII War Movie","review":"Great story set during WWII and follows the lives of several men in Europe during WWII. Originally bought this for our son and after watching the series got one for ourselves. Haven't had anyone yet who has watched this that didn't rave about it in the end!!! Does contain a lot of graphic war scenes as one would expect so probably not for younger viewers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series!","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas. He is a fan of war movies and this being the exception because it is based on actual events. Even the interviews were great. Actually seeing the guys who were in the fight you had just seen is remarkable. Even for a chick like me, I have to say it was a great movie! Blu-ray makes it awesome!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blu Ray version of Band of Brothers","review":"I had heard this was good, and it didn't disapoint. Recommend watching with surround sound and a good subwoofer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written mini-series","review":"Band of Brothers is a great miniseries that I highly recommend to those who like dramatic war films."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best WWII documentaries ever","review":"This Documentary explains the essence of a military combat unit. Unbelievable historical events wrapped in with a study of the role of the leader and the follower. The importance of strong military leadership is shown in great detail. Any Military leadership department better get their hands on this collection.Even without much Air Force involvement Spielberg and Hanks did an amazing job on one chill WWII Documentary flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oustanding","review":"The most realistic movie. The presentation, the package, the extras interviews. Is a peace for collection. I big achievement in HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speilbergs finest hour follows Easy Company's finest hour","review":"Blu-ray Release - Band of BrothersMovie: 5.0 of 5.0Video: 5.0 of 5.0Audio: 5.0 of 5.0Extras: 5.0 of 5.0Overall: 5.0 of 5.0This documentary/series on HBO is a sorely needed reminder of what our relatives, grandpa's, uncles, and friends had to go through to give us the freedom we enjoy today. With Schindler's List this is Steven Speilberg's finest hour and it follows the true heroes of Easy Company. The end of episode 8 is probably the most difficult to endure as the narrator reminds us that while the war was being fought and while these men lost their lives in France and Germany all of us in the US had already forgotten what they were doing. \\"How will they know\\" the narrator asks. This blu-ray set is one way how we will know, and reminds us to honor our veterans and those who still fight for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best","review":"This mini series is excellent. Although graphic it is true to the soldiers story and I love the actual soldiers telling their view of real events."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding beyond belief","review":"The teaming and bonding of a group of soldiers under the most stressful and difficult circumstances captivates the viewer. I lost all sense of time, worked out on a treadmill and watched it in sequences over time, and am not watching it straight through. I feel that I was a part of EZ company, and continue to say that the men and women of war did a special and courageous thing for this generation and many more to follow. To all of the director's, producers, and other professionals that created this, I tip my hat to your craft, however I pray and think daily of the people who allowed me to be blessed to live in the United States of America, a free man. A must see for those who say that they are Americans, and proud of it. A absolute see for those who question the brutality of evil dictator's like Hitler and other's. All Sadam lovers, WATCH THIS FILM, and remain pensive. THANKS EZ COMPANY! May God Bless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"This product came sealed in what looked like it's original packaging but as I watched the 10 part series I discovered that 2 of the discs didn't even work. They were useless. Could not be more disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Currently on SALE at Target!","review":"This is currently for sale from Target for only $29.99! Amazon will not price match, so save some money and buy it there. I am rating low for the price only and the fact Amazon won't price match."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating","review":"I have seen and read many documentaries on WWII. Many of them are excellent. The best in my opinion is \\"The World at War\\" narrated by Laurence Olivier and done in the early 1970s.This dramatization by HBO is fair in my estimation. Unfortunately, the script seems to have been written by someone who never got over being a foul-mouthed adolescent. I don't care how much some may say that soldiers talked crudely and this is reality - I object to being presented with a made up script where the F word dominates much of the dialogue. Furthermore, there is one scene in Part 9 that is nothing but pornography. It was totally unnecessary and added nothing to the story. It didn't need to be there. I strongly object to HBO and other amoral movie makers producing this type of crap. The so called \\"documentary\\" could have been so much better with a more responsible script writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not handicap accessable","review":"I give this movie a 1 for its accessibility. I love the movie and give it a 5 star rating, however, it is not accessible to those of us with hearing loss. I have purchased two versions (over $100) just trying to get to watch this movie. If I spoke Spanish I would be fine. the captions do not work on any TV and show up as being blank. When I watch it, my family gets tired of having to interpret it for me and explain what is being said. I know that there is English captions out there, I have seen them on TV. So why can we not get them with the movie? I am feeling a little left out on this wonderful movie."}]`),C={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},N={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],W={key:0},M={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),p(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",M,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",W,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const x=d(C,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-22eed64e"]]),j=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"glossary/22.md","filePath":"glossary/22.md"}'),R={name:"glossary/22.md"},G=Object.assign(R,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{j as __pageData,G as default};
