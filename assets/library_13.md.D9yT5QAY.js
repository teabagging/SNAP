It lists about 1200 kanji, but all it is a list and some boxes for you to practice writing them in. Sure, it shows you the stroke order and compounds, but everything is written in roma-ji, and the compounds aren't that useful anyway. You aren't going to learn much, even if you do fill up the boxes with Kanji. There are no exercises to increase recognition, and if you have never encountered the words before, simply learning the Kanji will not teach you how to use the word. If you have learned the word before, most likely you learned the Kanji along with the word. Don't make the same mistake I did and buy this book. There are much better books for learning Kanji."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Very easy to install on YSP-800 unit.

I had to look at different hardwares stores to find screws that would actually fit the bracket and the YSP-800. So make sure that when you purchase the YSP-800, make sure it has the screws.

The journey encompasses many centuries and many delightful figures of the literary past, from John Boswell to F. Scott Fitzgerald, from Lord Lisle to M. R. James (in a wonderful section on Gothic shadows). The two best chapters concentrate on the death (and life) of Thomas Chatterton and the life (and death) of Mary Wollstonecraft and William Godwin. This book will be enjoyable for those who are not familiar with all the discussed writers' work (such as myself) as the writing is so clear and beautiful and the personalities examined so fascinating. This book examines biography writing as an art form and thoroughly proves its case. A charming read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"Was hoping for something a little different; something fun to listen to during the holidays.

These are basically the most famous meditation instructors in Myanmar (Burma), Thailand and Laos. If you want to learn about Theravada meditation, either for scholarly reasons or to practice, you can't do better than this book without learning their languages.However, I think it represents a sort of elite perspective on Theravada Buddhism. Many practitioners don't share exactly the spiritualities expressed by these teachers, and I think their practices and beliefs (some would say superstitions) are an important and valuable part of Theravada Buddhism, not to be neglected by either scholars or practioners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rich and Varied","review":"This book is refreshing and abundant in its ability to present the wonderful breadth of Thai and Burmese Theravada. Prior to reading it, my exposure to Theravada was largely confined to that form practiced in Sri Lanka. It will certainly expose one to the richness expounded by adepts of the Forest Tradition. I cannot comment enough on the multifaceted nature of this school of Buddhism, with regard to differing perspectives on teaching and methodology.

Her excitement at wearing her new coat to school and sharing it with her new friends quickly changes to sadness when she is taunted by her playmates. But she remembers her father's lessons and his love and helps her friends come to see how special her coat is--to ALL of them!

Very well produced dvd. It starts off with a sample performance in costume of the choreography she will teach. She then does a quick warm-up. She goes into teaching some movements. From there she shows combinations 1st without music then practicing with music. She then proceeds to teach the choreography which is the combinations previously taught just slightly varied. She keeps patiently building onto the choreography. In the end she performs in the end in costume. From her she injects her great sense of showmanship.Jillina's outfit is beautiful yet functional while she is teaching. You can see her clearly from the background.I would recommend this for intermediate and advanced dancers. I don't think she goes into enough detail for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jillina cannot teach nor can she inspire","review":"This is a VERY superficial instruction. Most importantly, where is drilling?! Jillina just dances at high speed, and expects not-so-advanced students to follow along.That could still have some value if her dancing was truly beautiful. But I find it boring. She doesn't come across as enjoying herself. During instruction she looks bored, and her occasional fake smiling doesn't help. During dancing she perked up, but her perky counting only killed my already weak desire to follow her. I need to learn how to dance; I already know how to count, thanks!This just looks like a home video made by Jillina's friend (apparently after a good number of drinks) at their leisure.

I study the Italian language and Renato speaks the language perfectly and without dialect.

This book goes over all the rules, and tells you what tools you will need to make your music look amazing. I got this manual about a month ago and I can say my skills have improved. At first, writing it all down can be time consuming, but eventually you will get faster at it, as it is very satisfying. Music notation software has made writing and copying music faster, but in my opinion is dehumanizing the art of composing. I highly recommend this book for any composer and/or musician who wants to further there skills in writing music down on paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good solid performance","review":"Ignacio Rodes' performance of these 4 guitar sonatas, three were premiers when this CD was released in 1993, are very good especially in the Ginastera but I did like Eduardo Fernandez's performance better because it was more dramatic. Unfortunately it is no longer available. The Brouwer sonata is particularly good musically and Rodes does fine with it. The recording is very good as well. However, I did like Miguel Trapaga performance and recording of the Brouwer better on another Opera Tres recording (#1031 ASIN: B00003O9IA) again because Trapaga shows more passion and the sound is warmer. The Espla and Bardwell sonatas are less interesting but still good.

The book's historical perspective on modern day business practices and the explanation of fundamental East-West cultural differences are insightful. That said, the book [now in its 6th(or 7th?) Edition] has developed Schizophrenia; often developing ideas that are later contradicted and switching incongruously between timeframes. The usage of and reference to Japanese is antiquated, marked by mistranslation and an awkward treatment better left to a serious Japanese language text.

This album is such a romantic sounding record, that I can't help but put it on over and over in the nighttime hours. It's sonically richer than most of the stuff Ivy ever did but when you're chief songwriter as distanct as Andy is then you'll tend to sometimes tread the same ground in certain ways. There are occasional tracks such as \\"Justine\\" and \\"Beautiful View\\" that really, really remind me of Ivy.

This is simply, the goofyist slasher I've ever seen, except perhaps Army Of Darkness(of which there is no equal). But Army of Darkness was not a true slasher, while this is.There are some classic scenes in this one, but my favorite is when the guy dressed up as Santa robs the store, shoots the guy behind the register, and goes out to his car only to find that he only got a few bucks from the store and expressed his dissatisfaction with his meager \\"take\\".

There were no science fiction elements that I could see.A pretty vile book all the way around.After reading this, I told my husband that he'd better switch to reading only Outlanders and stop defiling our home with crud like DL unless he brings it home with the pages processed, perforated and on a roll!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"The Stranger isn't really all that great.

After being attacked by a cave creature that turns out to be the love of her life, and then dealing with her real boyfriend, it was just too confusing. To say something positive, the attraction between Nicoletta and the cave creature was interesting. I think that the only thing that kept my attention was to see if they actually spend the rest of the lives together. That brings me to the end, which was definatly different than what I expected. Maybe that was a good thing, but I wanted it to be different. I think that the author wanted a younger audience to read her book because for anyone else it is on a higher level.

So I bought it, since other players will back up to the beginning of the track, which is useless for an audio book, unless you enjoy hearing the beginning of a chapter again.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect fit","review":"I just recently got a chihuahua puppy who only weighted 2.13 lbs at 6 1/2 weeks, and I had trouble finding anything that fit him. I finally found this and it was just the right size for this little puppy. Everything else was too big for him. It is very easy to put on and adjust, especially if you want to put on your dog and adjust while on him. You simply slide it over his head, and you pull on the straps to tighten, similar to drawstrings. Then there is one spot you can adjust longer or shorter to fit around the chest. It clips together behind the front legs across the chest."},{"rating":"2","title":"OLD FASHION ROCK","review":"TRACK LIST: 7 O'Clock/Man On The Loose/Whippin' Boy/Sex Party/Sweet Mary Ann/I Don't Love You Anymore/Hey You/Misled/Long Time Comin'/Roses & Rings/There She Goes Again/Take Me HomeThe lead singer has the same raspy voice of Rod Stewart.

And seems like the author thinks that hatred is their privilege. They care about their pride, OK, but would not care a bit of others pride. They don't have a bit gratefulness, they don't have a bit love. They are really selfish people only care about themselves. Look at how Zared treated Tearle, and how her brother treated Lady Anne.

The feud complicates their getting together, but in the end Tearle finally breaks through Zared's barriers to win her love.I've liked Jude Deveraux novels in the past (The Duchess, Knight in Shining Armor) but I have to admit I was disappointed with this book. The story never seemed to [pull] me in and I found myself reading just to know how it ended. I even wondered why Tearle liked Zared at all. She was so filled with hatred and seemed incapable of showing him even the slightest bit of kindness.This is a book to skip."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for any Mountaineer!","review":"This adaptation of John Denver's beloved song is a must for any family who has ties to West Virginia.

It showed up and the handles were all shattered (they are pretty cheap plastic). In addition, the casing around the mechanism was broken, allowing the magnet to spin freely around. Trying to look past that I deided to set my bike up to see how it ran, and how noisy it was. After getting most everything back into place that I could the noise was fine for about 20 minutes, and setup was relatively easy, but after 20 minutes it started making a ringing noise that is apparently the metal wheel rubbing against the magnet. If it wasn't broken maybe it would be a good product, but I am pretty disappointed, and I would look elsewhere if you want to spend this much money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad trainer at all.","review":"This is my first trainer, so I have no experience with any other.That being said, it works great for me. To help with the noise problem, I went and bought a VERY smooth rear tire, and set the trainer on a thin rubber mat. No unrealistic noise that shouldnt be expected from riding a bike inside a house. I could pop in and watch a movie while using it.Wanna be cheap? Throw an old phone book under the front wheel to balance/level the bike.The only gripe I have is the initial mounting of the bike. Finding the right way/angle to secure the skewer caused me to almost launch off the thing more than once.(Hint: Secure skewer pointing BACK before mounting.)Other than difficult mounting of bike, it's a good product.

History happens. Here is the story of a revolutionary instrument that had its beginning the 1960's.Even if you are only interested in music, this book is enlightening in an unique area. The authors inclusion of his interviews with Kaman family members in his work is like sitting in on a story telling. You get a feel for the events as they take place. Particularly those of us who were around when the Beatles, Glen Campbell, Josh White and others rising. There are those ties that from Ovations' history that stir warm memories.

The speed and the understanding of the music was exceptional for a middle-aged performer. How exciting to learn Birelli was just a kid.

I chased leaves around the hard and carpeted surfaces until they were crumbled all over the edges of the floor.

I called GoVacuum and they do not even have the 'HOKY' by Oreck so if you order from them you will get the cheaper model. I was offered to ship it back and may do that but I advised the GoVacuum guy he was showing the HOKEY and he should change the offer on Amazon.com as it was deceiving people.

A lot of people close their ears and eyes when it comes to hearing the truth about what they can't experience and understand so they'd rather belittle Smiley's point of view and experiences to \\"reverse\\" racism or tiresome rhetoric. But then nothing more is expected from those who walk through life privileged. Even the most liberal white man could never understand the plight of minorities, let alone conservatives, the party of I-have-mine-screw-you."},{"rating":"1","title":"About like he speaks","review":"Mr. Smiley seems like a likeable guy, but from what I have seen of him on BET, and other cable shows, he lacks any ability to articulate points using reason or objective facts. Unfortunately, his writing isn't much better. Many whites would consider him somewhat racist. I don't, I actually think he is truly searching for an answer, but his conclusion that the \\"right\\" is to blame for everything is tiring, particularly now as we hit 2000.Something fresh is in order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who was this book written for?","review":"Without exception the worst writing I have ever seen. No facts, no figures, just Tavis' opinions abound, presented as 'quasi-facts'. Pick up a Cornal West book (race matters, etc) for quality 'left-leaning' reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I consider myself a liberal democrat; politically, I am very close to Mr. Smiley. However, the lack of insight or intellectual rigor which he offers with this once-over presents complex views in broad and often incoherent strokes. Mr. Smiley's obvious lack of background on issues as broad as racism or as complex as affirmative action shines through. However, it is amusing in a way to watch the academic equivilant of a toddler playing with an uzi.Thanks, but we don't need a liberal limbaugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE IN PRINT THAN ON AIRWAVES","review":"Tavis Smiley is one of the most irritating television personalities I've heard, and he is worse as a writer. He taps into Black America's thirst for knowledge, any kind of knowledge, but unfortunately he doesn't offer much in the way of substance. Someone needs to pull the plug on him, and someone else need to stop printing this drivel. And this isn't random racism -- I'm an AFrican American woman who thinks WE can do better in producing good commentary. Clarence Page and George Curry offer much better insights than Smiley does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Centered Nonsense","review":"Tavis Smiley is a self-centered dimwit. Who is he preaching to?Why is his opinions so important? Maybe his prose would be worthy if he looked at the whole picture. His writing is his opinion. Readers buy books of quality. This is not quality it is meant to brainwash the mis-informed. This book is written like a mad man wrote it. Read at your own risk. A real waste.And Tavis Smiley views of his race is a real disgrace."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"After being a fan of every other Fearless book from the first series, I was deeply disappointed in the Fearless FBI series. The beginning was okay, and the climax was eventful, but I was hoping for the same raw, violent, witty, smart, and suspensful plot from the original Fearless books. I loved the past books, and I was let down after reading the new books. I expected Gaia's unique character to stay the way she was, intelligent, disdraught, passionate, unexpected, and best of all, fearless. However, the new books portray her as being more mature and composed while she grows up and goes to Stanford and getting a job with the FBI. I miss the old Gaia who lived for the moment and roamed the streets of New York. I wish that the old characters such as Ed, Sam, and Jake were still in the book series and I think it was depressing that they were all cut out of Gaia's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good deal","review":"I Got this camera last week, ...what makes this camera distinctive is it's touch and very sharp LCD , brilliant body design and slim size, it comes with rechargeable battery which saves batteries drain. it's very easy to operate even from first time, resolution of this camera is minimum requirement for you needs.

And she doesn't flow like a Belly Dancer should, also her dance is cold and dry like her.There many other things out of the Hollywood style Super Starts, just look for Middle Eastern Dancers, sometimes the cultural shock is big, but makes you learn better about all other things.Buy Norhan Sharif, or better buy the Egytpian Dancers videos (Lucy, Fifi, Dina, Farida) and you will get the real thing, not a cheap American imitation of such a beautiful art!!Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely done, clear photography & instructions","review":"I've been really enjoying this DVD for quite a while now. My family enjoys watching the performances, and I've been working with the instructional portion. The photography is very nice, Jillina gives clear directions about each movement, and the menu is segmented so that you can easily find what you want to work on. I really liked the fact that the movement combinations were numbered 1,2,3,etc., because that makes it easy to find where you left off last time so you can go directly to what you want to work on. This is also one of the least expensive DVDs in my collection---most bellydance DVDs of this quality cost a lot more. Kudos to Jillina on doing a great job! I own the other 2 DVDs in the set, they're equally wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful video","review":"This is a great video to practice bellydancing as an artform.

We required him to read Mr. Berardelli's book before we took him to test for the learner's permit and we are using it as a blueprint in teaching him to drive. It is very well organized and reminds us to cover small details we might otherwise overlook. We especially like the 100-hour log. Our state only requires 40 hours with a parent while behind the wheel, but we've made it clear we'll be requiring Mr. Berardelli's 100 hours before a license can be obtained. Our metropolitan area lost more than 20 teens last year in traffic accidents, including one from our son's school and the wreck happened right down the street from us at 5:30pm, with no drugs or alcohol involved.

So it is a good idea, *every* time you start out...\\" --It's just filler and it's tiresome to read. The book is also poorly written in other ways and needs a good basic editing, the type a grade school English teacher could do.Give another driver's education book a chance; they're all written for teens anyway.

Audio and video quality is high and whilst he performs so many of his big hits, they are just as enjoyable as he always seems to make each version different enough from others. The dancers bring some action and visual energy to the show although the choreography is pretty basic and unadaventurous.I have been to many Cliff concerts going back as far as the 60's but today's concerts are even more entertaining. To sing, move and look that good at his age and still present great concerts is rare and a pleasure to all his fans. This is a great addition to my music and DVD collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still being sold - don't pay this much","review":"Yes, it is still in print. Google it.

Since the Disney corporation feels that everyone that has a show on the Disney Channel is a singer as well, this CD is not their best work. To shift from respectable artists (and I use that term loosely), such as NSYNC, Ashanti, and Christina Aguilera, and go to \\"Disney Channel-made artists,\\" like Raven and the Duff sisters, in my opinion, is a mistake. If your kids are into all the shows the Disney Channel has to offer... the CD is a fair choice. Otherwise, stick with the first Disneymania CD and don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Great albumn, i would recomend this to people of all ages.

It's all about making money.How else to explain this collection of horrid, shrill recordings?What we have here is the worst sort of pandering by one of the most soulless corporations now in existence. Each and every \\"song\\" here is an example of rote, by-the-number calculation, designed to appeal to what the Disney people must assume are idiotic SUV-driving parents and their overindulged little monsters, in other words, to people who cannot distinguish between quantity/popularity and quality.

I am a little worried about a supplement that has such an obvious effect, but I have used this for two weeks without problems. As for results, well, it has only bee two weeks.

I only take 1 pill in the morning. The bottle says you should slowly build up to two pills in the morning and two in the evening. I would probably drop dead if I did that. I did 1 pill in the morning and 1 in the evening for a week and could never fall asleep even after working out. The 1 pill in the morning gives me energy, but my heart rate is increased for the entire day, which cannot be healthy. I sit uneasy at my desk feeling like I need to go walk around or something.

Sword's fact-filtering, and cut-and-paste journalism will unfortunately impress the unwitting reader, who will be twenty bucks poorer, and totally misinformed on the 1864 Confederate campaign to liberate Nashville. John Bell Hood has been described as the Civil War's most \\"famously unfortunate\\" commander.

My intent was to buy a similar edition for a church pianist who would have been very pleased to have it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Historical Devotional Hymnal","review":"It's obivious that the previous reviewers of this hymnal are not familiar with traditional Afro-American Baptist Churches.This hymnal is the book of songs that's sung by the church deacons during the devotional part of the service. Many of thesesongs are sung without music. I guess this is understandable since a lot of these new age and mega churches use Praise andworship teams and some don't have deacon's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, how convienent! Nice Rabbets.","review":"Until I purchased this bit, I had been making rabbets with a plain straight bit. I had to set the fence to the thickness of the stock to rout the rabbet. With this bit you simply align the bearing with the router table fence, and you get a consistent rabbet up to 1/2\\". Rabbet size can be changed by installing a different size bearing (included in the kit). This is much more convienent for me than setting up a dado blade.

But since Flash has become an Adobe product, released CS3 and CS4 and most importantly the transition from ActionScript 2.0 to 3.0, this book is in desperate need of a new edition.It presents tutorials in a way that are actually useful to journalists, rather than useless and overly complex motion graphics. However some very simple coding is now impossible with this book, because of ActionScript 3.0. I found it very frustrating trying to do tutorials in Flash CS4, and not being able to follow the instructions because of updates to the program.For a journalist wanting to know flash, McAdam's book would be the perfect resource if it didn't force you to digress in technology more than 4 years.

I tried a little of a interval thing I read online where you take your cadence from 90 to 110 to 90, shift to next taller gear, and continue.

Sad to say, I was sorely disappointed. The only performance that comes close to capturing Patsy's spirit is Norah Jones's rendition of \\"Why Can't He Be You\\". Norah sounds nothing like Patsy but they sure do share the same soul.I sorta enjoyed some of the other tracks (Terri Clark and Amy Grant in particular) but can't bear to listen to the completely misguided performances of Natalie Cole (I Fall To Pieces) or Diana Krall (Crazy). Both sound completely confounded by their material. Diana Krall's peculiar phrasing of the lyric of 'Crazy' turns the song into the aural equivalent of a sleeping pill. I'm completely baffled by her interpretation. Is it s'posed to be profound? Whatever her master plan, the listener will experience sudden lethargy, muscle weakness and an overwhelming need to take a nap.Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did any of these people ever HEAR Patsy Cline?","review":"I was anxiously awaiting release of this CD.

I believe it is a truly masterful album... twelve unique and distinct artists, all doing very unique versions of some of the best songs ever written. True, not all of them are completely traditional, but I personally like it. I would prefer an album like this where the artists have a chance to express themselves creatively on some of the material, instead of just copying Patsy's style. Some highlights of the album are Natalie Cole's unique \\"I Fall To Pieces,\\" Norah Jones beautiful \\"Why Can't He Be You,\\" Lee Ann Womack's rock-edgy \\"She's Got You\\" and Rebecca Lynn Howard's superb vocal performace on \\"You're Stronger Than Me.\\" I recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Patsy Cline's music and is open to truly unique covers of her songs.

I was impressed by the parings of the songs and the artists. they seemed an interesting and good match. Nothing could have been further from the truth. Patty Griffin had the best track on the album, Diana Krall, Norah Jones and Amy Grant turn in OK performances. Yet all the performances still sound like the artists are just repeating words - not singing a Patsy Cline tribute. Most of the remaining songs are PAINFUL to lisen to - overproduced and overblown and downright awful.

I am the former secretary for the fan club and I have to say it's just awful!! I know these ladies were supposed to do it as they wanted but I'm sorry, there's only one way to sing a Patsy Cline song, and that's to let Patsy Cline do it. Terry Clark was the only one, I felt, that was close and that wasn't that good. Do more of the duets cd's, at least we have Patsy's voice on those.

Her raw emotion and natural talent can never be duplicated. Not to say that the women featured on this collection are not talented because the certainly are, but there is no bright moment to be found. It comes off as lack luster which is the FURTHEST thing from what Patsy Cline was. There is a reason why these songs are known as Patsy Cline songs, she wrote none of them and yet they are hers, all to herself. Everything else is just an immitation. It is not a fitting tribute to the glory of her amazing voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"listen before you leap","review":"I bought this after hearing Diana Krall's version of Crazy on NPR.

Norah Jones is still terrific even if not a perfect match for her style. But, the first song by Natalie Cole is so poor that it unfortunately sets the tone for the whole album. Cole's voice is hoarse and otherwise dreadful. How could she lead off the album? Wrong choice for a Patsy Cline song.

The only cut I was really disappointed in was Martina McBride's version of \\"Sweet Dreams\\". Along with Take 6, which really adds nothing to the song, Martina really could have done a much better version alone and with full orchestration. She has a beautiful voice and I am a big fan, but this cut was not what I expected.Highlights are from Amy Grant, Diana Krall, K.D. Lang and LeeAnn Womack. Overall though a pretty good CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This CD is a REAL disappointment. Natalie Cole's renditiion of I Fall to Pieces should be subtitled I Fall to Sleep. Nora Jones is her usual breathless self(someone ought to get that lady some oxygen). If they had deep 6ed the Take 6 background track on Martina McBride's Sweet Dreems it would have probably been pretty good. The best two tracks are by Dianna Krall and J.D.Lang.

In practice, this is a wildly uneven effort. Some of the arrangements are so bad that they are comical (I won't point out any names to protect the sincere, but guilty) and many of the vocal performances are surprisingly lackluster even from those with usually fabulous voices. This CD just doesn't work.There's another CD out there that tries to do the same with Dolly Parton hits, Just Because I'm a Woman, and that one is very successful. What's the difference? I think it's partly that the artists on that CD are better interpreters of other people's hit songs.

Only a few tracks can truly be considered tributes to, or remembrance of, the awesome talent that was Patsy Cline! Amy Grant played best, while Michelle Branch and Terri Clark attempted to stay true to Patsy's style. Starting with Natale Cole, all of the other artists, apparently, preferred to re-interpret these classics in their own styles, rather than honor Patsy -- they failed miserably. My own disappointment was greatest in Martina McBride's rendition of \\"Sweet Dreams.\\" Martina could have played this much better staying true to Patsy's original, rather than adding ridiculous and unnecessary background vocals. Overall, this was a terribly produced album. I strongly urge anyone who wants to spend time \\"Remembering Patsy Cline\\" to bypass this album and purchase one of Patsy's.

I must say that three of the songs were acceptable (Jessi Alexander, Patti Griffin, and Amy Grant) -The rest of these ladies need to stick with what they know - and it ain't Patsy Cline. Patsy Cline felt her songs - she sang about heartache and pain like no other - the rest of these ladies whine and moan the songs - and the arrangements - if I wanted a pop CD I'd buy one.

(Okay, he does try to commit suicide in a coffee shop restroom--but, conveniently, he changes his mind and there are no witnesses.) And despite the book's deliberately inflammatory title, even Blair himself isn't able to work up much of a head of steam that affirmative action somehow played a role in his downfall. Regardless of his race (or his much-touted slave ancestry--what, were his they plagarists, too?), Blair's pathetic tale is not worth revisiting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time and line Blair's pocketbook","review":"I am an avid reader (2-3 books a week), and also an open-minded reader. However, to anyone who is considering buying this book, my advice is simple: don't bother. For one thing, Blair is not a good storyteller. He doesn't stay on track. He would have a fairly decent story line going for about a page, and then would interrupt himself with 2 or 3 pages of chatter about nothing. I found myself looking up from the book thinking \\"What was THAT all about?\\" Secondly, the book is self-serving and irritating. Blair plays the race card, the substance-abuse card, the childhood sexual-abuse card, and the \\"I was wronged by the Times\\" card over and over again. Give me a break. Bottom line: the book was too whiny, self-serving, boring and poorly written to be worth the used-book price I paid."},{"rating":"1","title":"A solid disappointment and further discredit to Blair's name","review":"I read Blair's book because I honestly wanted to read his side of the story and give him a second chance. After reading it, I now realize he didn't deserve this much of my consideration. \\"Burning Down My Master's House\\" is riddled with ad hominem attacks, self-serving soliloquy, and a disturbing lack of supportive referencing (which is essential due to the potency of his allegations and established lack of credibility) . Also missing was a proportional apology for breaking the trust of the world and the hearts of loyal NYT readers. Every page seems fueled in the interest of his own vindication - a now impossible task after the publication of this book, which should only deepen the recidivous Blair's ignominy. What a loss of a fine writing talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Liar, Liar, Pants on Fire\\"","review":"Jayson Blair may still be active as a writer -- penning 5 stars reviews on Amazon, per chance? The book is full of lurid details of drug abuse as he chronicles his fall from grace at the NYtimes but short on insight as to why it happened, or shame that it did. Instead, what we get are a lot of self-serving rationalizations and finger pointing. Here the NYtimes is characterized as a kind of witholding parent who simply could not meet the many needs of Jason, while inadvertently enabling and perhaps even encouraging his bad behaviour.

I had read a positive review in the Amsterdam News, but I still was wary because of other more critical reviews. Just by standing up and agreeing to face the wolves and offering what is sincerely and apologize, I give Blair some credit, but what made this book strong was that he provided insight on the general problems that people in all sorts of areas -- law enforcement, government, corporations and journalism -- face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finding your passion","review":"No doubts: Jayson Blair is a good writer! His passion was to use writing to help and inform others. His story is really about how we loose our focus and meaning when we allow the evil of \\"pressure\\"(either externally or internally induced) to destroy our common sense.It's also a story about how bad lifestyle habits which seem to give short term satisfaction(e.g using drugs and limted sleep to propel ahead) can destroy us in the long run.After reading this story, I was reminded we are indeed \\"spiritual beings\\" having a human experience. So many young people, like Jayson, get caught up in the material aspects of success and forget to take time and smell the roses...I wish Jayson all the best.

Ultimately, drug exploits are tiresome: \\"I snorted a bunch of cocaine, got it on with a stranger, spent all my money, woke up with a headache, blah, blah, blah.\\"I also agree with the reviewer who commented that the writing is sloppy and the editing evidently minimal. I had to shut the book for a few minutes after reading about Jayson's seeing the Challenger shuttle hurtle to the earth through his ten-year-old eyes. I cringed with embarrassment as he relays the \\"touching moment\\" when his fellow mental hospital patient tells him she \\"liked black guys in her heyday\\" and would have gone for him twenty years before.

You don't have to get even halfway through before you can figure out exactly what happened here. Some publishing house obviously offered him a large advance to write a book, and he threw together whatever he could think of off the top of his head, very little of which is probably true, threw in some \\"woe is me\\" for cohesion, and tossed it onto the editor's desk. Whether or not anyone even tried to edit this thing, I don't know, but if they did, they should be fired. This is slop, worse than those celebrities who try to \\"write\\" books.

Blair is a pathological liar--even his book title is a preposterous lie; it has the audacity to imply that Blair is some kind of a crazy rebel who is fighting power/symbolic slavery by breaking out of a slave role and destroying his masters abode. This is plain sewage. He is a fool, an arrogant nutcase and so full of himself that he cannot see past his own privilege, abuse of power and narcissism. He is an insult to every journalist who actually takes her or his job seriously. Instead of blaming drugs, depression and suicide attempts, (he is not the only writer on the planet who has some kind of psychiatric struggle - did Poe, Tolstoy or Churchill lie their way through life?) he should look into his soul and see that the emptiness and broken moral compass within is his own job to fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor prose from a supposed writer","review":"This is the closest I've come to being sorry I bought a book. For a NYT calibre writer I thought the book was rather poorly written, and more poorly edited.

However, as he has demonstrated through his multiple television appearances, he is beyond shame.Many journalists with drug or alcohol problems get help and rebuild their lives, but the first step to that is to accept responsibility for allowing their lives to spin out of control. Blair sees no reason to do that as long as there's the Grey Lady to blame for giving him a job, an expense account, and even car service.I hope to see Blair, and this appalling book, become a footnote in journalism history.

Compared to other rappers out there today (ie 50 Cent, Lil John, Ludacris, etc..), Dizzee Rascal is superior by far. His beats are pretty unique, and his subject matter and word choice is better than what other MCs are talking about. This isn't really mainstream material, so he might not really catch on in the US. I guess some people might not dig the British accent, but I thought it added a unique flavor--its also fun to hear British slang thrown in (ie \\"mates\\" as opposed to \\"niggas\\").The only things that bothered me were the gun references in \\"Hold Ya Mouf\\" and the poor spelling of track titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dizzee, not Disney","review":"I can not believe some of the Yank reviewers on here criticising Dizzee's accent and demanding that he move to the states for a few years to lose his accent.

This was a massive disappointment. What do people see in this? It's not awful or anything, but there's not much to recommend it. Dizzee Rascal is a good rapper and sometimes he turns a good phrase. But the beats and the music are rudimentary and unimaginative. The production isn't very good, either. There's very little about this album that is memorable -- I've played it through four times, and almost nothing sticks. It's not like I need my music to be totally poppy, but less accessible music usually makes up for it by being experimental or complex, and this really is neither. It's just hookless, non-danceable background beats. Great. I really have no idea how this album got such positive critical attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off the hook!!!!","review":"This is unlike anything u have heard before, Dizzee can't be compared to any of the mainstream rappers out there.

This album by 18-year old South London garage rapper/producer Dylan Mills contains some of the most incredible rhymes and, truth be told, some of the lowest production values any american hip-hop fan has ever heard. The majority of the album (including the incredible I Luv U) was recorded and produced when Dizzee was only 16 or 17. While American hip-hop has Lil' Bow Wow and the like as the protoges of other, more experienced rappers, Dylan produced this album himself. With a speed approaching that of Busta in his prime and a lyrical skill far exceeding 90% of the modern scene, Dizee Rascal will truly be someone to watch in the future.

I cleaned the laser and it still does the same thing, and I was told it is no longer warranteed.

It wasnt handled roughly by any means and the screen just went out. The sound and dvd still played but there was no picture. I adjusted the screen a couple of times and it then worked but it no longer works at all. We paid 400.00 for this player and it worked for 2 months and three times.

The song starts and all you see is the lyrics. No pictures of the movie. No scenes. No nothing. Just the lyrics.So, my son still prefers to listen the songs while watching the movie, and I understand that because we can always enable the subtitles (although there's no colors to be guided I think it's better than the karaoke)."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs Karaoke machine!","review":"Nowhere in the product description does it say that you have to play this disc on a karaoke machine in order to get the on-screen lyrics -- but that's exactly the case.

How is it helping the environment when they have to package twice as many rolls as a common type of toilet paper?"},{"rating":"1","title":"All for being green, but very dissapointed with this tp","review":"I'm all for being green and try to buy recycled & earth friendly products as often as possible. I even cloth diaper my kiddos, compost my trash, etc., and even when my husband is a little \\"over\\" it I push on. That said, I'm very dissapointed with this toilet paper. It is 1 ply, and rolls are extremely thin, so we're going through it SUPER fast (faster than any TP we've ever had), changing the roll every single day. I'm floored at how quickly this stuff runs out compare to other products we've used. I'll look for a green TP again, but will definitely cancel my subscribe & save to this product and won't order again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"I've been using Green Forest tp in my home for several months now, and it is great. I pay about the same price for this recycled tp as I used to pay for conventional tp. It is soft and comfortable and no one has complained about it at all.

I've tried several and then found this in a local store last fall (they since stopped carrying it). The only other place I could find it was here on Amazon and I'm glad I did! I now subscribe to it, pretty cool! The rolls are a little smaller than others (if I remember right) but we don't go through the packs as quickly as I thought we would. Hope that helps, it's hard to say much about TP!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get this if you have allergies","review":"I am allergic to corn and wheat, and this is the ONLY toilet paper I can now find that doesn't give me an allergic reaction.Updated: I have used the premium version, also sold on Amazon, and personally I find this one to be much better. It does have fewer sheets per roll but is otherwise superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why throw money down the toilet!","review":"I priced the paper several ways, grocery store, big club stores, online and you can't beat the price.

Packed loosely so it's soft, but so few tissues on the roll it uses up fast. It doesn't tear neatly, so there are bits left behind. And, it tears while wiping, nasty. Buy Seventh Generation instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Green Forest single rolls","review":"I wanted to buy toilet paper that was environmentally friendly so I ordered Green Forest toilet paper, single rolls, on line. I would not recommend the single rolls. It seemed to me there was hardly any toilet paper on the rolls. If you decide to try it, get the double rolls. I must of missed that option. The toilet paper is soft, but a little flimsy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I am very dissapointed with this product. I don't think I saved any money because I the rolls run out so fast because the paper is spun very loosly and their is not much paper on each roll. Also, the paper seems pretty thin so you have to use quite a few sheets so it's totally not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality and value was below what was expected","review":"The paper's color (definite gray cast due to apparent lack of toxic bleaching) could be justified but the value was much below what was expected. The roll size was very small with very little product as compared to other major brands, although those too have diminished in size and quantity per roll. If they reduce the amount of product any more the rolls will look like a roll of adding machine or cash register tape. I resent \\"sneaky\\" marketing tactics.I try to support companies and products that encourage environmental responsibility within their products, policies and processes; however this purchase was a definite disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"better buy at Costco","review":"We purchased this product because we thought it was a better deal that the Costco Kirkland brand.

It's a better deal to buy the Kirkland brand instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like the paper but","review":". . . there is so little of it on each roll that they are wasting resources by using way more cardboard tubes than they should be.

Like someone else said, the rolls run out very quickly. There are only 2 of us using the rolls and we have to replace the roll every 3 days or so. It's also a little too rough for me. I prefer softer tissue like Charmin. Good for the budget though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycled paper but too much plastic","review":"It's good the paper is recycled, but the environmental effect is completely negated by all the plastic packaging. The quality of the paper is fine, but the rolls are small and loosely rolled. I really believe it would be better to purchase virgin paper, in large rolls, wrapped in paper than these little things wrapped in plastic. It just made me ill to see all the plastic around a little bit of paper. At least paper decomposes and grows again. I will choose a different brand next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive and Rough...","review":"Need I say more?The purported environmental benefits are nonexistent: modern forestry makes the concept of recycling paper meaningless... So the \\"green\\" benefit is purely emotional."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, not worth it!","review":"I've ordered from Green Forest several times and love the company, but these rolls just aren't worth it.

I still love the brand and recommend the facial tissues/paper towels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleans you conscience too!","review":"I recycle my trash, but unless someone uses that recycled stuff, what's the point. The toilet paper is a nice product that prevents trees from being cut down by being 100% recycled and 50% of that post consumer. Is it White Cloud or squeezably Charmin? No, but it does job. Until I can buy such a product at my local store, I will continue to purchase this from Amazon. I'll try their facial tissues next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the Earth, Good for You","review":"Like most, I was hesitant to try using \\"eco-friendly\\" toilet paper because I thought it wouldn't be \\"human friendly.\\" Not true with this stuff!

Besides the numerous mistakes and typo's each subject is covered so breifly that u might as well guess as to what to do. The books title is very misleading also. It says 'for windows 95' when a good part of the book is geared towards 3.11. I think that the only good use for this book would be to replace a broken leg on a couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has no sense of organization","review":"This is a pretty disorganized book by any standards. The author seems to have no sense of what he is trying to teach. It would have been so helpful if he had just had the reader create a project from scratch. Instead he jumps from from one topic to the next and then back again. If you want to learn Oracle dont buy this book.

It looked great, very nice design, lots of options. A few crashes here and there, but I've learned to save often. The real problems come in when you try and burn a DVD. Its really bad at only burning part of your DVD, which causes your movie to stop in the middle. Adjusting brightness can lead to an black screen on final DVD burn. Still images, which you lay titles over etc, all get lost when you save your project and reopen it.Its too bad, the layout and design is just awesome. I had such high hopes when I read through it. I hope they can fix some of this for the next release, since this version is nearly useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere for moving your videotape to DVD","review":"This product and the bundled Pinnacle 8 Studio software delivered spotty performance. It generally capptured the video from tape OK, but the interface (and especially the capture format options) was very non-intuitive. The DVD rendering was slow, and results were hit and miss: some were OK, some failed outright and some were rendered with annoying frequent color shifts (about every 3 seconds throughout the entire DVD). This all took place on a new, fast machine with plenty of RAM and disk space. I'm pretty comfortable with new apps, but the Studio 8 is very hard to figure out. Consider the PYRO A/V link from ADS instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is one too many","review":"Without question the most frustrating software application I have ever had the mis-pleasure of having to work with. Slow - despite a top of the line duo-core processor and terrabytes of storage - doesn't begin to describe the time that is required to render a project. You can count on the render process to hang approximately 95% of the time and that's the least of the aggravations. My last project using this so called \\"solution\\" corrupted the audio track in the time line, globally replacing the selected audio clips with different clips though leaving the original file name in the time line - so it wasn't until print to tape one was able to discover that the theme music was now inserted at minute 34:45...

Pinnacle's original creators should be ashamed of being associated with crap that looks like it was developed in China.

Years later (2006) I bought a compilation album with a CT song on it (Bluebeard - Four Calendar Cafe). It was the 'stand-out' track on the cd. After buying Four Calendar Cafe I researched other CT cds. I bought Milk & Kisses and then found Heaven or Las Vegas. Heaven or Las Vegas guided me through one of the toughest times of my life. Ms Fraser's amazing voice, the melodies and the constant surprises of lyric and sound the Cocteau Twins hands us are made in another world.

I remember first hearing this CD coming out of the jukebox at Vezzo's in Philly, thinking \\"I gotta get this one.\\" It's the perfect CD for whiling away a quiet night. Ms. Fraser's vocals are sensual and inviting, the muscianship is excellent, and the lyrics are just on this side of being understandable, if not totally coherant. The 'Twins left thier Goth constituants behind with this one, foraying ahead with a style that seemed to invoke My Bloody Valentine and Sonic Youth, while eclipsing both of them in content. While \\"Iceblink Luck\\" seems to be the breakout hit here, there are also the title track and the first track as well. An essential CD for anyone who loves all that can be music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it bought this used!","review":"I knew about the Cocteau Twins for about 5 years or so before actually buying a CD of theirs. I only heard three songs by them in my life so when I saw the \\"HOLV\\" cassette used I decided to pick it up. It didn't disappoint. I couldn't believe someone would sell this (unless they bought the CD)! The music in this album is brilliant. Liz's voice is great. This album is a great introduction to the band. I recently bought \\"Four-calendar Cafe\\" and I can tell right away that it won't have the same staying power as \\"HOLV\\". I'm not really sure about the titles of the songs but my favorites are: 1,2,5,6 and 7.

Constantly, the prehistoric animals featured in these shows are compared to military machinery and weaponry: talons and claws are \\"smart missiles,\\" tails are \\"crushing tank treads,\\" predatory jaws are \\"weapons of mass destruction.\\" Discovery's writers seem to forget that these animals were complex and interesting beings that also cared for their nests, slept, ate, drank, migrated, survived and bred.

I suspect that Magnavox got their players from Mintek, then put their more recognizable name on them. Since Mintek is a very small company with no track record, you might want to check out their reviews before you buy this player. I've had the Magnavox for 2 weeks, and the Mintek for 2 months, and so far they both work fine. But when you buy a big name brand, you expect that it is more reliable than the unknown maker.

This is a solid little player (did I say little?) and comes with lots of plug-ins and features. My main complaint: sometimes it sounds like a race car grinding gears when it starts up and sometimes it'll just start grinding in mid-play. It can also have trouble loading a disc unless you really press down onto the spindle. It tends to freeze sometimes in the midst of playing and then it moves on. It does the same with movies sometimes and other times it plays right through. So over all I would say it's a good machine but a little erratic.

Hold my calls.\\" Bert said with a child like grin on his face.In addition to using a period instead of a comma after \\"drink\\" and \\"calls,\\" the author puts the spoken words of both characters in a single paragraph to further confuse the reader. This book is filled with misspelled words, grammatical errors, and punctuation errors. The writing is stilted. It lacks any suspense or clear story line. What a waste of my money.

The stories either lacked plot or ended abruptly. It's like these authors didn't know how to write a short story. The stories that setup the plot well and described things fully, ended quickly. It felt like the editor gave them a certain number of pages they could write and they shoe-horned a story into it.If you want a good book about mystery and golf, this isn't it.

It came sharp enough right out of the box to stick about an inch deep into a tree. For comparison, I ordered the Gil Hibben full size competition thrower knives (3 in that set) and they scarcely had a point and virtually no edge.After getting this Cold Steel thrower, I of course got some small nicks in the blade after throwing. I was able to get them out with a coarse honing stone fairly quicky and get the edge back. The knife is sturdy and fairly heavy. The paracord wrap, to my pleasant surprise, has stayed on very well as it is properly wrapped and burned. It will eventually fall off as any paracord wrapping will do, but it should stay for longer than one would expect.Overall, I recommend this knife over most of the other throwers I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Throughly Enjoyed","review":"I've had this knife a month now and I have to say I'm hooked on Cold Steel.

Here are my observations:+ Well Balanced; easy to find the balance point+ Great Looking; black matte finish looks great, no doubt about it+ Good Heavy Weight; VERY heavy! More than enough to stick in a pine board when thrown from 12'+ Quality Metal; tips have held up well, despite having hit the floor more than a few times+ Belt Sheath; good quality, but could be betterWe bought two of these and have been very pleased with the throwing performance as they work well for both straight and rotation release.I really like the paracord wrapped handle as well, making it more comfortable to grip as a regular knife. The blade does ship VERY sharp and holds an edge very well.Highly Recommended!CFH"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Throwing","review":"This Cold Steel Throwing Knife is just what I wanted. This is a fine weapon that every warrior or sportsman needs.The balance is perfect for controlled throwing. With a minimum of practice a combatant can hit the target.This knife is a good weight and is heavy enough to easily penetrate and leave a significant wound. I recommend this product to anyone skilled enough to avoid hurting themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than expected","review":"I bought a pair of these, and to my delight, they are more than I expected in a throwing knife; that it's a real knife, capable of doing more than being thrown, is a plus. The cord wrap is tight and nicely finished, and the balance point is right where the handle meets the blade. Each comes with an acceptable nylon sheath with a nice, snug fit. These are hefty knives with a 5/32\\" thick blade of high carbon steel. Quite a value, and the rest, the throwing, is up to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Okay","review":"The knife is very well made, but the only problems I have with it is its made in china, and the paracord blends in with the thick vegetation around my target. it takes a while to get used to, but once you get the hang of it, its just another thrower.if the paracord does come off, just replace it with a brightr coler (like bright orange)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Knives Ever","review":"I think Cold Steel are the best blades made and will not buy another brand probably for the rest of my life. They have shown me in video and in personal use that no other company can compare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite possibly the best knife ever made","review":"This knife is the best one of all my knives. I can skin a deer with it, throw it for fun or practice. It is perfectly most glowingly balanced, at short distances you can hold the hilt & throw it because the blade is so heavy. You really have to have a strong arm & good technique to throw it holding the blade. Buy 4 or 5 today!!!!!!P.S. I am being sarcastic, I just got tired of being told MY original review wasn't proper, that there was something wrong with me. Trolls. So buy one anyway, and write your own review, then stick to it if you dare. Buncha jerks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Disappointment","review":"Within the first ten minutes of throwing this thing at simple tree rounds, it started chipping away. Within twenty, the tip of the knife had broken right off. This thing is pathetically weak. These tree rounds were soft from all the throwing I've done with hatchets and other, much smaller and far less expensive knives, of which I assure you lasted a lot longer than 20 minutes. After sending the knife back; even after they received the knife, it took weeks to get a refund. We ended up having to dispute it through the bank; the company would not voluntarily give back my money. I'm never buying from this seller again, and I don't recommend anybody else does."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice piece of steel","review":"A really simple knife that delivers what it promises. It is extremely sharp out of the box. it is well balanced, the steel is extremely hard so will withstand almost any abuse you do. The paracord on the handle is nice but the way it is wrapped makes me think that won't last too long in there, but I will prove that when I have the chance to use it extensively. I like the size and feeeling of the knife in the hand. Could be nice to have the point sharp in both sides but I guess I can sharp it myself. Like the title said Nice piece of steel. Do not expect something fancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome pry bar with an edge","review":"The True Flight Thrower is thick, heavy and comes with a decent edge. It will not stick in my wood target no matter how hard or how precise I throw it. The tip is very thick and will hold up to the abuse but it's too thick to stick in dry wood. It would work great on a cross cut target of soft wood like cypress or white pine. My kiln dried yellow pine target just rejects it and throws it to the ground. Works great on cardboard. Overall, its a tough piece of steel but needs the proper target medium to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Knife","review":"A stoutly-built throwing knife that will also serve as a cutting tool. Many \\"pure\\" throwing knives are unsuitable for cutting purposes, and although most knives can be thrown, they will not long survive as projectiles. This knife satisfies both uses. The sheath is functional but inelegant, and for the price I do not care. I can make a good leather sheath if I want to, but the one it comes in works just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and Useful","review":"This book is part of the G.

The biggest problem is Orochi. I waited the entire film for the monster. Then, when he came, he was just a plothole creature that could have been just as easily taken away.

How a Female can believe she is unwilling and end up burning with Passion and Love. The night Alexa looses her virginity could be called seduction, rape, or unbridled sex - depending on how one looks at it. Her awakening after that turns her into a sensual creature, as hungry for her lover as he is for her.Plot wise this takes place during the revolutionary war, when America is fighting to be free of England.

The sides are folded and sewn, protecting the edges from fraying. The package says that canvas is subject to shrinkage, but 12' x 15' is quite large and shrinkage will likely not be a problem.I like this dropcloth and felt good using it to paint the inside of my garage. I never liked working with plastic dropcloths because they've always folded in on me, perhaps due to carelessness, making a mess.

It's tolerable during the day but at night I find myself turning off the power strip. Operating the DVD wasn't too bad after reading the manual. It took some patience since the manual or menu features aren't entirely user friendly. Another annoying quirk is when we turn on the unit to use the VCR, the VCR will come on and then immediately switch over to the DVD. We have to hit the VCR button to put it back in VCR mode.

In many ways I prefer that position over a mirror mounted on the helmet or the glasses.Unfortunately, the mount itself is made from relatively soft plastic which leads to vibrations even on smooth roads. The joint for adjusting the mirror loosens too quickly so that readjustment is needed from time to time.Overall, I still love the concept but I removed the mirror from my bike again because in practice this mirror is not very useful. However, I am using this mirror as a starting point for building something sturdier using an aluminum mount."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"This mirror, although the position is good when riding, is not practical. I was constantly trying to avoid hitting the mirror against anything such as a wall, pole or anything else. This is because it sticks out so much from the handlebars. You cannot flip your bike upside down to work on it with this mirror attached.There is road vibration also. It takes a long time to figure out what is going on in the mirror. For example, at night there may be three cars behind you. But because of the vibration, it looks like 6 cars because what you see is 12 bouncing lights but it is really 6 bouncing lights from three cars with two headlights each.Because of the optical curve, objects also appear different than in real life. So it is also hard to perceive depth. I returned mine and have a glasses mirror that works much better.The reason I give it two stars is if you cannot wear a helmet or glasses mirror, then this mirror is better than riding unsafely with no mirror at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rattles all over the place","review":"The velcro strap simply doesn't hold the mirror securely.

As stated is other review, I could not see a thing until I was almost at a stop or riding on a road that was as smooth as glass.I think the plastic is waaaay to thin and flexible. The mirror wobbled all over the place. I had the velcro pulled until it was ripping and it was still shaking all over. I returned it the same week. I am still searching for the old style Rhode Gear version that was made out of aluminum and was GREAT. Probably in the history books though.I am a road rider and ride in the 14-18mph range. Maybe it would work better for the people who just ride around their neighborhood or to the ice cream shop and don't go over a few mph and have smooth roads(like anyone has that anymore) I can't say."},{"rating":"1","title":"needs constant adjusting, takes too much space on bar","review":"I have tried using this mirror on both my road bike and my touring bike (with butterfly handlebars). In both cases, the mirror took up too much space on my handlebar and made changing hand positions awkward. I was constantly having to re-adjust the position of the mirror and tighten the velcro strap on my handlebar. I now use the mirror on a third bike that has v-shaped handle bars. It sits at the bottom of the handlebar V and is clamped on with a metal ring-shaped clamp. Since it's at the bottom of the V on the handlebar, it can't slide down any lower. It's finally functional as a rear view mirror, but not on a road bike as advertised by the vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"ilumina review","review":"awesome cd! cool music and bumpin' loops! love the remixes too! terrestre from the nortec collective is very dope! understand a little spanish but with this cd, you don't need too cause the tunes are cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bliss","review":"If you like Daedelus you need this cd.

While it smells good and my hair does feel clean, I noticed absolutely no enhanced volume using these products. I gave it 2 stars because it at least cleaned my hair. I am skeptical about trying the real expensive stuff (Kerastase, Phyto); they either seem to work for some (are the reviews legit or by someone who works for the company???) or not at all and a sheer waste of $$$. It would be nice if these manufacturers would offer a free sample to prove what they promote is actually true, since they claim results can be seen after one use.

It lacks the flow of \\"Faith for Dummies,\\" and the useful visuals of \\"A Cartoon Guide to the Bible.\\" It's defense of Barabas is both \\"spirited\\" and unique to Biblical scholarship, and its investigation of Job's earlier misdeeds helps to clarify things for the layperson.

I've worked through, \\"Japanese for Busy People\\" the Romanji version. It will take about 10-12 years of daily study to be able to read Japanese if not write it..even if you go through this entire series you won't be able to pick up seinen manga and read it with out more vocabulary and kanji memorization. Even shounen with furigana will be difficult.However this series is a great way to introduce ones self to the Manga style of writing.One thing I have noticed is that my other dictionaries and source books on verbs list type 1 verbs as the \\"u\\" dropping variable verbs, while this book lists type one verbs (it refers to them as group 1) as the \\"ru\\" dropping invariable verbs.I'm far from being an expert on written Japanese grammar, however I was confused at first with this (I'm working my way through several books and dictionaries from cover to cover simultaneously).Please correct me if I'm wrong.Thank you,Michael"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for kids!","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I was a foreign language teacher for many years, and even I was put off by the use of technical grammar explanations! I bought this for an 11-year-old girl who is fascinated by manga, hoping to interest her in Japanese language learning. This was definitely not the book for such a purpose -- its description should make it more clear that this is not a book for young learners."},{"rating":"1","title":"um well..","review":"this book was not useful to me because i don't think i need to know the phrase 'where are my ninja stars'.. however i made tons of friends at japanese camp with this book.. though i suppose maybe someone who actually liked manga might find the book more useful..not worth the money in my opinion.. i donated it to my local library.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I thought it would be.","review":"So when I ordered this book, I thought it would be another run down of limited japanese phrases, limited kanji descriptions, and a whole lot of romanji. Lucky for me though, it wasnt like that at all. The stylish excerpts from japanese manga seires novels helped not only to transistion my brain from one language to another, but also aided my grammatical sense. (Seeing as how kanji can be spoken in either Onyomi or Kunyomi depending on its structure.) They only reason I didnt give it a five was because after reading 20 chapters, with 10 more to go, I have to admit it got kind of boring. It read more like a text book than a witty how to book. Hopefully they can improve on that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the interested","review":"This book made me realize how hard Japanese really is. Its a great book for the interested but don't think that your going know Japanese after just reading this. Combine with theJapanese in MangaLand: Workbook 1for effective learning. I only got this to familiarize myself of what I'm getting into when I take Japanese in the coming semester at school."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Bought this for my Teeneged Student of Japanese","review":"While I can't improve on what Courtland said, I would like to say that I bought this for one of my daughters, a straight-A student of Japanese. At first she didn't like it but she was bored and started to read it and decided that she liked it. This is useful Japanese. It's repetitive. It's how it is spoken. She saw her Japanese teacher the other day while grocery shopping and he immediately started speaking to her and she spoke back, speaking better than she had in his class and he was extremely pleased as she'd not lost anything over the summer.Magna reminds me of comic books in elementary school-- the teachers didn't think they were useful reading material but for kids who weren't into reading and liked the short stories with lots of action, they were good because at least they were reading and getting something out of them. This is really the way to go for learning ebcause you put the language into use immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"For people with British and Spanish accent","review":"The examples that the author provides are not targetted at American readers. For instance, he said that the \\"a\\" in Japanese is pronounced as in \\"cat\\". The correct pronounciation is closest to \\"Ah\\". But if you say \\"cat\\" with British accent, then it's pretty close, but \\"cat\\" with American accent is totally off. And he said \\"o\\" in Japanese as in \\"lot\\". Again in British accent, it's \\"l-Awe-t\\" and correct, but in American accent it's \\"l-Ah-t\\" which is completely wrong. The author is Spainish born in Spain who studied in Japan, and the book is printed in Spain. This is geared toward Europeans who go by British English/accent as the \\"standard\\" English language."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japanese in MangaLand","review":"I have read several (well started) several books trying to learn japanese but it is a very forien concept to me as a native english speaker, This book takes a good aproach or explaining and giving examples that helps me understand how the language is sturctured and works.

Well, what a big fat disappointment. This book should have been an excellent read; it has all of the elements I love in a story of True Crime. But alas, as someone else who reviewed the book pointed out, it is written like a trashy true romance novel. I understand that women can be naieve, but give me a break. I truly stopped caring about Brenda after she was almost killed after her car was rammed and she almost died; she still never suspected her husband-she actually had to overhear him talking about planning her murder on the telephone before she realized what was going on. I think if the style of writing had been more sophisticated it could have been a good read but as it is, it wasn't. save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This has got TV movie written all over it...","review":"Agreeing with previous reviewers, the stars are for Brenda Gunn's courage, not for the writing style. It's a great story but Ann Rule should've written it. The trashy novel style is not meant to be used for true crime--I skipped a lot of pages (cut to the chase, so to speak) because I lost all patience with the writing style. Brenda is an intelligent woman who made a good living and smart investments but she married a guy only 2 months after meeting him and he turned out to be an ex-con...the entire marriage and relationship was a set-up involving the woman Brenda thought was her best friend: maximum betrayal. Hats off to Brenda for getting smart just in time to save her own life, but I sure wouldn't have gotten the tombstone with hearts and planned to be buried beside the guy who literally died trying to murder me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth reading","review":"This book is not worth reading, period. The writing style is extremely poor: the plot has too many loose ends, the editing is sloppy, the analysis shallow or non-existent, and the vocabulary is more primitive than that of my 8 y.o.'s easy chapter books. Content is no better. Ms. Gunn is a very poor role model for victims of spouse abuse. Even considering her feelings for her husband, she makes too many bad decisions. She is unable to learn her lesson and recognize the pathological nature of her husband and their relationship, and her \\"still loving him\\" and wanting to be buried next to him when her time really should not be celebrated. If you want to read a true crime novel, the choices of good reads are numerous (I see that Ann Rule has already been mentioned). If you are interested in psychopathology and in how to protect yourself or your loved ones from dangerous people, read \\"Women Who Love Psychopaths\\" by Sandra Brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did I read this?","review":"This is a ... book.

When Glen enters her life, it is as if all her dreams comes true. What follows is a tangled web of deceit, deception and ultimately dispair. The story could be chilling...but the writing style is so over the top that it distracts the reader. The writing is more like a trashy romance novel, which obscures the true life aspects of the story. Brenda Gunn's story deserves a better telling...I beg to disagree with a previous reviewer, this story would benifit from a detached viewpoint. I am giving it one star in honor of Brenda's bravery, without her it would get no stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Could be Married to a Killer","review":"Can we ever really trust the person we love, the person we marry?

Although Uniden can be good at times, this one is virtually worthless:1) The keys on the handset began to wear out after just 3 weeks of use. By 4 months, only 2 of 12 keys were legible.

Granted, there is a lot to be found here - if you have the time and patience and inclination to plod through all the often-repetitious information offered by the author. As another reviewer has said, this book reads like the author just dumped all his notes together with no attempt to organize them in order to make them comprehensible to the average reader.

I bought this for a small, all season porch that tends to get a bit colder than the rest of the house during the winter. On the highest setting, it definitely takes the chill out of the air and makes the space a little more comfortable. This is a great fan for a small space or office. It is not a powerhouse by any means, so it is unrealistic to expect it to turn a large room into an oven. It is lightweight and very portable with a handy cool to the touch casing and carry handle. It is also a very quiet unit. It is no louder than a regular tabletop fan.

The controls are easy to see and use. The only caveat is that it is quite light, and therefore somewhat tippy. Mine has never tipped over while in use; it remains quite well balanced. However, when setting it in place (I do not keep it plugged in) to heat the small bathroom where it is used, I have to be extra careful to get it steadied so it doesn't fall over. That said, it is certainly quite a bargain for the money, easy to tuck out of the way when not being used, and capable of warming up that chilly bathroom so ice doesn't form the minute you step out of the shower!

I used this unit on the \\"low\\" setting for about 12 mos (used only in winter months). It worked fine. Today, for the first time, I used it on the high setting. It had been on for about one hour, when one of the internal supports for the heating coils collapsed. This caused the coils to collapse into the metal fan, which then caused a short. A huge flame shot out of the front of the unit and turned the plastic housing black. If I hadn't been sitting there to unplug it immediately who knows what might have happened. This unit has basically never been moved, so the weakness in the support is not due to operator misuse. It is likely a manufacturing and/or design issue.Very poor design. It's cheap for a reason. Don't risk your safety for a few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with latest model","review":"I am really confused. I bought this heater years ago for my office and it worked wonderfully. It was recently stolen so I had to replace it. According to my order history I ordered the exact same model but it seems very different than the one I bought two years ago. The fan looks cheap, is VERY noisy and the unit just does not generate heat the way my original one did. The original one used to actually heat up my entire office with no sound at all. I have to keep this new unit next to me in order to have some luke warm air blown in my direction that does little to heat up the room. This is like those cartoon air conditioners that use a fan to blow air over a giant cube of ice to cool a room.I really miss my old heater!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after one month","review":"This heater worked fine for one month.

It was also super loud. I probably used it fewer than 10 times in total before it just stopped working altogether in October 2012.

I bought two of them and one still works after two seasons. It doesn't snow or get down below 32 often where I live so they aren't worked all that hard. Moderately so I would estimate. First heater had cord that partially melted at the plug (directly in wall no extension cord) I cut off the cheap cord and put a 16 or 14ga outdoor extension cord on it to stop that problem. It worked about a year and then it just stopped working with a strong burning smell. Second one still works and cord doesn't get hot like first one.

In that three weeks, it's been used about 3 times. I used it for a number of hours on the first day that I plugged it up, with much satisfaction, until I turned it over. After doing so, the heater would not restart. I looked through the manual to discover that in order to make it restart, it was necessary to turn off and unplug the heater for 30 min (a long time for a cold natured person in a cold office building). Fortunately, it restarted successfully, that day. Sadly, by my third attempt to use the heater it was done for. The cursed thing would not start and the caution light remained on after performing the restart steps. I'm going to return this item for another Holmes item, as I've been told that they normally produce great personal heaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty little heater","review":"This is a nifty little heater for small spaces.

Yes, it is cheap, and yes, it basically works, but thats about all I can say for this model.It's tiny and plastic. Not made to last long at all.My main disappointment is that it is too light weight. You can almost blow it over as you walk by it. Not substantial at all. Not UL approved or rated. It has already started to melt an extension cord. Glad I spotted that quick. Now I use it only with it's own cord which appears to be fine, but if used for a few hours the cord gets very hot to the touch. I wouldn't dare leave it on unattended.The last space heater I had lasted 15 years and is still going, though probably not much longer.

It's all good reading, but given the brevity of the text, I found myself wishing that Edwards had stayed on task a little more. The pictures are stunning!

I don't feel them at all and they don't jostle around. Perfect for what I bought them for - running. So, I give them 5 stars - couldn't beat the price.I would not suggest using these 'backphones' if you plan on doing any exercises that require you to lay supine with your head against a plinth, or even sitting with your head resting on the back of a chair - not comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backphone with Bass","review":"In wearing these backphones, make sure that bracket connecting the earbuds passes between your upper ear and your head.

The percussion and guitar in particular make certain cues sound more like Hans Zimmer's Media Ventures groupies than the Alan Silvestri I'm used to (not to say that that's a bad thing). However, once the action really gets going, the Silvestri-esque horns, strings and vocals come through in spades, giving us some high-octane themes similar to Mr. Silvestri's other epic projects. This by far is the best commercial Alan Silvestri release since the Mummy Returns, reminding us all why he's one of the best in the business. With a perfect blend of modern percussion, hard-hitting brass, and a variety of ethnic instruments, Silvestri once again displays his versatility with 60 minutes of pulse-pounding action. Whether you liked the movie, didn't like the movie, or never even saw the movie (such as the case with me), you won't be disappointed with Alan Silvestri's latest masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best workout CD ever!","review":"This was an awesome movie with fantastic stunts.

It is loaded with percussion and some beautiful themes. However, for those of you who are dissapointed about the music from the Lab Scene, I know what the story is on that. That music was not composed by Alan Silvestri, it was composed by another film composer by the name of Craig Armstrong. Craig has done scoring for such movies as \\"Kiss Of The Dragon\\" and \\"Plunkett & Mclaine\\". Craig's film scores are rarely ever released and when they are, they are even harder to get a hold of(trust me I know from experience). So unfortunately, as awesome as the TR2 Lab Scene music sounded, it will probably never see the light of day on a CD. I have even tried to find it by using download programs and I was unsuccessful. Although this is a great silvestri film score, for those of us who loved the Lab scene music, we will probably only ever hear it in the movie itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is The Best Soundtrack I Ever Herd!","review":"Im a big fan of Angelina Jolie I love her movies exspecily Tomb Raider And Tomb Raider Cradle Of Life!

It is better to read the story from the perspective of a Clinton-hater than to read a fawning, isn't-Hillary-wonderful story by one of her many admirers."},{"rating":"2","title":"She will be paid no more","review":"Before I read Barbara Olson's very interesting account of the former first lady and current junior Senator from New York, I always thought that Hillary Clinton was a Marxist. Now, I realize that this assessment is not really being fair to Karl Marx. It would be more accurate on further review to describe Ms. Clinton as a Stalinist. Anyhow, the book is fascinating and should be read by all, particularly in light of the fact that Senator Clinton may one day become the first female President of the United States."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required Reading For Any Potential Hillary Supporter","review":"Thank you, Barbara Olson, you left the world a better and wiser place. This book (once I got past Hillary Clinton's childhood and college days) read like a fast paced novel. The research and narrative are excellent. It left me reeling with the realization that Hillary Rodham Clinton is even more ambitious and amoral than her spouse and, probably, a good deal more dangerous. It is inconceivable that anyone who really knows the facts outlined in this book would elect Hillary to any office whatsoever. I sincerely hope that this book will receive the attention it richly deserves. It is important to our future that this woman be stopped. Oh, and by the way, I voted Democrat in the last election...so please do not dismiss this as a bi-partison soapbox review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware....","review":"the cover of this book gives away its flaw. whenever someone writes an \\"i hate whoever\\" book, check out the cover. why would an objective person choose such an unflattering picture? why not show them at their most attractive? why would they immediately want their audience to make the connection that an unattractive person is an evil person? the cover tells you how objective the author is. personally, i don't doubt that the clintons are flawed, just like every other politician. but i can never buy the fact that they are to blame them for everything that ever went wrong in this country, before and after clinton's presidency."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sometimes you just have to read what they say.","review":"A previous review of this book wrote: \\"Some of the things Barbara Olson reveals is Hillary's support for Bobby Seale's Black Panthers Trial to make sure he got a fair deal even though the Panthers justified the rape of white women by black men as a political act of protest against white oppression.\\"In other words, Hillary should be ashamed of herself because she tried to make sure a person on trial got a fair deal. Would the writer of that review have preferred an unfair trial?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this book as a civics lesson","review":"Here's a free speech lesson that should make us proud to be Americans. Mrs. Olson, having investigated the First Lady as an employee of the taxpayers, then uses that research material to attempt to finish the work that her close personal friend Kenneth Starr worked so hard to accomplish: to punish the Clintons.Where else but in America could a government prosecutor with intimate ties to the supreme government prosecutor sell the fruits of her labor for personal profit in an attempt to destroy the popular and duly elected head of the country and his wife?Buy this book. Read it. Tell your children and grandchildren the story of how President and Mrs. Clinton stood up in the face of this kind of vilification, went to work for the American people every day, and were embraced by the majority of the American people.Is this a great country, or what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad she devoted her life to trashing others","review":"Well friends, again we see the right wing approach...bash character, ask questions and verify information later. It is a shame that there are people who devote their life to making others seem terrible and stretching the truth until it spontaneously combusts. As a college student, I have watched the makings of young conservative men and women and to put it mildy, you guys freak me out. Unfortunately for Ms. Olson, this is her last book and the one she will be remembered for. Did she ever talk to Mrs. Clinton, ask for her side? Highly doubtful since this is less a scholarly piece of work, more a right wing attempt at brushing aside the many good things that mostly more than make up for the bad of their tenor.

I was struck at how much Barbara Olsonused concrete examples and didn't rely on heresay, as is the case withmost unauthorized biographies..... I agree. There's a backgroundsadness about Hillary exposed in this book that I hadn't thought ofbefore:imagine having to displace your genuine anger at a mate likeBill Clinton onto substitute males like Newt Gingrinch and KenStarr. For such an intellectually trained mind such as Hillary'ssurely she must suffer from cognitive dissonance most of the time! Theuntold story in the book is how the constitutional limits on power ofany one individual in our government(not least an unelected FirstLady)are thwarted at every turn. Perhaps Hillary was the \\"fallguy\\" for Bill in the failed health care reform fiasco? She wasblamed and not he.....not a bad outcome for HIM!

However, if you are interested in an unbiased account of the now Senator and former First Lady, then this book will be a sore disappointment.While even the most staunch Clinton-supporter will be forced to admit that the couple are not perfect, and that they have made mistakes, this book refuses to admit even the smallest triumphs into its pages. FYI, he was well liked enough to be re-elected.The next time I want to read writing of this caliber, I will turn to the pages of the National Enquirer for the latest news. Anyone with a diserning mind will see this for what it is, another chance to mud-sling and pander to the lowest common denomonator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puzzling","review":"David Brock, a self-acknowledged liar, provides much of the \\"evidence\\" against Hillary Clinton. It is implied that because Hillary had a friend who was a Stalinist, she must be one too. The case against Mrs. Clinton is built on such arguments. This book didn't make any sense to me at all and left me with a feeling of distaste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"More contemptable garbage from the likes of another extreme Conservative. The majority of the book doesn't even contain facts. It reads more like a trashy magazine with the same amount of false allegations that themselves amount to nothing.

However, if you are a thinking, fair minded person, save your money, you may need it before the current president is done with us."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Facts, Just Opinions.....","review":"Everyone has an opinion. You will get a full dose of Barbara Olson's opinions here. She seemed to do a lot of research, but the trouble is...she did not feel confident in the reader's ability to interpret. Her prejudices against the Clintons are loud and clear. The bitter resentment boiling within this author from working on a failed impeachment is apparent. I am no fan of Hillary or Bill Clinton, but feel that a chronicle such as this serves no one if not objectively presented. The only thing gleaned from this book by this reader is: Barbara Olson hated Hillary Clinton."},{"rating":"2","title":"would you buy a used car from this woman?","review":"Clearly the mastermind behind Bill Clinton's rise to power, this book is a testament to Ms Clinton's intelligence and ambition. Unfortunately, the Clinton legacy will surely be viewed by presidential historians as tarnished by the same corruption, abuse of power and hypocracy that enabled him to be elected in the first place - due, in large part, to Hillary Rodham-Clinton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Political Psychodrama","review":"A properly iconoclastic (image-breaking) work offering the truth about Hillary Rodham Clinton. Take away the photo-op visage of William Jefferson Clinton; he is a mere facade, and you are left with Hillary's guts, brains and unforgiving determination; the innards of the Clinton presidency. Here lies the power. In Hillary; not Bill.Barbara Olson explains the psychological development of Hillary's socio-political game plan, her manipulation of the American legal system and her above-the-law attitude.Everyone in New York state should be assigned this book as required reading before the 2000 elections."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read for All New Yorkers","review":"For all you people who think the Clintons are nice people, read this book. The most corrupt politicians ever to get to the White House.They need to be stopped from any further political ambitions. We certainly don't want President Hillary. Thanks Barbara, excellent book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor source of information","review":"I was disappointed in Olson's research. Much of the information included was later found to be false. I could go on to say the book is biased, but that is made obvious merely by examining Olson's own political believes. My review is biased too, and I am likely revealing my own beliefs, but I am not a journalist or a professional writer by any means. I rely on journalists to give me valid and confirmed information. Spreading rumors as facts not only puts her in the same camp with the tabloids, but increasingly the same camp as many in the popular media. Of course, she's had months to confirm her facts and hasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like the Author's \\"Star\\" magazine approach","review":"First of all, I couldn't shake the feeling while reading this book that I was the teacher in a class and Barbara Olson was pointing at Hillary Clinton saying, \\"she did this and this and this.\\" Also, it doesn't set well with me that Ms. Olson is trying to make a mint on a \\"Star\\" magazine type books with sordid details of someone else's life...I got it from the library.About the book. It doesn't seem to me that Hillary Clinton is different from hundreds of other politicians who have sought power. There will be plenty here to upset you if you dislike her and reasons to write hate mail if you want HC to be president. There is definitely enough details to keep you entertained, but frankly I wouldn't give my money to this women."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda- or worse!","review":"It is really sad that the late Barbara Olson will be remembered not just as an innocent victim of September 11th's terrorist attack, but for her extreme hatred of Hillary Clinton, that spilled over into a dreck of a book, \\"Hell to Pay\\". I am sure she was a very nice person while she walked this world, but judging by \\"Hell to Pay\\", she seemed a very spite-filled person, convinced that Hillary and Bill were Marxist insurgents bent on turning the USA into Soviet Amerika, and only by stalwart compassionate conservatism could the Marxist threat be eradicated(with ample firepower and bloodshed). It is one thing to dislike someone based on their politics, but to smear them with outdated rhetoric and accuse them of treason is quite another."},{"rating":"1","title":"I too am a former Clinton believer","review":"Although I have become very disillusioned by the whole Clinton administration (including Hillary herself), I found this book to be obviously bias . . .too bias, in fact, to make any credible case against the first lady. Even the cover photograph (one of the more unflattering I have ever seen of Hillary) seems as if it were clearly meant to skew her image in a very tabloid way.I found sifting through the material to uncover any real information to be tedious.I am no fan of the Clintons, but I do like my information presented in a less prejudicial light. Although I can appreciate someone first hand account or educated judgment of certain events, I still would like to maintain some freedom in drawing my own conclusions. Ms. Olson's book doesn't allow for much reader freedom.Unless you want a spoon fed account of Hillary from the far right, I wouldn't recommend wasting your time on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad Legacy To Leave","review":"I read this book, or should I say that I tried to read this book. I did take into account that Ms. Olsen has a personal agenda but this does not excuse the flimsy reporting and sources that she used.Let's be realistic and understand that the author has her own agenda. She seems overly obsessed by Hillary Clinton, almost dumbstruck that Mrs. Clinton is actually a living, breathing human being that has somehow managed to become a Senator.While conservatives will likely applaud this book as it is another link in the long \\"let's blame the Clinton's for everything chain\\" I find it a sad legacy to leave. Such hate filled anger is not insightful, just childish and petty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tabloid-style writing","review":"I found this to be a disappointingly shallow and thoroughly unconvincing book. Much of it is based on bizarre imputations and long-discredited information from shady and disreputable sources. I found the analysis to be viscerally biased and illogical. For example, much of the first chapter is dedicated to implying that there is something sinister about Hillary's \\"ambition,\\" as though a brilliant, idealistic, dedicated woman like Hillary has no right to wish to actualize her monumental talents. Emotionally loaded and negative words such as \\"hardened operator\\" are used to describe qualities that I see as positive; for example, an ability to remain focused and unbowed in the face of adversity. And then there is the rather odd claim that Hillary has merely \\"persuaded herself\\" that she is \\"spiritual.\\" It carries on in like vein and becomes increasingly tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belongs with the Tabloids at the check out stand","review":"This book is the type of ...[stuff] that is usually reserved for grocery check out stands. As my mother said \\"If you don't have anything nice to say about someone, then don't say anything at all.\\" If only Ms. Olson had the same social manners and held back with her poison pen. The book is catty at a high school level and leaves one wondering what Ms. Olson was truly motivated by to write such hateful words. If you must read this... buy it second hand or better yet, get this one from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoid","review":"This is a silly book that feeds into the ridiculous conspiracy theories that surround the Clintons. Bill was a good president and a rotten husband. Hillary's loyalty to Bill is (probably) a mix of love and ambition. But she's served our country well as Senator and Secretary of State. That's enough for me, but not enough for the haters."},{"rating":"2","title":"The devastating truth about Ms. Clinton, by fermed","review":"A clinical look at a neurotic, evil person. Carefully written and excellently documented, the book reveals a vulgar and humorless individual with zero insight who actually believes herself to be a beneficial political force. Contrary to all the evidence, she sees herself as caring, full of concern for others, and decent.New Yorkers should take notice and vote to stunt any further growth of this virus on the body politic. Those from New York who have commented here have certainly not been fooled by Ms. Clinton: of the 127 reviews posted before mine, 13 have come from New Yorkers. Of these, 4 have been negative and dismissed the book as \\"lies.\\" They therefore rated it with one star. But nine blessed it and gave it 4 (1) or 5 (8) stars. Let us hope that the wisdom of this distribution holds in the November ballot, as it surely will if lots of New Yorkers read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewers: Get Your Facts Straight","review":"The readers of Barbara Olson's book should do their research before posting a review to Amazon.com. While Barbara Olson tragically died as a passenger on American Airlines Flight 77, one of the hijacked planes that crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11, 2001, her husband is still very much alive and is the 42nd Solicitor General of the United States. He was nominated by President Bush on February 14, 2001, confirmed by the United States Senate, and took the oath of office on June 11, 2001. He did not perish on American Airlines Flight 77.Get your facts straight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Afraid America, be very afraid","review":"All Republics last about 200 years.

Is it simple coincidence that many reviewers didn't know much of what Olson exposes to the light of day? I hardly think so. As for one reviewer's echo of Hillary Clinton's claim that a \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" tried to bring down her husband - he seems to have a done a thorough job of that himself. Indeed, if any conspiracy were in place, why was Hillary elected to the Senate? Enough said there, I think. The book is a must-read for anyone who wants to know what the Clintons obviously never intended ANYONE to find out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who Can Accept The Truth","review":"Barbara Olsen puts into chronological order things most of us have read over the past eight years. She does so beautifully without preaching. As a lawyer she gives you a more than clear-cut view of one of the most self-centered, sociopath and dangerous women of the 20-21st century. The moniker of brilliant has been given to Hillary. I maintain she is a cunning survivor, much like a hunter and she is very hungry.

She does well known standards (Blue Moon), novelty songs (Mama Look A Boo Boo) and her work on stage with tunes from her Broadway appearances.

Another gay man writing a book about a beloved star with nothing but his emotions to take us through the tale. I wanted to read about Judy Garland. What I got was how Al DiOrio felt about Judy Garland. At least he felt (and feels) about her kindly.The writing of this tome is atrocious. \\"In September\\" she did this. \\"In October\\" she did that. \\"In November\\" she did something else. \\"In December\\" she did something else yet again.This is nothing more than a tribute from a fan.

I grew up in DC and remember that time. Nixon was vilified and demonized. My lasting image of him is one of a discredited, corrupt, and dishonest opportunist. Reading the transcripts, though, caused me to adjust that view somewhat. I think RN was truly surprised at the attention given to a little burglary in Foggy Bottom.In the same way that Clinton is being called to the carpet for doing things that Kennedy got away with, Nixon was a victim of poor timing. I think that, before 1974, \\"dirty tricks\\" were commonplace and pretty much accepted by the players as part of doing business. That changed after Watergate. Relevant to our own times, sexual infidelity was common knowlege but went unreported, until Gary Hart. Today, politicians must be clean, AND true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated rehash of the Nixon tapes; poorly edited","review":"Stanley Kutler's rehash suffers from poor editing.

Kutler has made a minor profession of studying Nixon's downfall, but he can't even get right the name of the case that Richard Nixon personally argued in the U.S. Supreme Court, a case to which Nixon alludes in one of the recorded conversations contained in this book. That is only one example among many. The reason why these transcripts are so lacking, at least in part, is owing to the use by Kutler of commercial Court Reporters, not scholars. Kutler admits to the use of such novices in his introduction.

A must read for anyone concerned that the words spoken in the pulpit today may have to be dined upon tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fails the Test, .... but Creative","review":"This book is for you if you are willing to accept the position of \\"creative\\" biblical interpretation. The format is exposition of the author's thesis using case studies. The case studies are designed to convince the reader that traditional interpretation approach is incapable of \\"seeing\\" beyond the literal concepts into the \\"true\\" and liberating meaning. The author's selection of substantiating cases are seriously flawed as references are admitadly drawn only from bible commentors from the 1950's on. The book appears to be apologetic for justification of women as pastors and preachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Sound","review":"I've owned this shelf system for over 5 years.

This is a thoroughly enjoyable picture book that speaks to one of the most simple pleasures of the universal imagination: flying! Delightfully told through a \\"secret\\" (now, truly, who does not love a secret?!) that goes from one whimsically illustrated creature to another, and ending with a celebration of friendship over a nice, warm bowl of homemade soup, this is simply a poetic, feel-good book.

The wires are also very thin and I've had no bounce-outs yet (approx 1000 throws).The minus 1 star comes from the in-excusable mounting screws that come with the board. DO NOT attempt to mount the board with the provided hardware. The good part is that it comes with 2 different sets of mounting parts, so you have some options. The bad part is that neither set has the correct screws. If you try to use the provided screws, you will find that the screw heads/caps interfere with the fit; i.e. you wont be able to mount the board after you've screwed in all the screws.

Bottom diameter is 57-58mm as close as I can measure it. Best deal I could find on a good quality tamper at a reasonable price. Bottom is heavy 18/8 stainless steel. However I was surprised that the acrylic handle can be unscrewed and separates so that you have 3 separate pieces: Steel bottom, acrylic handle, and acrylic ring which fits like a sleeve at the base. Don't know how durable this type construction will be in the long run. Also makes me not want to wash it with soap and water, because I'll have to disassemble it after to let any water that penetrates dry out. So instead I just wipe it off after use.

Sadly, I haven't read past number three (I can't find them in Australia!), but from what I have read, this book was an essential starting point. It had many new, interesting characters introduced-- namely Qorl, the crashed Tie-fighter pilot-- and it combined humour, and action well. The reason I only gave it a four star rating was because I personally thought that after this, the Young Jedi Knights series just got better. A great read for anyone who wants to know more about the Solo twins."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD BOOK","review":"Heirs of the Force continues the adventures of Han Solo and Princess Leia Organa Solo's children to become Jedi Knights.

It really gives you lots of information for each character, so you can get to know them. That is mostly what I like about this book.

Key characters and factors in the overall arc are introduced, yet the premise on which they were presented, an Imperial TIE pilot who crashed during the second (known) battle of Yavin is somewhat spotty. The other factor which caused me to rate the book as I did was that was meant for younger readers. If only this had been an adult novel, and Kevin and Rebecca were writing to their full capacity, it had potential of being good. I don't mean to attack young adult books, but I read the Thrawn Trilogy when it debuted in 1991. I was only 8 then.

I didn't read this author's first novel, but when that heroine, Lily's sister, Lauren, enters the book, she is horrid. She constantly thinks her husband is cheating (after apparently at least 4 years of marriage), to the point where she's left him and rushed to London within days of giving birth. Lily's love interest is even more idiotic than she, if possible, and their romance inutterably boring.Every character in this book is superficial and dull.

I like RINGO and would give the original 10-song vinyl release (1973) three stars. But now with the CD additions of the single \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" and two fun b-sides, RINGO merits four stars. Along with TIME TAKES TIME and VERTICAL MAN, the CD of RINGO offers the best music Ringo Starr has made these past 30 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inconsistent, but some real gems here","review":"I agree that this is Ringo's best solo album. With John helping on one track, Paul helping on another (actually providing their own compositions), George helping on much of it (and providing one of his own songs along with co-writing \\"Photograph\\"), it's as close to a Beatles reunion album we have prior to the two new tracks on Anthology. In fact, the line up on John's song, \\"I'm the Greatest,\\" is the Beatles with Billy Preston and Klaus Voorman subbing for Paul on Bass. And for McCartney fans, I really think \\"Six O'Clock\\" is one of his better compositions from this period (though the heavy synth arrangments are a bit dated, the melody still kills). The one question I have about this digital release is: why did they change the name ofthe second track, \\"Hold On\\" to \\"Have You Seen My Baby\\"? Curious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ringo's Best","review":"Ringo may be quite ordinary as an artist, but the chemistry was right there for this one.

I view George Harrison as attaining songwriter status on a par with Lennon or McCartney by 1969, with Ringo soon taking up George's former niche songwriting-wise. Although Ringo's star would fade by 1975, for those still tuning in he made a stellar comeback in the 1990s and the \`00 decade, contributing more than his share to any latter-day \`best of the solo Beatles' album-sets you might want to make. A tree is best measured when cut down. Ringo lay down for most of the 1980s, but then sprang to his feet in heroic fashion. Bravo Ringo. And that voice!

Delta is squandering their good name with products like this. The casting are rough throughout. The pulleys are unbalanced, the drive belts are stiff. The idler pully shaft and the shafts used as part of the belt tensioning system ride in holes drilled in the head casting. No bushings are used and the play can be measured in fractions of inches. As you apply tension to the belts, the motor shifts upward causing the drive belt to skew upward. The poor build results in a lot of vibration especially at higher speeds. The laser adjustments are poorly designed and the beam width at working distances are too thick for precise hole designation. I haven't measured runout because I wouldn't bother using this drill on any precision work. The best I can say for this drill press is that it will drill a hole. I wouldn't expect it to last for long however."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good solid drill press","review":"A well built drill press solid enough for accurate work.The assembly manual states that unless the stand if fastened to the floor, an auxiliary stand of 3/4 plywood is necessary.

I put thin strips around part of the edge to slip a dolly under it in case I want to move it.

The head was not milled correctly for the post. It was seated only after dry ice and other means of persuasion and about a week of messing around. The table was not milled correctly. I could not drill a vertical hole until I hand ground the casting on the front-to-back table set/stop. The adjustment screw handles all broke in the first week and now I have 'dog bones' hanging everywhere. One of the lasers puts out a very fuzzy beam making 'spot-on' impossible.

It drives my Sony 7506 phones with ease.The sensitivity is very good on both AM and FM. Batteries last forever. It's really an amazing deal for this price.

However I made the mistake of listening to it at work - the FM sounds so good, I sent back the Sennheiser noise-cancelling phones my company provides, and use the SRF-59 instead, to drown out all the sounds of co-workers yelling into their phones, coughing, sneezing, singing at their desks, etc. So... I will probably buy another SRF-59 for use in the outdoors. Physically, the radio looks and feels solid - I guess time will tell. Shortcomings? More difficult to tune than a digital rig, but that's a given on a small analog radio. Also the belt-clip thingy is awkward to use.

It does not lose it signal when I turn different directions or go downstairs into my basement. The on/off button is rather small on the from of the walkman but it has a nice click when you turn it either way. I would have rated it five stars if it wasn't for the headset. It is hard to adjust properly to your ears and therefore you have a tendency to pick up outside noises. If you have a headset that you like to wear and it will fit the walkman jack, I recommend you change to that one and keep the Sony headset as a backup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Radio","review":"Works great!

With the channel drift, I have to fiddle with the dial all the time to get back to my station, which is not easy to do with this particular dial... I ended up throw mines away.

The headphones do work passably well but for the same setting give much less volume than any other headphones I have tried for comparison. In short this is not the Sony Walkman of old - and newer is not better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok, but analog tuning is a pain","review":"I've used this radio for a while now, and I've concluded that it's not very usable. The problem with it is the tuning dial. It's tiny! Everytime I want to tune in a station it takes ages to try to get it tuned properly. If your use is always to tune in one of the 4 or 5 most prominent stations on the dial, then this will work fine. If not, I strongly suggest getting something with a digital tuner. It isn't that much more expensive and will save you endless headaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"News Talk Junkies","review":"I bought this radio to listen to AM news talk. It's light/compact and runs on one AA battery. I use ear buds, so the FM reception may not be as good as using with headphones, but my AM reception is great. I live 30 miles from town in the woods and it picks up stations I've never heard. It's fun to listen to find out where the station is broadcasting from. Tuning is very sensitive but you get used to it. You can't beat it, especially at this price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony SRF-59 FM/AM Radio Walkman","review":"I bought this Sony radio to replace a Jwin brand portable radio. The Sony has terrible reception. I use it while walking in the neighborhood and the FM station goes in and out with a lot of static. I expected the Sony to be superior to the Jwin, but it's not. The Jwin's problem was a bad ear bud, and when it was replaced, it works great. I walk the same neighborhood route with no loss of reception."},{"rating":"1","title":"difficult dialing","review":"Unlike most of the reviews which were positive which caused me to purchasse the radio I completely disliked the product. it is nearly impossible to dial and pick up most stations. Since the dial is so small you need pinpoint accuracy. Yes, the quality of sound is very good, but I am throwing out this unit, and buying something else !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The simplest solution is often the best solution","review":"This is the best radio walkman Sony makes. The battery lasts 10x longer than the digital one and it's made better. The digital one has a flimsy volume control that broke after a week.

I've had this kind for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rdio","review":"This is a great little radio.....gets very good reception.....I use this at football games, and it works out very well, even when all the yelling and cheering are going on.

GREAT value for the price......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great radio for its purpose","review":"I got this radio for Christmas last year and use it on my daily 3 mile walk. The earphones sound fine and are comfortable. I replaced the battery after 6 months to ensure it wouldn't go dead while in use. At over 25 hours of use per month, that was over 150 hours on one battery. The analog tuner is great. I placed it in local, tuned in my station then switched to DX & it's never lost the station. Love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pulls 'em in.","review":"Came down to Sony and Panny and the Sony won b/c of its ferrite antenna. Tested as soon as it came in and was impressedd.

It's true; it gets stations that I couldn't listen to with my more-expensive digital portable radio. The only drawback is you can't program in your favorite stations, obviously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Distance Reception","review":"The Sony SRF 59 has incredible long distance reception for such a small device. I live in North Jersey and have no trouble listening to clear AM reception from Toronto, Canada, Detroit, Chicago, Nashville, or St Louis. I am on my second one and recently brought three more just to have as spares in case they ever stop making this radio. It is truly the best portable, one-battery, high - reception radio there is. It is hard to even find a small AM-FM unit with a rotary tuner (most are digital) which is essentail for fine tuning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was the worst headset/radio that I've ever bought.

What reception?","review":"I bought this item because of all the other reviews. I don't know where the other customers are using their radio, but here in So. Calif (L.A. area) this radio does NOT pick up or stay tuned to stations. Since it's digital, when it loses a station, you get a LOUD blast of static/white noise. Went back to using the good old fashion analog radio with a real antena."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Piece of Plastic","review":"I'm so surprised reading all the positive reviews on this product! It's cheap plastic, and can't hold a station, and that's about where it begins and ends for me. I can't get good reception on this radio, and because it's a dial, if you do luck out and lock in on a station, if you put the thing in your pocket, it's super easy to accidentally hit the tuner dial and lose your station. The headphones are big and cumbersome, and the battery life is mediocre at best. I really have nothing good to say about this little radio. It's not even that small. Even at the low price point it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get AM reception in tall downtown building","review":"I bought this small AM/FM radio to listen to the local baseball game when at work and on the bus. But when I recieved the product the AM stations would not come in when I was downtown on the 5th floor of a skyscraper.I have no idea why this radio will get signal at my house 15 miles from downtown, but once I am downtown it has nothing coming in. I am thinking about returning this and getting something more powerful.After a few more days: This radio has almost no power, it constantly fades in and out and doesn't hold a strong signal on fm and am is barely their at all if you are lucky. It also picks up a lot of other interference from Bus engines and computers that it is located by.Please listen and do not buy this product, you will be just as sad as me :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good option","review":"I got this item for someone in the family that wanted one as a christmas gift.

We used to take little radios to the swimming pool as a kid and could run them a week or so on a 9v battery. But good luck finding one! If you do ... reply to my post here and tell me where!This is comfortable, clear sound but not outstanding. But what it offers is a radio when the ELECTRICITY IS OFF! Yeah, when the power goes off in an ice storm or summer wind/rain storm. My quadrants of a neighborhood in Richmond, VA is one of the first to go off andf the last to come back on in power outages. So I accept it and keep charged and/or crankable LED lights, oil lamps, propane logs for cold weather outages.tip: keep plenty of re-charged batteries for the radio and a pack of the correct size in alkaline type as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consider This a 30 Year Review","review":"I had a Sony am/fm Walkman for 30 years. It was still working perfecly at the time it was stolen and it was used every day during dog walks. I bought this SRF-59 as a replacement because it looked very similar to the one I had for 30 years. When it came, I was shocked to find out it was the EXACT same design. I guess if something works well, why discountinue it. I thought about moving up to a digital walkman but battery life decided. This one gets 150 hours on one AA battery as did my old one. The digital version only gets about 50 hours. That is a huge difference. If you are looking for something simple and reliable that has been proven to work well long term, you cannot go wrong with this one. It is inexpensive, has really good sensitivity on both am and fm. The headset is a nice bonus as well. I hope this one lasts another 30 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reception inferior to my ipod","review":"I am disappointed with the reception of this radio. I bought it so that I wouldn't have to use my expensive ipod as a simple FM radio, but after only a day I can see that I need to revert to the ipod. The station right here in town that my ipod picks up perfectly is mildly distorted, and it lost completely when I head over the mountain. The ipod never loses the signal. Bummer, as I bought this based on all the good reviews of its reception, but sadly my experience is quite the opposite.I'm still going to keep it for baseball games and maybe camping or beach days, but basically it doesn't perform it's sole function very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything I expected","review":"This walkman was everything I expected, highly portable, with many options, clear signal, AM/FM, and high quality headphones. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glowing reviews are justified","review":"If you're looking for radio that is independent of the Internet ie solely battery powered, this is a great choice. Sound is good even with the headphones that accompany the radio but would obviously be enhanced by better quality. Excellent value."},{"rating":"2","title":"AM \\"memory\\"","review":"This little radio, even with the chintzy headphones, is worth the price. One thing about the beauties of analog tuning- if you leave and re-tune an AM station, you will increasingly get it better. Radios left on one station will gradually develop a memory and keep getting the signal stronger.This applies to everything from ancient garage-sale bought GEs or RCA Super radios(both Thompsons)to Sangean ccradios, so you go from $5 to $200Don't complain about mild annoyances, 10 $15 radios are worth experimenting with over one $150 model, which will turn into a disappointment. It takes a Sangean a year with its digital tuning to get the memory you have in a month with analog, and by then the digital read-out is dead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still a deal","review":"With all the Ipods there is still a need for the Walkman.

However, this Sony does a great job of picking up my favorite AM stations.5) Wonderful stereo sound on FM stations and the Sony headphone has a good sound to it. However, while walking I carry my iPod type of headphones and the sound is just superb using them.6) Uses just one AA battery and it is said to last about 30 hours of listening or more.7) Small size, small enough for a pocket or purse with ease.CONS:1) No digital settings for the stations, however, it is easy to change the stations.2) The belt clip is rather tight, but this is so it will not easily come off."},{"rating":"2","title":"walkman","review":"great little radio with clear signals and no static.

For $14.99, it's definitely worth the price. The reception in the Chicagoland area is decent with minor static here and there. It's light and uses a single AA battery. I've used the walkman for the past 3 weeks for about 2-3 hrs 5 days a week and am still on the 1st battery. If you like to switch stations often, this is not for you if you don't want to manually find them; there are no presets. The headphones do stink.

I can't accurately evaluate the tonal quality or the radio itself or the supplied Sony headphones, because my ears are 78 years old (along with the rest of me) and my high frequency end response is shot at least in part because of some time spent in noisy environments. My only criticism of this product is that the tuning is a bit \\"stiff\\". But its performance makes up for that! It's worth the price - hell, it's worth two or three times the price! Get one! You can't go wrong! (I do NOT own stock in Sony!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"It was cheap.","review":"It was cheap and it didn't get the stations in well.

I'm not going to give it five stars simply because there are other products out there that are of much better quality and advanced technology than this one. Nevertheless, it is easy to use, it serves its purpose AND it can last you a long time. The last one my grandmother had was about 8 years old more or less. So yes, if you are looking for an easy to use walkman, I would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony Walkman Stereo Radio (Purchased at Amazon)","review":"Ah, I must be getting old or something. I remember when a Sony Walkman had a little heft to it and was bullet proof! This one is not as impressive at the old ones were (translation: it looks cheap). But, the good news is it's very light and portable (isn't that the reason we're buying it?). Great for walks around the block, or hiking.The sound quality is excellent. The highs are crisp, and the bass is great. It can pull FM stations in very well; even the AM ones seem to come in pretty easily. It's got the old style analog dial, and I like that feature. Still, it's very easy to accidentally change stations if you put it in your pocket. I'm thinking I never had that problem with digital radios.If you're looking for an inexpensive but good-sounding AM/FM radio, I think you can't go wrong for the price.

Analog tuning very easy despite the technology. Single alkaline AA cell estimated by Sony to last 140 hours on AM. No \\"soft\\" on-off switch, a plus to prevent accidental power-up. Battery compartment hatch is attached by hinges and snaps shut securely, so it won't just pop open if jostled nor get lost. Note: lack of speaker is also a plus; a speaker on a radio this small would be next to useless, as it is the case with the Radio Shack Optimus (cat. no. 12-610), another analog AM/FM pocket radio just slightly smaller than the SRF-59."},{"rating":"2","title":"am fm walkman","review":"item is lightweight so if dropped, may be a problem. reception is excellent for when i walk. belt clip is a little difficult to use but overall a good value"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!!","review":"I purchased this \\"walkman\\" a few days ago I was so excited about having a device to hear the local news and the religious programs on the AM stations.

No amount of fine-tuning can correct this. I tried at least 3 different pairs of headphones (it uses the headphone cable as an antenna) and saw no improvement in reception.

While the novel is relatively short, the principle character, Bryan Stykes, is well developed, and I was delighted to learn that Wegusen is already working on his second novel featuring the same character.While the writing style is not the most sophisticated, it is clear and doesn't get in the way of the story's plot.

There was very little about the alien presence at that point and too much dwelling on how miserable everyone in the area was. It appeared that the alien presence was taking over people.

The character's were hard to follow because there were so many and so much bouncing around. I didn't connect with any of them on an intimate level. There were times that I would have to back track because I got so bored reading that I paid no attention to what I read. There were grammar errors throughout the book and it was so cheezy that I was at times embarrassed I was reading it.I'm halfway through the book now and will not be finishing it.

This is a writer you'll want to stay with for a long time to see what happens next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just awful.","review":"This book was incredibly boring. And repetitive. And boring. And repetitive. The only reason I finished it is because I always make myself finish books that I start, no matter how bad they are. It seemed like nothing happened in the entire story until the very end...and then it wasn't even exciting. I found myself skimming the last few chapters just so I could finish it and read something else. In fact, I'm not too sure how everything was resolved at the end because I was reading so fast. And you know what? I didn't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harvesting terror...aliens land in freakin' Appalachia","review":"For a few characters in Scott Nicholson's newly released book 'The Harvest,' a quart of moonshine may be necessary to make the alien orifice probes go down a lot smoother, but readers won't need any corn lick'er to make 'em keep reading this horrific tale.Set in a remote area of the mountains of North Carolina, an alienbeing lands on top of a ridge and has the local Appalachio-American population runnin' amuck with fear.Nicholson brandishes a green crayon to vividly color the characters and makes sure to throw in some good old fashioned trailer trash sex for good measure.Nicholson continues his tradition of excellent storytelling. No disappointments here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ROUGH HARVEST","review":"This novel is so achingly bad that I had to finish it just to see how bad it could get. Other than a few nice touches here and there, this novel is full of derivative characters; derivative plot; a ton of horror movie cliches; and no sense of how to maintain suspense. Nicholson takes so much time in overexposing his characters that you just want him to get to the good stuff. The religious overtones are so zealously drawn that they are all religious fanatics, especially Bill and Nettie. My God, people, this is the 21st century; nobody, even religious zealots, are this clueless. Bill's over the top finale with the demented and \\"converted\\" Armfield Blevins is a real hoot! You end up caring very little about the characters, and even the ones you do, it's a minimalist's delight!If you really like dumb, insignificant novels, this should top your list for Halloween. Yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho-Hum","review":"I picked this book up on a free Kindle offer and I'm glad for the price. I made it 27% through before calling it quits. The author does do well with descriptions of locations and characters, but to me, they came across as animated stereotypes--nothing too unique or interesting to any of them. And, there were so many of them. I like King and Koontz, but didn't find that quality of work here.

It had the shell of the action, but too much wasn't even explained properly (\\"Wait, did he die or what? What happened to the girl?\\")- The final discussion on the alien seemed to sum up in a way that seemed to hint that the entire story was irrelevant, which is a weird way to leave it. I felt, oddly, like I was being told outright *by the author* that I wasted my time reading this book.Maybe worth a read if you absolutely love Stephen King, but otherwise I would give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"This book is annoyingly cliche, characters are stereotypical, plot is recycled and inferior to the more original iterations.

Scenes move slowly forward with predictability and very little atmosphere. Scares? There really isn't any. Just a bunch of overly descriptive scenes of gore. The repetitive actions of the creatures got old very quickly. I didn't really care about the cardboard characters and knew the ending a hundred pages before it was over.

For the pure mathematician, it depends. Some might enjoy it for its readability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be renamed Complex Analysis for Engineers","review":"If you are engineering student, then you're going to love this book to death. If you are interested in pure mathematics, on the otherhand, then do not waste your time here. This book promotes absolutely no rigor whatsoever. I'm using this textbook for my complex analysis course right now, and I must say that this book is beyond boring. I have to force myself to read the book mainly to keep up with my class. I feel that doing rigorous mathematics gives the reader a sense of freedom and that they are free to do things they never thought was possible in the mathematical world. This book, on the otherhand, forces the reader to pretend like they are doing calculus I work. Been there, done that, time to move on.Bottomline: Avoid this book if you love pure mathematics(if you have to use it for a complex analysis course, then pick up a supplmentary theoretical text that lets you enjoy the subject)."},{"rating":"1","title":"ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS","review":"This movie will not teach you a thing about avalanche saftey, it will show you a lot of avalanches, snowboarding, skiing, and idiots telling their stories about how they barely survived because they didnt bother to do any checking before they took off.

I don't like the message to teenage girls that if you don't have a boyfriend or are not dating, you must be some kind of weird outcast or miserable.

This book is about the traits and characteristics of entrepreneurs who became millionaires.This book discusses eight principles (passion, goals, going beyond your comfort zone and taking risks, belief, challenge yourself,learn from your mistakes, etc.)Check this book out from your local library if you want.

I am extremely disappointed in the product description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fun, VCD, missing \\"Status Quo\\" song","review":"All songs come with both original vocals and in instrumental karaoke versions. Some instrumental karaoke songs have backup vocals. The \\"Bop to the Top\\" instrumental version has some lead vocals interspersed through the song as well, which is a little weird, but you get used to it.This is a Video CD (VCD), not a DVD, which means you need a DVD player that can play the VCD format to see it on your TV screen. The lyrics graphics aren't great, but they work just fine for the most part. Occasionally they get a little jumbled, but nothing that you can't sing around. The lyrics are also in the album booklet, but that is a little hard to follow with the small print and the duets.The CD is missing one song, \\"Stick to the Status Quo.\\" I would have given it 5 stars otherwise.

She had no nanny/nursery nurse qualifications - these take two years (minimum) to obtain here in England and Diana was not even sufficiently academically qualified to be accepted on to such a course. Consequently no reputable agency would ever have placed her as a nanny.The aura of her as a devoted childcare worker was the invention of the press. All those pictures of her in a nursery with children lead many to believe that she was a nursery nurse - she was not. She was briefly a nursery assistant - employed to do the unskilled jobs under supervision (it would have been illegal to have her work unsupervised in a nursery)She may have been a very nice person (I cannot tell since I never met her) but a nanny she was not.Don't be deceived, potential readers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Diana I thought she would be!","review":"I was so excited when I heard about Mary Robertson's book on Princess Diana. I have been an admirer of Diana's since she began dating Prince Charles. I have many books on Princess Diana in my personal library and this one fits on the shelf nicely. Mrs. Robertson shows the public a kind and caring young woman who simply loved to work with children. The author shows us Diana as an innocent and unfazed teenager. I was very happy to hear that Diana and Mrs. Robertson stayed in touch for so many years and that Diana also thought about Patrick even after her own children were born. The media has made Diana out to be many things but Mrs. Robertson shows the world that Diana was truly one of us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I have a large library of books about Diana, Princess of Wales, but this book does not tell any reader anything new or significant about the Princess.

I personally found it rather boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy, smarmy and heartbreaking.","review":"I wouldn't have bought this book, I received it as a gift. The heartbreaking part of this story is the way the Princess was betrayed and exploited. The authors claim that she wrote the book to \\"balance\\" the \\"critical\\" press of Diana is utter rot. Mrs. Roberson saw for herself the depth of love and affection the world felt for the Princess. Mary Robertson was so lucky to know Diana. Diana showed her nothing but kindness and showered her with opportunity. In exchange Mary Robertson cashes in by revealing every small detail of her aquaintenship. One can imagine how dissapointed the Princess whould have been to know that even a few conversations, letters and Christmas cards would become fodder for a book. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smug, opportunistic drivel.","review":"What a perfectly awful little book -- surely the Diana portrayed within its pages would have loathed it!Written by a self-absorbed, rather strident American woman determined to get her fifteen minutes of fame by exploiting a very modest connexion with the late Princess of Wales."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Diana's fans !","review":"Very good book!Point of view from a woman who knew Diana before she became Princess of Wales.

A must read for any fan of Diana. It was nice to hear from someone who knew her before she became a Princess known to the world.

It seems like every new album demonstrates their continued growth as song writers and musicians. It's a crime that the album \\"Shootout\\" didn't generate some real national attention for the band. If you don't own Shootout, get it.Later Days does not have the cohesiveness of Shootout, but it does contain some real gems. \\"Stunt Double\\" and \\"Play it on the Strings\\" to name just a couple.After enjoying their live shows through the better part of the 90's.

With their blend of Country, Rock, and Bluegrass, these guys are like a time bomb waiting to explode. I've been following them and seeing them perform since the early '90's up in Chico, CA. The growth that they've made as a band is incredible. They definitely took a step of faith with this album, producing it on their own label. Like everything else these guys do, it works and works well. Tired Wings and Gold Plated are almost always on the set lists at shows. With the addition of their not so new drummer(not new anymore), their sound has evolved yet once again. Their previous three releases are all very unique and if I may dare say, even better than Later Days. Their new one is coming out late February and it WILL be great. If you ever get a chance to see them live, TAKE IT. The energy and presence they create on stage is electric and contagious.

This cookbook contains a lot of information about baking but few recipes that I found useful. The first 25 or so pages are about the history of the company. There are several recipes for biscuits but so much information is interspersed with the recipe I found it difficult to follow. It could have been a much better book if it contained more recipies and less information.

I would prefer book that contained just King Arthur recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Marketing, Poor Recipes","review":"Don't waste your time purchasing this book unless you plan on using only King Arthur Flour brand flour. I have tried numerous recipes (and I am no fool at baking) and none have ever turned out to meet my expectations. Because KAF wants you to use their high priced flour and the conversion of theirs to Gold Medal and Pillsbury doesn't quite match match up, don't waste your money. I refuse to spend my money on a higher priced flour when the other brands can make terrific bread on their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bible for the Shelf","review":"I consider myself to be very picky regarding what cookbooks I own - I'll read any cookbook but I won't buy them for my reference shelf. This cookbook is a keeper! Sands deftly tells you not only the \\"how\\" of each recipe but the \\"why\\". I've read plenty of the \\"chemistry of baking\\" and other such books, but this is the first that truly explained certain principles of baking to me (like why yeast doughs rise faster on humid days). There are even, in addition to the hundreds of recipes for baked goods, instructions on making your own play dough and paper-mache using King Arthur Flour! Don't be fooled into thinking this is a coffee table cookbook though - everything is black and white with no pictures (only a few line illustrations for things like the different bread braiding techniques) - but you are bound to come back to this cookbook again and again (in fact, it might be a good idea to buy a cookbook cover as the pages are sure to get smudged with all your efforts)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent resource and valuable guide","review":"This is a good solid book for anyone who loves to bake. A ton of information, and things you will not find in other places at your fingertips.

The book is well written for learning the subjects it presents. The only reason it does not get five stars is because it is not a good reference. The information is in there, however, the index is incomplete and the information is scattered throughout the book. Finding information takes some manual searching. Otherwise, it is one of the best books for learning verilog. I used the included software instead of the Xilinx Foundation Series software for Students. The included software supports the complete verilog set, not just the sythesizable subset. If you are experienced, looking for a good reference , will spend nearly $150 for a book, and do not need a verilog simulator, I recommend the Complete Verilog Book.

And this album has more great songs than any of his others. \\"Blue River,\\" and \\"Wind and Sand\\" are my favorites--wistful and poignant. \\"Perl's Goodtime Blues\\" is also a good one.

Have listened many times and my kids love it also. Even the mello songs are edgy-not soft sounding like some of the weaker Stranglers cuts. That's because the vocals of JJ and Baz are the best since the early days. Today's overrated overhyped new bands can't come close. This new Stranglers deserves to be heard.

Since I enjoy reading about the lives of people, I decided one day to pick it up....and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. It would be fun to be a mouse in the corner and hear the other side of the stories, yet Iacocca gets many points with me for telling the stories of both the ups and downs. His writing style makes a book on leadership very accessible to all readers. The book is peppered with one-liners that are can still be quoted and make total sense to anyone. Fascinating reading it 26 years after it was published. Back then he was touting the manatory use of seatbelts-he must be smiling that is the case now. Fascinating man, who has documented from his point of view an important part of our history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relevant Insights","review":"After seeing this on the Goodwill shelf for years, I finally sunk in the 99 cent investment, in the hardcover no less! It was worth every cent.Iacocca provides an fascinating view of history from the inner workings of a man inside some of America's largest corporations. Certainly Iacocca's ego shines through as his own story unfolds, yet one can see hints of its necessity and the protection it offers him in the course of his life.Iacocca traces Lee Iacocca's rise through the ranks of Ford and his tremendous part in the turn around of Chrysler. As the stories are told, Mr. Iacocca weaves his pearls of wisdom for those seeking to succeed as he did. Iacocca the salesman is ever present. Iacocca read even some 20 years after its original printing continues to provide valuable insight into such modern issues as gas prices, trade imbalance and unemployment.A insightful book even for someone not interested in the auto industry."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Car Business","review":"Anyone who want to know about the car business this is an excellent start.

It sounded 'okay' but my favourite song \\"Bella Linda\\" definitely gave much to be desired from the original.

Look at it this way if you are a real Grass Roots fan you get to hear Rob sing parts of songs that Warren sang originally and you get to hear Dennis's unmistakeable voice on songs he was never part of.This is not a CD for a causual fan who just wants the hits presented in their original form and I agree that it should have been presented upfront as re-recordings. That being said there are some places with Dennis singing on songs recorded long before he joined the band that are really interesting.

Offering interesting reading for academics and those who have a general passion for the period. This book is well referenced and sourced - pulling together the thoughts and experiences of many key and contemporary Victorians such as Ruskin, Dickens, Eliot and a whole host of lesser known but equally important writers and artists. Kate Flint explores the changing concept of perspective - she shows the impact of travel - the challenge to conventional perspective offered by physically altering one's position - train travel or ballooning for example. \\"Sight\\" as it was perceived by the Victorians is something we do not identify with today. Flint brings to the foreground the important fact that \\"seeing\\" in Victorian England was indeed a very different experience.

The examples were there, but few and far in between, without the detail that would have made them useful case studies.

The plot is ludicrous, with subplots sprouting up all over the place and dying before they reach their climaxes and half the time not even resolving themselves. Even if you tried to enjoy the film, and were conscious of what was going on, there would be no tangible storyline to really follow.

Harrison Ford is a good actor but due to poor direction he appeared to be a bit of a klutz. A few more takes on some of the scenes might have proven to improve them. Especially when the actors seemed to be acting so hard. It was difficult to follow the story line. The movie was more about the two detectives. The laughs would have come much more naturally if they had followed one story line and have the laughs come from that. The movie also went on much too long and the final action scene could have been cut at least 5 minutes and we wouldn't have missed it.

A got a few snickers here and there from Harrison Ford's part-time Realtor gag and Josh Hartnett's attempt at becoming an actor, but somehow those scenes were really reaching - for something (especially in the interrogation rooms with IAD).I have a feeling that when the Distributor screened the final product with the Producer, Director, Editor, etc., they just said \\"Uhhh,okay.\\"...\\"It stars Harrison Ford; it's got to be worth something!\\" I also have a feeling that at the Post-Production process the director may have winced at the ending scene as said \\"It's a Crapshoot,\\" and then took a vacation.This movie just didn't work out right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shelve this movie in the cheap movies bin","review":"This movie is not worth watching.

I nearly fell asleep a few times during the first hour of the film. Harrison Ford walked through his part in this film and he deserves better, and Harnett, though potentially talented, is simply NOT convincing as the sensitive, metaphysical yoga instructor-cop. Never mind, it was fun to see Gladys Knight, Smokey Robinson and Frank Sinatra Jr. in bit parts... the familiar landmarks around Hollywood, and the chase scene at the end of the film is really good... but it's not enough to save this film for me. OH, by the way, this is supposed to be a comedy.. it is NOT. It has some humorous IRONY in it, but NEVER comedy. Martin Landau is great in his part... but its all too brief.... too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"ISPN number doesn't specify version","review":"Unfortunately, this book is no longer in print which is why I had to get it through Amazon.

I've put at least 1000 miles on them, and yes, the sole is more worn than the leather. Easily the most comfortable boots I've ever owned. I've climbed 5 14ers in CO with them, taken them through about 40 miles of the grand canyon, and even took them up the river hike in Zion. I've replaced the laces twice, changed the inserts and they are still completely water proof(my feet did get wet on the Zion hike, but that was in four feet of water). They were the editor's choice in backpacker magazine when i got them in 2001 and they will definitely be my next boot.

Therefore I was disappointed, especially for example by track 4, which keeps repeating \\"Computer Machine..\\" ad-nauseam, I absolutely cannot stand track 4.On the other hand I bought \\"Boheme\\" in the same order, and found that this seems to continue in the non-English tradition, although not in that amazing \\"African Pygmy\\" language of that original CD. \\"Boheme\\" is more like it - but next time I will be more careful and find if I can specifically get more of that African Pygmy music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan-Tas-Tic!","review":"This is an ethnic beat that is really in harmony with new age music.

It deserves 10 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"This ain't your daddy's Deep Forest!","review":"But that isn't necessarily a bad thing.This disc is decidedly more.. \\"rock band\\" than previous releases, if once can dare stick such a specific label on Deep Forest. The energy level is certainly much higher; On most tracks, drum machines have been replaced with actual drum kits. Looped samples of the natives have been replaced by songs with lyrics (that you can understand!) but there's just enough of the Forest still left to keep it familiar.On the other end are tunes which trick you at the start as being 'yet another dance song', but jet off in a far more interesting direction than any monotonous and repetitive techno track ever will.All in all an interesting disc, worth the listen if you don't like your favorite artists to keep churning out the same stuff with every new release and are instead willing to accept a little evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same Deep Forest","review":"Hi,I was VERY disappointed when I first played this album; lost are the deep tribal drums and chants and replaced by a sort of techno/computer-rock (Gods of technology?) that seems much less like \\"world beat\\" and more like \\"noisey rock\\" to my ear. However, after a few weeks, the album has grown on me and to be honest, I very much hated Deep Forest the first time I heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I am a huge Deep Forest fan and was supremely disappointed with this album.

I've got all of their older discs (including some imports to get those special bonus tracks) and even some of the singles. But this disc... it's completely different and not in a good way. I guess Pacifique should have been a warning sign that Deep Forest was losing touch with what makes them Deep Forest, and this disc unfortunately proves that they've lost their way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grrrrreat Album!","review":"With thier last album,both Deep Forest and Enigma turned towards electronica.And even I really hate saying this but Enigma failed in doing so.Voyageur is an album far from the standards of Enigma.But on the other hand Deep Forest did a splendid job,some people were complaining about the noise and loudness in this album,but I did'nt felt anything like that,in fact Deep Forest did a perfectly great job in combining world beat with electronica,the sound is completely new and is full of energy.I would recommend all the fans who did'nt like dthis album to listen to it again,maybe they will have to do it more than once,but this is not an album to miss.Surely a great work by Deep Forest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effiel 65, just not as good.","review":"If you've ever listened to deep forest before (Boheme, Comparsa, etc.) then, chances are, you won't like this one. Unlike their usual world rythm from places like Cuba and Africa, they have the sounds like a techno night club in the USA. Example: Number 5 features the voice of a female singer, who sounds nice if you are into the usual modern day rock, but doesn't include the beautiful beat and melody that the past four CD's have. I was greatly dissapointed, however there are three or four songs in the CD that I appreciated. It's also kind of depressing, and didn't have the depth of feeling that Techno sometimes has. If you REALLY want to try this CD out, or like techno music, go for it. From the stand point of a techno fan, it was done ok, but just ok and no better. But Deep forest seems to have lost their 'touch'..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok but not Great","review":"Music Detected does have a few great songs in an otherwise mediocre release. There isn't much continuity or fluidity from track to track, it just seems all slapped together. This creates a flow which is not very smooth but rather a rough ride on high waves.There are a couple of gems hidden in the shuffle including \\"Yuki's Song\\" and the simple & short but brilliant \\"In the Evening\\". Download these 2 tracks and skip the CD. Better yet buy Blank & Jone's \\"Relax\\" 1 or 2 CD's, Conjure One's \\"Extraordinary Ways\\" or any of the Digital Moodz releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best recording of Deep Forest","review":"For as a DJ, this one is a very dance-able CD.

Perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The End of a Great Band","review":"Until recently there were only two bands whose CDs I would buy the day they were released without a second thought: Deep Forest and Baka Beyond. The list has shortened now to Baka Beyond. Music Detected is such a huge disapointment that I suspect it was a misdirected effort to win the American audience. Deep Forest must have been holding it's communal nose while recording this awful mess.

ARE THEY KIDDING? This is probably the worse cd I have listened to in years. I agree with the previous review regarding track 4. It's really awful.

True DF fans, AVOID!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music For Las Vegas Magicians On An NBC Special","review":"This album marks a huge change in style from the type of music we all got to know Deep Forest for making.This album sounds like something you'd here backing the soundtrack of the TV show \\"Ripley's Believe It Or Not...!\\" or the music played on some NBC special featuring a Las Vegas magician while performing some trick. I think I even catch an air of the TV show \\"Survivor's\\" voting torch ceremony music.Basically, it sounds like mediocre studio music made by people who are just trying to cash their check. I've had few albums that have disapointed me as much as this one did. Avoid it, find a new artist that cares about quality, because obviously the people behind Deep Forest just want the record company to cut them a check when they finish an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imposters Detected","review":"This can not be the same Deep Forest.

Guess the record company wanted to sacrifice music artistry for profit, and got neither!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Downward Slide Detected","review":"Sorry, guys, this is where I get off. It's been a great ride; thanks for the memories. After the tour de force that was \\"Made In Japan,\\" I guess these guys had nowhere to go but down. The beautiful melodic themes and strong ethnic vibe so typical of their previous work are gone. In their place we have cheesey Europop and pretentious, would-be rock anthems with -- are you ready for this -- English lyrics! There are some (unremarkable) ethnic vocal samples thrown in, but they are lost amid the wall of distorted guitar/synth, power drumming, and digital reverb. Speaking of the latter, this is a particularly shrill and noisy record; whoever produced it must have a serious high frequency hearing loss. I was one of these guys' biggest fans, and I feel cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing across the board!","review":"I bought this album without reading any of the reviews under the assumption I'd get the same quality and feel as the first two albums.

It now sits collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Music Detected","review":"I am a big Deep Forest fan and I tried to like this horrible cd. I gave it at least 10 full listens and finally gave up and sold it to a used cd shop for a few dollars. It was quite unpleasant to listen to.

The price is cheap for a corrective goggle. They fit in the inner part of the eye socket, closer to the eyes than many goggles. This part of my face seems more immune to bruising and indentation so they don't make me look like a raccoon after wearing them. My only wish is that the strap were a bit longer because it is tight on my big head (7 7/8 inch hat band size, i.e. extra large)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nicely built goggles","review":"I bought these goggles a month ago. I was wearing normal goggles to swim every day before. After first try on these goggles, I really liked them and have not used my old goggles since. My old goggles will get foggy after 15 min swim. These new goggles did not get foggy after swimming for one hour. They are very comfortable too. The best thing is that I can see clearly while swimming because of the corrective lenses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value but a little tight","review":"Overall I'm pleased with these goggles. I've wanted to get prescription swim goggles for a while, but assumed they'd be as expensive as prescription glasses. Apparently not the case.My only complaint is that the strap doesn't loosen up enough.

Hopefully the silicone strap will relax a little over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"well .. they look nice","review":"Poor product , skimpped on the strap which is way too short , will fit a child's head .Even with all that the extereme pressure on eye sockets , were leaking .Prism doesn't allow to sneak peaks , goggles in general dont feel \\"right\\" .I had many goggles beofre and have always adjusted but not to this one , gone back to my old Speedos .Strongly advice to try before buying those goggles ."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality, OK design","review":"I was initially put off by many customers' comments about this goggle being too tight and too small. As I unfortuantely have a big head, I was inclined to order a different brand (around $20, plus shipping). Finally I ordered this one on Amazon.com, because Amazon offered free shipping and the price ($12.99) was really attractive for corrective lens. It turns out that the straps are okay, not too tight, but the eye cups are kind of small which take me a while of getting used to. Besides this minor design flaw, I think this goggle is great. The bottom line is, this goggle works well and I can see clearly. The goggle is made of quality material and the anti-fog coating is excllent. You just know it will last a very long time. Given the low price, what else can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Speedo Aqua Racer Optical Corrective Lens Swim Goggle","review":"I love the lenses but these goggles are painful to wear.

They are not an exact match to my prescription but they are excellent for swimming. I spoke to my eye care professional about them and he said they were a great deal.

Also, these DON't leak."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"These goggles are just what they state, RACER goggles. Do not expect a comfortable goggle for just lounging in the pool. I have an average head and after loosening the strap a little bit they do fit, albeit quite tight.

They achieve a great seal that is watertight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goggles are great, but the case is poor.","review":"I can see through these almost as good as my $200 prescription lenses on my normal glasses.

There was no way to adjust them properly.I arranged to send them back to Speedo and it took them over 6 months (after countless calls and emails)to reimburse me.

After being a Speedo customer for over 25 years I was very disappointed with their customer relations--I'll think twice about another purchase of a Speedo product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I bought this goggle online, and found it too tight on my face. Changing the nose bridge did not help. The problem comes from the design of the tiny frame which is pressed too closely around my eyes.

I still listen to that first album a lot and had great expectations for this new release. But, I'm sorry to report this was a real disappointment. First, why are five of the 12 songs repeats from \\"River Under the Road?\\" This new album was recorded at her concerts with no backup. They sound so much better on the studio produced first album. Her voice comes off as flat and the tempo is very slow. A friend walked in when I had it on and thought there was something wrong with my CD player. It even seemed to me that she forgot some lines in one of the older songs. And, why do performers think we want to listen to clapping from the audience or conversation during the performance?

The first one is so good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as it looks","review":"I have a very careful 3-yr-old who loves this book, and even he has managed to wrinkle and/or lose pieces of it. It's not a fun book for the adult. It has a few good aspects, but way too many pieces that are easily lost or ruined. The button page has odd-shaped buttons that are a pain even for adults to do and undo; the vinyl faces and house have way too many pieces which are stored in packets that make them all stick together in one horrible ball of plastic. The creators of this book had some fun ideas that don't seem to work that well in real life. I know a lot of people like these, but I don't really see why.

The price is totally not worth the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game for young kids","review":"I bought this game for my 3 year old primarily due to nostalgia-- I remember playing it myself as a child and enjoying it a lot. It was an instant hit with him, and we have spent several afternoons and evenings trying to beat that sneaky raven to the fruit! It's a great introductory board game for young kids. My son learned about rolling and interpreting dice, taking turns, and generally participating in board games (skills that we have since used while playing other board games).My only complaint about this game is that the little baskets for collecting fruit are disappointingly fragile. Excitable young children can easily crush the baskets beyond repair! We have substituted kitchenware for the time being and will probably head to the craft store for a more durable replacement. The other game pieces are sturdy, brightly colored and fun to use-- I just wish Haba had put as much effort into the baskets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Orchard is great!","review":"This is a great game because there is no one child winning while others feel sad. The kids (ages 3.5 and 4.5) really got into the team work involved with beating the raven. Adults enjoyed playing it as well.

My 2.5 year old plays it daily and absolutely loves it.2. durable (baskets get squashed, but hold up to it okay but a little beaten looking)3. game pieces adorable (small) and high quality. If you have very small children then you may want to laminate the cardboard puzzle pieces. I haven't but the puzzle component is doing fine despite that.4. Co-operative games are important developmentally and not so easy to find.This is a great first game for kids. It teaches about taking turns, sharing, and working together towards a goal. We've had this game for several months and it still comes out everyday to be played with. My toddler loves rolling the die (singlular) and putting the fruit in the basket. The puzzle is fun for her, too. The fruit game pieces are small (hence the recommended age) but my 2.5 year old plays the game as it is intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sophisticated and great fun!","review":"All my family love this board game. It is so nice to have it on a rainy or snowy day that all our family can play this together."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT first board game","review":"This game is easy to play. Even our 2-year-old is able to join in. The pieces are cute and durable, with the exception of the baskets, which eventually I'm sure will get crushed by a foot or rear end. (The good news is that the baskets aren't essential to the game and you could easily substitute any other kind of container.) Our 4-year-old is in a \\"sore loser\\" stage where losing anything sends her into a crying, screaming fit. But the cooperative nature of this game, where everyone is on the same team, means she deals with losing (to the raven) much better, and we get to model \\"good sport\\" losing to her. One great thing about this game is it doesn't last forever. It takes about 10-15 minutes to play. There's only one other drawback: when you roll the die, it has a tendency to make a royal mess of the board. We're teaching our girls to roll the die on the carpet instead of onto the board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is pictured!","review":"The image for this game is NOT what you get in the box, you're getting Haba's My first Orchard game NOT Orchard (which is different game and which is pictured above).

I was very disappointed in the wrong image being pictured and buying something that I didn't realize was going to be something else. So please be sure to check out a proper pictured item for My First Orchard, because that is what this seller is selling.

It's a very handsome thing, but deeply, deeply flawed. When I plug in my 80GB Fifth Generation iPod, usually the Soundstation just shuts down. The controls on the front of the machine tend not to work while the iPod is playing. I can generally control volume and mute from the rather ugly remote control, but I can't search, skip, pause or stop the iPod play from the remote. Questions on the Logitech support forum have gone unanswered. I'm too busy to mess around trying to call Logitech tech suppport - if they even HAVE a contact number. I have to find the paperwork, and I'll give it a try, but this feels very much like $300 down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great system.

I was counting on it having been enough time to get a newer version.So far, we've had no problems.

Also, adjusting the mirror requires two hands (something you don't have when you are moving on your bike) and the movements are not smoothe. Consequently, the mirror jerks when being adjusted.

You have to be able to put it on the very front of your helmet in order for the mirror to reach your field of view. On my helmet there isn't a sufficiently large flat area on the front to use the adhesive.On top of that, they include a two-sided adhesive (on side sticks to the mirror arm, the other to the helmet), but only one side of the adhesive is sufficiently sticky! It would probably work if you used two adhesives and stuck the less sticky sides to eachother, but they only give you 3 of the adhesive pads, so clearly they're supposed to work by themselves.The arm of the mirror is also rather flimsy plastic, and I was afraid I was going to break it during adjustments.In the end, I used up all 3 adhesive pads and was unable to get it to stick to my helmet. I ended up just throwing the mirror away, because it wasn't really long enough anyway. Don't bother buying it - this mirror is worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I found this unit useless.

That said, the removal of the old beams and replacement of the new was extremely easy. Another reviewer had stated it took about 90 seconds to complete everything and he was not far off. I stripped the previous wires back 2 inches and hooked up the new ones after shortening the several feet provided. The eyes lit up and after a minor adjustment to the brackets, the garage door was operating again.

About all I missed in this film was the very stylised jerky ghost moves that characterised the first film. Whilst the Barebones structure of the plot of the search for the Statue, the Quest of Dr Richard Hammer, holds the film together, the carefully detailed death scenes spook the daylights out of anyone watching.There is no commentary in this disc.

The ghosts this time seem like they want to make their vitims suffer what they suffered in the past. And there are lots of victims this time around. The problem is you wouldn't know or care majority of the characters. There's also almost no plot at all. Most of it just involves setting up who will die next.Overall, like many horror sequel, the original remake was much much better and there's really no reason for this piece of mess.

I ordered this brand because I have always used Clubman and loved it, and I still do. However, the Clubman Virgin Island Bay Rum smells nothing like the classic Bay Rum scent. It smells like some extra spicy almost cinnamon scent. I didnt like it at all. Maybe someone out there might love it, but I didnt, mainly because I had a certain expectation of what it was going to smel like and Clubman didnt deliver. If you want an awsome classic Bay Rum scent go and buy Stephan's Bay Rum. That is the same that my barber uses and its the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was totaly Fantastic","review":"I LOVE the cd. I have listened to his music since i was 2 years.

I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it","review":"I would call Karl Ridderbusch not wooly but big, rich, friendly, doing a good job of singing a role which is a bit above his range. From all reports (except one, the first comment on this review) he was a very nasty man and an unreconstructed Nazi who never served, but he was excellent at PORTRAYING benevolent big guys. Too much so to be really effective as Fafner and Hagen. His stage-personality was like John Goodman's, which is just right for Sachs.And the other reviewer must not be listening to the same Jean Cox I hear. I have no complaint about him except that he's not quite as genius an actor as Windgassen and Jess Thomas. But he is strong and beautiful, his range is just right, and I find his acting very sincere. Especially the exchange with Eva in Act II.Hans Sotin is gorgeous as Pogner. The goldsmith with the golden voice.

My son & daughter love the iPod dok & no need to worry about the small parent cup holder just buy an adaptable Bob parent tray or any parent tray for that matter & your set.

Whatever you think of \\"Heaven's Gate\\" the film, you cannot be help but be astonished. So many times, sandwiched between fascinating details of late 70's/early 80's cinema, are moments that actually make you scream. Like many who lived it, you see the iceberg coming and have no power to alter course. It all adds up to truly sad moments that actually happened to real people. Truly heartbreaking is What Could Have Been (What Should Have Been!) in the face of the final results. Amazing book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ego, Dollars, and Art","review":"Steven Bach's FINAL CUT about Michael Cimino's ego run amok and the consequent dismantling of United Artists has long been considered the great insider's tale of Hollywood's actual doings and follys. For both Bach and the reader, it is easy to see the perfect storm that surrounds giving Cimino free reign on \\"Heaven's Gate.\\" Coming off of an Oscar for the \\"Deer Hunter,\\" Cimino gets whatever he wants, does whatever he wants, and basically acts like the most conceited jerk of all time. No one seems to disagree with assessment. The conflicting opinions exist on what Bach and others could have done as management. Their every decision ends up wrong and United Artists uses the disaster to sell itself off to MGM, for a profit no less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition close to unreadable","review":"My rating is not for the book itself, which I quite enjoyed, but for the typo-ridden Kindle edition.

If you're interested in this book, do yourself a favor and pick up a used copy of the paperback instead of the electronic edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book but was this edited by Cimino?","review":"Without question this book gives you an insider's look at Hollywood and how movies are made. Unfortunately, the editing of this book is virtually nonexistent. It could easily have been called, \\"A History of United Artists\\". That dates back to the 20s and therefore you must invest about 100 pages before you get to the story of Heaven's Gate.But once you get to the Heaven's Gate section, the old story of Hollywood excess, greed and ego takes over. Cimino may take the prize for egos and that's saying a lot.I enjoyed this book and bought it for the historical significance it has in modern Hollywood history. I was not disappointed but be prepared for a long read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Cares?","review":"Heaven's Gate is a misunderstood masterpiece, and this book is just a silly book about the author's money obsession."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watching a Studio Wreck","review":"This is a book I can't put down once I start reading it, and I re-read it every few years. It starts when a new management team takes over United Artists. They have to put together a slate of films. \\"Heaven's Gate\\" is one of their choices, and we see how this film moves from one choice among many to the behemoth that wrecks the studio. Contrary to some of the reviewers who say the book doesn't get to \\"Heaven's Gate\\" soon enough, I think the book is well-structured.I also like the way Bach displays three different directors: Cimino, Scorsese and Woody Allen. Cimino is obviously the egomaniac out of control. Allen comes across as the \\"good director,\\" always conscious that he is working with somebody else's money. Scorsese comes out between the two extremes.Hey, if this book were only about \\"Heaven's Gate,\\" I wouldn't like it so much, but we also get some insight into \\"Manhattan\\" and \\"Raging Bull,\\" two much better movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scanpan Chef Pan","review":"I am a great fan of Scanpan and have several pieces.

The binding is so bad in certain sections of the book that 20-some pages just separate themselves from the rest.This isn't an isolated incident, either. Several of my classmates have had pages fall out in similar sections of the book, so I can only assume that it's an actual manufacturing problem.The book is still usable, but it's rather inconvenient to have to constantly stuff 22 pages back into place just so you can read about Martin Luther."},{"rating":"1","title":"this seems highly racist in this day and age being an african american amazon seller and buyer i feel","review":"this seems highly racist in this day and age being an african american amazon seller and buyer I feel this has taken us two steps back"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Fabulous Resource!","review":"This book does exactly what it says....

Second, comparing this version with the Original 1611 King James will reveal that the italicisation of the 1611 KJV (meaning words added by the original King James translators) is way different from the italicisation of this Bible.

I realize it's a low budget film, but I've seen many low budget films that are well written and well acted and this is not one of them.I was bored but kept watching the film, expecting to find that it was really some kind of science fiction story with time warps, after the line of dialog: \\"He must be about my age now.\\" How is that something that any normal person would say?

I use it as a whole-house PA system to play XM Radio programming while I work in the garage or in the kitchen. It has very clear audio, but it depends on the speakers you use to hear the audio. I use a pair of Legrand Q-Series 100 watt outdoor speakers for the garage and Legrand Q-Series in-ceiling speakers for the kitchen. It sounds good in the kitchen and even better in the garage. I am giving this review four stars instead of five because of the misleading information in the manual. The manual states that it puts out 1000 watts when connected to 4 ohm speakers. When it's connected to 8 ohm speakers, it puts out 500 watts.

It also suffers from the old long telephone cord problem. The coils interlock and I spend more time trying to uncoil the hose, than if I would have just kept my old regular hose and winder.

She has definitely made the switch to digital photography, and is a master at Photoshop. But she goes far beyond this. She sometimes uses traditional art techniques to take the basic photographic digital prints to a new level of creative expression. For instance she may decide to color the image herself using traditional paints and a brush. Perhaps she prints the image on canvas and uses this only as an outline for the painting she wants to do. Perhaps she wants an old fashioned appearance, complete with aging caused discoloration or a sepia tone.There are a lot of books on using Photoshop to produce special effects. And what you can do with Photoshop is truly amazing.

The leading is also sub-optimal, making it very physically difficult to actually get your eye to move across the page. The fact that what's on said page is a lot of redundant, pandering fluff doesn't help matters at all.Like most self-help books, this one spends several chapters defining a couple of catchphrases in language that is so simplistic as to be patronizing, and then spends several more chapters repeating them over and over and over. There is literally over 100 pages worth of forgettable feel-good setup to wade through before you even get to the actual point of the book.

Beautifully done. One hopes the somber predicitons will not come true"},{"rating":"2","title":"Regional","review":"I found this book one of the minor works of Ismail Kadare.The three-arched bridge stands here as a symbol for the dangerous political situation of Kadare's homeland Albania, between the West (for him, capitalism) and the East (the Turks, Islam).The construction of the bridge is also a sign of the violent transition from agricultural and rural (the pontoon) to industrial and commercial interests (toll).The incorporation of the ancient Albanian legend about a ritual murder needed to preserve the bridge seemed to me rather exaggerated.Unlike Kadare's masterpieces (e.g. The General of the Dead Army, The Pyramid, Moon Night), this story concerns more Albanian regional problems. It tackles general human problems more or less indirectly.But it is still a worth-while read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"When this book got rave reviews I immediately bought it and began reading.

When I put it back in my Jeep, I was greeted with the same hum, and horrible distortion, only thing is, this time it didn't blow the fuse, so they at least took care of that. Once again (for my peace of mind and to make sure I wasn't going nuts) I got hold of a friend of mine, and used his 1200 watt amp for a little while. It worked with no buzz. This time, I didn't bother sending it back again as the warranty was expired, so now I've got a doorstop that looks like it could be an amp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never mix rock and fantasy","review":"For the most part, I love Hawkwind. True, sometimes their lyrics are sophomoric but that is part of their charm. Hawkwind's enduring strength lies in their ability to mix their unique spacey sonics with flat out rock and roll. Unfortunately, The chronicle of the Black Sword offer very little of either. Instead we get a band trying to create an epic fantasy recording but ending up with a product that is the worst of both rock and fantasy worlds.Instead of sounding fantastic they sound lame. Instead of rocking they leave you waiting for a sound that never comes. This record is a failure on every level. Perhaps if I were an adolescent with no taste in either fantasy or rock I might find it listenable - As it is I really wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally awesome","review":"i was fairymay in a school production, and it is the best play i have ever done.it is a very open minded script, so you can percieve it however you want. it is totally awesome"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Story","review":"I was introduced to \\"The Curious Savage\\" last fall when I played Miss Willie in a college theatre production.

Nearly half the lp features bass & drums, and they tend to obscure the genius which resides in this man's fingers.The songwriting is consistently good (features 2 of Jones' best originals plus 2 by his brilliant brain-trust, Alan Tunbridge) and Wizz's singing is above par throughout.I was beyond thrilled when Scenescof reissued this obscure gem- now I can retire my vinyl version to the archives.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flowers + Supplies required","review":"This book has a beautiful assembly of flowers and arrangements.

Matt has a vocal and instrumental style all his own. I mostly listen to pop and alternative music, but I have friends who listen to other styles who also enjoy this cd. Matt the Electrician has such an original, folk-popish style. It reminds me slightly of Sister Hazle or Barenaked Ladies, though the style is original so you have to hear it to know it.

This album fares far less well.Full disclosure here: I've been a rabid Joni fan for 30+ years. So I approached this tribute album with a mix of trepidation and hope. Sad to say, there is not a single song that I found compelling in comparison to the original. Don't get me wrong: Annie Lennox does a fine job with \\"Ladies of the Canyon\\", as does Cassandra Wilson with \\"For the Roses\\". But all they did was make me want to go listen to the originals.My biggest fear is some that some people will allow this album to act as their introduction to Joni. Trust me: a bigger mistake you could not make."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album will make you BLUE....","review":"As a 50 year old who buys a lot of music, there are 3 albums from the early to mid 70's that I still play regularly - John Martyn's \\"Bless the Weather\\", Bob Dylan's \\"New Morning\\" and Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\". So I was quite interested to hear about this tribute album and was pleased to see that so many songs from that great album BLUE were included. The unfortunate reality is that those songs, along with most of the others, are very disappointing. After just three listens I have found that the absolute \\"ho-hum\\" nature of this project has left me feeling very BLUE........ I should have spent my hard earned on something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a tribute to joni mitchell","review":"i was disappointedtoo many of the performers over interpreted joni mitchella few imitated her stylebut joni mitchell sings joni mitchell songs better than all of them"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I was hoping for something a little more inspired. As others have said, already, none of the performers really seemed interested in this project.And why did they have to go out of their way to sing their song in such a way that it is as different as it can be from Joni's original? What really confuses me is why they didn't ask Cyndi Lauper to sing \\"Carrie\\"? The TV special that attempted to honor this, the first lady of song for the last 30 years, was nearly as bad as this CD. But Lauper's version of this bouncy song from \\"Blue\\" was inspired and heartfelt and(something completely lacking from this effort) fun. Skip this disc. Buy the sublime originals. I guess no one does Joni as well as the woman herself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"A tribute to Joni had all the possibilites to be a favorite in any Mitchell fans' CD collection. After all, the 2000 Tv special that featured Shawn Colvin, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Diana Krall and others was probably the most entertaining special I've seen in this decade. So having that for a seed how could this not be awesome? Well the simple answer is that it was designed to be too complicated, on the edge or whatever. Some of the performances are awesome! (Prince, E. Harris, KD Lang and JT) but some are almost unbareable and prevent any listener who is not familiar with the particular song to even understand what the heck its about. Music fans purchase at your own risk, but understand that few true Joni fans will think its a tribute or a treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this was a good idea?","review":"A tribute album to Dylan makes sense. After all, Dylan can't sing and it has been proven time after time that his words, in the hands of others, really shine. But Joni Mitchell? It's hard to imagine a more beautiful and original voice. These artists do nothing to add to her body of work. While all talented in their own right, when singing Joni's tunes they offer pale reflections of the original works at best. This album seems like nothing more than a half baked money making scheme and should not be supported."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed. Where are the other cuts?","review":"This tribute was announced almost ten years ago, and it seems to have undergone a transformation since then. To be fair, there are some interesting additions such as the Sufjan Stevens and Brad Mehldau tracks. And Emmylou Harris is brilliant. But Sarah McLachlan's \\"Blue\\" has been heard before as has Prince's \\"A Case of You.\\" Earlier reports indicated contributions from heaviweights like Steely Dan and Lindsey Buckingham. I sure would like to have heard what they would have done. Even more disappointing is that Joni's Hejira-Mingus era albums are mostly ignored - and that was her best music, in my opinion. As a final indignity, it sounds to me that too much compression was added in the mastering phase, and hence the overall sound quality of the CD is lacking in dynamics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointing","review":"This disc is not very interesting. The performances are mostly lackluster. The only stand out tracks are Annie Lennox's brilliant reading of Ladies of the Canyon. Lennox has a wonderfully distinctive voice and the synthesizers and Indian instrumentation reminded me plesantly of the Beatles. k. d. lang does a wonderful job on Help Me and James Taylor does a good job on River but I already had that on his holiday release. It was sort of interesting to hear Prince but the rest of the disc is just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy Tribute","review":"This is no \\"Return Of The Grievous Angel\\". Sadly they use admirers of Joni Mitchell's music instead of artists who would really know how to make some decent renditions. This CD is good for about three listens before it ends up collecting dust in the music rack. James Taylor and Sarah McLachlan fit for Joni's style (Folk, Jazz & World) and that is about it. Who should be here? Pat Metheny, Shawn Colvin, C.S.N.& Y., Jackson Browne, Judy Collins, David Wilcox, Richard Thompson, Arlo Guthrie, O'2L, Steely Dan, John Gorka, Carly Simon, Laura Coyle, Robben Ford and Loreena McKennitt. Maybe even Rickie Lee Jones and Joni could kiss and make peace. Let's try a second tribute and get this right. The booklet by the way is a joke. A 2 Star only for Sarah McLachlan's \\"Blue\\". Avoid unless you're one of those collectors from A to Z on Joni Mitchell. She deserved way better than this. Save your $$$$ and read the other honest reviews which I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tributes are always tricky, this doesn't make it","review":"I'm a lifelong fan of Joni, and listened to this \\"album\\" with anticipation. The first 4 cuts, by contemporary artists, were unlistenable. Then it gets better, but still with misfires by Prince and Elvis Costello. The only great selection is k.d. lang's Help Me, followed by Emmylou Harris' The Magdalene Laundries and Cassandra Wilson's For the Roses, which is not enough quality to merit buying the CD or keeping it (I'm giving away the one I purchased). This was a good effort, but overall it fails."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong","review":"I really like this album. Casting is 80% in every musical artistic venture and this is well cast.

How did they get here? What is going on? Harpman denies us answers. Even after the women manage a fluke escape, their freedom is ambiguous at best, and we can only watch as they wander an uncompromising landscape (that may or may not be Earth...) and ultimately succumb to exhaustion and death.That this is not a cheerful novel goes without saying. Its triumph is Harpman's unerring eye for the absurd and tragic. Above all, this is an engagingly strange book that refuses to pigeonhole itself into any specific sub-genre. I highly recommend this odd and uncategorical tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Festival of Excrement","review":"Come, brethren, let us rejoice that the \\"artist\\" who is the subject of this book is dead.

This book is just what I needed. I take it to work with me, and at the end of the day, I figure out what I feel like eating, and make a quick stop on the way home for the fresh ingredients. I make enough for lunch the next day, and sometimes bring a \\"snack\\" for my boss who is a low-carber, too. (Dana, you can probably take credit for my recent raise!!!)The best things about this book are 1) that it has a ton of great innovative recipes, and 2) reading them seems to suggest other creative ideas to whip up as well.These are not just recipes for \\"low-carbers,\\" but a wonderful collection for anyone who is interested in fresh, delicious, and easily-prepared meals."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many odd ingredients","review":"Too many of the recipes in this book include odd ingredients. Guar, xanthan, tapenade and low-carb tortillas are not easy to find in my large suburban grocery store. Also many of the sauces and condiments used in the recipes are themselves recipes elsewhere in the book so if you don't have a batch already made, you'll have to spend more than 15 minutes making it.

This is THE BEST recipe book I have EVER found! And the 15 minutes is probably pretty accurate. For us moms with 3 little ones at home, it's more like 30 minutes including all the distractions...but that's still by far better than anything else home cooked!It's a relief when I make a recipe from this book 'cause I know it won't take too long. AND I can make practially ANY recipe in the book. When I meal-plan at the beginning of the week, I just sit down with the book and pick the next one I haven't tried yet (I've probably gone thorugh about half of them by now.) We haven't needed to repeat a recipe yet 'cause I'd say 95% of them are excellent!I can't say enough about this book. And I have now picked up her other books and they are great as well.

We discovered that boredom, expense and unavailability of certain ingredients make it difficult to even want to shop, nevermind cooking! Dana's books give us choices for every night, as well as ideas for lunch and snacks. She lists easy-to-find, generally inexpensive ingredients, and she speaks in a breezy, but very informative \\"girlfriend\\" style. As a diabetic, I do have to watch fat calories and too much of any food, but her recipes are easily adaptable to people on restricted diets and never overwhelm me. I either choose my dinner/lunch foods sometime during the day or the night before, which is less anxiety-producing for a baby-stepper like me.

I am really glad I bought them."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money . . .","review":"Many of these \\"recipes\\" shouldn't even be considered recipes.

It has been installed in our rabbit hutch for a month now and the bunnies will sit on the pad when the temperature drops.

I bought one of these little heaters and built a custom plywood birdhouse around the heater. I mounted it on the back wall, so Birdy can move closer or farther from it inside the birdhouse. It has been on continuously for about 3 months now. Oh my gosh Birdy loves it! She stays in the birdhouse on cold mornings, with only her beak sticking out the door to sing her morning greetings to the yard birds.THEN...we needed to provide a home for a Guinea pig. So I got another heater, and built a custom guinea pig house around this heater. It is mounted on the floor, and covered by a plastic tray cut from a dish pan to make it easy to clean.

It is everything described and more. The temp of it to the human touch is quite comfy and my hedgehog loves it. It is placed within her cage and she has moved her hut on top of it so she feels warm and secure. It does not heat up the plastic cage bottom in any significant fashion, so it is quite safe in that regard. The wire wrapped cord fits nicely through the cage bars, so there is minimum exposure of the cord to the hedgehog. The wire wrapping is a nice feature so animals can't chew through the cord. It cleans up nicely with a damp cloth, but you can also purchase a fleecy cover for it if you choose to. I would highly recommend this to anyone with small animals that need a warmer habitat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Noise","review":"I bought this heating pad for my rabbit to use on cold nights, and it seems to work great--except for the incredibly annoying buzzing/chirping noise that emits from it every time it's touched, or rustled in any way.It sounds like a recording of R2D2 dying.

Because of this, it's pretty much useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm & Cozy","review":"I worry when my cat gets stuck outdoors when nobody is home to let him in on cold days. I put this in the corner of the dog house on our back porch, and it works perfect. I stuck my head inside to make sure it was still working & the dog house felt warmer than my home. Since my cat prefers to stay outside (away from my 2 mischievious dachshunds) I don't worry any more about the frigid temperatures. I have a small bed in the dog house which he slept in at first, but since the temperatures are dropping, I've found him snuggled on top of the heater.

This is not lightweight or irrelevant, but instead smooth and upbeat with amazing vocals provided by the gifted Mr. Lawton. There are 12 perfectly selected and performed tracks on offer here, no filler. There are cover songs from John's days with Uriah Heep such as my favorite track Feelings. Also of note are Still paying my Dues to the Blues, I'm Alive, and Tonight. Every track on offer is proof of Dunning's chops as a musician and Lawton's mastery as a singer/bandleader.

Read it and rise to that challenge. Over the past thirty years I have spent many weeks in the Kipawa area. It is a joy to see and experience. Scott's stories give you a picture what it is to live in and experience these wild places.

Soon after, Ward starts to suffer from fears of heights.

The book is too repetitive, and could be shortened to a few pages. The basic idea of the book is: warmth = thickness. Most insulation insulates because of the dead air space it traps (not because of what the insulation is made of), so the idea of staying warm is to just have enough dead air space. So, the \\"Secret of Warmth\\" is to just use something to make dead air space and seal it up good so the wind won't blow in and the air won't leak out. And don't get it wet. There, you've read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid reference.","review":"The book provides very good advice on several ways to create insulation when none exists, as well as giving expert guidence on the make-up and effectiveness of different fabrics and materials as insulators.For as inexpensive as the reference is, I say its a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tested on animals- here's a better one","review":"This is a sad product that had been tested extensively on animals.

The spray part of the product would not work at all. I had to screw off the lid and glob it into my hand to use it. I have now gone through the entire bottle (I don't like to waste money) and my experience is that what it did cover got hard and crunchy yet also left certain spots still frizzy. I am willing to admit that perhaps it's because the product was globbed like a normal gel as opposed to being sprayed on as it was supposed to be and so perhaps my experience was just doomed to begin with and the product might not be too bad.

The swivel wheel makes it great for all around use, (the store or just taking a walk.) When the wheel is locked it does work like it should, but still has a slight wobble.

I guess the metal frame got too hot or something (even though it didn't even feel hot to the touch) because as we were walking back home the frame totally bent. The stroller fell over, the tray popped off, and my son almost hit the ground. Good thing I had him buckled in!!! And good thing my mom reflexes let me get my arm between him and the pavement before he hit his head! We were just walking along, going slightly down hill, and it just collapsed!

During this time, I've used many types of scrapers and spatulas. The best is the 13-1/2-Inch Rubbermaid Professional Scraper (purchased from Amazon). At first I thought it looked too big to use easily but soon found it is the best to scrape butter, batter, or dough down on the inside of my Kitchen Aid mixer, make hand-mixed heavier cookie dough or bread dough a breeze, speeds up spreading batter in pans or frosting on cakes, and is not likely to melt or tear!

I've left it a little too close to a gas burner many times and there's one very slight scorch mark as evidence of that but no melting. The color of the scraper head has stayed fairly white despite the incredible number of times it's been exposed to tomato sauce, curries, and other recipes that you would think might stain. I use this for incorporating ingredients in a bowl and sometimes as a spatula in a heated pan - it goes above and beyond as far as usefulness.I do wish the handle came in additional colors and that it were more ergonomic but it is sturdy, a good length for most every task and not a huge issue.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read - back to the basics","review":"I've always hated reading techical books that are more than a year old.

I have both in the original vinyl and they're in excellent condition, but I was broke when I bought them and they're both mono. It was good to hear the albums in stereo for the first time, although I thought that the remastering was uneven. Some tracks sounded better than others to me, and some flaws I'd heard in the old vinyl recordings were still there. Apparently not much care was taken by Columbia during the original recording sessions (she was too close to the mic for one thing), which is a shame because that lady could SING!Anyway there's only one more Eydie CD I'd like to have and that's \\"Eydie\\", recorded by RCA in the late 1960s.

But I was very surprised (and suspicious) at how bright the new CD sounded. So I bought a used vinyl copy of \\"Don't Go to Strangers\\" for a direct A/B comparison via software spectrum analysis, and discovered that the CD had indeed been brightened (+2.4 dB at 2KHz; +4.3 dB at 4 KHz; +6.6 dB above 8 KHz). The manufacturer may have boosted the highs for the \\"wow\\" factor, like putting more sugar in Coca-Cola. But this is a BIG boost and I wonder if it might have been a mistake with de-emphasis from the original Columbia tapes. But I'm perfectly happy here, as have copied the original to a CD-R after taming with a 10-band software equalizer. Plus, I now have a copy of the original 12 inch album cover of the beautiful Eydie!Keep having fun out there, Bill."},{"rating":"2","title":"'A SOUL , EXPOSED \\"","review":"....I AGREE W/ ALL OF THE OBVIOUS SUPERLATIVES, PREVIOUSLY EXPRESSED !I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN BLOWN AWAY BY AN ASPECT OF EYDIE'S , DELIVERY , NOT IMMEDIATELY REALIZED ( at least , not by me )SHE IS A SOUL SINGER OF THE HIGHEST CALIBUR !SHE MANAGES THIS , TOTALLY NATURALLY , WITH NO LAME ATTEMPT TO SOUND BLACK.THIS 2 / FOR IS THE ULTIMATE EXAMPLE OF THIS !SEVENTY MINUTES OF GOOSEBUMPS !!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really?","review":"This started out looking good, showing brit punk legends like the Subhumans, the Exploited, GBH,the Addicts, and showed snippets of the Damned but then focused on the Addicts for far too long.

He provides a detailed account of the development of nudist clubs and clothing-optional beaches across Canada. Not a naturist himself, he has no particular agenda, other than to present a scholarly and readable history of non-sexualized social nudity in Canada. The footnotes took up nearly half of the original manuscript, so the publisher decided to place them online free of charge, rather than to include them with the text. \\"Au Naturel: The History of Nudism in Canada\\" is on a par with Cec Cinder's \\"The Nudist Idea\\" from Ultraviolet Press. Together, they give an accurate and informative portrayal of the quirkly world of nudism in North America."},{"rating":"2","title":"No holds barred look at the dark side of family life","review":"If we are to believe mainstream cinema, family life is all gung-ho where everybody loves everybody.

My wife and I have watched them multiple times and planned several trips afterwards. Rudy Maxa is a fun travel guide. He presents excursions and sites that are historical and cultural in nature. He tends to show accomodations that are a little more expensive, but that aren't too lavish. The Pacific Max DVDs don't match the European set, because there are less historical sites and activities & there are only 2 shows per DVD, while the Europe set had 4 shows per DVD. My sense is that Rudy is most comfortable in Europe. Rudy does however do a good job of showing you the different excursions within New Zealand & China such as kayaking, wine country, etc. If you are interested in watching travel videos only & not set on the Pacific as a destination, I would recommend either of the Europe sets first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great idea - and it's working!","review":"We just started doing the \\"Potty Project\\" with our 7 month-old son a few days ago.

Zoom, lights that go on when you pull the razor out, clock in the front so you know if you are late, big mirror... what else do you want?

The tape and suction cups don't work, alone or in concert, even on a solid glass shower door. The battery compartment rusted after 2 showers. The lights stopped working the first time it fell 5 feet to the shower floor when the suction cups failed, and the clock quit the next day. The day after that, the lights came back on, during the day sometime, with the razors IN the holes. This is a turd in the punchbowl.

The switch in the razor holder still would turn it off but we were not using that. In addition this mirror is clunky. It's obviously meant to stand on a flat surface. It looks ugly in the shower. Since our first Zadro failed in less than a year because the suction cups no longer held it, we had concerns with this much heavier, not really shower-friendly model.

The very first time I went to change batteries, I found rust and corrosion. I called the company and they said they'd replace it with the receipt but it was past the (lousy) warranty period.

I think a mobile base is a must for any shop without an abundance of room. The machine is top heavy so don't skimp on the dimensions of the base. Follow the book on set up.

I have energy enough now to work out every day. This book explains everything in detail and the website has a forum where you can ask any question under the sun. However, the forum in the back of this book will answer most of those questions anyway. I lost 7 lbs in the 10 days, my husband lost 10 - but that isn't the reason to go on this diet.. its to change your lifestyle and the way you look at food. As a society we are too consumed by food, it runs our lives. Try it and find out how you feel for yourself, it will open your eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book is awesome!

The Master Cleanse is great for anyone- and especially those trying to eliminate cravings in order to eat healthier or transition to a vegetarian/vegan or raw diet. The original Master Cleanse book was a great guide, but Mr. Glickman made it easier to relate to, and updated things to modern day.

The other group went on a cleanse diet. In the end, neither of the two showed much difference.Also, being a radiology student and having studied physiology, I can tell you there is nothing that this cleanse can do that your kidney's and liver can't already do on their own.It was an interesting read, and I had high hopes that it would be legit, but I ended up disappointed.Also, half the book is just testimonials and things taken from message boards on the website that accompanies the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!","review":"Waste of money.

The book is repetative, repetative, and let me repeat myself, repetative...and boring. The basis of the cleanse is simple, so the steps are repeated time and again over the first several pages (he didn't even reword them). The rest of the 150 pages are reprints of postings to his website from several years ago, the majority regarding bowel movements. I ended up purchasing \\"The Master Cleanser\\" by Stanley Burroughs, which is succinct. The bottom line on this cleanse, regardless of who's book you read, is that it is ridiculous. Why anyone, including myself, would think that lemon juice, maple syrup and cayenne pepper are intelligent choices for a cleanse (I'm shaking my head)."},{"rating":"1","title":"come on!! what a ripe off!","review":"The diet is great, I have done it. Thats not what I have a problem with. All this book is, is a re-cap of the real book \\"the master cleanser\\" in the first chapter. And the rest of the book he took comments from the master cleanser website that other people wrote. It's free to go on to this web site and read the comments yourself! And the real book \\"the master cleanser\\" costs less and has more info in it then this book. I bought this book because everyone said it was a great follow up book.

I really wasn't sure I would make it but now I'm sure of it. I lost 7 lbs. so far and my clothes fit better. It wasn't for the weight, I did this, but to cleanse and prepare to start eating better. It has cleared the congestion in my chest. I hope it helps with the many other health issuses. My husband stopped on the 4th day, but the first day, he dropped 6.5 lbs. and a couple of lbs. each day after. That was a lot of liquid retention to be carrying around his heart and lungs.

I was also apauled that I was drinking a \\"bottle\\" of maple syrup every 2 days. YUCK... I ended up stopping on day 6 because I started getting sick. I felt my immune system was low on defenses or all the toxins in my colon that were coming out were acting up.Overall the cleanse did work in a way.

Yeah, yeah, the maple syrup has all kinds of minerals and calories, blah blah. You can't live on maple syrup. I liked the salt water flush, but I realized how completely unhealthy it was. This \\"cleanse\\" was the stupidest thing ever.Do you want to cleanse yourself? Lose weight? Lose wrinkles? Look years younger? Cure/prevent illness and disease? Become a raw vegan.

After a few weeks it started driving my wife nuts so now I'm throwing it out and looking for a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"MomR","review":"This interdesign forma wingo wallmount paper towel holder is a very sturdy holder.

I personally hate things that are not supposed to wiggle start wiggling and become misaligned.I thought it was kind of expensive, but after spending months looking for something cheaper and as sturdy, I gave up and bought this one. It better not rust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper towel holder","review":"I gave it two stars... I love the looks and the quality, but if you buy large rolls of paper towels from Costco, it's impossible to get them off the roll until half the paper towels are gone. As other reviewers have stated, it's much to rigid (i.e. great quality) to bend the arms back to accommodate larger rolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this","review":"It is beautiful and strong, but you cannot get the paper towel roll in without collapsing the roll. Then it won't spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over designed","review":"I returned this product after trying rather unsuccessfully to insert a roll of paper towels into it. The ends don't give much so the cardboard tube is bent and the roll does not dispense towels very easily. You have to be as strong as Sampson to get the roll inserted. It is certainly very well built, rather too well built, so it is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very annoying","review":"I like the minimal design, but functionally this thing is driving me crazy. It doesn't have enough give so it smashes the cardboard roll every time you put a new roll in. It works for a while and then when the roll gets low it falls off because the structure of the cardboard is compromised. Poor design in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"Well, not much to say here except that it is probably one of the nicest towel holders I've ever used. It is strong and sturdy, yet flexible enough to easily install a roll of paper. I even used a over-sized roll of paper and it fit just perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"I could not get this towel holder to work. The sides do not flip/bend and could hardly get the roll on. When I did, it crushed the cardboard core and towels would not roll/move. Terrible product. Amazon was generous in letting me return it and bought a great one instead from Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"Besides the packaging being almost impossible to open and giving me a nasty cut on my finger, the holder is very ridged and not practical.

Needless to say, this greatly inhibits the ability to dispense the towels properly and sometimes leads to the roll of towels twisting off of the holder completely. Despite my love of all things stainless steel, I wouldn't buy this product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't forget the screws!","review":"There's not much to say about this... it's a one-piece paper towel holder. It looks good, is well crafted, and does the job.But if you're mounting it under a cabinet (as opposed to the wall) make sure you have screws that are short enough on hand. The underside of my cabinets are only 0.6\\" thick. The screws this comes with are 1\\" long.The good news is that shorter screws work equally well at keeping this secure. You just have to bring your own to the party."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, It's true They DO Make Things like They use To","review":"Not much to add in addition to others. I concur that this looks very nice - especially if you have a stainless steel kitchen, and is ridiculously sturdy and well made. Yes it is a bit more expensive than others, but it is the best made paper towel I have ever seen, can't see it breaking like the plastic version I had. And as another user said you can \\"adjust\\" it in regards to how tight it holds the towels by flexing the sides (it is one solid piece of metal, wow) - although I found it perfect out of the box. In my case this is important because you have to reach across a counter to pull the towels, and my old one if you didn't pay attention the towels would fall off, and in to my sink. Very pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"It's very solid and looks great. It's brushed stainless and matches my appliances.

Sure, it looks great (nice solid stainless steel) but when it comes down to usability this thing gets an \\"F\\". You have to cram your paper towels in because there is no way to open up one side and slide the paper towel roll in, and the metal has no give. I've tried several brands thinking that it was just an issue with the brand I use, but nope, it's just a terrible design. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive","review":"Looks great with my stainless appliances. I have it hanging under and from my cabinet. I am very pleased with this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting and very Russian","review":"The Russians like Anderson's fairy tales a great deal and often film them. This version seems to be based on two or more stories. The film is at times poignant and, often, silly. There are also many musical interludes.Though more for Slavic audiemces the film is interesting. The costumes and - especially - the sets are greatly stylized. The music and dancing fit the story. Though no classic, An Old, Old Tale is great fun and gives you an idea of another country's take on fairy tales."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful but depressing","review":"Without giving much away, anyone who read Dances with Wolves and knows anything about history would know there is no way this book can have a happy ending. With this in mind, Michael Blake again writes a compelling novel with amazing insight. Not being a Commanche myself, I can not truly imagine what this time in their history was like, but I think Mr. Blake has done a commendable job in getting the point across. The reader gets a good sense of loss and the experience of losing a people's way of life. One minor point that in now way takes away from Mr. Blake's work, there were no \\"black-skinned slaves\\" in Washington D.C. 11 years or so after the end of the Civil War as is mentioned. Aside from that, I would highly reccomend this book to anyone who is interested in the beginnings of the Reservation system from an Indian point of view."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time!","review":"I loved reading Dances with Wolves, but Holy Road is a sore disappointment! I can't believe it's written by the same author. Blake spends chapters describing hallucinations and slaughter houses, but only a page on the death of the hero and other main characters. Way too many characters and way too disjointed. Holy Road lacks a cohesive story. I only read it because I enjoyed the original so much. If I hadn't read Dances with Wolves first, I would have put Holy Road down after the first forty pages. My opinion...watch the epic movie and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"boooringgg","review":"it's a great historical perspective, but possesses none of the magic of discovery, introspection and adventure of one person in the last book...Dances with Wolves. Sure would have liked more of his continuing story and voyage through his personal journey. Too many Indian names, too many battles, and in all probability, too close to a historical perspective than a novel that continues Dunbars journey. His death in battle is one line, with no embellishments...dismiss the former hero.Finished it, but like the reviewers said, left me with an empty stomach."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT","review":"As usual Amazon vendors are always prompt with the items always in wonderful shape when they arrive. Will continue to use Amazon.com...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about rhythm guitar technique (and a matter of taste whether you like the riffs)","review":"I bought the book in the belief, from its title, that it was about rhythm guitar technique - I should have investigated more carefully, I guess.Some samples are played with quite a high distortion level - ok if it's your taste, but it makes it a bit more difficult to hear note-for-note what is being played - and it grates a bit if you don't like heavy distortion.For me, the biggest problem is that I just did not not like the riffs - many of them sound to me like odd bits and pieces pasted together and I did not find any that I yearned to play. A matter of taste, I suppose, but on the assumption that other potential readers might have a similar reaction, I can't give a strong recommendation to the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle edition is worthless on iPad","review":"I cannot comment how this book work on Kindle device but it was not usable at all when viewed via Kindle app on iPad2. Images (actual music) were VERY poorly scanned - too small to read and fuzzy when enlarged and and music samples simply did not work on iPad at all. Luckily Amazon has excellent customer support and there was no problem returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good Romeo copm but not where to start","review":"After getting into Romeo I got this CD to get some of the rarer tracks - two of which are on here and very good (A No Fi Mi Piciny and You Can't Stop Me). THere are a few classic, Let The Power Fall, and an extended Wet Dream. A few really early tracks which are great rocksteady (Soulful Music and Walk INto Dawn) and a few really obscure tracks which are rewarding for hardcore Romeo fans. But those who want to hear his real prime should get War INa Babylon and check out his Chase the Devil tune, which the Progidy sampled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Godzilla's Best","review":"This movie was not the best godzilla . He had more of a puppy dog look . Godzilla was asleep in the movie and mostly was awake in the ending . He fought a giant shrimp which was really cheesey. The story moves slow and you just want to fall asleep . It mostly focuses on the people who are on the island . Not that great of a picture ."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is no accounting for taste.","review":"Godzilla and a giant crab (or shrimp, whatever) do battle near a remote island where a nefarious band of super criminals tampers with nuclear energy and enslaves innocent natives. By the mid-'60s, the most generous thing one can say of Japanese sci-fi is that it was chuckle-headed camp humor. This juvenile sci-fi flick is okay for \\"kiddies\\" that do not discriminate against bad movies. Godzilla appears as a bizarre antihero that protects the innocent and saves humanity. The special effects add to the chuckles of viewers who understand the unique appeal of cheesy movies. Joel and the robots of MST3K fame once gave this film the royal treatment. When the giant monsters bat a large rock back and forth like a volleyball...well, you get the idea. Sensible viewers beware. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good, But Lacking","review":"Here the story is king. The story is very well written and every thing is excellent, except there is not that much Godzilla in this film. He doesn't show up until the end. In most Showa Godzilla movies, definitely in the other series, they show him at the beginning as well, but not here. The lack of the big G hurts the movie at times because the story becomes dull at some parts when you are waiting for G's arrival.I am a huge Godzilla fan for 18 years, and I have now seen and own 22 of the 28 Godzilla movies, not including the American Godzilla movie also known as GINO. Out of all of those, this is not the worst, but actually one of the best in the Showa series just for the incredible story and special effects that this movie had for it's time. But if you want to see the big G a lot, this won't be something for you. Like I said, Godzilla doesn't come out until the end of the movie; and the wait for him to show up can be dull at times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster","review":"This movie was purchased for a friend's birthday.

It is dullsville."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dissappointment","review":"This film makes the biggest mistake any film can make. It makes a giant radioactive dinosaur stepping on terrorists boring. The human plot is execrable and Godzilla takes ages to do anything. Mothra is absolutely wasted in it as well, completely motionless until the end. Ebirah is a moderately interesting Kaiju with a few brief fights. A giant condor is also just... there at on point.This film is a cure for insomnia and is best skipped over for better Showa films, like Mothra vs. Godzilla or Invasion of Astro-Monster"},{"rating":"2","title":"inuyasha!!!godzilla!!!!Dragon ball Z!!!bond!!!fan.

And it's great. Seven songs with an average length of 8 minutes, and not a weak track among them. The album opens with Culley On Bleecker Street, a catchy, uptempo song about a chance encounter with a New York waitress. Oversight, the second and weirdest track on the album, has two different moods, a hardrocking chorus with a freefloatin' refrein. It has just four lines of lyrics, but they say it all: Funny how my life went by, could it be it's an oversight?Well, I could go on and on about the other songs, such as the dark, moody and despairing Wintersong and the beautiful Hope You Don't Mind, or revell in the sound and splendid guitarsolo's, but you get my point: this is one of the best albums I've ever heard, a prog-rock gem. And this is only their first album! Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing terrain & amazing people","review":"A facinating read of a little known history.

Step-by-step specific instructions are scarce. Still, I give this book 4 stars because I really like the projects. I also like being able to come up with my own colors and painting rather than paint by the numbers. I can tell you that the materials that they tell you to use for the mechanical parts are right on.

Better products are made with polypropylene which is more stable and less controversial."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, but so do other things less expensive","review":"Ok...this thing works, but not that well, and definitely not any better than several alternatives.It is nothing but a wide-mouthed funnel with handle. If you compare pricing of normal kitchen funnels to this, you find that it is quite pricey. If you have a 'perfect fit' at the neck with your carafe, chances are, you'll end up with a vapor seal that will prevent it from letting the coffee drip into the carafe, anyhow.I bought one, and while somewhat inexpensive for a 'coffee maker', it is nothing but a glorified funnel. It is a pricey funnel, too. As for taste of coffee, it makes just as good of coffee as you can find a grind for, and get your proportions right.Myself, I still love my Mr. Coffee Coffeemaker 10-to-1 over this thing. After all, what is $0.02 of electricity, anyhow?"},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong size","review":"The product seems good and I will use it. However, I bought it with a thermos that recommended getting it with a size 4, and they sent me a size 6 item, which looks huge on the small carafe.

I would have preferred the size 4, but don't want to go through the hassle of returning the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Please do not waste your money on this so called coffee maker.

It was easy to pack (along with half a box of #6 filters) and easy to use and made good coffee.Some reviews complained that it ran slowly - we didn't have any trouble with that. The cone we got did have ridges in the bottom to keep the filter from forming a vacuum.The disk at the bottom of the drip cone (which holds it up from the container) is a little less than 3\\" across. It's designed for a thermos but we didn't have any trouble balancing it on the edge of a small French press. There's a spout underneath that extends from the disk 1.5\\".It takes a little experimentation to decide the amount of grounds and water to put in.

The chapters cover literally everything from divination to prophecy to Y2K preparations (not to mention the significance of the year MM to McDonalds Corporation), but I couldn't bring myself to anything bigger than a quaint smile.This book is not for the devout believers. Do notice than in Garner's dictionary, the words \\"eschatological\\" and \\"scathological\\" are separated only by a single syllable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the joke?","review":"Garner concludes his analysis of the book of Revelation (in particular) by correlating its vision with the persecution of Christians under Nero. This banal and misdirected exegesis eases his conscience over having to take the myriad of apocalyptic visions of the scriptures (Isaiah 24-27, Jeremiah 30, Psalm 83, Daniel 7-12, Zechariah 12-14, Zephaniah 3, Joel 2, Matthew 24, II Thessalonians 2, etc...) seriously. If you want to mock the scriptures, Mr. Garner, go right ahead. We live in a free country. However, there is no reason to alleviate eschatological tension by revealing that the Bible \\"doesn't really teach an imminent Armageddon.\\" It does, and I don't think any honest invidual could deny it, regardless of the commentaries to be found in his library."},{"rating":"1","title":"There'll always be a McDonald's","review":"What started out as a great story finished as an agit-prop piece for PETA.

The story is quirky and fun, however Liss uses the story to present his radical and outdated beliefs on the treatment of animals in medical research.

I liked the unique setup - a young man selling encyclopedias happens upon something dangerous and has to deal with the consequences. It was a quick read but pretty superficial.I felt like two different people were writing. Some of the scenes were interesting and well-drawn. Others were awkward and choppy. I appreciated the ethics of the book as a vegan myself, but the author wasn't very subtle with it, and it was just thrown in with no effort at subtlety. Also the protagonist's romantic interest was a little forced.I would read more by Liss because he has potential, but I would suggest that readers who are interested in his books try a different one than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a good point but not well written","review":"David Liss is one of my favorite authors but his talent remained hidden from the pages of \\"The Ethical Assassin.\\" I agree with Liss's political views so I really wish he was able to pull off the storyline more successfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland with a dash of Self-righteousness","review":"To preface, I think Liss is a great author and I really loved his first novel,A Conspiracy of Paper: A Novel (Ballantine Reader's Circle)was fantastic and completely riveting. I picked up this book in a discount bin, and I understand why it was there.The story isn't entirely uninteresting, but he frequently substitutes a rant for a story. Liss seemed more interested in telling me what he wanted me to think rather than telling me a story. It made the characters completely one dimensional.Ultimately, if you want to read a mishmash of a novel and animal rights propaganda, get this book. If you want a great story with fantastic writing and interesting characters, try one of his other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"a message wrapped in pulp fiction","review":"I am a fan of David Liss and have read a number of his books.

A comparison with Carl Hiaasen is valid for this read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good","review":"as his other three. The appeal of this novel relies on a kind of stylized notalgia for the early 80's. But the characters are not likable for the most part. Even the main character has not much depth, and it's a constant irritant throughout that he is narrating parts of the story that he could not know about. The book wants to build the narrrative around the main character's internal reaction to events-- but this guy swings back and forth between extreme terror, and extreme smugness at about 100 mph, it's hard to even keep up with the emotional continuity. However, I did look forward to reading it a bit each night, because the story was engaging and I wanted to know how it camme out. I will certainly continue to buy more from David Liss, based on past performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bait and switch","review":"This book pissed me off.

The author poses one interesting idea, although not new, and several minor ideas. Unfortunately, every character is one-dimensional and all appear to be political cliches from NARAL literature. I would like to see a book that somehow combines the competing virtures and vices in both sides of this controversy. The best I can recommend is a reading of this book with an equally-flawed pro-life novel, such as Deadline by Randy Alcorn. In each, the authors tend to present their side as being more human, with the other a mere cliche."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a woman's world","review":"The author does extremely well with a still controversial subject, abortion. He wanders about a bit, nevertheless writes an engaging novel.Whether you are pro-abortion or anti-abortion, it behooves you to read the book.

The book was well-written enough to compell me to finish it, despite how angry it made me (hence the rating of 2 instead of 1). I am a strong believer in life, but I can accept it when people have a pro-choice viewpoint. It's when it is \\"in my face\\" that it makes me livid. This book, although fairly well-written, was not so much a medical thriller but rather an elaborate pro-choice propaganda brochure with a cast of paper-thin characatures and bad stereotypes representing the pro-life side of the argument. Mr. Pottinger could have saved a lot of time and effort if he skipped the novel and merely stated his intended point more directly: \\" Pro-life is bad. Pro-choice is good.\\" Some of us read to be entertained, not lectured to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brain Dead Political Screed","review":"First, I agree with just about all of Mr. Pottinger's agenda. Being pro-choice is good, boming abortion clinics is bad. Not as bad, however, as his writing, which would be perfectly adequate for a comic book, but is otherwise painfully inept. The premise and plot of this worthless little book are sooo idiotic I had to groan upon figuring things out. And putting it all in the Washington DC scene is unforgivable. This thing is liquid filth.

The characters have little flesh and blood and evoke little deep emotion. The events fit together too smugly and the conversations are often awkward. And the pseudoscience spoils it all. Forced male pregnancy to make men rethink their views on abortion? A long shot and unfortunately one that fails badly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Stirring Novel","review":"This novel is exciting and inspiring.

It's seven inch length provides good reach in hand-to-hand combat, but that length costs you a little bit of control when it comes to dressing game. The knife is well-balanced in the hand, and has a good and solid heft to it. The kraton handle is grippy without being sticky, and has a nice give without being too soft.

Plank uncovered an impressive array of sources, giving immediacy to some of this history. The Mi'Kmaq Indians, often allied with the Acadians, emerge as a significant third party in this long struggle, in which periods of relative peace and cooperation alternated with military conflict and dictatorial methods.

Do NOT mistake this book for a scholarly work or one that makes a serious effort at discussing ways to reform science education or teaching methods.

Believing evolution is wrong because you have read this book is like believing there is a pink elephant in the room because you have taken lsd. Your mind has been tricked.Wells' argument is also fundamentally anti-biblical. For example, Wells believes the \\"Cambrian explosion\\" is evidence of an error in Darwinism because (according to wells) new species were created during this time. However, this means that God must have engaged in a SECOND act of creation. He created plants and animals, they existed on earth for some many years, and then he intervened again to create new plants and animals.

In recent interviews, Mr. Wells has been quoted as suggesting that America needs to be cleansed of evolutionists as it has been cleansed of communists in the past. It's too bad Mr. Wells has to inject politics into science. Scientific research is based on objectivity, and the fossil record is not a \\"Democrat\\" or \\"Republican.\\" Unfortunately for Mr. Wells, the fossil record shows spectacular examples of intermediate forms in horses, whales, and, yes, humans.

It's a completely bogus piece of charlatan poop serving no purpose but to seperate a sucker from his money.

But for the many people who are not strong in thier scientific background, this book is designed (not so intelligently) to mislead and misinform. True to the cultural movement it represents, this book is breathtakingly inane."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darwinists/ Evolutionists have lied to and deceived us for years","review":"This is a great book to add to your library if you are interested at all about the way evolution cheated us from the truth. I once believed in evolution until I gained more knowledge and discovered the weak basis and lack of evidence that evolutionists teach students through textbooks, periodicals, and scientific books. It is always been a one sided viewpoint in the scientific circles, anyone who is not an evolutionist or a supporter of Darwin's belief is an outsider. If you raise your questions against the teachers of evolution, you will be attacked or labeled a name to try to discredit you. It's time to wake up and hear the truth that this book is presenting. Don't allow those evolutionists to silence you and keep you blinded forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Good Book on Science...","review":"If you read only one good book on science this year it won't be this one.Icons is written by Jonathan Wells whose only real job appears to be with a Public Relations company in Seattle that is promoting Intelligent Design and is a waste of anyone's hard earned money.I will never again read a book from an author with a Ph.D that does not have a Jo.BAnd I don't expect the DVD/video to be any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon ...","review":"What a silly book this is. You simply cannot critisize a scientific theory only by judging high school texts about it. What is said here about evolutionary theory could just as well be said about astronomy or geology. Of course issues are simplified in high school text books, since understanding the theories thoroughly would require years of dedicated study.In short: the purpose of this book eludes me. That errors and simplifications in public presentations of evolution theory would diminish it is nothing but a straw man argument... and a very transparant one too. Someone must already heavily dislike that theory already to fall for it (...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Same Arguments Rehashed","review":"At first it appears that this is a new view of evolution with new arguments against it. Wells has collected so called evidence from the mainstream and peer-reviewed scientific literature, and attempts to use it to show the falsity of Darwinism. What he fails to mention is that the \\"evidence\\" is selectively quoted and most of it has been refuted. His arguments are based on such examples as the infamous comparative vertebrate embryo diagrams, long ago known to be doctored, but he fails to mention that current authentic embryo photos support the same conclusion. Argument after argument is a rehash of creationist dogma clothed in new scientific sounding language. His conclusion is the same as other creationists, science is a big conspiracy and is all wrong about everything! If you buy that, then buy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's wrong with Argos???","review":"Stan \\"take the red pill\\" Argos should be ashamed of himself. Since when has a person's religious beliefs had anything to do with a scientific argument? Obviously Argos is a witchhunter who can't come up with an intelligent argument against a book he disagrees with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moonie Science or Scientific Moonieism?","review":"Wells is on record as saying that he went back to school to destroy Darwinism for \\"the Father\\" (Rev. Moon). The theme of the book is that evolution is wrong because the author can pick flaws in high school text books. More often than not these \\"flaws\\" are distortions by Wells rather than genuine errors. Using the same logic, we might say the earth is flat because there are bad high school geography books in circulation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crackpot Science & Crackpot Theology","review":"Just out of curiosity I bought this book to see what Wells had to say. As a 30 year practicing scientist and Christian - DON'T waste your money. Not a single one of Wells' arguments/evidence is real. This is a half-baked theologian/scientist writing with a fundamentalist Moonie obsession that won't let him accept any reality accept his own. I couldn't stop shaking my head as I read.... I can't beleive this guy is serious! oh well, it would have been good for a laugh, except there are some people who actually will think this book is true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Satirical Look at Science","review":"This book is a waste of time as it does not address any issues from a scientific standpoint, arguments are simply 'madeup'. Before reading this book, make sure to read reviews from independent sources, not just from reviews on the cover or from religious sources. Reviews from the scientific community are more than enough to keep this from being read. On top of that, several scientific sources who were cited in the book say they were either misquoted or half-quoted. A waste of time for anyone looking for real insight into evolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a very scientific book","review":"this book is clearly more political statement than anything else. its purpose seems to be to try and confuse the public about what evolution is and how strong the evidence is for it. i would not reccomend this book to anyone who wants to understand the facts of evolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change from the traditional fantasy style","review":"I must admit, when i picked up this book, I thought it was going to be another Tolkien rip-off like so many books are now, but i was pleasantly surprised. I've not read the first book in this series, but i don't think the book lost anything with this. At a glance, it is a strange style that the author has used, deciding to write in the present tense, but is effective when you get the hang of it. The lack of deep themes and morals is made up for by some fantastic scenes and original ideas. The start does drag on, however, and the annoyingly-happy ending is a bit predictable. The poetry and songs in the book are quite good though, if you read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I guess I just can't get into this \\"series\\" after reading Robert Jordan, Terry Brooks, and others. My idea of a series follows one or a couple main characters throughout the entire story. Recluce books do not!! They are confusing to read. Things happen inthe story and you have no idea how they happened. I have read the first and second books of this series and will most likely not read any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"Modesitt had a purpose for this book -- he wanted to explain how and why Recluce was settled, and why the black magicians keep the politics they do. This gives the book more substance than the average fantasy book, and I liked it a lot.The author takes things way too fast in the first 50 pages, though, where he'll spend 3/4-page on a fragment of a conversation between characters that haven't been introduced yet, in order to fill in some piece of history. He continues this until his hero gets old enough to control events. My advice: read the first 50 pages fast, pick up the flavor of events, and savor the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!","review":"This is an awful book. It's very confusing (the confusion started before the story did, when it was said that this was the 3rd book in the series, and the second was \\"upcoming\\"). Next, a crudload of new characters was dumped in there with no reference to the others, and it was made as boring as possible. Read the first one, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty awful fantasy","review":"First off, I'm very uncritical about fantasy generally. I've even read tons of TSR paperbacks without getting sick. So I think a bad review of a fantasy book from me says quite a bit. Secondly, I greatly enjoyed the first book in this series, The Magic of Recluce, which diverged from typical fantasy in pleasant ways. Unfortunately, this book is typical fantasy...but written badly too boot. You have your sex-hungry, macho, magically gifted future-ruler, your good-looking female lead who can defeat the brawniest swordsman after a few weeks of training and runs from a life of privelege to join the male lead, you have your totally inept bad guys who keep throwing bigger and badder stuff at the leads, only to fail. This formula gets tiresome after a while, but it's pretty bad when it's in such obvious use. Hopefully this is not telling of Modesitt's later books in the series - I will never know because I gave up after this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A terriffic allegory","review":"This book, the second in the series of the Saga of Recluse, explains the world we live in today in a way that is so easy to understand.

The contrived \\"factual\\" rationalization for her position was as predictible as it was silly. This is a novel long on overly emotional protagonists drenched in self absorbed angst and prolix, confession prone bad guys, but short on rational plot development.

These are old recordings, but most sound pretty good--think the Victor recordings of Tommy Johnson, vs. the poorer quality Paramount recordings.But I'm here in part to say that all the tracks on this compilation are also available on the \\"Fixin' To Die\\" compilation if that one happens to be cheaper or more available whenever you read this review."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best album from the most underrated blues man ever","review":"Bukka White is right there at the top of my list of favorite bluesmen with Skip James and Howlin' Wolf. This collection contains all his early recordings in the 30's and 40's when he was at his best. Every song on here is great including classics Parchman Farm Blues, Shake 'Em on Down, and Fixin' to Die Blues, but my favorites are some of the lesser known cuts such as District Attorney Blues, When Can I Change My Clothes, and Special Stream Line. If you like acoustic blues and you aren't familiar with Bukka White, you need to be. Check out his YouTube video performing Aberdeen Mississippi Blues and you will be blown away by the aura this guy had."},{"rating":"2","title":"a real garage rock classic","review":"From start to finish, Little Steven's comp grabs the best of some stellar unsung garage bands and puts them on one disc.

I didn't understand any of it. The short story makes absolutely no sense at all. It is one big almost orgie. I found it frustrating and left me confused. I won't bother with any of her other works if this is what they are like.The remaining stories were uninteresting really and barely memoriable. Although I did find a couple of small chuckles mixed in them. MaryJanice Davidson's Dead Girls Don't Dance would have to have been the most amusing of the three only because of the airhead, queen of the undead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cravings","review":"I read the book in one sitting--as my husband would say I inhaled it. All four of the authors are some of my favorite.I am a big Laurell K Hamilton fan, but was a little disappointed in her contribution to this book. If you had never read any of her Anita Blake Series this story would not make any sense to you. I got to the end and thought --- AND????. It must be a lead in to her new book that is coming out but this did not make a good anthology story at all.MaryJanice Davidson's story \\"Dead Girls Don't Dance\\" was funny, warm, and romantic. It tied in with her book \\"Undead & Unwed\\" which was also very witty, fun read.Eileen Wilks' \\"Originally Human\\" was a sensual, imaginative story.Rebecca York's \\"Burning Moon\\" was super. I have not read one of her books yet that I didn't like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incubus Dreams","review":"The Laurell K. Hamilton contribution to this collection is taken directly from her book Incubus Dreams. What a rip off for Anita Blake fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cravings","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I\\"ve read all of Laurell Hamiltons books and am now starting on MaryJanice Davidson. I was disappointed to find that there was no continuation of the other two writers characters as I found them to be very interesting and would have liked to read more about them."},{"rating":"2","title":"when you just can't get enough","review":"Like many laurell Hamilton fans, I can barely wait between publications of her vampire series...and her faerie series is only an appetizer. If you love Anita and her sexy little boy toys you must read this book. I was surprised to find that I enjoyed the other three stories as much as I did \\"Blood Upon My Lips\\" -- so now I have three new authors to try out before September when the new Hamilton book comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you've read Incubus Dreams","review":"I got this hoping to see a new Anita Blake story, but unfortunately, it was an excerpt from Incubus Dreams. The other stories did not live up to Laurell K Hamilton's high standard. The writing for the other stories was juvenile and went from \\"I'm not human\\" to \\"have sex with me anyway\\" in a ridiculously short time. If you're looking for supernatural stories with good character development and excellent plots with a side of steamy sex, just stick to the Anita Blake and Meredith Gentry series by Hamilton and skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"LKH disappoints once again","review":"I borrowed this book from a friend, because I didn't want to waste more money another LKH book.I was disappointed once again at her poor showing of the Anita Blake Universe. The Anita Blake series used to be more about slaying and less about sex, now you can't pick up an Anita Blake book without it being 99% sex.I was also disappointed that LKH didn't even take the time to write a short story, just shoved some chapters in from her new book coming out.Does she not care that some of her fans wanted a new story of Anita Blake hopefully in the old style and not just a teaser for her new book.As for the other authors in the book, I haven't read them so I honestly can't review them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a short story ...","review":"The offering by Laurell K. Hamilton is a chapter from her new book Incubus Dreams. The only reason I bought this book was for her short story, only to find out that it's in her new book, so now I've read it twice (I've already read Incubus Dreams). As far as the other authors' works - I cannot comment. I just wish publishers would let a person know that it's a chapter from a book coming out a few months after."},{"rating":"1","title":"One out of Four Ain't Bad? Is it?","review":"Don't waste your money on this one. The only one worth reading is by MaryJanice Davidson. This book is 8 dollars and it is not worth 2.The anita story is so dumb, I am tired of all the weird boyfriends, not to mention girlfriends. Hamilton writes a good book, but her short stories are not so hot.Eileen Wilks is one author I have never read before. I did not care at all for the story. With a name like cravings and 3 good authors we should get at least 3 good stories.But Rebecca york even lets us down. I loved all the moon books. Witching Moon was my favorite. However, when they say a wolf mates for life, I thought he mated for his life. Obviously with this story we learn he mates for her life. I felt she let us down on this one.DEAD GIRLS DON'T DANCE is funny and gives us a glimpse of her next book. UNDEAD AND UNEMPLOYED. So for my part MaryJanice Davidson is still a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"York is always good","review":"I bought the book because of Rebecca York. I'd just finished her three moon books and wanted more. The short story here was a nice addition, and I hope there will be more of these werewolf stories.Originally Human, by Eileen Wilks, was my second favorite. Her characters kept my interest and she had a spark of humor. I'd really like to know more about the sorcerer, Cullen, if she gets back to this realm, and I can see lots of room for expanding on the story of the two characters here - I *want* to know what happens to them next.Mary Davidson's story was good. I haven't read her before, but ads for her books looked interesting.I was disappointed in the Hamilton story. In fact, I didn't read it all the way through. It started interestingly enough, but went downhill, seemingly more about sex than story, unfortunately.Still worth the money for the other three, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Pool","review":"I love LKH and will definitely be buying her next Anita novel. But I bought THIS book expecting to get a short story about my favorite characters. A short story has a beginning, a middle, and an END. Nowhere on this book does it say one word about her offering being an excerpt from the upcoming Incubus Dreams. Her story is called \\"Blood Upon My Lips\\" and is presented in a short story anthology, but it isn't a short story at all. I think that is a gross misrepresentation and dirty pool on Ms. Hamilton's part. If she wanted to advertise for her newest novel that's fine, but we should have been able to make an informed choice before spending eight bucks. Instead we are just left hanging and got as little satisfaction from our encounter with Anita, Nathaniel, and Damian as they did.Hopefully, the other stories will make up for being rooked by LKH. I haven't read them yet because I was so mad after reading her story I pitched the book over the back of the couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I just bought and read this book. The Hamilton story seemed very famaliar then I realized it was from Incubus Dreams. The other stories were ok. I wouldn't have bought this if Hamilton didn't have a story in it.

Difficult to read, full of 1970s impossible to comprehend propaganda. Almost seems like the crazy right-wing wrote it, there is so much to object to. How on earth is artificial insemination a subject for kids, and if it was, surely there is a less textbook, more creative positive way to portray it?? Surely. At best, this book is an artifact of good intentions, and little more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for restoring this book's Amazon Rank","review":"Amazon has removed this book from the list of books with \\"adult\\" content and restored its Amazon Ranking.

The latter contains no mention of artificial insemination or any other particularly controversial subjects. It is a sweet story in which Heather attends her first day of school and joins her class in talking about their families and drawing their pictures. All kinds of families are represented in this book, and Heather and her mothers are represented as a normal loving family. Also, an informative note from the author explains her reasons for changing the text for the tenth anniversary edition, which addresses the problems some reviewers had with the book as it was originally written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it, hated it","review":"I recently got \\"married\\" to my wyfe. Her 4 yo daughter is trying to understand, but she lives with her father who is less than encouraging. We bought this as an aid for her and had 2 problems. 1, the names were hard to pronounce and grasp for her-we have never met anyone who were so named.2, she did not have the benefit of being conceived as shown, so we needed to alter it some. I would love to see another book about the subject, one a child can truely grasp, more easily read by the child or to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heather has two mommies","review":"I think this book has a wonderful message that every child's family is different. I really liked how it showed that the children in the daycare drew pictures of their families. I was DISAPPOINTED in how much detail the book went into with artificial insemination. This book is rated for all age groups, this is outrageous. I am a preschool teacher and I would never read the details of the book, despite the overall message. I think the authors could have left the adult language and details out while still maintaining their message."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books to read about LGBT Families","review":"Honestly, this is not a book that i would choose for my son to read. I'm an out-gay man who adopted an infant ten years ago. It's just not a good quality book for the apparent age-range targeted. The black-and-white drawings do not make it attractive and Alternative/Artificial Insemination is not a topic of interest to kids that age or necessarily appropriate. It's certainly not a book that my son has ever picked off the bookshelves for me to read to him or for him to read to himself. Books like One Dad, Two Dads,\\" \\"The Duke Who Outlawed Jellybeens (or is it Rainbows?),\\" and \\"Two Moms, the Zark, and Me\\" are the books that he keeps going back to, reading on his own, asking me to read them, or sharing with his friends. Just because a book is written by us about us does not make it a good quality book."},{"rating":"2","title":"10th Edition does NOT include insemination info","review":"Several of the one-star reviews here refer to a different edition of this book. This edition (10) does not have anything about artificial insemination (to appease those who were offended). It is just a simple story showing lots of different families... not very in depth, not much to it, but a nice, \\"feel good\\" story line. I did not see ANY overt sexuality or \\"inappropriate\\" topics at all, as was mentioned by one or two of the other reviewers. I have not seen other editions so I cannot comment about those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be in color, but an important book to consider","review":"The illustrations should be in color to interest children.The edition I have does not have the artificial insemination part. While controversial, that part would be important for older children.It was not shocking at all; just straightforward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates more questions than it answers","review":"The book's appearance and story line are both lighthearted and gentle with the underlying message that acceptance is the highest of all virtues. This approach will probably work for a typical 5 year old child in a Lesbian led household - especially a girl child. If the child is a boy and/or approachng 8 or 9 years old, the hard questions start coming and this book pretends these questions will never be asked.Doesn't everyone have a father, somewhere? Who is my father? What is he like? Where is he? Does he know about me? Does he care about me? Why don't I know? Why don't you know, Mommy?Mommy, when you grew up you lived with your Daddy, why don't I?When I grow up, should I live with a man or a woman? Why? How/when will I know? Does it matter?

She also praises divorcees, like if a broken family was special and good for the children. Stop lying Ms Newman.Satan has deluded millions of people into believing the lie that homosexuality is nothing but an alternative lifestyle and that society can redefine marriage as it pleases, and feed these lies to our children. But this will bring consequences. Remember what happened in the days of Lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Heather","review":"Heather gonna need alot of therapy. This book is expensive.

Too young to have to tell them about Sodom and Gomorrah? Then why are they not too young to be told about homosexuality? Those kids are too young to have to be told about the sins spoken of in this book Don't like what I said, then tell it to God as he wrote about it in his Book, if anyone is interested in reading that book instead of this one. I bet most of the people who read this book have never read the Bible and if they did, they just try to explain away the sin of homosexuality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Activism Cloaked as a Children's Storybook","review":"I have a sister-in-law who is a lesbian and I was searching for a resource to help explain this to my 3 year old son. It's not a children's story at all. It's a political statement. The plot is boring and the black and white drawings are not at all engaging. They do little to support the story line. There is too much sexuality for young children. After reading this nonsense, I understand why so many people wish to ban it!

I came away with an understanding of what her life was like and I greatly appreciated that aspect of the book.

It is a flimsy paperback with poor quality photos. I know McFarland is a tiny publishing house but when you spend almost $40 you expect a little more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the cash","review":"Almost all of the women written about here are b-movie stars and after reading this book it's not hard to see why they never became bigger stars. Based on what the authors tell us they didn't lead very interesting lives and although they claim their film roles were memorable I never heard of half of the movie mentioned. Killer Tomatoes is written very much in the style of the 1950s fan magazines. The gals are all portrayed as saints and victims and you are only given a glimpse into their private lives. I would have like to have learned a lot more about who they dated, who they hated, who was addicted to what! A lot of writers think a stars private business is none of our business but then why write the book? My other big problem is with the photographs. They are all grainy, low quality images. I am not going to complain about Jane Russell's rambling forward because she is in her eighties and I'm sure that was just added on to sell a few more books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"Its bad enough when 'writers' rewrite stories with nothing new to add. Its worse when important parts of the stories are left out. THere is absolutely nothing new in any of these stories, and I agree with the comment about Jane Russell's \\"introduction\\". The poor old lady probably didn't read this boring stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stuff that Dreams are Made of","review":"I highly recommend this book to any classic movie lover. It is well-researched, informative, and entertaining. Unlike several other books of its kind, the two authors, in addition to covering the actresses' personal lives, also take the pains to explore and discuss the characters whom these women portrayed. In several instances, they lift direct dialogue from the films themselves to elaborate on their roles. What is the end result after reading this volume? Like me, I think you may find yourself trying to see as many of these films as you can! I anxiously await future writings from both Laura Wagner and Ray Hagen."},{"rating":"2","title":"These Tough Dames are tops","review":"I've always been partial to the so-called dames rather than the ladies in movies. Don't get me wrong I love Katharine Hepburn and other ladies, but for my money the brassy dames of the films always gave as good as she got--and then some. This book includes some of my all-time favorites: Jane Russell, Lucille Ball--yes, it's important to remember that before Lucille became \\"Lucy\\" she was one of the best tough broads in pictures in films like \\"Dance, Girl, Dance\\" and \\"The Big Street\\", Joan Blondell, Ida Lupino and especially Barbara Stanwyck--I can't think of an American actress who combined so well toughness on the outside with a thick layer of vulnerability on the inside. The profiles are wonderful and I even learned a few new facts that I never knew before. I highly recommend these Killer Tomatoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"great bios on the tough ladies!","review":"This is one of the best books I've read on the tougher ladies of old movies. I publish books for a living, and I'm sorry I missed getting my hands on this one for publication! The photos are pristine, as are the choices for sheer entertainment value. The biographies aren't the straight, boring \\"and then she played in this\\" kind. Thoughtful, well-researched and layered with a humor that doesn't go out of its way to be funny.

Imagine a product with the ability to fold and store like a soft pad yet play and feel similar to a hard pad. It has an insert which goesin the middle of the pad and keeps it from sliding around. It has a sticky bottom which also helps keep it in place. The buttons are raised so you can feel where they are without having to look down and they are the most accurate of all soft pads I've ever played on, which says a lot because I've played on about 10 different types/brands of pads. I've had my red octane for over a year and it's still working great. I recommend it to all of my friends and many of them have purchased and love this pad."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you really like DDR, buy a metal pad instead.","review":"Pros:-much better than the flimsy standard pad-more stable and solid base-still portableCons:-from personal experience this pad will eventually start to misfire. The button(s) that misfire(s) varies, and so does the behavior (the button may not respond or it may just repeatedly act like it's being stepped on). Regardless of whether it's being used for xbox or ps2, this happens to most people. Just search the internet for gripes-based on the above, this pad should not cost more than $60.00 based on its life expectancy. $100.00 is too much money for something that breaks down within a few months.Bottomline:If you really like DDR and you're using it to workout, I recommend that you just buy a metal dance pad for $200. Yes, it is twice the price, but it's better than wasting $100 for something that only partially works after a relatively short amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor construction results in useless product","review":"I purchased one of these pads a month and a half before christmas as a gift. Everyone loved it at first and we purchased a second pad so two people could play at once. Within 20 days after christmas, the first pad started demonstating operation problems: buttons not functioning when pressed and buttons sticking. About a month and a half after we purchased the second one, it too started showing the same problems. We purchased these pads in large part to the excellent reviews here. Apparently, these reviews were in reaction to the version 1 pad which appears to have a much longer life. At $100 a pad, having them die within a month or two seems like a huge rip-off. 100% failure rate within a few months is way too high. I'd suggest looking for another pad rather than purchasing this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleh","review":"Broke within the first three days >( Would not suggest this product. Go the another way if you want a quality pad for your DDR needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"so soft","review":"This pad is great I have used others in the past but nothing ceompares to the red octane hard foam pad. the raised arrow buttons make playing even more comfortable. The red octane foam pad is the top pad when it comes to dance dance revolution"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long lasting and lots of fun","review":"We bought this Dance pad over 6 years ago and it is still working perfectly!Though most of the arrows are covered in electrical tape, it is still in really good working condition. It just rips a little after such hard play and long years.Dancing on this is wonderful, it doesn't move (on carpet), and it helps improve scores immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES! The Perfect pad for an affordable price!","review":"The RedOctane Ignition pad is said to be the best pad besides the metal pad, it is hard and stiff, and arcade DDR players like me, say it is a really good price, and efficient. Do not worry about buying a huge 169$ metal pad, when you can buy a 50$ ignition pad that has as good quality as a metal? Buy this now! BUY IT! BUY IT! BUY IT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this pad","review":"I bought this pad and the second day of using it, the back arrow stopped working, we returned it and got another thinking it was just a faulty pad, the second pad's back arrow stopped working after playing it for one hour. I am extremely frustrated after paying $100 for it. You'd think it would live up to the price you have to pay for it. I'm going to try something cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted for awhile . . .","review":"These were awesome for awhile. I have two, and one stopped working altogether within a few months and the other one sort of works. The buttons start to stick, which makes it frustrating to play when you keep getting a bad score after you know you did well. I hope they come out with something better. For a good price would be a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"RedOctane Ignition 2.0 pad great -- 3.0 pad was terrible!","review":"My two RedOctane Ignition 2.0 pads lasted at least a year each, under heavy use conditions. Even when children ripped the surface of one, a little piece of duct tape (don't laugh!) fixed it fine. It was the most responsive and accurate pad I owned, with the exception of a Cobalt Flux metal pad.When one of my 2.0 pads finally wore out, I bought a new 3.0 pad. It's terrible! It lasted about 2 hours before dying. The foam button pads, NOT accessible via the zipper, moved around. Two of them even overlapped, so it was impossible to hit the up/forward button without hitting the left button.I highly recommend AVOIDING the 3.0 pad until this problem is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working after 3 days","review":"Our experience may be a fluke, but the pad starting acting funny after just 3 days. You could stand still in the middle and the pad was rapidly sending signals to the game as if we were trying to make a selection. We couldn't get it to stop doing this, so we couldn't play anymore and had to return it. If not for this total malfunction, then the pad would have been pretty good. Although they claim the raised edges allow you to tell if you're stepping on the arrows without looking down, they are not raised very much. So, this feature is not worth advertising on that point alone. We're still searching for a reliable pad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for 5 weeks then.....","review":"I bought this pad fom my kids. Thet played it quite a bit, got pretty good, then a button started sticking. It is alot better than the BNS pads we got and returned. They didn't even wotk right out of the box. HOWEVER a pad costing $100 should last more than 5 weeks, before failure. I think this is unacceptible. Sure it is under warranty but the mean time failure (MTF)is very short. I am concerned that this one won't last either. It appears the quality of the igntion and the BNS pads have crashed. It looks like us poor consumers get burned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"pad quit working","review":"ive had 2 of the soft pads and one metal pad from red octane and they all quit working after a couple months. and ive had some of my friends' pads go out. not sure if an unlucky streak or not, but had some trouble. the pad looks nice and works fine, but then had trouble after awhile when arrows wouldn't work right. it seemed like they got stuck in down position or stopped taking input after awhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awesome, but it broke!","review":"I just got my pad today, and it was the best pad I ever used. I immediately got higher scores than I ever have before. But after about an hour of proper use (in socks, no abuse or anything) the up arrow stopped working. I have had foam pads at a quarter of the price before that may not have been quite as accurate, but at least they lasted a few months. It is not worth the high cost to get a pad where chances are it will stop working soon, if not the same day you get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignition 2.0 Incompatible with Xbox","review":"I've gone through three Ignition 2.0 Dance Pads with our Xbox and the down arrow eventually stops working properly. If you press the down arror while you have foot on the left or right arrow, the down arrow won't register. We've had three pads in 4 months and the same problem keeps happening. Called RedOctane Customer Support and they admitted that there is a bug with their pad and Xbox. I'm stuck because the pad is outside of the warranty period. The kids love the pad EXCEPT the down arrow. Basically, don't get this pad unless you're using PS2. BTW, Konami pad that came with DDR2 has been rock solid."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS is a great pad?","review":"i just bought this pad, and i'm just learning ddr.this pad is terrible. i am literally not standing on the pad, and it's constantly registering a downward press.video games and peripherals are never returnable except for the same item, so now i'm just going deal with the fact that i blew a hundred dollars on something that will not work properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bags Split","review":"Caution, I spent the $79 for these bags and have used at least 1 dozen.....so far over half have split open using med. butter cream frosting.

I like the fact that it has bars at two different heights (the higher one to assist in standing up, & the lower one to assist in rolling over in bed).I also like the adjustable strap that holds it in place, although it took me a while to figure out how to thread the strap through the buckle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool to also turn in bed","review":"Great product to help the handicapped. I have cerebral palsy and am having problems turning in my bed. This product has helped me so much. I love the lower horizontal bar that is just above the mattress. It is closer than the side of the bed. So it is easier to reach than the side of the bed (full size bed). It is wonderful!!!!!!!!!!!! The image does not show you the strap that goes around the box-spring to secure the railing. So if you have a bed skirt, be aware you will have to have the skirt scrunched up under the strap on both sides. But the benefits make it worth it!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed Rail","review":"Very happy with bed rail. Just enough to let you know it's there but not so big you can't get out of bed.

This story is alternately hilarious and harrowing, depressing and transcendent. It would make a great film, especially if they did some Toy Story-style animation for the apocalyptic action figure battle the agonized protagonist wages as a child. The best part is that it doesn't cop out with a easy redemption for our hero (also named James Gunn) at the end; he's still ....done. James Gunn, you're no flesh robot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny - and touching","review":"I didn't expect the roller coaster this book presented. I related so much to Jimmy on so many levels that in the end, I knew EXACTLY where he was coming from. I'm not an emotional type, but this one touched me deep down - and kept me laughing on the way there."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Disturbing than Compelling","review":"I hate to break stride with all these positive reviews, but I hated this book. I was compelled to finish, yes, but compelled in the same way that one is compelled to look for corpses while passing highway car accidents. What started out as a promising recount of childhood quickly digressed. There is nothing redeeming about James; not one thing that elicits sympathy from the reader about his poor, sorry excuse for a life, not even being abused by his father or the suicide of a dear friend. By the end of the book, all I could hope was that Jimmy would throw himself in front of a NYC bus while in a drug-induced haze, or O.D., or otherwise put himself (and the reader) out of his misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sad State of Contemporary Fiction","review":"This book (much like the Scooby Doo Movie which the author also penned) is silly, self involved, and NOT funny. In short: an embarasment. Where are the future Denis Johnson's of the younger generation? Where is the angst of the contemporary American novel? We have too many sellout writing program cookie cutter type writers sans balls and talent who are a blight upon the present literary landscape...give me the real guts of Bukowski...the perversity of Millers, the outlaw spirit of Burroughs...real stuff, not kid stuff like Toy Collector..send this writer back to the play pen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please enter a title for your review","review":"the strongest attributes of this book are a few outbursts that bravely narrate the reality of the kind of impotent rage championed in movies like Taxi Driver and Falling Down, and juvenile, enthusiastic sex scenes that don't skimp on the details.i would have liked the characters Nancy and Gary to have been a bit more developed and introduced earlier in the book. some chapters seem dull and unneccessary but the action does pick up in the second half."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album...","review":"I was in New Zealand in September of 2002.

Great form factor, easy to install and use software. We transferred all his CDs onto the device quickly and easily and then the wheels came off the wagon. We could see all the songs on the device but could not get any of them to play. There is no tech support number-you can only send emails which go unanswered. I had a number of folks well versed in other MP3 players look at it with no luck. I returned it to the store and they could not get it to play either. Fortunately they were willing to take it back and we exchanged for another brand. Get an iPod if you can afford it-get any other MP3.

The battery life is at leat the amout they clam. (I use rayovac 15 min recharable batteries) The recorder works very well, the only problem with the recorder is that it eats up battery life. The hold button is great.The problem with the player is that the arm band is junk. It does not come with a belt clip. though I fixed the problem with to office rings they hold the loop on the case to the loop on my jeans. The softwhere that comes with the player is only ok. it does not keep the titles on my mp3 tracks.I found it worth the money to buy the 1 gb player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"This player was a huge disappointment for the price. Here are the negatives:- Does not support WMA files, even though it says it does.- Cannot play long MP3 files - mine cuts off at about 25 minutes into the track- Support is NON-EXISTENT: I have written support e-mails 3 times in the past month and NEVER received a reply. The FAQ is unhelpful.- Very difficult to get the player to be viewable by Windows Media Player, even though it is advertised as fully compatible. I did finally get this to work, and can sync to the device from WMP, but it still does not support WMA files (they copy to the device but play back as chirps and whistles)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage - Buttons wore out in 14 mos.","review":"I loved this player until the day I really, really needed to use it for recording, when I discovered that the MODE button no longer worked. This is the button you need to use to switch from mp3 player mode to voice record, line-in record, or FM radio.The device is now permanently stuck on mp3 player mode with no ability to shuffle or repeat, which is not the worst thing in the world, except that I specifically bought it for its recording capabilities which are now, for all intents and purposes, non-existent. And 14 months after I bought it, too; conveniently post-warranty.The screws holding the case together are impossible to remove, so there's no way to attempt a DIY solution to this maddeningly simple but nonetheless irreperable device-crippling problem. This thing is of no use to me now; a $200 paperweight. I'm never buying another iRiver product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Player, only 1 Flaw","review":"I researched MP3 players for about 5 months (amazing how much technology changes in that short span of time) and finally decided on this player. It had the Flash memory, so no moving parts to worry about. It was also larger (memory wise) than its much smaller 256 KB companions. I use it for working out mostly but also enjoy it on airplanes.The only complaint I have is in regards to the shuffle feature. Every time I turn the player off, it always goes back to the same order of songs from the beginning.Beyond that this is a great deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little device","review":"I bought this for several reasons...1- I like replaceable (rechargeable)batteries.2- This thing has GREAT battery life.3- It has great recording options.4- Small, light, easy to use anywhere, and comes with all the accessories you need (case, neck carry tie, gym armband).It's not as fancy an interface as the iPod, but I think the features (FM Radio and recording options) make this a serious option if you are looking to do more than just play songs.I have used the Line In to record Podcasts, and it works just fine (I used a Yamaha MG10/2 mixer and took it's output to the iRiver)... Sounds great!Only cons are you need to use the iRiver Music Manager or MS Media Player to get songs on the device (it's not like a drive-based file system plug-n-play, drag and drop).Limited playlist support. And it's a bit pricey.If this meets your needs, I highly recommend this product. It also SOUNDS better (at least to me) than my iPod nano."},{"rating":"2","title":"The coolest little gadget I own","review":"I have had this MP3 player for about 6 months and I love it! The sound is awesome and I have also made use of the recording capibilty which is pretty cool. The battery life is pretty good on a single AA battery at around 30 hours. There is a FM radio tuner that is OK, but I never really use that. The size and weight are reasonable for such a useful little gadget. I also think the design is pretty durable with regards to the buttons and the control stick. The one exception to that is the little door that covers the usb connection, but that does not bother me as I usually have the player in the soft case that is included or a harder case I bought separately . The arm band that comes with this bites though. If you don't mind dropping another $20 there is a sports armband that you can buy that is really good. Overall I love this player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disapointing","review":"Over the years, I have been a great fan of Aaron Neville, but I cannot recommend this CD.

I first listened to it in the car line waiting to pick my daughter up from school. The music started, and all my tension just drifted out the window. This CD should be a must have for anyone who is stressed out and trying to find a little relaxation. My usual chatty 10 year old was quiet on the ride on home. When asked why, she simply said, \\"I love this music!!!\\" Young or old, you will love this soulful CD filled with the beauty of Aaron Neville's one-of-a kind voice.

Without question, you cannot go wrong purchasing this CD. I highly recommend it and I don't usually recommend CDs because everyone's taste is so subjective. This CD works on so many levels: if you are coming home from a hard day at work; if you are having dinner with that special someone; or just having a casual dinner with friends. Like they say about Mr. Neville, built like a liner backer but with the voice of an angel."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is not one of his best albums.","review":"Aaron Neville has a beautiful and unique voice. I have enjoyed several of his albums, such as Warm Your Heart, Grand Tour, Tattooed Heart, Devotion, Soulful Christmas, and some others with his brothers. Unfortunately, I did not enjoy his renditions of \\"The Great American Songbook\\" songs included in this CD. Perhaps, the Jazz tempo and the mood in which he sings these songs were too different and slow for me. These beautiful songs are usually interpreted with a faster tempo by many singers.If you love the soul and R&B; style of Aaron Neville, I recommend you to preview this album before you buy it since you may not like the style he uses in this particular album. If you are not very familiar with Aaron Neville, I recommend Grand Tour, Tattooed Heart, and Devotion instead of this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE NEW NEVILLE","review":"Aaron Neville's \\"problem\\" (sorry) has always been his one-of-a-kind voice.

Through many interviews with black people around the country, Harrington provides a vivid picture of race in America. His most important point is that all black people do not share the same views on politics, economics, and racism. The only ciriticism that comes to mind is that his book is too optimistic. Harrington insinuates that one day racism can be overcome. This comes after countless off-the-collar, racist comments from various white people he meets (one from a young boy playing basketball).

If Cleckler had given only the solution, the reader would wonder, \\"Why bother?\\" But the 2 together make a solid case.There's an abundance of documentation and detail, in places too much. Just skip over the heavier tables and graphs. Better too much detail than not enough. I don't agree with Cleckler about renaming the letters of the alphabet, or including 35 pages of sample text in NuEnglish when 5 pages would have been plenty. And that sample text showed inconsistent and sloppy use of NuEnglish, but that criticism is more of a quibble when considering the scope of his work.

For a first time book it was fairly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The quintessence of romantic vampires: Byron","review":"I personally thought this book to be very good. The book had its weak points and its strong points. The weak ones were the ending, the fact that the whole book is basically narration, and perhaps my wish to see Rebecca become a vampire. It all seems strange that he would tell her the story of his vampiric conception only to soften the blow of death. Yet, the good qualities of this book make up for its weaknesses and then some. The flow of Byrons journies are so immensely intruiging, that I couldn't put the book down. Many orignal and unexplored areas were ventured upon in this novel. Such as vampires who can exist during the light of day and their sexual indulgences by night. This book is exceptional and I would recommend it to any classicist or romantic like myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Vampyre?","review":"First of all I am confuesed: Do I really have the same book?

This book was fluff, and not the kind you combine with peanut butter it was fluff that fills pillows so as to put you to sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byron fan","review":"Everyone keeps comparing this book to Interview with a Vampire. Sure, it has a similar framing to it, but it is wonderful because of its connection to Byron. It is pretty much a novelization of the Giaour and Childe Harold's Pilgrimage, and an incredibly romantic version at that. If you are a fan of Byron's poetry, you will enjoy this book. I think the Giaour and Manfred are some of the most (R)romantic pieces ever written, and this book plays off of them very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for High School Students","review":"I bought this book to tutor one of my kids with.

LOVE THESE BOOKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You can easily stock your library with Berenstain Bears books, they're that cheap","review":"Tell you the truth, though, I really am not a fan of the paperbacks. I find them too long, too wordy, and, really, too moralistic.My nieces adore them, though, so I added a star for that, and I keep buying them. (I'm a sucker, really.)This is a great example of the books. New cub moves into the neighborhood, Sister and Lizzy become fast friends (and why does everybody in this series get a real name except for the main characters?), they fight over something silly, and eventually learn to compromise and share. Aw.Great moral message, but kinda boring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning to be a friend","review":"Sister and Lizzie are best friends and do everything together. But sometimes Lizzie can be just too bossy. And sometimes Sister wants to do everything her way. When the two cubs start playing school, it comes to head over who gets to be the teacher. This story teaches forgiveness and understanding that to be a good friend it's about giving, not just taking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"My mother purchased this for me as a Christmas gift. It lasted perhaps 3 months before the wood on the bottom of the rack, where the \\"legs\\" attach, simply gave way and smashed. The rack was NOT over-loaded with heavy items, either. I tried wood-gluing it back together, and that held for approximately another month. Now, it came crashing down again and I've finally decided to give up on this piece of crap.Yes, it's an inexpensive item and yes - aesthetically - its a very attractive wood coat rack. However, the wood and the construction are not sufficient to perform the job that you expect it to perform."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Contemporary Reading","review":"We bought this Bible for our daughter who has always used the KJV Bible.

Amazon makes it affordable, so you're not out much at all if it doesn't meet your needs/taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contemporary","review":"Contemporary Bible written in modern language to make it easier to understand.

It is not, however, a true bible. The Message contains every book of the bible, and divides the books up in chapters, just like any bible. From here though, it is differs, in that each chapter is a paraphrase of its namesake in the bible. The chapters are not broken up into individual verses, and are generally of shorter length than chapters from the bible.Also, because the chapters are paraphrased, the Message loses some of the strength of a true bible, as Peterson is forced to make interpretations about some sections.Despite this, the chapters remain quite true to the bible, and the Message provides a refreshing, if somewhat simplified read.Just remember that this book is not the bible, just a great study tool to be used with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The message is a great version of the Bible and a great price too!","review":"Well, Amazon.com has done it again. I purchased The Message and was pleased that the price was so reasonable and it is such a wonderful way to review passages from the Bible in today's language. I use it all the time and think it is much more easy for youth and children to understand the concepts in the Bible. The old fashioned way of the King James version of the Bible was for then, and The Message is for now.

It is, however, a great study aid, that should be used in parallel with one or more of the modern, scholarly translations, such as the RSV, NRSV, Jerusalem Bible, etc. It brings a fresh way of reading the Bible and helps open up the meanings. It would also be a good choice as an evangelistic tool for someone who does not, or has not read the Bible, because the core message is there in plain, easy-to-read language. After all, the purpose of evangelism is to open the Word to those who have not heard the Word.

If the marketing was more honest, it would get a better rating.Admittedly, I didn't read the whole thing. But I read enough vs. New Jerusalem, NIV, and an interlinear Bible to realize this is a STRANGE translation.Other reviewers have done a good job of chronicling the many questionable, if not outright errant, translations in this work so I won't repeat them here.If you are interested in Peterson's opinions, go out and buy it.

Readers of The Message should be very aware of the fact that this is nothing less than the views of Eugene H. Peterson passed off as the Holy Scriptures. The most disturbing thing about this paraphrase is that it warps the gospel message into something entirely different. Instead of being declared righteous through simple faith in Jesus Christ for eternal life, through reading The Message one could easily get the idea that salvation is by works or by faith plus works (For a clear treatment of the Gospel and just a great book, see Confident in Christ by Bob Wilkin). Mature students of the Word could use the Message as an interesting commentary alongside the Scriptures, but not by itself. I recommend sticking to a good translation (Like the NKJV)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Message Eugene Petersen","review":"I first went to the King James and was thrilled to see how easy it was to use it on my brandnew Kindle.

It's perfect for travel and more convenient to curl up with in bed or on the couch than my bulkier KeyWord Study Bible (which I also would recommend, but more for in-depth study.) At first I wasn't sure that I liked the translation, until I read the introduction and realized that the author meant it to be a \\"story\\" Bible rather than a \\"study\\" Bible. It's especially useful in reading to my children, since the language catches their interest and understanding better even than the NIV. I will definitely be purchasing this convenient size for gifts in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Message, Stone & Purple Cover","review":"Love this translation!

This man does just that. I would urge all who are considering buying this to stop and NOT buy it. It is leading to false beliefs and even calling this \\"The Message Bible\\" is FALSE. God's Word is not something to be taken lightly or changed to suit your purposes or to make it \\"easy to understand\\" .

Her poety, like her historical fiction and 'memoirs' bring to vivid life the Latina experience both in her home country and as an immigrant girl to the US. She spares us little of the hardship and the brutality of the history, but has a wondrously upbeat vision of herself and her family. She uses humor generously, often with straight faced satire, or sly comments.Being a big fan of her myself, I bought this volume as a gift for my 14 year old granddaughter, who is a new explorer of adult poetry."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"I was given this collection as a gift a couple of years ago, and I read one or two of the poems, and then put it on my to-be-read shelf. Last week I retrieved the book and read the poems over the course of the week...out loud to myself. What a delight!Each poem is thirty lines long, and divided into three stanzas. There were only a few times that I felt that the form overwhelmed the poem. Alvarez covers a range of subjects in her poems; she writes about trees, about her family, about growing up in the Dominican Republican and in America, about herself as writer, herself as woman, among other things. And all with an easy, insightful touch.

(THis is why they are Die Cast in Japan in my opinion). The car looks awsome and no detail is too small. I don't think this one is good for kids as the transformation mode is a lot of steps with only bad pictographs to explain it. I had trouble getting it into robot mode and back I felt I really had to force the pieces I don't think a kid could strike the balance between creating the torque neccesary and breaking it. Once I got him to robot form Sideswipe is very posable and makes a pretty good action figure ( unlike classic Transformer bots). My recommendation for Transformer fans try to get the Japanese ones ( even at $50 they are much nicer) but for a low cost alternative not too bad. For Parents - skip this one You'll have to figure out how to change him and do it every time you son wants him changed or you'll have 2 broken parts)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternators = realistic looking cars and robots","review":"The first thing that sticks out when looking at an alternator transformer is, whether or not you're looking at a model car, or a transforming robot.

Logos and all.Though having him as a Ferrari (enzo?) would have been better.The next car which is coming out is the Ford Mustang.The car looks better, and the robot mode looks steller. Only problem with that, is the name, they picked Grimlock for the Mustang GT! Thus again, showing the only flaw with the Alternators. Though, they did a great job with Hound, matching him up with a Jeep Wrangler.Overall, this toy is great looking, and is made more for show, than for handling (toy use).Also the color variants (they're out there) also make nice collector pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"best!","review":"This has to be the best transformer Ive ever seen!

I like raising my monsters, breeding them, exploring with them, and battling with them, etc. I do not like twitch games. While the rpg aspects of this game in the walk around portion was fun, it really lacked the fun of the previous 4 games because it didn't focus enough on the strengths of the previous games.

The adventure part of the game is fun, but the manual that came with the game does not explain how to do the quests well enough. I'm sad I wasted my money.

A very human portrayal of every day life under occupation during WWII."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series-Wonderful for WWII and British TV","review":"It seems dated but it is a great time period piece. True story and one that I had not heard about. I love the british tv series because they are so well acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A series of info-mercials","review":"Very little coverage of the vast and numerous highlights of this beautiful country. Way too much focus on a few specific lodging, dining, and recreation providers and too little on the wonderful places to see and things to do. The advertisements for one of the largest on-line travel companies are the best example of the commercial rather than informational nature of this DVD. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only the rear window deflectors are included","review":"This is a misrepresentation of the product. When I received the order only the deflectors for the rear windows were in the package. When I called to get the front ones shipped I discovered the email from Shopzeus said they were only shipping the rear ones. I also talked to a third-party operator who couldn't even issue a return authorization. I hope Amazon can help get this corrected. I will contact their customer service directly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acceptable","review":"Everything about this air conditioner is good, except the noise level. It was unacceptable to use it in the same room I was occupying,trying to listen to TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marilyn, Marilyn...","review":"James Haspiel has made a truly beautiful book about Marilyn Monroe. The book is full of pictures and also quotes from/about Marilyn. This is a must for every Marilyn fan. The most interesting thing is that J. Haspiel was Marilyn's friend, and that's perhaps why this book is so fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"More to this book than meets the eye","review":"At first glance this poetry is straightforward and even boring -- but the details so methodically spelled out here are often those nuances most often forgotten during the early stages of hsing i practice -- this book will bring you back to the basics and move you forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzz..... what there's a movie on... oh sorry.. zzzzzzzzz....","review":"I hate to be a reviewer who admits he couldn't make it through a movie... but i just couldn't put up with this movie which is supposed to be taken seriously.. I know what your thinking - what right do you have to review a movie when you did not even see the whole thing... you have a point.. but.. as i see it a movie should be interesting all the way through or what is the point of watching? I don't care if it ends well if i cannot make it that far the movie has failed its purpose.. You might enjoy 'breaking and entering' i found it to be a sleeper.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Other Good Things To Do","review":"Gave this movie forty-five minutes, but it was so slow moving and seemingly pointless -- okay boring -- I gave up. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable Coupling","review":"My husband and I just didn't buy Jude Law and Robin Wright-Penn as a couple. Nor the supposed attraction and sexual tension between Law and Binoche. Of the three I think Wright-Penn stands out the most, followed by the girl who plays her daughter Bea. The other interesting part was the antics of the young man playing the agile monkey boy. I wouldn't watch this film again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking and Entering","review":"A surprisingly good movie (to me at least). I like Jude Law's acting as his expressions are more natural that \\"acting\\".I have enjoyed other movies of his although this one impressed me the most. Maybe because I didn't have high expectations (which tend to ruin most movies for me)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real people, real world!","review":"Life, seen from the perspectives of some very genuine people, played beautifully by the leading cast, Juliette Binoche, Robin Penn and Jude Law, the trio shine brilliantly in this little gem. A brief, yet a brilliant performance from Poppy Rogers who leaves no effort in portraying an autistic girl. Although a bit complex, the atmosphere, the situations that occur are very believable and a wonderful cast-performance and direction does justice to this film. The film starts out slow but then soon catches a rapid pace, making you not move even an eye lid. A journey of some real people in a real world, worth witnessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking and entering","review":"what a great piece of work. Fab cast and story. Being a Brit I really enjoyed the locations in London a nice thriller"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad movie","review":"My biggest problem with this movie involves the script, which has too many characters who appear and disappear, and is far too long.Secondly, the characters do not relate to one another in any meaningful way.Jude Law and his wife are not connected. Jude Law and the boy's mother are equally unconnected. Jude Law, who appears to be a successful architect, never works, never has emotions, and is as drab as his boring wardrobe.Only the minor characters actually show some humanity and distinction but they are too few and far between in a dismal movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't do it for me","review":"It takes the first 45 minutes before some things starts to happen and then still it feels very stiffled. What came to mind watching this was the book \\"Unholy Hunger\\", as it displays very well the feeding happening in human relating on planet Earth. Everyone is feeding on somebody else; sometimes it is mutual feeding and at other times it is distinctly predatorial. Not a pretty sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deserves a better review","review":"Picked this up for my daughter, for college. It was very easy to install and set up. Most low cost printers are designed to use a lot of ink, if you're not familiar with computers. It's just a fact of life. How do you think they sell them so cheap? You need to print at lower quality settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haha - This thing is awful - even if free!","review":"This \\"printer\\" was part of a package I purchased. I had to buy it to qualify for multiple rebates on a computer, which has worked out great. However, unless you need to buy it as a rebate qualifier don't bother buying the Lexmark Z715. It's amazing to me that people actually pay around $80 for this thing. It feels like it came out of a Cracker Jack box, the print smudges and it is irritating to set up. What else can I say? Too bad their was not a zero star option. Congratulations! to the people at Lexmark for creating the worst inkjet printer ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total piece of junk...","review":"I received this printer in a bundle with an e-machines computer. The paper jammed constantly and this became extremely irritating. Even free this printer is garbage (which is where it ended up). I wouldn't recommend this joke of an inkjet printer to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lexmark Junk","review":"Lexmark used to be a good company but I guess they have sold out like others. This printer WASTES a lot more ink than it should. Their cartridges only come half full (same with HP) unless you buy the 'better' ones. This printer is also incredibly slow. The only good thing I can say about it is it seems to last a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked Well But Didn't Last Long","review":"Got this printer about a year ago. It got very light use during that time as I have several other printers that get more frequent use. I doubt this thing printed more than 20 pages before the paper feed stopped working. For what it cost me it's not worth fixing. I'll just replace it with a better quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't even get this installed on my computer","review":"I bought this printer and found that I can't even get it installed on my computer. Something about the driver? I have a brand new computer, comes with Windows 7 and this is an older printer. Maybe that's the problem. Bought the printer, ink, USB cable, and it is all useless to me.Oh yeah, the installation CD that came in the box said(in English)that English wasn't an available language for installing the software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reissued Book - Overpriced!!","review":"I am so disappointed in Nora Roberts and her publishers. I am rating this a \\"1 star\\" simply because the Kindle version does not give any indication that this book was a Silhouette Special Edition originally published in February 1990. Even though I own the entire series in paperback, I would have bought them for my Kindle also if they were reasonably priced. I have loved her books for many years now. Every few years I re-read the Stanslaski series. Every one of the stories were entertaining, engaging, and leave you wanting more; but these books can be purchased in paperback form in a two-book volume for less money! Look for \\"The Stanislaskis Sisters: Natasha and Rachel\\" (two full novels) and \\"The Stanislaski Brothers (Two Complete Novels: Mikhail and Alex).\\" They start at one cent."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it - love it - love it","review":"Of all of Roberts' gazillion books this series ranks among my top five favorites. I'm so glad they are finally on Kendle so I can always have them available. These characters are real. The romance is believable. The story is interesting and moves at a good pace. I have re-read this series several times over the years - and it just gets better with each book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Start to a Great Series!!!","review":"Being the first book of the STANILASKIS SERIES, it had to be good...Well it certainly was. Nora Roberts did not disappoint in any way!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Taming Natasha (The Stanislaskis)","review":"I like a book to have a story line but this just didn't fit the bill as it was, once again for a book on the Stanislaskls, just too much about sexual feelings. I like Norah Roberts but this was not worthwhile of her so wouldn't recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Bogey, Where Art Thou?","review":"This is one strange set. The artwork and music CD are nice, but the rest is a mess. First, the music is on disc one and not disc two as stated on the package. The DVD is awful. The Jack Benny Show is so washed out, it's almost impossible to watch, which is a shame since it's a great show. It appears to have been taken from a tenth generation video bootleg. The movie Beat the Devil is better quality, but still not that great.The only thing that got this set a one rating is the music CD. It's fun with Bogey sound bites between each slice of interesting jazz, although not much of the music really fits into any of Bogart's films. It's still worth a listen.I wouldn't remommend paying the full Amazon price for this set, but if you buy it discounted from Amazon Marketplace, you might not be too disappointed. In other words, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I really didn't need another book on watercolor painting. Not being a novice but always looking for easier and quicker ways of doing things, I bought this book with some trepidation. But what a pleasant surprise - the book for a change did not waste valuable time/paper on repeat basic instructions but went immediately into techniques. I even found the section on color pigments interesting. Not any one book can give you all you are looking for but this one is nice to have in addition to. Its uncluttered, let's get to it, approach alone deserves 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring remixes that strayed away from the original greatness","review":"I really like the original push it remix but if you already have it and are looking for more great mixes stear clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another reissue","review":"Originally released by E'G/Polydor Records, reissued in the U.S. by Passport/Jem/Caroline and elsewhere by Virgin. Had three other covers. I had heard half the album already on the 1987 compilation \\"King's Road 1973-80\\", and a live version of \\"Woman\\" on \\"Arkangel\\". I have the Australian LP, but most CD reissues have bonus tracks, and I went to a legal site for the mp3s. You know how it is. The album at first got little notice. A year or two later, Asia came to pass. The rest is history. It wouldn't be until after leaving Asia in the early '90s that John Wetton would the full-fledged solo career that once again takes a back seat to Asia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muy pobre","review":"Mi inter��s por John Wetton proviene, exclusivamente, de su participaci��n en King Crimson. Por ese motivo, cu��nto m��s se aleja de lo que hizo con el grupo, y posteriormente en UK, menos me gusta. No obstante, los ��ltimos discos (Rock of Faith, Sinister, etc.) a��n siendo comerciales y, un tanto blanditos, tienen buenos momentos y se escuchan con agrado. No as�� este que nos ocupa que, adem��s de contar con pocas ideas compositivas, se ve lastrado por la horrible producci��n t��pica de los a?os 80. Mucha ampulosidad, mucho teclado para un disco de AOR sin demasiados vuelos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Offers more than expected.
