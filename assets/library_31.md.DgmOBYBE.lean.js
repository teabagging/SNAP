I should have known better than to doubt U2's destiny of sheer excellence.I bought it as soon as I could and picked up a few extras to give out as gifts.

It's that good.The album is vibrant, sexy, smart and simply an absolute pleasure to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"Although this album isn't quite the rock 'n roll blowout that it seems some people were expecting, it is so articulate and well-crafted that any U2 fan will appreciate it. It's definitely more suited to an adult crowd than teenagers, so I wouldn't be surprised if this doesn't fare as well as some other recent releases. But don't miss out on this simply because it might not be #1 on the charts. Bono's ability to communicate emotional experiences so universally is amazing, and the Edge's ability to reflect that with a guitar is unique to this band. Although \\"One Step Closer to Knowing\\" and \\"YAHWEH\\" seem a little unpolished and hastily done, the rest of the songs more than compensate. If you don't buy the album, be sure to download \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own\\" and \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\". Certainly not the best U2 record, but definitely one of the best records of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best albums of all time!","review":"We can't deny that the tracks of this wonderful album are awesome can we?The most relevant song is \\"Original of the Species\\" such an incredible anthem that you can create in your mind to understand and improve our human nature.Beyond the lyrics U2 show us every time that they are forever in our hearts and soul, besides we have to remember that U2 make a promise wich consists in if they make 2 crap albums they're out of the business and separate forever, so, go U2 forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good U2 again","review":"I just love this band, this a a very good U2 release.

Many hits, very good ballads, incredible voice by Bono. For sure, as some reviewer mentionned, his voice is not as it once was, but the emotion is there as never before. I just love \\"Sometimes you can't make it on your own\\", this is an amazing song with such a level of emotion. I have the edition \\"Deluxe\\" and to me, the couch version of this song is a pure jewel. It is an acoustic version that is incredible.

That's the only way I can describe U2's dwindling career, topped off by this miserable release. How does a band labelled at every turn as complete sell-out's with a dimunitive sound make a comeback in the eyes of the fans?... The answer: They attempt to re-create the once cutting edge sounds of their previous works.This album is so bad that it does not merit a worthwhle review.U2 have sold out, and they will never put anything more out worth listening to, they have betrayed their own fans, and this album shows that they got what they deserve, it's that painful to listen to.Buy any 1980-1997 U2 album instead of this mainstream band, and you will be completely satisfied, and even more so knowing that your money is not going to help already rich corporate rock sellouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"I've always been a fan of U2 but recently my renewed commitment to my faith has awakened me to the meaning of the words of many of these songs.

This album did not disappoint.In October 2004, Vertigo was everywhere from ipod commercials to radio play. It was a hard rocking sound that made me so excited for the album to come out.When I bought the cd, I listened to it over, and over, and over. I am one of the biggest U2 fans out there and it takes me repeated listening to approve of their their new album.To sum it up, Original of the Species I believe is the standout track. It's probabaly one of their most beautiful songs ever recorded along with Stay, All I Want is You, and With or Without You.Other great tracks on the album are Sometimes You Can't Make it on Your Own, Yahweh and City of Blinding Lights. Overall a great album, but not their best.

It sure takes a lot to pack a special edition with illustrated album under a pricy hard cover and a DVD to boot (alas, documentary and stereo). But that's all there is to the \\"lot\\". Edge ain't no musician and Bono no singer, the way they perform -- and they hardly ever performed better. What with painy vocal and one note chord sweeps. Ever too formal to break new ground, the band goes on riding the crest of non-existant hard core / new wave. And that fervor about society, morality and, gosh, peace! They are the Brezhnevs to the free world of rock.

Pop had one or two good song, as did each subsequent album. The only good track is the most commercial one (Vertigo) most of the other tracks sound like throw aways, second stringers, and not something that should be on a U2 album.Don't get me wrong they are still a great band, but its starting to feel like they are running out of things to write and sing about. Maybe Bono needs to worry less about his hair and get really pissed about something like he used to and write some good music with Edge.Buy the Single (Vertigo) skip the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 will die for selling out so bad!","review":"I can't believe this. U2's albums \\"War\\", \\"Joshua Tree\\", and the epic masterpiece \\"Achtung Baby\\" will forever be classics in my book. That was when U2 was a GOOD band. Then they tried an experiment with Zooropa (though that art began on AB, it was a GOOD experiment) and it was that day when U2 died. Pop was no less better as well, it was even WORSE! All That You Can't Leave Behind was better then those two pieces of crap, but still not up to U2 standards. Now we have their lastest crapterpiece, How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb. They have now become money-hungry, grobbling sellouts. They make Metallica seem loyal to their fans (and trust me, that's saying something)! I will always listen to War, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby, as they will stand the test of time. U2 should call it a day, and break up.

Bono, knock the crap off. You aren't a politician, quit pretending you are, and how do so many people take him seriously as a political figure?

So that is my point. GIVE IT SOME TIME, it'll blow ur mind!Besides, the fact that everyone is talking about this album means that U2 have actually succeeded in putting their music out there.

You won't be walking around with any of these songs stuck in your head. They are that unremarkable. Oh well, U2 has put out bad work before (see my review of Achtung Baby), perhaps a few years from now they will put out someting decent.

The best way for me to describe it is like a one hit wonder. It sounds like the millions of one-hit-wonder bands you hear, that create one great song just to get you to buy the CD and the rest are weak. With albums like this from great artists like U2 its no wonder the record industry has problems with pirates. It's good the CD was less than $10, but in my opinion it's not worth more than $1.

Anyways it sounded so boring, the instruments sound so bland, the same cord over and over, boring singing and lirics: one,two,three,fourteen(WTF does that mean?). It sounds the same from beginning to end. My cousin bought the album and I gave it a spin, and the whole thing sounded the same, boring, bland and generic pop rock. People stop saying this is so great, when there are other bands that are creating far better music. One example of such a band is \\"The Mars Volta\\", U2 can't even dream of creating such amaizing music as the Volta guys create."},{"rating":"1","title":"negative review","review":"I hated this CD the first time I heard it and I still hate it.

First of all, this isn't a ROCK album at all. Only 25% ( 3 songs ) are pure Rock. The rest contains middle-tempo songs or ballads. I think U2 is an old fashioned band, I mean, they live with the smashes they had in the past.

Well, U2 did it again, folks.You can't get much manufactured than this. It almost sounds as if the guys made this album, just to get some songs on radio, and to make some more money. There's no feeling behind any of these songs, and they're getting to be a tired, tired act.Bono is nominated for another Nobel Peace Prize. Impressive. However, I'm not impressed with the fact that it seems he also thinks that he's saving the music industry through U2's music. Fat chance. U2 is washed up, and I hope this is it.

Well, I gave some of them helpful reviews because they said whatthey like about the CD and have other reviews. I know what they like and since I don't like any of it, I can safely say I have different taste in music.I like music that is COMPLETELY not mainstream or is a lot more aggressive than U2. SOme of my favorites have been on MTV alot, but have a completely different sound than U2, such as Rollins Band or Ministry(not With Sympathy though).

Bono apparently still thinks he is a good singer, so he drones on, song after song, belting out raspy, irritating vocals and lyrics that mean nothing. Every song is uninspired drivel. The album is total garbage, but will still be a huge hit anyway because the devoted fans will eat up anything the band puts out. U2 is like Metallica - they were great in the 80's, OK in the '90's, but are now just corporate greedy sellouts riding off their former glory. For the love of God, stop buying this, and maybe U2 will get a hint and stop making music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last one star reviewer needs to stop crying","review":"This album from U2 is one of my favorites.

I'm personally convinced that this belongs in the top tier of U2 albums, along with Boy, Joshua Tree, and Achtung Baby. It is different from each of those earlier albums, and they're all different from one other - but it's part of the greatness of U2 that they can succeed in very different ways. The fact that U2 can put out an album of such high quality 25 years after their debut album is both stunning and nearly unprecedented in the history of rock music. It is terrific that this achievement was recognized by a Grammy.Ignore the naysayers. Listen to a great album and enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to the cd a few more times","review":"There's one key thing to consider when checking out a new U2 album - their albums have a history of 'growing' on people. Lukewarm reception often turns into solid critical and public admiration and sometimes extreme fandom. It's impossible to say whether or not an album or band is good after one listen, or after hearing a few singles over the years and then dismissing the band. In short: Give Atomic Bomb a chance, and come back when you've formed a complete and comprehensive opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look what they done to my song...","review":"There might be good music on this disk. But something happened in between what came out of the band and what was shipped. The mix, production and mastering is so incredibly poor, the disk is physically painful to listen to - at any volume.It only got two stars out of sympathy for the musicians, whose hard work has been so thoughtlessly destroyed by people who ought to know better.I'm really bummed. It might have been good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 Builds Arsenal","review":"U2 continues where it left off on \\"All That You Cant Leave Behind\\" but \\"Atomic Bomb\\" is more guitar oriented. This may be Edge's best guitar performance. This recording is a collection of up tempo rockers, mid tempo songs and ballads. Themes include war, peace, social justice, confusion, mortality and faith. U2's lyrics continue to be relevant and inspirational and address issues in the world we live in. In my opinion this is one of U2's top four recordings and i do recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"five stars","review":"I've had this album since it came out in the fall, and i still love it. I cant say theres any songs i skip over on it. Though their music is still as good as in the 80's, its in a different way. I think now its a little less epic and a little more personal now that they are older. Almost all the songs could be singles but still manage to have substance to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"U2 are back in business","review":"I love this new album. They have succeded again to reinvent themselves and grow in all the fans hearts.I reccomend this limited collector edition, it has a great 48 page book with drawings and hand written texts.Also you shoud give it time and not rate it at the first audition. It's too subtle for the average listner so you should open your ears more than usual ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"The previous reviews here seem to have been a rush to judgment-posted the same day as the CD's release! That's not enough time to judge a cd, especially one from U2, who pack so much into an album. It needs to sink in awhile, as you get used to each track and pick out your favorites. Is \\"HTDAAB\\" as good as \\"Achtung\\" or \\"Joshua\\"? Of course not. But there are some excellent songs here-from the gangbusters \\"Vertigo\\" to the next single \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" to the crunch of \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" to the pop beauty of \\"All Because Of You.\\" My only complaint is the 48-pg book that came with the deluxe set (you also get an extra song \\"Fast Cars\\"). The book is a waste, you'll flip through it once and never look at it again. It doesn't even include the lyrics (as far as I can tell); it's totally illegible. Save your money and buy the single cd release.PS-\\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" is already one of my all-time U2 favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same old same old...","review":"Ok, its U2 with nothing else to offer. U2 has always had its own distinctive sound without straying much EVER! The redundancy is insipid, lifeless, and makes me want to never hear Bono's voice again.

Don't buy this. you've already heard it"},{"rating":"1","title":"ow!","review":"That guy who says this CD is like nails on a chalk board- he is right about how painfully bad this CD is.Bono-quit being so pretentious about \\"good works\\" you do and go back to making music like you did when I was young, ie War or Joshua Tree.

I thought U2 would never top their 2000 masterpiece, All That You Can't Leave Behind. But they did. In many ways, this might be U2's best album todate. While The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby have a more 'classic album' feel to them but HTDAB has all good songs. \\"Vertigo\\" is one of their best singles ever.

It's not exacly ground breaking or redefining, but it's absolutely amazing. It doesn't exceed any expectations, but it meets the expectation of what U2 should be. Every song on this album is great. Just sit down, turn the volume way up and read the lyrics with the music. This album redeems U2 for zooropa and pop, which could have been a great album if produced differently."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"Did someone say they prefer Ashlee Simpson...

It gives so much pain, really, because I'm a die hard fan, and I really believed in they were going to release their bestalbum, but that hasn't happened. I don't know how to do now, ifreturn waiting, or better to begin to listen to another more honest and new music.

Worst band ever.","review":"This band is fronted by Bono--[...]Bono is a hypocritical egomaniac. I hate it when ENTERTAINERS go political! Did somebody forget to tap Bono on the shoulder and tell him he's not a politician? Oh wait, he already knows that! But he'd never admit it to his gullable fanbase. Every trip he makes to Africa, every charity he donates to, every benefit concert he plays...all of these things fuel the propaganda machine that has kept this awful band on top of the charts since the 1970s.Don't buy into the hype about Bono. He's a hypocrite, just like Jim Baker or Jimmy Swaggart. This multi-millionaire keeps claiming that he \\"wants to help people\\". Yet every time he \\"helps people\\" it draws more attention to himself and U2's record sales go through the roof.Bono's \\"humanitarian work\\" is nothing more than a washed up rock star stroking his ego.

This is basically middle of the road, white bread pop. The multitudes love this type of music.This title, \\"How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" is pretentious and out of place for this album. With a title like that, I really expected U2 to have something to say, similar to albums like \\"War\\", \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"Joshua Tree\\". With a title like that, I expected to be challenged. Instead, we get sappy love songs, or emotional outcryings from Bono.I applaud groups experimenting, and changing. We don't need another \\"Unforgettable Fire\\". But, this album does not experiment or push the boundaries. This is just a continuation of \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\".

Marketing takes over music. It happens to the best of them. Let's hope that this is a blip in the system and not the new trend. The Rolling Stones have done marketing over music for years. People sadly think they are the greatest rock band in the world. In reality the Stones are just one band from a long gone era doing greatest hits shows and tricking record labels into giving them large sums of money for the new turds they call albums. U2 can very eaisly fall into that trap. Look no further than the IPOD commercial that turned Bono into iBONO... Better luck next time guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an evidence of perpetual decline.","review":"The U2 mystery has gone. Apart from being a quartet of forty-something blokes with the same trademark guitars and an immense back catalogue, their purpose seems unclear.Unfortunately, this dull album shows this lack of purpose to have reached crippling levels. At times it's as if as the band, lost as to their true identity, start playing what they think U2 should be playing. It sounds so familiar. No substance at all. It's just marketing, fashion, Grammy Awards, etc. The album quickly descends into an uninspiring mid-tempo plod.The overall impression is that they've forgotten about the songs and preoccupied themselves worrying about the textures. Stuck between second-guessing their audience's expectations and where they actual want to travel, they end up in a cul-de-sac of their own making.Stuck In A Moment They Don't Want To Get Out Of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this packaging","review":"I'm giving this whole \\"Limited Edition\\" package a one star rating, not the album alone. I'd like to consider myself a die-hard U2 fan but I honestly felt ripped off when I gave over this much money for nothing. The book included is ... Amazon wouldn't approve of the word I want to use so I'll just say useless. You can live without the DVD, it's nothing special.

I have and still throughly enjoy the bands previous efforts but was very disappointed after multiple listenings to this album. I am sure Bono, The Edge, Adam and Larry still have a lot to say, but they did not do it on this album. My advice to U2 fans - if you do not have previous U2 album's - spend your money there not on this effort. Hopefully the band's next collection of material will be back to their previous standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poster child for downloading","review":"Vertigo, the first song, is of course great.

What other reason is there for making music like this? There is no inspiration here (except for Vertigo, which is a sort of tribute piece to their own earlier music). The band sounds like it's swimming in a vat of liquid Zoloft. Rock music is a young man's game, there is nothing wrong with LEAVING IT BEHIND and preserving one's dignity. As it is, they are like a civil servant putting in his 30 years to maximize his pension, but with all their money they don't even have that excuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"They phoned it in.....","review":"The fact that there are so many mixed reviews of this album says it all. This is \\"supposed\\" to be the U2 that returns to it's rock roots. Rather, it's just a another bland over-produced mediocre output that they've become so proficient at making over the last decade plus. Most of the songs sound as if any average band could put them out. This is the great U2??Sure, there are a few songs that will hold you for a little while. But, compared to U2 in their hay-day these songs are merely \\"fillers\\". Clearly, U2 ran out of ideas and energy a long time ago (See their last 3-4 albums for evidence).It's sad, when you really think about it. They're living off their past and a HUGE marketing budget. That's it. Btw, I really really wanted to like this album. But, like the last few, it just wasn't feasible to do so if you have a frame of reference for what this band \\"used to\\" be.

If you like mellow pop music, then you probably will like this album.I wish everyone on here would stop bitching and whining that U2 isn't as good as they used to be. Shut up. This is a good album that has a good message. It isn't for everyone, so what. You can make some people happy all the time, or all the people happy some of the time.I will say this though. They way over marketed this album. How many times do I need to see the ipod commercial. Usually, too much hype leads to bitching and whining by the masses.

U2 have always been about staying relevant and being fresh and they've managed to do, at least until Pop. I still don't know what happened after Pop, which was an extraordinary and smash album. U2 turned for grammy worthy music, becoming to obsessed with being the biggest band in the world, no matter music. HTDAAB just seems like a safe, adult pop record full of over-baked tunes.

How very disappointing\\"City of Blinding Lights\\" is probably the only half decent song on the album and that's pushing it.. I guess it would be an average album if it wasn't U2..

Perhaps it was the pre-release hype which raised my expectations. Perhaps it was the hard-edged sound of the single, Vertigo which lead me to believe the remainder of the album would follow suite instead of being relative mellow. Perhaps I'm partial to the production work of Eno & Lanois who's influence seems to have been turned down in the mix. Perhaps it's because Bono's voice *sounds like* it was overdubbed onto instrumental tracks recorded in a different studio at a different time. Perhaps it's because I liked 'All That You Can't...' a lot and 'Bomb' is quite different. Dunno. Perhaps you'll like it more than I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Cars -- worth the money?","review":"The only reason I can think of for buying this CD is the extra song, \\"Fast Cars,\\" which is not on the American release. It's a great song, too. I'm not that big a fan of the album itself; there are several great songs, but also a few lackluster songs, so it's a bit of a mixed bag. \\"Fast Cars\\" is a standout, though, AND it's the song from which the album draws its title. I'd suggest buying the AMerican release, and then going to iTunes and buying the less-than-a-dollar \\"Fast Cars.\\" Then you can make your very own version of this import, and have spent considerably less.Great song, though, no doubt about that."},{"rating":"2","title":"S.

They have taken their years of expeirence and talent and wrapped it up nicely inside this bomb about to explode into everyones minds.Love and Peace or Else is one of the single heaviest songs I've ever heard from U2 and City of Blinding Lights is a materpiece.Original of the Species and All Because of you incorporate clear sounds and influences from their past. This is one of those rare albums where every track is well worth the money. Adam Clayton on bass has never sounded better, Bono sings with passion and renewed spirit The Edge has cloned himself along with some additional guitars and Larry Mullen Jr.on drums is simply awesome.

Gosh that's so cool. And for all you tards that actually want to know how to dismantle an atomic bomb, its through love and compassion. Their concert was AMAZING and so political I LUUUUVED IT. This album has both melodic, passionate music such as my favorite above, \\"Sometimes You cant make it on your own\\", \\"One Step Closer\\" and \\"Yahweh\\" to name a few) and up beat electric sounding tracks (i.e \\"Vertigo\\", \\"City of Blinding Lights\\", \\"All Because of You\\".)

Every song is not going to be conscious-raising, nor a rich, mythical landscape musically painted on cuts from \\"Unforgettable Fire\\" or \\"End of the World\\". They are, however, no less enjoyable. Do I crave every riff,song ever recorded by this enduring cadre? No, and there are certainly tracks I don't like. But, those are few.

This album doesn't do any of that, the songs are nice, but way too safe sounding. There is no new sound here, and honestly it sounds like step backwards in terms of song writing. I still like U2 a lot, and this album doesn't change that, like any band some albums will be classics, and others won't, this album is one of the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's over","review":"Quite a few years back, the great band Nomeansno sang a song where they told us \\"only so many songs can be sung with two lips two lungs and one tongue.\\" It seems Bono and company did not bother to listen to these words of wisdom because they keep trying to release more music. This newest CD proves that the band has lost its touch even though millions of people buy it. I doubt that would have happened had the song not been forced onto us in commercials. U2 sold out big time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The U2 Music You Love","review":"These men have made some great albums. This is not one of them.It has no substance.

This could have been a great collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to dismantle this year's worst CD","review":"It's hard to explain how bad this CD. After the first 2 songs this disc takes a nose dive like no other.How a band with so much talent can turn out such a piece of crap is beyond me. Pull out the Joshua Tree and relive the good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly boring and lame \\"rock\\" album","review":"First off, these musicians need to realize they are old. Not that age means you cannot make great music but to think you can get in touch with all generations because you wear a cowboy hat and glasses is stupid. Bono constantly wearing those glasses should be reason enough to hate this album. Boring album with so-so guitar playing and meaningless lyrics. PLease U2 fanboys don't talk about the depth of them and the fact that there are so many layers to these songs because they aren't. My favorite line is the title of the song \\" Love and Peace, or Else.\\" This is a refreshing thought coming from pacifists. Or else. Without using violence, the only way they could possibly do any harm is by releasing another album. For a much better review check out maddox's page titled \\"the eleven worst songs of 2004\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disappointment","review":"The album to me is a commercial friendly flop. The music at one time meant something, now it seems the band is simply out to continue making money and using the U2 name and there songs to benefit charity and other things which is very good. But what happened to the dedication and focus on the music? \\"lets just sound like Joshua Tree and just make some generic songs..\\"I don't know where the band is headed but this album is boring.Not too many good things here. A few tracks are memorable, the opening track gets annoying after a few listens and then the CD gets put on the shelf or in the discount bins.Do yourself a favor and look for U2's other albums. Even U2's POP album has a little more to offer than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Does U2 Get Such Critical Acclaim?","review":"I don't understand why so many music critics continue to lavish praise on U2. I don't hear anything new or exciting on \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\". It's tired,overdone,boring,bland,and pompous. I don't like one song on it. \\"Vertigo\\" sounds horrible to me,but it's the best they have to offer. \\"Yahweh\\" is one of the worst songs they've ever done. All the songs in between just put me to sleep. The best thing about trying to listen to the album is that it cures my insomnia.Bono said he'd know it was time for U2 to hang it up when they did two bad albums in a row. He's lucky \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was a decent album or U2'd have to retire now. Actually,\\"Pop\\",\\"Zooropa\\",and \\"Bomb\\" have all been bad.I'm not going to listen to the hype any more. The critics who call every new U2 album the best one in years are always wrong. They've said it about every album since \\"Boy\\" and they've been wrong every time."},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 Was once my life blood , nomore","review":"I believe that u2 was one of the greatest rock bands of our time, not because they were Irish clovers but because they displayed true talent, and Bono's voice is very spirited and will always be however this album sucks. I enjoy old U2, when they first hit the fast paced mainstream universe they were very different and I liked what I heard. Now all I hear is this 'Vertigo' stuff and I think Bono has become like all the other pop stars in this world, money tree people! Maybe the next U2 album will be better than this one, how to dismantle an atomic waste of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"All That Shmaltz They Can't Leave Behind","review":"First of all, I'm a fan of U2; have been since I was a teenager: loved War and Unforgettable Fire. Grew up while watching their style evolve: loved Achtung and Zooropa (and elements of Pop). Was bored by All That You Can't Leave Behind. So, I had high expectations that HTDAAB was going to be a great album. Boy was I disappointed. Vertigo was a real tease that this album was going to be earth-shattering and upbeat. While I found the lyrics on HTDAAB to be stronger than in the recent past, I found the music dull and monotonous. I guess I should have seen this coming: they look bored in the video for Vertigo and the iPod commercial would have made a better video!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to U2","review":"I was hopeing this would be the next great U2 album.

The Joshua Tree and achtung baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPOINTING!!!!","review":"Since 1991 U2 have been releasing sub par albums!!!Although Zooropa & Pop were ok, they hardly had the magic of their previous releases. But the band went at an all time low with their first release of 2000, All that you can't leave behind despite having decent single releases was just very bland and void of ideas.In truth How to dismantle an atomic bombs failings are hardly surprising, there is nothing new, and they seemed to have rehashed old ideas and just basically turning the volume up whilst hoping we don't notice how bad the tunes are.There is nothing special about this bomb, and though it blasts at times (Vertigo, Because of You) this bomb turns out to have a malfunction and never seemed to have worked anyway!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near their roots","review":"11 unconnected pop songs. Simply a filler stuff for the bucks. U2 are playing it safe once again. They are over-the-hill as they aren't ambitious or take creative risks. Bono botched his singing melodies so badly. I don't know how the hell he likes his own voice. Maybe he's deaf.This album is just boring and painful, plain and simple. Not only is this the worst piece of corporate radio fodder garbage album that U2 has put out, but it is now in my top 20 'worst albums I've ever heard.' This album has absolutely nothing to offer.... unless you like to music that sounds like it was made in a church by a bunch of 45 year old half-asleep drunks.on another note, dont bother pretending to like this album just so you can be 'loyal' to the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why U2 decide to make yet another album?","review":"What has happened to this band? A years ago ( until 90's ) they were doubtlessly the best contemporary rock band and then suddenly they've became a sellout corporation. Bono's voice is getting worse all the time, as well songwriting. Songs are miserable and lame, monotonous and annoying. Sterile production makes this album even worse. That production is very one-sided, with every song designed as a simple, catchy, mid-tempo rocker or ballad. Rotten simplistic crap as ATYCLB. As marketable as that previous soup.This is essentially only a dull plodder, forgettable filler. A sea of mediocrity. Here we have U2 making a bunch of songs sound like trademarked U2. Plus, the vocal assault doesn't help take away the impression of U2 becoming dumbed down cartoon caricatures of themselves.Achtung Baby and Pop now seemed a million miles away"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back to Basics - Joshua Tree: Part 2","review":"I don't usually post reviews or make comments on message boards but I felt it was the least I could do for my #1 favorite band of all time. After all, they have provided me with so many fond memories and experiences.Before I start, I want to say that any new fan of U2, should try to buy these albums in this order (though nothing says that you cannot buy How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb first--it has already become a 5 Grammy award winning classic):1-Joshua Tree, 2-U2: Rattle"},{"rating":"1","title":"U2 have sold out.","review":"If your a U2 fan you will with out a doubt be dissapointed.They said this would be a raw rock'n roll record and the best record that they had ever made, well that was all \\"talk.\\"Anyone who knows what real music is can tell that this album is an absolute flop and in a few years people will realise that it was crap, not to mention the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this exactly?","review":"Like the other 1900 people here, i'm a huge fan going way back to the -nevermind. The last itme we waited four years for an album we got Achtung Baby. The time before that we got The Unforgettable Fire. Both stellar albums. This time though, I think this is my least favorite (after POP) lyric album but one of the best U2 albums musically.Love and Peace certainly gets one's attention. The Edge's guitarand Adams heavy bass make it radically different from everything else on the album. Now that I think about it the guitar is theonly truly interesting part of the entire album. The melodies drone into one another and well, with unconnected imagery and a lack of poetic center it just throws me off. Not their best work,but not the worst either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their most pathetic absence of music ideas","review":"There's no one attempt to break out of the U2 comfort zone and do something a bit different. The whole album just doesn't go anywhere. Songwriting on this record is terrible. Moreover I cannot listen to more than about two songs without getting a headache because Bono's voice is so annoying. Bono had to do his raspy high-pitched scream in every song - except for their most boring song ever 'One Step Closer' - and make it all sound like garbage. Bono just grates. I just don't understand how everyone could have been so fooled. Is this a return to form? No, rather this is a return for the money. After all, they still have the name \\"U2\\".U2 are completely sellouts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, what happened????","review":"I am an avid U2 collector of many years, and this album is a huge dissapointment. It looks like U2 is done pushing the envelope of the mainstream and taking us with them. You will not be inspired, suprised, interested, or moved by this album at all. I sure hope they make a lot of money so that they can come back with one of those less popular and much more interesting albums. They really need to decide if they are going to be a relevant band, or produce more retarded videos like the \\"Stuck in the Moment\\" one with the same director as Britney Spears. They should be confident enough to keep progressing like bands such as Radiohead. Sorry guys, but this will sound great on one of those poppy radio stations, but will never be worth a crap in my car. Maybe they should decide whether they want musical appreciative fans of mindless followers. Just my humble opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"All that hype for nothing","review":"Having grown up with U2 I couldn't wait to hear the new CD and was soooo dissapointed once I listened to it. Aside from Vertigo, the songs are flat and lack any of the spark found in albums such as Boy and Joshua Tree-a total let down. The perpetual rhyming in the songs leaves me with the idea that U2 should perhaps pursue writing children's tunes as they have mellowed out and gained some middle aged spread. Perhaps they should stick to doing good in the world and hang up the microphone and guitars. Spend the money on Tsunami relief instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland and uninspired","review":"I usually don't write reviews, but after 2 less than stellar offerings, something must be said. I own most of their catalog and enjoyed every one until All That You Can't Leave Behind (Rattle and Hum had it's moments).I tried to like this album, but all the songs meld together in blandness. Although it is slightly better than ATYCLB, it's painful to listen to as I know what this band is capable of.It's basically recycled Joshua Tree melodies and forced lyrics. If you're new to this band, please check out my favorite cd - Achtung Baby (Ultraviolet anyone?)As far as major releases go:1. Achtung Baby2. Joshua Tree3. Zooropa4. The Unforgettable Fire5. Pop6. War...that's the oldest one I have listened to enough to review.7. Rattle and Hum8. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb9. All That You Can't Leave Behind"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fading but still competent","review":"These lads clearly have seen better days. I believe they still have enough left to justify their existence but unfortunately Achtung Baby is a ghost while listening to this long player. Like Sachin Tendulkar at the crease these musicians still induce awe but could anyone honestly describe them as the band in the world on the basis of this long player?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells Like Sellouts","review":"Same old same old from the next band to provide the soundtrack for a car commercial. I'm so disappointed! I was used to U2 providing me with fresh fodder with each collection they released. This time around it sounds like more of the same stuff they presented the last time. Oops, maybe cause that's what is. Had some leftovers from 2003 so they repackaged it (thanks Steve), pumped it up with a big marketing scheme (thanks other Steve) and viola the public bought it. Where can I get in line to return mine?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This album rocks!","review":"U2 can be classified the following way - Beatles, Led Zeppelin and U2. They belong to the category of the greatest bands of all time. I really can't see why a lot of reviewers are criticizing this album. After listening to it a few times it really grows on you. This may not be the best U2 CD, but it would be the best album of almost every other rock group if they recorded something like this. I gave it 4 stars in comparison to all the other fantastic U2 albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average, cookie-cutter, by-the-numbers","review":"U2 hasn't ROCKED since POP. This effort is overproduced, and under-written. Bono's lyrics are getting worse as he continues to spend more time away from the band. The rhythm section here is pedestrian at best, and Edge is just recycling like never before.I'm a HUGE fan, dating back to when I first saw them in January 1981, but this is weak. POP had it all, great drums and bass, lyrics and Edge experimenting and creating rather than recycling. It's a true work of art right up there Joshua Tree and Actung Baby. This is just sub-par."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retirement Beckons","review":"I'm a lifelong U2 fan . . . and alas, this album is the epitome of \\"product\\". This band clearly is like Michael Jordan if he tried coming back a 3rd time, today - formerly the best, but now tired and way past their prime.With a few decent exceptions, we've heard this all before on previous albums - MUCH better. You can almost see the rust on their instruments.Still, track 12, the acoustic one on the limited edition, is pretty cool - they should have done a whole album like this . . . acoustic, stripped down, exploring new musical turf for them. Something different. That might have worked, and at least thrown a fun curveball to us fans.Instead, we get a band whose charisma is intact, but songwriting skills eroded like a sandcastle at high tide. Just gone. This album is like 90% the ultimate rock n' roll sins - Predictable and BORING."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre U2 album (2.5 stars)","review":"This album was very much a let down. You would come to expect something more fresh and inspiring after a 4 year absense from U2. No surprises here unlike their previous albums. Very straight forward music.Better luck next time U2, but it seems time's running out."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unbelievably stupid comeback","review":"This album should be against the law for this to be packaged as U2. Bono's strained vocals ruin the album, and the songs are missing the whole talent they had back in the 80's and 90's. It's clear U2 have nothing else to prove, and they don't even want to. This album just shows their 2000 musical ignorance. U2 should be ashamed of even taking credit to these 'songs'. Consider this record to be the ultimate undoing of this once legendary band. Too bad their time have come and gone.And yet every time U2 appear, their adoring fanatics react to it like it came from the Holy Scriptures... dream it all up again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Playing it safe.","review":"Man they sound fake on this album.What a dissaponitment.125 1 star reviews can't be wrong. Please if you have'nt heard it yet, don't buy it, or even listen to it, its very bland and uninteresting - not awful - but really bland."},{"rating":"2","title":"About Vertigo...","review":"I find it intersesting that the people giving HTDAAB bad reviews are saying that Vertigo is the only good song, whereas people who enjoy the album are saying that its one of the weaker tracks. I think this shows that most people arent giving this album a chance because it isnt full of 3 minute rock songs like the lead single suggested. This album is a grower, you cant judge it fairly with only one listen, which is what i believe many people are doing. Mark my words, in time this album will get more positive reviews and fewer negative reviews as people realise this is a classic U2 album and see that it is much more than 11 Vertigo's."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is wrong with these reviewers?","review":"I absolutly loved this CD! I have always been a fan of U2 and contrary to some of the other opinions posted here I don't think they are going downhill at all. This CD is amazing! Awsome lyrics, themes, guitar background, and of course Bono's great voice. Just give it a try. If you like U2's style you will like this. They are playing half these songs on the radio right now so I'm wondering if its so \\"bad\\"(according to some) why its so popular. Some of the reviewers with actual good taste know where I'm coming from, as for the rest of them I'm sorry they didn't enjoy it but I have no clue as to why. Take a chance, its worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wide Awake U2 !!!! I'm not sleeping","review":"generally any new album released by a band is overrated by the same band, and this is an example of that. 3 of the best bands from the 80's have released albums this year: The Cure, REM and U2. It's clear the only alive band is The Cure, with a worthy new album, while U2 and REM keep using the same uninspired and flat music.Let's see...80's U2: AWESOME, BRILLIANT90'S U2: PURE GENIOUS, BRILLIANTU2 2000: R.I.Plamentably fans elevate and exaltate the band and increases this this fake feeling of greatness with a new LP that does not exceed the ordinary.Is time for several things:1- Bono must cut his hair, take off his sunglasses and all Rock Star stuff and start to concentrate in CREATING music again.2- U2 must release a new album at most by early 2006, otherwise is officially dead.3- Is the perfect time for \\"U2 Anthology\\", unreleased concerts from 80's and 90's on DVD, outtakes, etc, etc"},{"rating":"1","title":"Old U2 Fan","review":"I gave this one star because I had to give it something. Please understand, I love U2. I have loved them for many years. I remember when I first saw the vidieo for \\"Gloria\\". I enjoyed reading the review that listed the new song lyrics with older song lyrics, and I can not agree more. I miss being inspired by U2. I miss feelings chills when I hear one of their songs. Nothing compares to \\"Bad\\", \\"A Sort of Homecoming\\" or \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday.\\" I hate that they have written a lyric like \\"As the boys play rock and roll\\" in Vertigo. U2 never had to identify their music as rock and roll before this. Pleae, listen to some older songs from U2, and see just how great they were at one time. It is ashame that Bono's head has gotten so big. Please watch the bands performance of the song \\"Sunday, Bloody Sunday\\" in the movie Rattle and Hum to see just how great U2 can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing ...","review":"Oh okay , Im U2 fan and a fan of music as well . Its not easy being a fan of todays music industry! U2 no doubt is a fantastic band , and even on this album Adam, The edge and Larry have displayed their legendary talents with the guitar, drums and Bass. However, I have to say that I feel they're pretty much are stuck in a league of their own, which isnt appealing anymore. Music is part rythm, part lyric , part melody and part harmony (& about chord progressions etc) . It would be nice to see them not play it \\"safe\\" for a change , just like former Savage Gardens Frontman Darren Hayes latest solo Album \\" The Tension & the Spark\\" that speaks volumes about being musically evolved ( think Eurythmics), a far better musical triumph Ive so thoroughly enjoyed although it will not sell truckloads like U2 . Why ? hmm ... I have to say with regret that U2 as a brand have become larger than the music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the beginning of the end of U2","review":"Well... what I can say after reading all these commentaries. My personal opinion, indeed. I do not want to speak of the wonderful career of U2, only about the new album. 11 nice done songs with a big commercial interest are here. The A side of the disc is far better that the B side , which is singsong and boring. There are interesting songs like City Of Blinding Lights, but there are horrible ones like One Step Closer, Yahweh (Bono in his lowest level as a singer), Original Of Species and Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. The Edge uses the same guitars all the time, Larry almost is unnecessary in this album, as well Adam. It is a simple, short disc, designed to sell.I don't feel the album, that's all. After 49 minutes I'm the same person, worried about the same things and trying to listen to better albums. This album won't change me at all, unlike previous U2 albums like Pop, Acthung Baby or Joshua Tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"If U2 is the best band in the world, bring on the Polka!!!","review":"U2 has been my favorite band for about the past 10 years. Achtung Baby is still my favorite album, and I couldn't wait until HTDAAB was released so U2 could dominate the music world once more. Much to my disappointment, U2 should throw in the towel. Every album is released with words such as \\"U2 have reinvented themselves and the Edge has rediscovered the guitar.\\" The guitar is sad, the songs drag on, and Bono's voice and lyrics have fallen from greatness. This album is so boring, it doesn't sound like U2 even care about making music anymore.

The lyrics were there, the guitar sound was there and even the drumming was there, but it just seemed as though they tried to hard to sound like Joshua Tree. I am not saying that this is a bad albumn, it is a lot better then some of U2 90's stuff but it was just missing the passion of the original U2. I would have to put this albumn right on the level All That You Can't Leave Behind, good deserving four stars but not the greatest. This is a must own albumn for any U2 fan but for the music collector or lover, I would go for Joshua Tree, that is classic U2."},{"rating":"1","title":"a plague","review":"U2 are a plague on music and their latest should have been dismantled before it was launched. There are no words to describe how bad this CD is without getting vulgar. None of the songs should have been released to the public to destroy what was left of our auditory nerves. Vertigo is like a plague that has spread across the land due to its use in those idiotic commercials and so all the sheep went and bought the CD just to spread this noise even more.

Now, submerged in such superficiality, they give to us this \\"ATYCLB Reloaded\\".Unlike which it would be logical, U2 appears like an immature band for teenagers with easy songs destined to attract more and more fans, forgetting to older fans that have followed them all life, this U2 is sold for the Grammy and the Pop style life. The 11 songs have no new musical world neither transmit new ideas nor new images, they only are a pretext for a new tour and more and more cash.Overall this is a surrogate band that has refuzed to make an effort in trying something new and different, continuing ATYCLB, which was the worst U2 disc ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"no time for this","review":"I heard this and it didn't catch me right away.

With the man injured, the women take charge.The scenery's great, the acting's adequate, the survival choices, for the most part, are quite reasonable, the story's of course predictable, and there's a cool bear doing his acting with gusto.I give it 3 1/2 stars. No language, no sex, no real blood and guts, but too stressful for little ones to watch: Dad gets hurt, bear's trying to kill them. I think OK preteens and older. The extras include a 'making of' documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Courage","review":"This is an excellent family movie. My nieces and there parents all loved it. Great story line for stepkids.

I'm not familliar with Rule's other work, but this disk is my favourite of the Faerie series. It's absolutely gorgeous, with transcendental musick and divine near-operetic aethereal vocals atop. She does sound like a Fae queen. I would recommend this to anyone who embraces the more dark side of Fae; someone big on introspection and meditation.

Now don't get me wrong I love the hampsters but this is just wrong.1) Hampsterdance song (radio edit) The most famous song of the hampsters, and the most commonly used version of it. Very cute, but you'll have trouble not getting hooked.2) Hampsterdance song (Extended Version) One of the longest of their remixes of this song, it's pretty much the same as the other one, but with a different intro.Overall, this isn't a very good deal because it donsn't have that many songs and all of them are practically the same. I would recommend one of the other hampster hits CDs. This is a good gift for collector of hampsterdance products, but if you're looking for more (and better) music, I think you should try one of their other CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Required text","review":"This book is wonderful!

It demonstrates that this interesting branch of medicine can be both versatile and concise. The book is full of valuable illustrations which students can depend on for quick revisions. Ubiquitous tables, colourful charts and figures all help to accelerate comprehension. Also, there are two additional sections whose chapters handled Immunology and Parasitology in significant detail.No single textbook may be without shortcomings, but I sincerely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd but not musically intricate","review":"I love this cd. It is great for headbanging in the car or just with your friends. A good example of this is Crimson Rain. It lacks the intricacies that I have become fond of in bands such as Rhapsody and Wintersun. It has barely any solos whatsoever(only one)and it is not up to my standards. If you like pure viking metal, and I do, then you should get this. It's a good cd, quite creative, and I love the pure metal edge. My favorite songs are Wyrd of the Dead, and Crimson Rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"efficient and quiet","review":"I got a Whisper 60 and have had it running for a month or so. I've has other Whisper models before several years ago and they always did the job well. This filter is quiet and effective with removing detritus from the water column. I noticed a small amount of bypass when it is turned up to the maximum flow rate, but that aside I have no issues with its performance. The design of the back for media is slim and if you want to customize what you put in it then it is possible but a slender fit. The flow rate and durability of these filters can't be beat for the price, so I ordered three more to get me by for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"After just 2 weeks, makes a loud sound and stops intermittently.

I will not make any comments about the effectiveness of this filter since I did not have it long enough to see how well it keeps my aquarium clean. However, after running it for 4 days, I had to do something different. My aquarium sits in my front room and the noise of this filter was simply unbearable. In the end, the filter's name was a complete contradiction. I ended up going with a Fluval 406 upon installation alone, I am MUCH more satified.

Well good for you. I lost my receipt and can't get a replacement, so I'm out $50.Seriously people, if you're going to keep fish, spend the money and buy a product that's worth it.

I have a 10 gallon fiter, the same brand, and it is really a whisper. So I thought it is a good brand and I will get a bigger one, but the 60 gallon filter is not a whisper, it is a B-52.

It will probably take a year to make a 60 gallon tank water clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"product","review":"filter works great. this is my second one. the first lasted around 6/7 years. i would definitely recommend this product"},{"rating":"2","title":"Whisper filter no so whispery","review":"I have owned a whisper filter in the past and find them a superior product. So I was not hesitant to buy this one. The whisper does work better than most standard filter systems that come with aquariums these days. So thats why after 1 month I ditched the Aqueon filter system that came with the tank I purchased and switched to the Whisper filter. The only thing I would say that is negative is the sound... it isn't a whisper at all.. more like a water fall in your house. So if you find the sound of running water irritating this isn't the system for you. I find it soothing so it isn't a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works but sucked up my fish","review":"I've been using this filter for about 6 months. I got it with a tank that I bought used. It seems to be a decent filter for my 55 gallon tank, but I like having lots of small fish (from tetras to swordtails) and it sucked up dozens of them. Needless to say all of the fish and about 5 frogs were killed. I tried making a screen for the intake with both fabric and metal, but they got really messy and I gave up. I also tried adjusting the flow to a very low setting, but then my tank didn't get clean enough. I'm currently looking for a different filter with a built in screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter!","review":"I put it on my 10 gallon aquarium and it works great.

I wanted to add these along with my Marineland Penguin 350. They are very noisy. Spend the few extra bucks and go with the Marineland. If you don't want the bio wheel, leave it out. I should have spent the extra few bucks and went with all 350's. I tried everything to quiet them down. They are just loud and obnoxious. But, if loud means nothing to you, the large bio bags they come with are really nice. It allows you to remove the charcoal media and either insert something else or leave it out. It also comes with extra pieces of down tube to reach the bottom of those tall tanks. If it was quiet, 5 stars. But the noise kills it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Terrific Read","review":"After I finished reading Houllebecq, I was in desperate need of other well-written, sardonic novels about men who are alienated from their surroundings.

Whether it's worth purchasing is another question. Long time fans will most likely already own the complete albums containing these selections. For younger fans interested in checking out Jaco's music, I would suggest purchasing one or more of the complete recordings represented on this compilation. The reason for this is that you should hear these great albums in their entirety. For the novice I would suggest purchasing Weather Report's Heavy Weather, Joni Mitchell's Shadows And Light on DVD, or Jaco's excellent live disc, The Birthday Concert. If you're a Metheny fan you can check out Bright Size Life. If you've thought about purchasing Jaco's self-titled debut on Columbia, then this compilation might be a good choice because almost all of the material from that album is represented here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Jaco Pastorius","review":"What could I possibly say about this man except He was/is the world's greatest and most copied bass player who has every graced this earth...This is my favorite compilation of his music...Soar in Peace Jaco..."},{"rating":"2","title":"JAAAAAACO!

Since that time, my digestive system has been super sensitive. These activated charcoal capsules are amazing. Taken at the first sign of upset, the charcoal binds any toxins and draws them out. They work quickly and have no side effects. Follow up with a few tablespoons of yougurt, and you're as good as new.I read that hospitals use activated charcoal in overdose cases. Don't know if that is true, but I do know that these capsules are safe and effective. If you are on medication or take vitamins or supplements, time hyour dosage so that you don't take them with these capsules since the charcoal will draw out the medicine.It is nice to know that there is a remdy for digestive distress that is natural, safe, easy, inexpensive and effective. I always have a bottle on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"my fingers are all black!","review":"The charcoal seems to be good quality, but when the capsules are being opened they spray little plumes of powder everywhere.

WHY?","review":"Oh, the horror. I cannot accurately describe just how bad this album is. Geoff Tate's voice sounds strained and off-key at times. Even the background singers sound old and tired. Tate even appears to have trouble remembering the words to the songs on OM:I, but I'll give him the benefit of the doubt....he could just be ad-libbing or something due to having sung those songs over and over for the last 10 years. Chris DeGarmo is not on this album, and it shows. Kelly Gray was a poor replacement for him, but Mike Stone is just abominable. Operation: Mindcrime is one of the best albums *ever* made, and I'll be damned if I want some talentless idiot taking \\"creative license\\" with the lead guitar parts. In addition, the mixing of this album is just abominable. I am a huge, huge Queensryche fan, and listening to this disaster really hurts."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good soundtrack to a phemonal film","review":"This is the soundtrack to the theatrical production of the DVD release of Mindcrime At The Moore. The sound quality is decent. The reason why I only give this album 2 stars is because there are parts of this recording that only makes sense if you are watching the DVD.

I played two friends basses because I didn't have my own until I saved up enough money to buy my own and purchased the Dean Edge 09. This is a great bass that has good balance, isn't too heavy, and has good heavy tones. Awesome if you play heavy metal, nu metal or even death metal. The body isn't actually Mahogany as the description says, but it's stained to look like it and makes it look pretty cool. The only thing I would recommend is switching out the strings because as you probably know, stock strings usually aren't the best things under the sun. I'd highly recommend this if you're wanting to learn or are starting to learn bass, or even if you're a well rounded player (if you are a seasoned player I would recommend you switching out the pickup as well).

Come on guys, we need you back!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VH the 3rd and worst","review":"Van Halen 3. Well, after the much publicized breakups with Sammy Hagar and then a short reunion with original singer David Lee Roth, Van Halen returned with third singer Gary Cherone. Upon listening to tracks such as \\"Without You\\", \\"Fire in the Hole\\" and the horrible \\"Once\\", VH has lost its fire. This is by no means a change in singers. Cherone can hold up his own end but seems to be uncomfortable filling in the shoes once worn by Roth and Hagar. The real disapointment is in the music. Edward VH is no longer the guitar virtuoso that made everyone's jaw drop from 1978-1984. The guitar sound is dry and sloppy. If one were to listen to this up against such masterpieces as \\"fair Warning\\" or \\"1984\\", there is no comparison. It almost seems there are two different guitar players. It's no wonder it turned out to be Van Halen's worst selling album to date. It's just no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"go back and listen to 1,2,fairwarning diver down,1984,women&","review":"Van Halen 3 is not a worthwhile lp. it sounded as though there were three guys in the studio at different times, different planets! who are these people? the other guy-singer-should have stayed home and watched hee haw reruns.yuck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Crap. I can't, unfortunately give it a lower rating","review":"If this is the best Eddie can do sober, Good God man, get some booze into your body. This CD is just awful. I am beginning to suspect that Eddie has used up his bag full of tricks, which is why he has to rely more on gimmics like the power drill on \\"Carnal Knowlege,\\" and the Sitar Effect Box \\"VH III\\". In his solo on the live album he repeated a phrase from \\"Spanish Fly\\" no fewer than six times. If he has creatively run out of gas, he should have the class to call it quits. The Dave years were good mean rock. The Sammy were definately more Top 40ish, but this new stuff is unredeemable. Van Halen RIP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen?","review":"When I first heard the album, I thought I was missing something. So ...another listen. OK, maybe this is VH's Zeppelin III. Another listen... No, this really sucks. It's not a hidden masterpiece. It's a lame attempt to bilk another million dollars (???) from the faithful. Well, no more blind buys for me. I'll have to hear the next album before I buy. Come on Eddie...I'm tired of defending you...get with it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say but the headline has to read \\"First Bad Album\\"","review":"No lie! I've tried listening to this a few times, I find myself clicking the cd player to the next song and to the next. Where's the fun, where's the rip. Gary Who? Come on Eddie, your first impression of him was right on when you said he sucked. I guess everyone has a brainfart once in a while. Nice to hear some of Eddie's keyboard talent but not enough metal mixed in. I highly recommend this album....NOT!!!!! I have every album except for best of, which I agree with Sammy, when a band does that it usually means they've run out of good new material. Way to go Sammy. And no, I don't agree with you bleeding hearts that compare every song to Roth and Jump. They had there heyday together, now its over. As all good dedicated non fairweather fans, I will be looking for something better in their next album attempt. Try again guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the songs ?","review":"I'm not too bothered about whether Gary is better than either Sammy or Dave. What struck me is that there were no songs here. Since Eddie co-produced, it appears noone else had the strength or will to tell him was good and what was crap. I'm afraid this is well and truly the beginning of the end for VH. I'm really sorry I bought this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"They shouldn't even be called Van Halen anymore!","review":"I bought this CD because I really like all of Van Halen's music. I was very disappointed! It all sounded the same and it seemed slow and depressing compared to their previous albums. I liked Sammy, but I think they should bring Diamond Dave back and make another album. I feel I wasted my $14 and the CD sits in the case on the shelf. I wish I could send it back to them and make them pay me back!! I definitely don't recommend buying this one. Listen to it first if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen's worst CD to date!!!","review":"There is very little that I can say that is good about this CD. I bought it thinking to myself \\"it's Van Halen, it should be good even without Sammy Hagar\\". Boy was I ever wrong! In fact I am really suprised the band went on to record this CD with this lead vocalist. The band surely could have found a better lead vocalist than this guy. I was extremely disappointed with this CD. Do yourself a big favor and save your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS SAD","review":"It is really very sad to hear such an album from Van Halen.

It's the loss of Sammy Hagar. No, I'm not one of those \\"immature\\" VH fans who boycotted the new disk. I bought it the day it came out, and I still own it. But, it severely lacks the 'musical fullness' we experienced when the \\"Red Rocker\\" was still on vox. Hagar was a great writer as well as singer and musician. I don't think Cherone took part in a whole lot of writing on the new CD. Gary is a great singer, but that's all he is. Sammy was a great singer, guitar player, AND writer; a more well-rounded asset to the band. I listened to 'Balance' the other day and wanted to cry. You can clearly hear the difference. I am excited for the next release. Hopefully it will be a case of freshman jitters and sophmore success. I wish VH the best of luck. One star? Maybe not. But, most definitely not five."},{"rating":"1","title":"One to forget","review":"Comparing to the the other VH's CDs I got, this is the worse ot then.

I loved Dave with the band and I love Sammy with the band. Gary's vocals just get on my nerves!! This is the first VH CD I have not played like 50 million times. I played it once, was shocked! I played it again, I just wanted to lose my lunch. SO on my CD rack it sits. All I can say is WHY?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Me Wise Magic the last of their magic?","review":"Was Gary on a Karaoke machine? He sounds like he's singing at the music rather than with it.

It is unfortunate that VH wants the same good music that they enoyed with Sammy by replacing someone who sounds like him. The fact is that Sammy CAN sing. His inflection in his voice makes you want to sing along.The new singer, however, CANNOT sing.VH has no concern, according to Eddie, if they sell CD's or not. I don't care if Sammy wanted his own dressing room, or if Eddie kicked him out because he was not a 'team player'; VH should take a lesson from Roth and understand it is up to the fans to say if they should play another note.I am a VH fan and hope that I will not live 'with out you'. Call Sammy and fly 'higher and higher straight up you'll climb."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can it really be that bad? Yep.","review":"Poor production values, toxic vocals. This album would be an embarrassment for a garage band, let alone a band with VH's talents."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Album that got overlooked","review":"VHIII is actually a really good album! I bought it when it first came out and i thought to myself how in the hell can u follow up Hagar and Roth? Well the answer is Gary Cherone.I know alot of fans downplay this as not a good album or an addition to the VH Catalog but you may want to give it a second listen.\\"Without You\\" was the radio hit off this and it plays perfectly into the Classic Halen Songs in my opinion.I dont think radio or fans stood behind this enough and i understand its Extremely (no pun intended) hard to follow up the 2 Legends but i always perferred Hagar over Roth myself yet this has some really sweet guitar laced rock jams.\\"One I Want\\" has a cool groove and \\"From Afar\\" is a haunting melody courtesy of Mr Cherone.I wish they would have made a follow up to this just to see where they could have taken it.\\"Fire in the Hole\\" is a heavier track that was featured in the Lethal Weapon 4 movie and i dig that one too."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I'm a Van Halen fan from way back. This is without question the worst \\"music\\" they have recorded to date. Boring. Every time I try to listen to this album, I cringe and turn it off.

Meanwhile I'm buying up the Japanese mini-LP releases in April, and the 2005 Van Hagar Japanese remasters. I really don't need a remastered version of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not good","review":"I tried really hard to like this album when it was new, I was thrilled Cherone was on board cause Extreme used to really rock.And I liked both Hagar and Dave (Dave more). But the album just isnt any good. The drumming almost saves a couple songs but they are drowned out mostly. I even tried again to like it years later but it seemed even worse then. I think I still have it but only cause the used cd store wouldnt take it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What The???","review":"Not only bad by Van Halen standards, but by any standards. Even we die-hards have a difficult time listening to this. Two stars only because Eddie's still the best. This is such a poor effort that I would recommend taking the chance of file swapping but it probably won't be found on any music sharing service."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Not That Bad!","review":"This album isn't as terrible as reviewers have said. Cherone's a good (though not great) singer and the songs sound pretty good, especially \\"Without You,\\" which I use to get fired up. Having seen Cherone perform in concert, I know he has the necessary stage presence. As for complaints about the serious lyrics, unless you're AC DC, you can't sing about sex and booze forever. Van Halen is not dead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent guitar playing, angelic vocals bad mixing!","review":"Eddie's on FIRE on this album! Newcomer Gary Cherone vocals are outrages. The only big fault in this album is the horrible mixing job by Mike Post."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like the album and think some people need to get a grip.","review":"Everyone wants to bash on this album because it doesn't sound like vintage Van Halen. Could some one explain to me what \\"vintage Van Halen\\" sounds like then? The guitar licks on this album are meaty and the entire album has a gritty feel to it. Michael Anthony and Alex Van Halen do a great job on this album in creating a great sound to compliment Eddie's gritty guitar work. No, I don't think this is their best album, but Gary Cherone can sing and I for one don't mind if they decide to get a little more serious in their lyrics. They aren't little children anymore and I enjoy seeing a more mature Van Halen speaking out. I really like the new approach and think the album is just their way of experimenting with a new sound. I love \\"Without You\\" and \\"Once.\\" These are awesome songs and will become classics for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's really no way of getting around it...","review":"This could very well be the worst album ever made by a major rock band that is of a high degree of talent and influence. And that takes some doing. In some ways, this album's awfulness is an awe-inspiring achievement. Everything, from the vocals to the arrangements to the songwriting, is spectacularly ill-conceived. It may well prove to be one of those albums that effectively snuffs out a band's career. And perhaps it should be heard just for just that reason alone ---to show musicians what NOT to do when your talent and ego overfloweth."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE BOMB!","review":"This was the biggest mistake of Van Halen's career. Gary Cherone is trying too hard to sound like Sammy Hagar. Van Halen's greedy manager lost it when he got Sammy kicked out of Van Halen so he could get a bigger percentage of the profits. Lets hope Eddie loses the EGO and lets a real frontman back in the band named....DAVID LEE ROTH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"THis is the lowest-selling record ever by Van Halen. Simple as that. Of course the are some gems around that were never top sellers. Unfortunately, this is not the case here. This album didn't sell just because it's so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGER-STAY AWAY","review":"This CD is full of negative energy-nothing to do with VH, Cherone doesn't sing, he screams. Almost all of the songs suck-there is an overall feeling of angst beneath the album. Eddie's guitar sounds like George Harrison (no offense, but this is the 21st century where is the brown sound???). If you, like me, loved VH then listen to Tropic of Capricorn from Sammy Hagar's 10-13 new CD. Then you'll see that Sammy is VH as we know them. VHIII is a curse-stay away. I hope I lose this CD again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not *that* bad ...","review":"OK, so I have had all the VH DLR records since they came out. I bailed on \\"Van Hagar\\" after OU812. Years pass. The brand new one comes out. So I rebuy all of Sammy's stuff along with VH3. Gotta tell ya, I like VH3 almost as much as the new one, and more than all the Sammy records. Why? Because it's \\"different\\". I wonder if some of the reviewers who trashed this one years ago would change their mind after listening to it today. Yeah, it's not Sammy, and it's not DLR, but it's still a good album nonetheless IMO."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"This cd stinks and really that's all one can say about it. In many spots it sounds like bad Queen?. I guess being that Gary was a huge Queen fan, he had some influence here, but yikes!!, that's not what Van Halen is or was about. I like Gary, but he was a poor choice to front this band. The songs are bad for the most part and lack true VH passion or vibe. Eddie was once my favourite musician, I idolized the guy, but he's fallen off a lot lately because he can't get off the bottle. Eddie, get into rehab man and do us and yourself all a favor and get well again. Letting Dave go was a big mistake, getting Sammy to replace him was a good choice, letting Sammy go was again another screw up. Gary was wrong in every way for this band and this cd shows why.Buy it only if you love VH and can deal with it. I love VH and I couldn't handle it!!, so the choice is yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Album by a horrible singer","review":"Veering away from their great days with Sammy Hagar and David Lee Roth, th=is album was not nearly as well performed nor did it have any catchy tunes. The new lead singer Cherone was unable to fill his spot atop the ladder with the legendary band, and the band sank back into depression.Van Halen III was definately the worst album by Van Halen ever recorded even worse than DIVER DOWN, the previously worst one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I paid a $1 for this CD.

Nuff said!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen Should Have Sued Themselves For This One!","review":"Just total crap, from start to finish. It's got a slightly curious electronically manipulated guitar experiment from Eddie, and a couple faintly recognizable moments from that once dominant rhythm section, but mostly it's just totally lame. Ed can make extraordinary sounds at will, and Alex could be as monumental and heavy as an avalanche, but there's absolutely no inspiration driving 'em here. They're on auto-pilot as Sammy Hagar imitator Gary Cherone claws and scratches his way through leaden, dismal social consciousness and even more dismal heartaches. The joy of the original Van Halen was their remarkable harnessing of raw, molten energy into profoundly original rock songs. All these tunes on III are profoundly cliched duds. It's so bad, I'm sure it's committing a dozen crimes against nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cherone has a Lisp?","review":"I love Van Halen, and had all their other albums before I bought this. I put off buying III because I knew it would be bad, but wow it's just terrible.

Oh for the likes of 1984's kick'n upbeat rythms."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Choice for ZERO stars","review":"Can we just pretend this didn't really happen? Just a bad dream...

How could they let this happen? The David Lee Roth era was classic, and the Sammy Hagar era was continuing a great tradition and making it better.

Take my advice don't walk away from this cd...RUN! Bring back Sammy..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lead Singer Disease","review":"Let's be frank: they blew all their good stuff for this record on \\"Without You\\", a fine, fine tune. The rest of the album is execrable. \\"Primary\\" is the only other worthwhile track, for obvious reasons. The music on some of these tracks is actually good and, for Van Halen, a departure from previous work. But it simply cannot get past Cherone's awful vocals (he was actually decent with Extreme... here he sounds like he's been drinking Sammy's tequila) and his even worse lyrics.Eddie complains about Lead Singer Disease... get a clue, dude, ditch the singers and make VH an instrumental trio. Mike and Alex have a very good groove together; let them work on good fundamentals so you can lay your guitar on top. I love listening to \\"Baluchiterium\\", for example. You guys needs to make an album of nothing but ear-popping rock, without some guy preening on the microphone. And forget about the damn ballads! They never worked for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a question","review":"At what point did Van Halen transform into complete dorks? This album is incredibly terrible for numerous reasons. First and foremost, we must start with Eddie Van Halen. At one time, this ego-driven ignoramus was hailed as a modern-day guitar-toting Rembrandt. Well guess what, he ain't so special anymore. His sanctimonious songwriting reeks of immaturity and idiocy. This CD, however, does have a purpose: it's a mighty fine coaster. While this album couldn't even elicit emotion out of a four-year-old on a sugar binge, it does prevent cold beverages from leaving rings on oak coffee tables. Trust me, I've tried it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellently underrated and reincarnation!!!","review":"What is everybody's problem? This album kicks ass! Gary Cherone sounds like Hagar only less annoying. \\"Fire in the Hole,\\" \\"Without You,\\" \\"Primary,\\" and \\"Ballot or the Bullet\\" are excellent songs. Hearing Eddie play slide guitar is a interesting listen that works very well. His vocals on \\"How Many Say I\\" could've been better, but the album is really everything that is good about Van Halen. After all, these are forty-year-olds working with a thirty-year-old so the sound has to change a little, they need to mature a little...they can't do drugs their whole friggin' life like Dave seems to be. This album is an excellent opener for the new incarnation of Van Halen. Try it again people, you really need to get your thoughts clear and realize this album is one of the better comebacks ever released."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click the 'BACK' button on your browser NOW!!!","review":"Run! Run away. Do NOT even think about this one. I'm mailing my copy of this CD directly to Eddie asking for my money back. If this Van Halen trend continues?? The next CD may feature numerous bassoon solos, with your neighbor on vocals. Change therapies Ed.....this ones broke. And I may be the biggest VH fan I've ever met. Yes--I paid more money to see the show 1 week after my purchase. Gone! Dave??????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and unartistic","review":"Thankfully I didn't pay money for this mess, only borrowed it to have a listen. This doesn't even sound like Van Halen and I don't mean just the new voice, the music doesn't even remind me of the other incarnations of the band. The songs on this CD are just boring. They never go anywhere or present you with anything to get excited about. One song after another that just sit there and beg to be ignored. It looks like this may have been a career killer. Hard to believe a major artist could make a CD this bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was he thinking?","review":"Ok, the worst thing about this project is the songwriting. The lyrics are so whipped up, it proves that sammy was a better songwriter. Theres songs about going to the dentist (fire in the hole), and getting girls (dirty dog water) Not to mention the horrible how many say I, Eddie got too much control and showed just how goofy he really is. This is VH's much forgotten cd,"},{"rating":"1","title":"OUCH!!!","review":"'Without You' is the only \\"good\\" song on this album. A couple of tracks approach \\"decent\\", and the rest are horrible. This album was a lesson in disaster and should be discarded in the nearest dumpster. Eddie needs to swallow his pride and move on. Gary Cherone was not his soulmate, and was a terrible pick for a lead singer. (So is Eddie as evidenced by 'How Many Say I?') Cherone tried to sound like Sammy, but failed miserably. I heard that Hagar was let go in part because of his work ethic. Sammy has since been working his butt off in the studio, releasing quality material, while Van Halen has stagnated. I haven't heard any info on Van Halen's status, but it appears they might be done for good. Too bad they didn't end on a good note.Avoid this at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"After this one, VH needs to redeem themselves!","review":"Van Halen 3 is easily the worse Van Halen album to date. Gary Cherone was a nice idea, but he is certainly not the musician / singer that Sammy Hagar is. His voice seems weak and whiny by comparison.Also, the lyrics on many of these songs are laughable. Take \\"The Ballot or the Bullet\\" for example. VH is trying to sound politically astute but only use bad cliches like \\"give me liberty or death\\" or \\"the pen is mighter than the sword.\\" The lyrics on the song \\"How Many Say I\\" are also terrible, though it is interesting to hear Eddie sing lead.The only decent song on this album is \\"Once\\", which I really like. It is melodic, with good vocals, lyrics, and guitars. The rest of the album, however, is a bomb. VH really needs to do a good album after this one to redeem themselves!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"I recently listened to the \\"III\\" album and have finally understood what all the bad reviews were about. At first I just thought that people were just upset about having a new singer in the group and maybe they were Sammy Hagar or David Lee Roth fans who couldn't (or wouldn't) have an open mind towards the ex-\\"Extreme\\" Singer, but now I realize that this is very much a terrible CD. I don't think that Cherone is completely to blame here, because the song lyrics and arrangements are pretty awful but it would have been better for VH to have at least hired a singer that didn't sound like a poor imitation of Hagar. Anyhow, that's all history now. If DLR doesn't work out in the reunion, may I suggest Joan Jett (for a change of pace) as the new lead singer or if a female won't cut it for longtime fans, how about Mike Patton (of Faith No More)?"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUTILE EFFORT","review":"Eddie dropped the ball in this one. It is an arrogant album, which gave almost no liberty to Cherone sing in his own way, and the compositions are so bad, that Eddie should have reserved them for a solo album. It's a shame how band members Anthony and Alex didn't interfere, because I can't believe they liked the final result of Eddie's ideas for this album. But someone had to be the scape goat, and singer CHerone is gone for sure. Without doubt, the next CD will be better, because it is impossible to get worst than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie says he wrote it on the toilet, and it's crap . . .","review":"Okay, first understand, I am a HUGE Van Halen fan from the release of the first album. I am also a professional guitarist and spent many years copying Eddie and have one of his signature Wolfgang series guitars. I never liked Sammy Hagar, but he said he quit because Eddie just had riffs and boring ones at that and no songs for Van Halen III. Sammy says it all. This record is an embarassment to one of the greatest guitar players of all time. Eddie said in an interview that he composes on the toilet, I guess that is why this album is crap. So Eddie if you read these, please either get back with Roth and bring back the glory days or go and create and instrumental band and let yourself fly like you did on Fair Warning. So Fair Warning, stay away from this stinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums of all time","review":"I'd give this negative stars if I could. If someone asked, \\"What is worse--Van Halen III or the E.T. game for the Atari 2600?\\" I'd have a very difficult time deciding. As far as I'm concerned, all copies of this album should be buried right next to those game carts in Arizona....Anyways, what should you expect in this album? An untalented, lame, boring mess. Nothing exciting here. In fact, this album could be used as a measure for any band starting out--if your band sounds better than this, you're ready to start playing at bars/nightclubs. If not, re-rehearse and re-practice until you do :)Oh, and by the way, I'm not just putting this down because Gary Cherone is the vocalist. I had just made my own personal best of \\"Extreme\\" CD. He's great in that band, but not in Van Halen. 'nuf said....."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are just mad about the lead singer! Get over it!","review":"This is a great album! Those who don't like it need to get over it. Great and expanded guitar playing by the best ever, Eddie Van Halen. You little cry babies who are so upset over David Lee and Sammy need to check your loser selves. Quit crying lake the girls you are and actually listen to this album!

Better than all the previewing losers say it is!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cheating band strikes again","review":"Take the voice away and you have a sound track to \\"Face Off\\" If you cant get along or if you have diffrences, what do you do. Go out and find someone who sounds like you did 4 years ago. Rememeber The sounds alikes, they did Beatles songs and sold to unexpect consumers thinking they were getting something worth wild. The VH3 does the same. With no mistake that this isnt Sammy Hagar, your ears seam to stray off and hear the great \\"old\\" guitar riffs from Eddie. For the CD, if you liked 'For Unlawfull Carnial Knowledge' you wont be dissapointed with this CD. Just waiting for Mike Hutcheson to make a return to INXS. Via tape or a sound alike"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead ducks on the highway...","review":"I once had the misfortune of watching a woodland duck being run over by a large Lincoln Continental. The sound that issued forth from this poor, dying creature is strangely reminiscent of the garbled wailing coming from Cherone's gaping hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebody Get Me A Doctor!","review":"It was hard to imagine a worse singer than Sammy Hagar. His voice sucked and his lyrics were simplistic drivle. But leave it to Eddie Van Halen (not winning any prizes in the brains department himself) to come up with someone even worse. Gary Cherone is possibly the worse singer to ever hit a stage. His voice in it's screaming mode -- 99% of the record in this case --rarely changes pitch and breaks apart in a way that grinds on the ear. It's really hard to explain until you hear it yourself, but fortunately there are still samples above. \\"From Afar\\" and \\"Fire In The Hole\\" are the only tunes where the band clicks, and low points like \\"Once\\" and \\"Ballot For The Bullet\\" will have you writing this group off."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Sad","review":"I must admit, when I first this CD, I was trying to be as open-minded as possible. My loyalty with Van Halen was primarily with DLR, although Sammy was tolerable for a while. But, this album was horrible. I think that Eddie sat in his studio too long, did not listen to any producers, etc...he wanted it done HIS way. Well, from a guitar standpoint, it has some very unique work, but from a musical standpoint...it just does not work. Cherone's voice is ragged at best, and the songs are just overworked guitar pieces. Ed and the boys need to do what their FANS want and get back with DLR and put out some real music. I think the two songs on their greatest hits with Dave are just a snip of what they could do today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gary's Out of the band!

Get Dave or Sammy, or another awesome singer, let your new producer make a good record this time, and rock on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAMMY/DAVID COME BACK!!!","review":"Only Eddie saves this cd from getting a lower rating. Put a fork in 'em, the band is done. Thanks for the memories, guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent lyrics, s**tty guitars","review":"Ok, not all is lost, for these guys. Gary Cherone isn't that bad of a vocalist, and will do in this case, for Van Halen. What I'm wondering is, WHAT HAPPENED TO EDDIE???!! There isn't one decent solo in this cd. Just a lot of feedback. I think, that they should keep Gary, but Eddie, put the power back into your playing. Also, the production of this CD was pretty bad, too, which isn't their fault. But Gary can rock, if you've seen him live, you will know EXACTLY what I'm talking about. Old fans shouldn't worry, because their next disc should be WORLDS better than this. Van Halen has learned a lesson, and will move on, to do what they've always done. ROCK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen and Extreme don't mix","review":"I am a big fan of both Van Halen and Extreme, and as separate bands they really rock. It would seem logical that having Extreme's Gary Cherone lead Van Halen would be like the marriage of chocolate and peanut butter in a Reese's peanut butter cup. Unfortunately, it more likely resembles chocolate and sardines. To put it plainly, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adjusting to changes","review":"I feel this album was not their best work but it had some very strong points. Some of the songs are excellent while some seem to lack. One thing is for sure and that's that the album is very different from their other music. However, it has some good originality in it. I believe that Once is truly a beautiful song with great lyrics. Other strong songs are Without You with New World, Josephina and A Year to the Day. I think there is some genius in a lot of the music, I just don't believe it is a very well finished album. I think they messed around too much with effects on the vocals and sometimes they had a good thing going and messed it up with other parts of the song. It's not full of the catchy pop tunes that they once had. It lacks a little of that happy go lucky stuff that Van Halen fans have always loved. But it also has some very good stuff. I think they can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not bad, but...","review":"I was huge fan of Extreme, also of \\"Hager's VH\\", went to their shows when I lived in Japan.

'Til then, I will cherish my memories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because it's Van Halen, two stars...","review":"...but otherwise a terrible album. Being a huge VH and Extreme fan, I was extremely disappointed with Gary Cherone's vocals here. I thought that his voice, along with Eddie's blazing guitars that it would be great, but boy was I wrong.Let's be serious, people. If you are going to own one Van Halen album, I can guarantee you 1998's 'Van Halen III' will not be at the top of your list. 'Neworld,' an instrumental piece is the only halfway decent song on the album.Overall, this is a very poor album. Cherone's vocals are great with Extreme, but his vocal style just doesn't fit Van Halen.I can't recommend this release to anyone except collectors. A very disappointing release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I had some actual expectations for this one, but my hopes were dashed. I absolutely hated every track on it.It sounded nothing at all like Van Halen. The guitar was all classical instead of the usual wicked licks that Eddie delivers. I forced myself to listen to the entire album because I paid a lot for it. I wanted to give up half way, but I made a point of it. I hated every single song. It was bland garbage. \\"Me Wise Magic\\" (with David Lee Roth) was better than any song on this album. Completely worthless from top to bottom. I expected a WHOLE lot more from Van Halen. What a disappointment. I haven't listened to it since.And yes, that really is Van Halen. Big fat suckfest of an album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to pack it in, guys","review":"The music is unlistenable, and Cherone, who was better with his old band Extreme, comes off here like a Hagar clone.

After approaching the first listen with an open mind, there are few positives. How can Cherone expect to re-establish himself when he sounds too much like Hagar? The tracks seem drawn out and especially tired. Eddie can still rock with the best of them, but that's about it. He co-produced the album and the tracks seem to be everywhere, but not hitting anything successfully. What does that say about him as a producer? They have drifted too far from the sound makes them a successful band. Many VH fans don't realize is that it's not so much who their lead singer is, it's more who produces their album. That having been said, does anybody have Ted Templeton's number handy?"},{"rating":"1","title":"How Many More Pieces of Crap, Say I??","review":"No one is a bigger fan of VH than I. If Ed Van Halen thinks people are going to continue to fork out 16.99 to hear him experiment with crap in his solitary studio, then he is a jazz singer. Ed was my hero for years but no more is Ed cool! Every interview he gives is actualy repeated over and over and over just like his latest guitar solos on the last three albums. He hasn't changed the sound of his guitar for 10 years now, and I gotta tell you it's just nerve racking now. I wish he would stop pretending to be the second coming of Beethoven or something and just put out some damn Rock and Roll. What a shame.

It would be easy to place the blame for this sub-par album on Gary's \\"fingernails-across-a-chalkboard\\" vocals, but Michael's harmony and Alex's beat are a throw back to the worst of 'Great White'. I can only recommend this album to those who can filter out all of the jumbled inconsistencies and focus on Eddie, his speed and style will remind you of years gone by. Van Halen must focus and refine on what made them great, a band that personified hard-driving, party-time, \\"men who love women\\" Rock and Roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good-Bye Sammy Hagar, Good-Bye Van Halen","review":"I believe the posturing of the Van Halens vs. David Lee Roth and/or Sammy Hagar led to the downfall of the band and unarguably, the worst Van Halen album of all time.

You can tell they were going for the \\"raw\\" 90's sound but the album sounds like it was produced in the garage of an amature. The songwriting is almost nonexistant. no hooks no melody.

That band seems to have vanished with this pathetic effort. The blame can't be completely pushed on new vocalist Gary Cherone. Its Alex and Eddie that have completely lost their energy and ambition. The music is no fun at all, which comes as a surprise from a band that wrote songs like Jump and Panama. And just when you thought it couldn't get any worse, try listening to the closing track, How Many Say I.

I believe I bought Sammy Hagar's Greatest Hits with the previously wasted money. Gary was good (not great) with Extreme, he seemed lost here.David Lee was successful in his solo career, but he was never better than he was in V.H. Hagar, it can be argued was actually better in his solo career, than he was in his outstanding V.H tenure. Eddie, Alex and Mikey can't over come Cherone's lacking.

Eddie's classic guitar sound is practically nonexistent and I think they left Michael Anthony out of the mix altogether. Alex's drums sound like they were recorded thru a transistor radio.

Very Good. He's so good that Eddie fired him ...He's totally uncompatible with VH, but one thing is certain: it isn't his fault for the failure of this album. The reason is that the songs are just horrible, and it's not Cherone who writes them ...I'm so disapointed, I can't believe VH released this garbage. Of course we already had clues of what was coming (\\"BALANCE\\" ...), but this surpassed even my wildest nightmares ... Some reviewer below said a good fan stick with a band no matter what they do !!!! Well, I'd say the band thanks you for your money ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Mess","review":"This album is a mess. Don't waste your money. When Eddie canned Sammy, he goofed big time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible music, bad singer. Bring Sammy back!","review":"What a disappointment. Those who like this CD must be crazy or maybe they just want to provoke us, the real fans. Cherone is as bad a singer as Roth. Sammy please come back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD seems to lack any real effort.","review":"This CD seems to lack any real effort from the boys of Van Halen. As a long time fan, this CD seems to be in need of a focal point in which the band could build great songs around. I thought with a great singer like Gary Cherone the music would sound like Queen, instead it sounds very amateuristic. Maybe it's time to resign Dave or Sam, or give Gary more control of the song writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning! Warning! Massive ego on the loose!","review":"I'll never forget the childhood ecstasy of playing \\"Runnin With the Devil,\\" over and over and over again on my first stereo. Now I want to forget the agony of listening to this new Van Halen record. Eddie suffers from complete lack of control on every front: the solos are boring and repetetive, the songs are all too long, the \\"new\\" noises are not interesting (even annoying!), and for God sake, could no one put a stop to \\"How Many Say I?\\" I don't see Cherone as a problem--in fact, he's mixed so low I can't tell if it's really Sammy. Worse still, fans of all things Van Halen are hard pressed to find any signs of Michael Anthony's trademark vocal, which after all is the only reason we accepted Sammy so quickly. Next time, perhaps a producer who will make Ed sit down, shut up and play guitar. And even if so, I'll still want to hear it before I shell out one penny. If you haven't bought VH3, SAVE YOURSELF!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest BOMB ever!!!","review":"I have given this album plenty of time, but it's got to be the greatest bomb ever by a big name rock band. The album is pathetic, and there wasn't one song that made me want to keep this out of loyalty.

Yes, Van Halen 3 is actually worse than I remember. Not only is the music bad, but the production is awful. It sounds like Eddie found his Mr. Microphone from pre-pubescent years and called it his recording studio. Do yourself a favor and follow Sammy's career, he's obviously the brains behind the music. His \\"Ten 13\\" sounds better than anything Van Halen put out (even with him)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this the best they can do?","review":"I gave this album 1 star for the 2 good songs on it, \\"Without You\\" and \\"Fire In The Hole\\". The rest of this album goes nowhere slow. Just listen to the lyrics on \\"One I Want\\", so cliche, and boring, just what we needed more Superman lyrics. Don't even get me started on \\"How Many Say I\\". Eddie don't quit your day job! And I want to know what happened to his guitar playing, did he forget how to play or is he too old to rock? As far as I'm concerned the Greatest Hits album was the nail in the coffin for this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"This is the worst thing by Van Halen I have ever heard.

At least Sammy's still putting out good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"COME ON EDDIE, ADMIT THE MISTAKE AND DUMP THE BUM!","review":"ABSOLUTELY AWFUL. Don't waste your money! I am (was?) a devout fan of the band and can't stand this album. It is not that I was a big fan of Dave or Sammy and am mad about the break up. It is just that Gary Cherone truly comes off like a Sammy wanna-be. The thing going through my mind listening to the album was that this sounded like a really bad bar band. The songs are all totally forgettable. What a shame... I will think long and hard before buying another VH album - unless it is a reunion album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gotcha!!!","review":"Hi...My name is Ed Van Halen and my band is terrible.We sound like middle age bores and although our writing has never been good,at least it was fun.BUT YOU BOUGHT THIS GARBAGE CD.More money for me...GOTCHA!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess Van Halen doesn't really NEED fans anymore","review":"Say what you want, Van Halen was put on the map by their volutile chemistry when David Lee was with them. I can't really fault them for wanting to get rid of him, because he obviously has mental problems, but Van Halen got it's legs cut off when Roth was ousted. With the departure of Sammy, It's an outright cheat to call them Van Halen anymore. At least the Jefferson Airplane had the self respect to change the name a little bit when they had major personel changes.Good grief, Alex Ed and Mike, what the hell were you thinking when you hired a guy who looks like a hospital orderly and sings like a karaoke Hagar rip off?Do us all a favor: Hook up with David Lee for one last meaningful tour before he get's too old to jump. You'll make a half a billion dollars, then you can do what you want with the rest of your lives. All I ask is that you try to remember who got you where you are-Your fans, and David Lee. That's a fact."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?!!!","review":"This album just lets me down. Most of the time it takes me at least 2 full listinings of an album to appreaciate it. I'm not appreacaiting it yet and I have had it for a year. I have nothing against Eddie, Mike, Alex, and Gary, but the album, the songs on it, and the way it sounds is not Van Halen like.It also bugs me that when David Lee Roth left Van HAlen we had to get used to Sammy Hagar. I just got used to him. They should give us a chance to catch up. All their singers are good singers, but only David Lee Roth sounds good, and really fits in with Van Halen. Here is a hint to guys in Van Halen: If you want to gain back all of the fans you lost from this album just do a reunion tour with David Lee Roth and release and album or two and you'll have more fans than before."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last VH album","review":"After being a fan for over 20 yrs. , and after repeatedly listening to this CD, I have come to two conclusions.

Though Cherone's bleary-eyed dork look certainly didn't help, nor did his attempt to imitate Sammy.I guess the best argument of how terrible this CD is is the evidence provided by sales numbers. This is the only VH album to not go platinum. Hmnmm...I wonder if there's a reason for that??After all, it can't be just because there's a new singer....look at how tremendously successful thier first album with Sammy was. There was a reason for that too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring Back Sammy or Dave!","review":"I got into VH when Sammy was the lead singer, but the best era is the Roth era by far. And judging from Dave's solo stuff, he can still hold his own vocally. This album is awful and is a sorry tribute to the name of a former great band. They struck gold by continuing their success with a new singer after Roth...they haven't struck gold this time. They went to the well one too many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did van halen even record this album????","review":"VH III The Worst Van Halen album ever realesed, first off let me say i am a big van halen fan and have almost all of there albums anyways this album though isnt van halen, its some cheap imitation of a good band. This guy just dosent fit with the band, i mean its a good thing they finaly reunited with David Lee Roth the bands meant to be lead singer. But this album deserves to be thrown away, van halen rules but this album most certanily does not. DO NOT BUY THIS ALBUM!!!such a waste of moneyVAN HALEN RULESTHIS ALBUM DOESNT"},{"rating":"1","title":"who wanted the guy from Extreme?","review":"Van Halen hired Gary Cherone to replace Sammy Hagar as lead vocalist in 1998. The one and only album to feature the former Extreme frontman more or less bombed! Not to say that Van Halen III is terrible, it certaintly isn't any worse than the last two Van Halen albums with Hagar. Heck Fire in the Hole is actually a pretty decent song. So, Van Halen III is fair, probably about equal to Women and Children First, Fair Warning, For Unlawful Carnal Knowledge, and Balance, if you liked any of those albums you'd probably like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sucks, Say I","review":"Wow!

I bust this disc out when morbid curiousity hits me-I get in moods where I enjoy listening to bad albums by favorite bands (I LOVE St.Anger!!). Cherone sounds like a bad Hagar, and that's REAL bad.

Life is too short...Tora Tora Tora!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"Van Halen got rid of Hagar & Roth to end up with this. This cd belongs in the garbage.

Please don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie Shows Off - Unfortunately!","review":"This CD should be entitled \\"Eddies Solos Plus Some Singing\\". After listening to this CD completely through 4 or 5 times (sometimes it takes a while for a album to grow on you), I've come to the conclusion that the purpose of this album was to show how great a guitarist Eddie truly is - but didn't we already know that? The songs rarely flow from start to finish and few of the songs really give you the musically satisfaction of the David Lee Roth days or the early Sammy days. Save your money and buy anything you don't have of Van Halens from 1988 back to Van Halen I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of Eddie's best playing and deepest creativity...","review":"I am going to keep it short here. If you're a true Van Halen fan or shall I say...true Eddie Van Halen fan....this album is not to be missed. Sure, Gary's singing can grate on you at times and it's not full of stadium pop rock party songs. It is Eddie and the boys feeling creative and free and it's got some of Eddie's greatest guitar playing on it ever. It's worth it just to listen to his love of playing. Here's to wishing Eddie will release more instrumental albums. If this is a preview of all the different things he's got laying around 5150, then let us have them please!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing.","review":"Unfortunately I think the band has had it. Eddie sounds like garbage and the new singer is not all that. The best song on the album has to be Without You but that ain't sayin' much. I can't believe I spent money getting this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was very excited that Cherone was the new lead singer. Extreme (Cherone's previous) was one of the best groups ever, as well as one of the most misunderstood and underrated. I bought this album the first day it was released in hopes of a great album, I was quite disappointed. It's not any one area that's so disappointing, in fact there are some high points, it's just that the album fails as a whole. I don't share the other reviewer's enthusiasm and intrigue with VH's lead singer soap opera (in fact, this is a turn-off for me). If you want a really good VH album, buy the Greatest Hits, it's an excellent album.I'm still hopeful that VH can turn it around with Cherone (consider purchasing Extreme II and III, III is one of the most ambitious albums ever recorded) because Cherone and Eddie VH are both so talented. Pass on this one and get Extreme and VH's greatest hits -- you'll be much happier a week and a year from now."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree","review":"What's one more bad review to the previous 25 or so.

With efforts like this, Van Halen will be playing county fairs in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give it NO STARS, I would.","review":"This album is horrible. No question about it. The songs/lyrics are just boring/unoriginal, I have written songs for guitar better than some of these, and I'm a DRUMMER. The lyrics are boring and whiny, similar to... hmmm... extreme. Maybe they should have got Sass Jordan to sing. DLR band and Sammy Hagar albums are MUCH BETTER. Ed wrote this on the can, well he's S&$# out of luck to get me to buy the next one. END THE BAND! I was an all time fan, but you gotta figure, is it Lead Singer Disorder, or EVH Hip disorder. This album is not HIP, and there has to be some reason that TWO singers would have left this band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only bad VH album!","review":"The only part that's any good is the first 1/2 minute of track 11. SAMMY RULES! Maybe they can bury their differences and reunite - until then, I'm not interested. They should've hired Sebastian Bach from Skid Row."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sober Music That Sucks","review":"I was a diehard Van Halen fan until hearing this album. VH III lacks the \\"My Guitar Will Kick Your Ass\\" overtones previous VH albums contained, instead offering limp-wristed songs about politics and other innane topics that just don't fit the VH paradigm. Its as if Eddie took a long hike in the woods with Peter Frampton and just turned into a big wussy.Solution: Send Gary/Kato back to Boston, swallow your pride, do a couple of shots, and call Sammy. Beg him to return to the band. Give him publishing rights, whatever it takes. Just do it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was there an early Y2K problem when recording this album???","review":"I've listened to VH for years and loved VH for years. I thought maybe with Eddie not painting and putting together his own guitars from parts anymore he would have more time to produce a better album. Maybe it's the fact that with all their money there's just too many toys to play with in the studio, I'm not sure. What I do know is that they hired a good parrot in Gary Cherone to try and sing like Sammy. All I can say (and I hope that one day I might be wronged) is that the days of VH are gone. Gone are the cool riffs, fantastic leads, and great music, from the days of Dave to even the days of Sammy. Not every band can come out with a good album every time and I guess this is their time. I think what Eddie should do is take some advice and take it \\"one day at a time\\", after all this is life, the one you get, so come and have a ball."},{"rating":"1","title":"NEW LEAD SINGER'S FAULT","review":"The music is OK - Eddie...you are OK - so what were you thinking????

Its a shame that you, Michael, Alex,and now Gary Cherone instead of taking the opportunity to take the band to the next level, offer the fans a musical can of Spam. Pieces of different types of music slapped together in an seriously toned manner. What happened to the music being fun again? Ask DLR or Sammy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen..... RIP","review":"All I can say is good bye Van Halen. I have been the BIGGEST VH fan with Dave and even Sammy. I have met them except Eddie. VH is VH with Dave, but Sammy entered the band at a perfect time when Ed's music writing style was changing. You can hear it in 1984.When I bought VH3 on the first day, I put it in the CD player. I had already heard \\"The one I want\\" which I thought stunk, but I listened to the first 4 songs, I cried ( not really)! I guess the album would have been OK or pretty good if Sammy wrote the lyrics and sang on the album. Ed needs to stop interfering with lyrics, get Dave or Sammy back and PICK UP ALOT OF HEINIKEN's and start pounding! If these things don't happen Van Halen will RIP because Warner Bros. will drop them just like they did to Ted Templeman."},{"rating":"1","title":"No More Party Songs From The Party Song Band!","review":"To those of you who write about the changes that Van Halen has taken and how sweet and pretty and cuddly and wholesome, I say, \\"**** YOU\\"! Van Halen was the \\"Party Song Band\\". They don't do nice, sweet, \\"Apple Pie\\", songs. Listen to \\"I'm the one\\" off their first album, Play guitar, LOUDLY! Everybody wants some. Give us back the Real Van Halen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Worse Than You Could Possibly Imagine","review":"I am amending my previous review: It is not that this CD is not what we come to expect from Van Halen (ie Roth/Hagar). It is just, in comparison to other music today, the worst album released in 1998. I am not comparing this to old VH but just to music in general. I'll say it again: This CD blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DECLINE DID NOT BEGIN HERE...","review":"Of course chosing Cherone to sing could only lead to such a distateful album like this one, but VH decline began before, in BALANCE.

Gary Is Leaving Van Halen!","review":"This has got to be the most reviewed album I have seen on Amazon, with good reason. No one can express just how amazingly bad it is. But fear not! Gary is leaving VH! They'll probably still release the next LP which they finished with Gary, but this is a step in the right direction. I doubt Sam and Dave will be included in the next line up, but I wonder what Axl Rose is up to..... Anyway, I guess Ed got the point, and I hope he decides to start making ROCK music again. Who knows. I did buy this album, and most of the other post-Roth records, just hoping with all hope, that the man that gave us Fair Warning and 1984, and to a lesser extent, OU812, would deliver again. So far, I've been dissapointed. But with this news, I will hope that the VH flag is still flying high. To Sam, Dave and Gary, a suggestion: Start a band!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 Stars? You must be Crazy!","review":"Everyone who gave this album 5 stars should have their head examined. 5 Stars should represent a Classic Album, this is no where near a good album - let alone classic. Stop trying to convince yourself, \\"the first time I listened to it I didn't like it\\", and tell Eddie and Alex how you really feel. This album sucks - next singer! Please, the next time you have the urge to recommend or critique an album, stick with the Top 40 crowd, that's where your musical tastes belong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen???","review":"I did not care for this album, and it seems neither did many Van Halen fans, either of the Hagar or Roth variety. Probably why it is harder to find...nobody bought it! If you really like VH, do not purchase this album expecting it to fall in line with all the others. Almost sounds like more of a tribute album."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the greatest mistakes ever in rock n roll.","review":"This has got to be one of the greatest bombs in rock history.

This sounds like a bad tribute band version of the disappointing devolution of Van Halen into Van Hagar. The majority of the remaining fans of a once exhilarating band want the return of the David Lee Roth (DLR) - fronted version. Although Van Hagar had more number 1 albums the DLR fronted Van Halen sold far more units - by a nearly 2 to 1 margin and remain the calssic Van Halen played on classic rock stations today. I would rhetorically ask Ed Van Halen - is it so wrong to give the fans who've made you rich what they want? Don't you think Steven Tyler or Mick Jagger give their guitarists a migraine from time to time? Yet they, like David Lee Roth, front a band like you play guitar - as only a handful of charismatic lead singers can. And doesn't Van Halen's legacy, like its fans, deserve better than unflattering comparisons to Journey?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Van Halen owes me $15.95 + tax","review":"I am one of the 500,000 die hard Van Halen fans that was ripped off by buying this album when it first came out. The bottom line on this one is that while Gary Cherone has a good voice, the song writing is just total crap. There is not one memorable tune. Gary never had a chance. You might read a few reviews that say the poor album performance is because fans revolted against a new front man, etc. Not true. You might find a few pretentious music snobs saying Van Halen's fan base just didn't understand that album. Also not true. Bad song writing and production = a crappy album and that is what you get when you buy Van Halen III. When Van Halen refunds my $15.95 + tax I may buy another album, but not while this steaming hunk of garbage remains in my cd collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worth getting for Without You......used.","review":"This isn't a great Van Halen album, but the song Without You has grown on me, so at least listen to it once, it's VERY cheap used, so how can you go wrong??A career encompassing compilation must include that song!P.S. catch up with Sammy and Michael Anthony:Chickenfoot"},{"rating":"1","title":"probably the worst album I have","review":"I am a big fan of Van Halen. However, after I rushed to the store when it came out and bought it, I hopefully listened that the next song would be \\"worth it\\". It never was. I gave it a chance. Dave, hold your head up high.

This album is absolutely terrible. If these tunes were being shopped to record execs by a no-name band, doors would have been slammed after bodies were kicked to the curb. This release is truly shameful.I have followed Van Halen since their debut in '78, and have enjoyed EVERY album they have released. This one is, in a word, lame. NOT because it \\"dares to be different\\", but because it \\"dares to be worthless\\". Terrible vocals, terrible lyrics, terrible tunes.Guitar playing is great, of course, but how can you bear to listen to it through the boring, self-indulgent, and heartless tracks on this CD?Just get an mp3 of \\"Fire in the Hole\\" (the only good tune) from a pal. Then take your $ and spend it on an artist who is creating something from the heart, be it Kid Rock, classical, or even Britney Spears!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Van Halen album I ever got rid of.","review":"Okay, everyone says the guitar work on this record is great. So what? It's been good, if not better on previous records. Gary Cherone, formerly of Van Halen rip-off band, Extreme, sounds like a Hagar clone at best. The lyrics are worse than even the worst crap Sammy came up with. And need I mention 'How Many Say I'? I almost cried when I heard that, not because it was \\"deep\\", but because it was so forkin' awful! (Sorry, Ed.) I was never a fan of the Van Hagar line-up, but this crap sent me running back to 5150. Here's my barometer. When I sold this album, along with Dave's DLR Band release(better than III, but still not very good)Dave's album brought back more than VHIII. There's some vindication for ya Dave.(Don't worry, Dave, I may have sold your album, but new Van Halen out-sucks you ten to one. You never see many Roth-Era records in the used bin.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"so bad it's sad","review":"Easily the worst album a major band has ever produced. Eddie Van Halen singing that song was embarassing. Eddie didn't like Dave or Sammy because if they didn't like the music he had written they would tell him it wasn't up to snuff. Obviosly Gary is a yes man happy to be in the band, he won't say boo to eddie when one of his songs suck. note to eddie you have to work harder dude, you have to much talent for this garbage.

Eddie Van Halen one of the world great guitar players should be above this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Van Halen CD ever!!!","review":"Don't try to fool yourself. This CD sucks. Van Halen definitely lost its way. They hired a Sammy Hagar's clone (Gary Cherone), made an album full of fillers and ugly songs (listen to \\"Without You\\"!!) There's nothing in there that reminds Van Halen. I don't talk about David Lee ROth days, nor Sammy Hagar, but about VH itself, with heart in their songs, great drumming, everything a hard-rock metal band should have. Even when keyboards were added, the band was great. But this VH III is nothing at all. It seems that they got envy from Metallica's \\"Reload\\" and resolved doing the same stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe next time?","review":"I was dissapointed with this album.

This is the worst effort from all members of the band I have ever heard. Eddies guitar has gone the way of the dodo. The vocals from this album are horrible. Even the lyrics seem like they were writen by Al Gore. The only good thing about this CD is the picture on the inside cover of Eddie flexing his bicep. I think the only way to revive this band is to give Cherone his walking papers, give Sammy a call, buy a case of Jose Quervo, and sit down and figure it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"VAN HALEN IS DEAD!!!-you better find Sammy or Dave-dont buy","review":"dont buy this one it sucks bad ,thats what happens when you dog out 2 of the best singers for this bands style.sorry Ed,you need to think back to VH-1&2--Fair Warning--Ed with crap like this even die hards will drop your boring attempts at the good old days.for your own good find Sammy!!!!-or hang it up.ex fan from Texas-and Calif.

The new singer had a good voice, there just isn't anything backing him. Maybe next time....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than the average fan will admit to","review":"This album has never gotten a good rep. I think that's probably because it doesn't have Diamond Dave, nor Sammy Hagar on it. I think at this point in VH's career, they said \\"Gary Cherone? Who is that?\\" I'd venture to say most VH fans probably never heard of Extreme.Anyway, the album has several highlights - Without You, Dirty Water Dog, & Fire in the Hole amongst others. Is it VH1? Is it 1984? No, but that's not the point - this is a good album on it's own. If you can see past the bias that has been heaped on this album over the years, you might discover a disc that has a lot going for it.Don't believe the hype - check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, Give Them an \\"A\\" for effort...","review":"But sorry people, the execution falls flat. Granted, thisis something of a \\"new\\" direction for VH and shouldn't be held up against the past, not the Hagar era and especially not the Roth era. However, Eddie seems to have hit the glass ceiling as far as trying his hand at being more \\"progressive\\". The songs are too long, unbelievably disjointed, and crudely cliched. The titanic drums and monster guitar have been replaced by...um more synths, and that's about it. Gary Cherone is no better or worse than Hagar really, but this album can't be blamed on him. Eddie, Alex and Mike sound like a bunch of 13-year olds trying tosound like Rush re the \\"Permanent Waves\\" era. Even after two or three listens these WILL NOT grow on you.

Van Halen sucks now and has sinced Dave left, Extreme sucks and so does the singer of Extreme who replaced corny Sammy Hagar. If you're even thinking of buying this album-DON'T!!

Much the same way that Coca Cola owns Sprite, so they have every right to market Sprite in a Coca Cola bottle.This album is the \\"Extreme\\" using the Van Halen name.

The barbarian is from the frozen North, his god is 'Gorm' (Conan's is 'Crom'), he swings mighty sword, blah, blah, blah. I stopped reading at the beginning of the third chapter, when the 4th grade writing made me gag.\\"The 'urlium hull was lighter, for the negative influence of the lightning had begun to wear off, but the airboat was still far from ready to fly, although Thongor and Karm Karvus had anchored it securely to the purple bole of a mighty jannibar tree for protection, binding it securely with a rope of woven vines.\\"That's one sentence, and four thoughts, and not a single piece of punctuation would fix it.

Defending Ourselves teaches methods that I feel are more appropriate in the dojo than on the street. The section on firearms contains many errors and over simplifications. The author should have made an effort to consult an expert on the topic or eliminated the section altogether. The book encourages women to take responsiblity for their own safety and well being. Something I agree with completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"A superficial book - at best!","review":"This book is little more than a rehashing of other works written by someone who apparently thinks she has something special to offer - she does not! While her book does offer some practical post rape advice, the safety and self defense sections are full of errors; it reads like someone who took a few classes but lacks the voice of real experience. Her self defense advice reads like pseudo-feminist exercise lessons. No where does she even address the intensity of fear or how violent real attacks can be, or even the most basic martial concepts of speed and power - the might and force it takes to repel or incapacitate a comitted attacker. All in all, Wiseman's book has a juvenille, rich girl feeling - certainly not grounded in streetwise reality. My best advice to her is to stay on the pretty college campuses - and stay off the mean streets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some scenes well written","review":"Overall, the story line addressed the issues attempted, but not as well as it could have been carried out.

I contacted Marware who were happy to have me ship them the defective casing AT MY OWN COST and when sending me a replacement, being in Canada I was slapped with a nice $21.87 CAD import charge! Ridiculous! I wish I read the reviews for other such Marware products and never had to go through all these hassles. DON'T BUY THIS CASING! It's a good design but TERRIBLE choice of materials offering no protection for your iPod since it's soft and easily torn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Artistic Excuse For Porn","review":"This one is proof that anything will sell. The artist approaches a couple of women and says he would like them to pose for some naught pictures. They agree without hesitation. We see them pose and the artist start his painting. In the middle of the sequence the \\"painting\\" action is replaced by a fantasy segment where the models have sex with each other. In the way we see several paintings done. One of the extras has the artist do commentary on the walkthrough of a painting's creation.As far as learning how an artist works, what inspires him, his techniques, or his history, you won't find it here. Although advertised as a serious artist retrospective it looks more like a stab at a quick buck. If you are looking for artistic information you should look elsewhere. If you are looking for erotica or porn, you will also be disappointed.

I contacted K&N; via email. The next day, I received a call from a real American, speaking real English who was eager to help me. The guy on the phone sent me several replacement parts including a new filter at no charge and gave me his direct line in the event that did not resolve the issue.

This book has come to my rescue and I especially like that there are separate chapters on cats and dogs. There is also a separate chapter on use of the remedies wih horses.The best feature of the book is the second chapter \\"Using the remedies\\" where the authors spell out the animal behaviors that can indicate a need for each of the 38 remedies. For example, Crab Apple is the remedy for cleansing and is indicated for a animal who does excessive grooming or chews on its fur or feathers.The only negative aspect for me, as an American, is the very British slant in the resources lists and in the case studies. However, that is a small complaint in the overall usefulness of this title."},{"rating":"1","title":"mwoah...","review":"I bought this cd because I'm a great fan of Cox, but I was a bit disappointed when I heard it. It's the kind of easy listening that even my parents don't play anymore. Of course, there are a few tracks that I do like, but I prefer the technomusic Carl Cox plays most of the time... In my opinion, the cd isn't really one piece of music, as I am used to with mixed albums.

My conclusion is that the seller misled the purchaser on the condition of the cover but the inside was near perfect.

It is very difficult to understand and the layout impossible to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Most","review":"Many of the plant aquarium books readily available are either pamphlets or gorgeous books to dream over. Each has its merits, but this book is headed in the right direction. The balance between fish and plants is a delicate matter and one that should not be taken lightly. There is a lot to be learned and this book is a great place to start. There are a lot of easy to understand color graphics which show how plants and fish need to interact for your aquarium to thrive. The explanation of how water chemistry changes at night is most valuable. The listing of plants in the back is more of a sampling than a true encyclopedia. I hope a version of this book comes out with just a listing of plant species!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book for beginners","review":"This book is clearly written, easy to understand and beautifully illustrated with photos. It includes loads of information on how to setup a planted tank, choose plants that will survive in the conditions you can provide, and how to provide proper nutrition and lighting. There is only one omission I think should be in the book - there is no specific mention of Flourite as a substrate, which perhaps would be included in the \\"nutrient rich substrate\\" category Hiscock discusses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!","review":"Just what I needed. Perhaps not complete in terms of covering every plant you could want, but covers so much more. If you're just starting out, want more than just the basics, then this IS your book.I'm the kind that likes to really know how things work. This is the book for people like me. If you just want pictures of plants, there's plenty of TFH books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but not everything","review":"The biggest benefit of this book is the plant profiles section. It is pretty thorough but doesn't have every plant or all of the info I would like to have like how fast things grow, it just says \\"grows fast or slow\\". I would like to know how much over what period of time. Same thing with the lighting.The practical section is ok, but I wouldn't say follow it to closely. I tried some of the things it suggested and they did not work or made things worse. I found better, more accurate info on online forums. I think it should have more info on fertilizers, CO2, algae, and accurate info on lighting.It gets a four star review because there just isn't much in the way of good books for the planted aquarium hobby right now and the plant profiles section is good. I would buy this book because it is a good reference for plants but I would recommend going online and finding a good \\"planted aquarium\\" forum for all other info."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Book","review":"My encyclopedia I recieved doesn't match the picture, however none the less what I paid for this book and the speed of shipping was very pleasant and I'm very pleased with the book.

It has very in-depth information. I've always had problems with algae in my planted aquarium and this book explains several reasons why this occurs and how to prevent it. It explains, in detail, nutrient requirements, lighting options, ways that fish and invertebrates interact with plants, and which plants are best for beginners. It explains complicated information with clear diagrams. Finally, there is a great list of plants with photos and info.The only negative thing I can say is that this book is probably not the best for someone who only wants one or two plants in their aquarium and is looking for a simple introduction. This book isn't very simple, but it does offer clear explanations of many topics relating to growing plants in your aquarium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defects happen.

The first one got its legs caught and suffocated and the second one was in the top, severed in half. Even when I'm just adjusting the knob to feed the fish, the power from the filter slams them into the glass!

The way the main character reacts to the problems in her life is disturbing, but somehow liberating. Although I would never do the things she does, I could really relate to her and it was a great fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Layover","review":"The tragedy Claire experienced is unfathomable. Readers who complain that Claire is unlikable are missing the point. You don't have to like someone to care about them, to understand them or learn about life from them. In books, people get to live out their fantasy response, and Claire's actions are believable, impulsive and exciting. I loved being on the receiving end of Claire's witty insights and I enjoyed her Xray eyes. Interesting, how she never connected with other mothers before, perhaps that aggravated her experience. Zeidner's style is classy. Can't wait for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dynamic writing style, lousy characters and plot","review":"The first third of this book was innovative and a fun read. Then it began a downward spiral of ridiculous plot and unlikeable characters. Yes, Claire was self-aborbed, grieving, etc., but then she just became rather sick and stupid. I finished it hoping for some change which never appeared. The author had a good storyline, jauntily descriptive writing style, but the characters kidnapped her story and took it for a sorry joy ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Claire's \\"craziness\\" rings frighteningly \\"sane.\\"","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was oddly bittersweet and refreshingly real! Claire is remarkably composed and self-assured, while at the same time, entirely fragile. I felt very proud of her and sorry for her too, but the pride won out! She's my hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book to gulp down---then go back and savor","review":"This novel is such a fast-paced, enticing read that I don't think you realize until it's over how good it really is. But the book has stayed with me--images and ideas from it have kept cropping up. Claire is such an original and spellbinding character that you almost begin to see things--men, marriage, airports--through her eyes. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breast seller?","review":"First Elizabeth Wurtzel's BITCH, now this. If there's a topless woman on the cover, it must be good, right? Anyway, Zeidner is too talented to wholly dismiss; there are many fine passages of physical description (credit cards, room service trays), particularly in the opening pages. But finally we're left with a contrived tale, spun out for far too long, whose point almost seems to be: how naughty can Clare be and still get away with it? She stops seeming \\"transgressive\\" (or \\"newly bold,\\" yes we get the joke about the name) and just comes off as a selfish deadbeat. Don't believe me? What if I take my shirt off?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, implausible plot, revolting characters.","review":"Zeidner spins a yawn: this book is really boring. Also, the characters are so repellent that I don't care what happens to them, but I wish them the worst. Is there anyone else out there who found the plot implausible? So many empty rooms!

It's also become my last, because this was one terrible book. Words fail to describe, and I can't bring myself to recall the dull, lifeless, insipid text.Should I allow one bad reading experience to keep me from the genre? Perhaps, if you consider the praise heaped on this clunker! Instead, if you're into semi-fictional accounts of women, adolescent or otherwise, stick with Jane Austen and Louisa May Alcott. They are referred to as \\"classics\\" for all the best reasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes human sex less exciting than plant intercourse","review":"The book would have you think that the death of a child exonerates the promiscuity of the mother. I can interpret the logic of \\"Layover\\" in no other way. I would prefer honest porn that pretends to be nothing more than it is to this tawdry tale that attempts to surround human vileness with an aura of profundity. \\"Layover\\" has depth that is only virtual. Dive into this book's \\"deep\\" end and you risk hurting yourself. It is much more likely, however, that the reader will discover this book on the floor in the morning and have no recollection of how it got there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the sexy cover fool you.","review":"A friend recommended this, and when I saw the sexy cover, I thought, excellent -- I'm in for a wild ride. But this is high-brow chick-lit, without many surprises, and left me unsatisfied. It's a tale of self-discovery, sure, but at the end I felt it was a weak discovery. I wish I could get away from my life of material comfort, job prosperity, and surgeon spouse, only to realize that, hey, maybe my life ain't so bad afterall. Still, it's well written and moves quickly. I finished it in a couple of nights. But I wish it had gone deeper into the darkside of grief. I wouldn't call this self-destructive behavior. I mean, how bad can things get when you're staying at the Four Seasons (as this character does for most of the book)?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"What I thought would be a \\"light read\\" turned into quite a bit more.

What mother who loses a young child waits 5 years and then goes off sneaking into hotels and sleeping with perfect strangers? Didn't ring true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Subway Trash","review":"I bought this book in hardcover because the reviews were so good, but I wish I'd spent my $25.00 on Salter instead. The narrator of this novel thinks she has brass cojones, but really she's just a Grade-A whiner with nothing new or original to say. The writing is pretentious and clunky. I slogged up to page 150 or so, hoping and praying with each new page that the prose would improve or that Claire would guzzle a gallon of Liquid Drano, but I finally ended up chucking the book in a trash can at the Union Station stop. Everybody has their own opinion, but if you're looking for something good to read, I suggest you save your 25 bucks and read the back of a cereal box. You'll get more out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average at best.","review":"Sorry, but this has all the trappings of the Erica Jong School of Fiction: a marriage in trouble, a wife on the edge, overprecious description, reconciliation at the end with a too-stable but lovable husband..been there, done that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original view of one woman's pain.","review":"Finished in one sitting-what more can I say? Claire is dealing with her pain, hurt, and feelings of betrayal. The way in which she does so is original and thought provoking. Has she embarked upon a truly self-destructive path? Or is she merely exorcising her own inner demons in order to become a better person? Claire does what a lot of women only fantasize about doing. She also engages in a process of self-actualization which many of us are incapable of doing (men and women). Engaging, thought provoking and entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled","review":"I'm tired of being tricked into buying books that are supposed to be moving, or supposed to be darkly funny. This one, I don't care what they say, is poorly-written, full of cliches, and boring, and self-serving. All these glowing \\"customer reviews\\" are not to be trusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like a hangover","review":"I can't believe one of these reviews is titled \\"A fun frolic...\\". I find it disturbing that someone would call it \\"fun\\". I thought it was a very sad book...even depressing. It also dragged on. I have to admit I didn't even finish. I quit about two-thirds of the way through. I found no joy in reading this book and would recommend you read something else.I have to agree with others, the author writes well. That's the only nice thing I can say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"Although the quality of the writing at the beginning of this book was sufficient for me to buy it, I was left cold. It is a story of a middle-aged woman feeling despondent about the loss of a child (it's not clear how long in the past) and susequent one-time infidelity of her husband, who acts out by remaining away from home and engaging sexually with just about anybody in sight. Yes, some might be titillated by the frequent use of sexual terms, and I will admit that I like the author's style, but the book failed to go anywhere--It has no beginning, no crisis and a highly predictable outcome. If it were much longer than 268 pages, I'm certain I would not have finished this book. There are MANY books more worthy of one's time."},{"rating":"1","title":"it takes precious little","review":"it seems, to get a book published these days. My guess is that 50% of the people who purchased this book did so because of the partly exposed boob on the cover. I know that there are books that are meant to be taken to the beach or the mountains for summer vacation and then left at the rental house because to bring it home would mean more weight in the car and lower gas mileage. But if the reader struggles to get through the first 30 pages of truly uninspired writing more than once, something is seriously wrong. At least if Ms. Zeidner could write, it might redeem the ridiculous \\"plot\\" line. Even the sex, which presumably enticed a number of people to buy the book is unexciting. The dust jacket says that the author is a professor of English at a respected university; one can only hope that she is a much better teacher than she is a writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"The board is small and overpriced.

The best part is that this should happen after your warranty is out and HP is not acknowledging that it is a problem. However it is a problem, yours. But thats not even the best part. The video cards and motherboards are going out on a lot of these and they have a recall out on many of them. But guess what? Not this model and thats what happened to me.

I had seen many of these growing up on weekday afternoons and Saturday mornings in the 70's and 80's.The last two discs must be of interest to history buffs, but they are not funny at all to me. I'm only 42, so I guess I am too young to enjoy a lot of that really early stuff.No Foghorn Leghorn, no Wile E, no Road Runner.

Good grief, do you feel the same way about films? Books? In case you're not aware, there are quite a few that were written before 1960, and some of them are quite good. I say pull your head out of your ego and learn to enjoy something that happened before MTV. Or just go back to your video games.

This is speaking as an adult Deaf person.Really the only thing good about this book would be if you are looking to communicate with a deaf child.

If you have ever heard a foreigner struggle to say something in your native tongue and completely bungle it because they didn't know the rules of the language...that's exactly the position you will be in using phrases from this book when communicating with ASL signers. An experienced signer might be able to figure out what you're trying to say, but it won't be pretty. I concur with previous reviews that if you are serious about learning ASL, and especially if you are seeking a career that involves signing, you will shoot yourself in both feet and an eye with this book. So unless there is a specific reason you need signed English phrases, my recommendation is that you instead buy this phrase book:The American Sign Language Phrase Book.

My only hope is that she isn't left in the dust of the mainstream effluvium born of greed and lacking the appreciation for great talent.Both Avalanche and Rules for Jokers are outstanding works which should be included in any serious audiophiles collection.

Now they are very soothing to me. It is also unfortunate that the best song \\"Complicated Man\\" is only on the import version.

At 14 months my son is not able to do that because the switch is almost invisible to a little child.The remote control is also poorly designed. There is one button that does everything... it moves the car forward and turn it around in all directions. It is extremely sensitive.

If you are a beginner, you won't be once you get involved in the tutorials. The author is very funny and the lessons are step by step with full color photos. You can match your results with the ones in the book. This a variety of subject matter from conservative to the hot new trends. As an artist, I have just added graphic arts to my portfolio. With Down and Dirty Tricks, I feel as if I have been working in the field for years. You don't even have to start at page one, just jump right in anywhere and start working. This is our textbook in my Advanced Photoshop class. You won't want to stop working! If he would only write something on Illustrator 9!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Frustrated? No. Excited, Delighted and Amazed? Yes.","review":"This book provides the extra tips you need to amaze your friends and family. It is fun to explore all of the tools in photoshop on your own and come up with exciting designs but with this book you will have an edge and wonderful results. I like to share my tips- like No Way! Let them figure it out for themselves or better yet discover this book-a great secret of mine. Yes, I feel like I am the master of creativity and computer graphics, thanks to this book. It is hard for me to go to sleep at night and I can't save enough images on a zip drive due to the amount of work and the love of making new art. Thanks I really want the video/ Thanks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book...","review":"I am an intermediate user of photoshop. I got alot out of this book. It has notes on the sides of each page about a technique or shortcut in photoshop. I haven't even got the guts of the book and I love it. Simply wrote and easy to read. No fluff."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an AWESOME Book! Own Photoshop? You need this book!","review":"I find it hard to believe that anyone who has actually PURCHASED & READ this book would give this book anything less than 4 stars! I personally found it to be worth 5 stars! This book IS just what it the title states, Down & Dirty Tricks. If you want to learn some great tricks for Photoshop and apply them to your everyday use, then Scott Kelby has created the book for you! I found this book easy to read and enjoyable. The only thing I could even possibly think about knocking is the lack of more talk of Wacom Tablets, (hence the 4 out of 5 stars) but then I did find a great Wacom Tablet video at PhotoshopVideos.com. Over all, if you own Photoshop, than this book is a must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a book you'll just love","review":"Scott Kelby really really knows Photoshop, and he passes on that knowledge in this excellent book. It's hard to know if you'll ever use some of the info he presents, but if you want to go from expert to Power User, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocks","review":"This book stays on my desk right next to my computer so it's always within reach when I need a creative boost. I love being able to duplicate the incredible effects he shows that I would never be able to figure our myself. He has an incredible ability to take very complicated things and break them down to their basic steps. Whether you just follow the step-by-step directions to reproduce the effects in the book or use them as a launching pad for your own creativity, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEVEN STARS","review":"Yes seven is the least this book deserves. It is laid out thoughtfully so the reader becomes familiar with its format effortlessly. There is absolutely no verbal or graphic fat anywhere. You see the effect you want; you read how to create it and it works. What more could you ask for?The author writes in a friendly, concise manner and lets the reader in on a few hard won facts. Follow the directions and even a novice can produce the beautiful effects. Along side each trick are sidebars containing Photoshop tips. It's just a great tool to have. I'm still shocked at some of the effects I've created while reading this book.Scott Kelby, the author, is also editor-in-chief of Photoshop User magazine, president of the National Association of Photoshop Professionals ( NAPP ), training director for the Adobe Photoshop Seminar Tour, and a great teacher. Don't be intimidated by his titles, however, he knows how to get the message across. You will only grow from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Follow the bouncing ball","review":"Scott Kelby is no doubt a well rounded expert in the graphic arts, and photoshop. Whether your interest lies in advertising, photography, web publication, or design, Scott's got it covered here in this book. Nifty little tricks you've already seen in media and wondered \\"How did they do that\\" are covered here. Step by step it's easy to follow, making each step very clear. Some knowledge of Photoshop may be required, but only just to understand \\"why\\" these little niffty tricks work. Think you've seen it all? What to be amused by what you can do with Photoshop? Scott's book is for you then. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent how-to book","review":"Down and Dirty Tricks leads through a number of graphic effects and text treatment. It is limited in what all is covered, but by following the examples, you can learn much about Photoshop 6. If you are looking for a complete course on Photoshop, look elsewhere. If you want to polish up on graphic presentations, this may well be the answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY shallow and basic - not worth the money","review":"It's a funny thing - you see all these incredibly good reviews for this book, and then you are confronted with the absolutely useless stuff that parades as \\"techniques\\" within. This is one of the weakest Photoshop books I've EVER seen - all of the contents of this book are old hat (with the exception of the Photoshop 6 coverage, which is no better than that which comes with the actual program). Worse, I read the Amazon interview with the author, Scott Kelby - this guys admits to basically not having read a single real book in his life. It shows in his writing style, which is grating and adolescent...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Time Saver","review":"I can't believe the tricks Scott Kelby has packed into this book. No nonsense, no advanced mathematics, no extraneous explanations to prove he knows more about Photoshop that anyone else. He just shows you how to do one great effect after another. I have downloaded tutorials for alot of this stuff, then I find I can do the same effect or better in half the time by following Scott's tricks.This definitely belongs on your bookshelf. Or better yet, next to your computer desk.Just note that this isn't an instruction manual. If you're starting out in Photoshop, get The Photoshop Bible. But even for a beginner, the step by step instructions in Down and Dirty Tricks would be pretty hard to get confused over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although you can find some interesting techniques in this book, there's nothing that will absolutely knock your socks off...contrary to what the title indicates. In addition, most of the exercises aren't fully explained, so even an intermediate user has to figure out the extra steps needed to move forward.For the money, this book doesn't even come close to a book like Photoshop 6 Web Magic in terms of the 'Wow' factor and in explicating the steps necessary to complete each project."},{"rating":"1","title":"MAC Lovers Book by a real MAC nerd","review":"Disappointing is what this book turned out to be. Useless with a PC. The author obviously is a MAC user who understands a few key strokes in the PC but not the interface provided by the software. These are old, basic tricks for anyone who has ever used Photoshop, Photo Paint by Corel or other graphics programs.Definitely a disappointing book. Returned it same day we received it. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of Photographic content","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It has little to do with \\"Photo\\" in Photoshop. The first 75 pages are on drop shadows and type effects. Only 25 pages devoted to working with photo techniques. The other 200 pages are devoted to Text effects, illustrating, and web page effects. Adobe offers Illustrator and Pagemaker for these purposes .It is difficult to duplicate his effects without a CD containing the images that he uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"really pretty lame","review":"the tips in this book will only be helpful to those in need of cornball, dated graphic tricks. the aesthetic world is in trouble if this information gets into the wrong hands..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Public Domain Tricks Recycled","review":"As a longtime Photoshop user (version 2.0), I remember seeing thefirst issue of Kelby's Photoshop magazine and the birth of hisNational Association of Photoshop Users. Unfortunately, this bookrecycles much content from the magazine's history, and offers littlenew work. Worse, as is common knowledge among most NAPP members, mostof these \\"tricks\\" have long been available for free on theWeb at various Photoshop tutorial sites built both as a public serviceby designers and those looking to sell banner ad space. Couple thiswith the generally poor printing of the book's color plates, and youshould seriously question purchasing this self-published book,particularly if you're a professional designer. If you've got anInternet connection, save yourself some money and find this stuff forfree with a good search engine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Reading!","review":"I just received my copy of Scott Kelby's book and I can put it down only long enough to put my hands on the keyboard and try out these tips! His humor and simplicity make this book very easy to follow. Each trick is fully illustrated step by step, including screen shots. On each page on either side of the demonstration are tips and explanations in text. This book is a goldmind as far as where it will take your creativity. I never knew I could do half this stuff, he makes it so easy, that I get it on the first try! I'm going to buy another copy of this book to give to my brother-in-law. I'm also going to look for other books by Scott Kelby-hopefully in Illustrator."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"I first found out about Scott Kelby when I wanted to learn more about photoshop and saw his web site of his videos. I ordered his videos and was impressed with his skills and how easy he made everything seem. I then saw his book on his web site and found it amazing. It has some eye popping tips and tricks for text, images and creating interfaces. All you need to use this book is basic photoshop skills. This book will make you look like a professional user in no time. Be prepared that when you get this book to sit in front of your computer trying out all these amazing techniques. A must have for any photoshop user."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing is new","review":"Sorry Scott, I like your stuff, but this was a disappointment. Photoshop 6 is such a huge new update, but your down and dirty tricks for 6 was almost identical to the one for 5. You changed a few steps, but basically only had the same stuff. I was expecting a whole new book to represent the new program. New tutorials, new effects and so on. I am sorry I bought the book, because now I have 2 of the same thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Already rusted, missing pieces","review":"We ordered this item, but it was delivered in a box that had obviously been opened before. A few parts were already a little rusted and pieces were missing. We were unable to put it together as instructed. BUT the company was more than willing to accept the item for return and processed our refund quickly. We are happy with the service we received, but the item just wasn't something we could use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a pillow pal","review":"This is just a run-of-the-mill stuffed toy...not really big enough to be a pillow pal. Too boring for DS to play with or smoosh into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opener","review":"I knew Mother Teresa had done wonderful things in our world, but I had no idea what this woman saw...and the problems she addressed. Holy be her name. If you want to see some of her work, buy this DVD. I do not regret it and will watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Mage companion","review":"Despite the complaints of some of the other reviewers, the Mage system is not complex - it is only slightly more difficult than anything else. However, as far as WoD: Sorcerer goes, not every spellcaster in the WOD can act as a Mage - that is, not everyone can bend reality at a whim. The Sorcerer book discusses the rigid paths of magic studied by mortals. While it does not take into account new canon (see Sorcerer:Revised), it's systems are more simplified than the new Sorcerer book, and in addition, lists a /great/ deal of Rituals. Anyone that wishes to run a game based around dark and gritty magic (something to the effect of Call of Cthulu magic), ought to pick up this book. /Don't/ buy this book just because \\"Mage hurt my wittle head\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"An insightful and useful addition to any White Wolf RPG.","review":"After becoming familiar with the Vampire: The Masquerade line by White Wolf, I wanted to delve into some of the other denizens of the World of Darkness. I enjoyed the concept of Mage: The Ascension, but found that the excessive amount of rules only complicated play, so I turned to Sorcerer: The Hedge Wizard's Handbook for an easier solution. Uncluttered by rules of paradox, quintessance, etc., it allows you to add another element of magic to any of the compatible White Wolf RPG's. Easy to read and quick to implement, I highly suggest this handbook to anyone who wants to add a \\"touch of magic\\" to their troupe's roleplaying experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shiney","review":"I'm happy to say that the book was still in very good condition when I ordered it; no writing in the margins, torn covers, or anything else. I'm perfectly happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barbie size hooks","review":"I got these for a dress up station I'm building for my daughter. I thought they were so pretty. I wanted to use them for her to hang dress up clothes and necklaces on. However, they are so small and could maybe fit in necklace per hook! They are still pretty but...not practical!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple but Good book","review":"We've had this book for 4 yrs and I decided to finally write a review. This is another good edition to the \\"On my Way\\" Series. It helps explain in very simple terms the stress associated with starting a new school. Would be great for children starting a new preschool or daycare (not really for older kids as the illustrations and text are too simple). My kids really enjoyed this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable - even for a non-teacher!","review":"Started reading this book simply because the insides of the book's format looked different. I'm not a teacher but I thoroughly enjoyed this book. If you're a teacher...especially an inner-city teacher, you will greatly appreciate this read.BG @ MacGregors Books"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY ALL TINE FAVORITE BOOK!!","review":"This book has been one of my favorites for many years now. I had to buy a second copy because I was reading it so often that my first copy had started falling apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read for all of Irish descent!","review":"This book was originally banned in Ireland by the English. They thought the main character, The Tailor, was \\"sex-obsessed\\" and his wife, Anastasia, or Ansty, a \\"moron\\".This is really funny to me because I caught no such traits whatsoever in these two characters! This book can easily be read in one sitting, it is so enjoyable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i am related to the tailor","review":"To me, the Tailor and his wife Ansty, this stereotypical Irish couple, ARE my grandparents. I loved reading this book. Cross has a real way with words. The book is incredible. And I'm the great great grandaugter (i'm not sure about how many greats there are) of the tailor. the tradition lives on in our family, the type of relationship that you can see between the tailor and ansty can still be seen in my grandparents. It's a great book for anyone intrigued by their Irish roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"being one's own grandpa","review":"Worth reading, if only for the explanation of how a person can be their own grandpa.

The heroine had me cringing with her idiotic rants and the hero pushes things because he just decides to. snap. he decided it, therefore it must be good.If you like the insta-marriage, waiting to get it on until married, and marriage before love... perhaps you'd like this book.For me? While Lucy Monroe has a way with words, I kept cringing and swearing at the idiotic antics of this couple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Come Up and See Me Sometime was not a good book. The story chugged along with a minimum of plot. The timetable of the story is very fast and the hero is not a modern one. His beliefs struck me as sexist and the heroine for all of her touted business success, was anything but. The premise was a good one, but not enough substance to make it a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Passable at best","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer. This book is not as good as the other reviewers will have you believe. The main characters were not an emotional attractive couple. I was more interested in the secondary characters of Marcus and the mysterious secretary. Luckily I rented this book from the library and did not have to waste my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the other reviews would have you believe","review":"I've previously enjoyed Lucy Monroe's writing, but I'd advise you to pass this one up. The heroine doesn't know her own mind and the hero is a bully. Also, some of the writing is over the top. I ended up skimming the last 1/3 because I just couldn't stand it anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy contemporary romance","review":"This is the first book I have read by Ms. Monroe and I thought it was very enjoyable. I was a bit surprised that others here rated it so low. I suppose I can see how some people might find Alex too overbearing, but I love a good alpha hero and he's the perfect example of one. And Isabel is a sweet heroine that the reader can identify with. If you are a fan of hot love scenes and attraction at first sight, then I would say this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please buy something else","review":"Prior to buying these CDs, my husband and I used the 2-CD set, \\"Speaking French with Michel Thomas.\\" We learned a lot quickly from those CDs, but wanted to learn more. So, we purchased the Instant Immersion French set. This has to be one of the worst purchases I have ever made! It is very difficult to determine what the people on the CD are saying, and the tasks are unclear. There is no guide book to help you along.I'm going to purchase the full Michel Thomas set now, and highly recommend his method of teaching over this set of CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Romance","review":"Marya Jaks is a danger to the Undead. And yet, Drago, the vampire enforcer, grants her life. Then someone, using his name, tries to reverse his order and Drago realizes that someone, besides Marya, wants him dead. He must find out who and why, and quickly, for both his and Marya's sakes.After Image is a fast paced, rather dark tale of intrigue and betrayal, with one surprise twist after another. Ms. Roycraft's vampires are a bit more human than the traditional stereotypes but no less dangerous. Drago is not your typical hero as he is brooding, powerful and totally ruthless. Definitely not the knight in shining armor type. I was immediately enamored with him. Marya is a smart, gutsy woman who has a lot to deal with. The very real threat to her life and her growing feelings towards a being she had been brought up to hate.I always enjoy a book I can get involved in. I was able to put this one down occasionnally, but just barely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS-130 Wireless Surround Sound Headphones","review":"This is my first time purchasing a remanufactured item, but I felt that Sennheiser makes high quality products so I figured I would give it a try. These sound is wonderful, and it is great not having any wires. I can walk around the house and into another room and still hear the TV or radio wonderfully. I would definitely recommend these to anyone that is having difficulty understanding what is being said on TV because of hearing loss, and/or for those that just love listening to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to tunes while surfing the web","review":"The Sennheiser headphones are terrific for what I use them for. I don't walk around the house with them or while I'm out gardening or anything that takes me beyond 25 feet of the transmitter. And for that reason they are great. I got an excellent deal because they were remanufactured and by openning an Amazon credit card account, I got a few more bucks shaved off. Before I purchased them, I read about some people having problems if they moved in a certain direction or if they were down the basement or some other silly thing but so far, so good. You may wonder why I use wireless headphones if I'm so close to my PC? Simple, I love the freedom of not being attached by a cord. This is a replacement for a wireless JVC set I had and got very comfortable using. If I do want complete independence I've got my MP3 player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser RS-130 Wireless Headphones","review":"The product arrived without a User Manual. I ended up going to the Manufacturer's website and downloading one in order to understand how to configure the headphones. Once I did this, they worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly DOA","review":"This product did not work. The audio only lasts 5-10 seconds. If I turn it off and then on or hit the resync button, I get 5-10 more seconds of audio. It doesn't matter how close I am to the base.

Admittedly, the book starts off slow, but I can see that was just too build his the zany charactors and wacky premise. Once those elements have been established the \\"fun\\" begins. And I do mean fun. Like bumper cars in an amusement park the action is non-stop and the suspense of \\"what's next\\" is building like a crescendo. Without giving too much of the story away, let me just say give this novel a chance. If your a first time reader to Ludlum as myself, you too will be pleasantly surprized with the investment you put into this one. Delicious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not exactly good","review":"Road to Omaha could have been a really funny and enjoyable book if the author had just gone a little softer with off the wall \\"coincidences\\" and having 98% of the conversations being disjointed screaming matches.

Ludlum should be embarrassed by his effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolute must","review":"Sam and Mac are introduced in Gandolfo. Sam is still the same inept character but incredible lawyer. Mac finally explodes larger than life in Omaha. I picture Mac the same as Col. Kilgore from Apocalypse Now with the smell of napalm in the morning speech.

This book is for those who love the crazy antics of a larger than life hero"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not the expected Ludlum","review":"I also could not finish this book, and I was captive on a coast to coast flight. The comedy in this book is strained and it is obvious that Ludlum was trying way too hard to be funny. I had to read and re-read passages just to make sense of what was written. The Road to Omaha is very bumpy indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great for Ludlum","review":"I'm sorry I bought it. Even though I read about it first, it was quite different from what I expected. In comparison to other Ludlum books,this one is just awful. Didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult To His Fans","review":"I've been a Ludlum fan for years. I have a full collection in hardcover. FINALLY I get the opportunity to let the world know my opinion of ROAD TO OMAHA! Ludlum and his publishers OWE \\"me\\", not only the price of the hardcover edition but for my time wasted wading thru the first 4 chapters. This book is a crass insult to Ludlum fans. ROAD TO GANDOLPHO was mildly humerous. Not even that can be said for ROAD TO OMAHA. It was a struggle every stroke of the keyboard and the struggle was obvious. Ludlum would do well to leave attempts at humor to other authors and stay with doing what he does best - writing good thrillers w/o the need to rely on sex to fill out the pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shocker","review":"I have never read such drivel.

It didn't seem to numb the areas I targeted for hair removal, but all of the delicate areas it dripped on were numb for almost 24 hours. AND the unappealing smell lingered long after I had showered.

I guess I particularly liked:\\"Almost\\"\\"Trucker Hat\\"\\"Ohio (Come Back to Texas)\\"\\"Ridiculous\\"\\"Last Call Casualty\\"\\"Smoothie King\\"Bowling For Soup's songs aren't going to be enjoyed by everyone.

Filled with songs about getting dumped and messing up relationships, I've seldom had this much fun hearing such sad luck stories. The lyrics, though, can be just plain hilarious at times.

Don't expect to be laughing throughout the whole thing as it is a very, very dark piece about a very, very dark period in Chilean history, however, after you have seen it, maybe not immediately, but later - after you've thoroughly absorbed what you have just been watching the jokes begin to sink in. When that happens, you can't help it. The reality that this is one of the funniest stories, though perhaps one of the sickest pieces, you have ever seen. When I think of it, I don't want to sit down and watch it again, just thinking about it gives me that inner, guilty chortle. You know, the stuff you laugh at that you feel you shouldn't because in the telling it's not the least bit funny, in fact it's a tad ludicrous, but then when you see the denouement and mull it over, it's justifiably, hysterically funny even though it does give you that warm and fuzzy feeling. There, I've just released all my guilt. I can be merry once more."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Eggs Sizzling in a Skillet\\"","review":"An extremely slow subtitled film, with time-consuming scenes of people staring, a man masturbating, neighbors crying, a man driving and eggs sizzling in a skillet. Minimal dialogue adds to the tediousness. The context of the traumatic Chilean political upheaval and counterrevolution of 1973 is pretty interesting, as are the scenes pertaining to the ethics of mortuary science in wartime. Unfortunately, these get limited play in the overall narrative scheme. Unless you are particularly interested in movies that are more \\"art\\" than \\"drama\\", you probably won't care for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third album, less mature","review":"This is actually Gym Class Heroes' THIRD album. \\"For the Kids\\" was the first, followed by \\"The Papercut Chronicles.\\"While the lyrics of many of the \\"As Cruel as School Children\\" songs are less mature and less complicated in comparison to \\"The Papercut Chronicles,\\" there are a few songs that are particularly moving, specifically \\"Shoot Down the Stars.\\"If you're looking for an uncomplicated, dancy indie hip-hop album, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ever","review":"From when I first heard New Friend Request, I knew this album was going to be amazing. The Papercut Chronicles were great but the production was very minmal and the CD got a little monotonous. As Cruel as School Children is anything but monotonous. The first thing I noticed was the effects on drums which make it sound more like a hip hop beat, than a live drummer, much more of a bump. they also used a lot of other insterments, which sounds great. THe over dubbing guitar allows to really fill out the sound. This Cd is great it retains all freshness of THe Papercut Chronicles without the monotony. Also Travis has really improved his flow, I'd consider probably one of the top 50% MC's in the US."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Band Kicking it Old School","review":"The Gym Class Heroes bring back old school style hip hop with a new school attitude. They mix live and real instruments with smooth, funny, and often relatable lyrics. Their first album had a bitter sweet message which all the bands true fans loved them for, but the new album blends fresh positive lyrics and beats with the same smooth rhyme spittin from Travis guaranteed to make all parties happy.

Luckily, I found the CD right away. Overall, I like it very much and the music reminds of Outcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"$13 not well spent","review":"this is my first Gym Class Heroes album and I'm dissapointed. I heard good things, but I was still wary for awhile until I finally convinced myself to give it a try. The album sounds very mainstream and should never ever be considered hip-hop. The music is good, if by itself. I'll admit, I was into the album for about a week, but then the songs just started to sound repetitive and boring. Travis has some good lyrics, but nothing that makes you think he's something special. If you're looking for hip-hop, run in the other direction. If you're into mainstream music, you may like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knowledge yourselves.","review":"It took one listen to make me realize GCH has lost their way. First off- this is their THIRD album, not their second (...For the Kids being their first). The promise they showed in that self-produced, self-released debut was astounding. I still regard it as one of my favorite hip hop albums. Papercut Chronicles was a strong sophomore album, As Cruel is just what it names itself to be. The influence of labelmates Fall Out Boy (and all of their clones) is obvious, as Gym Class Heroes aims their own influence towards 15 year olds. It's sad to see. Judging by their recent success and current ambitions, Travis and Co. will blow up along with their comrades, but will soon go down in the flames of a poppy trend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Alright, their first two full-lengths \\"For The Kids\\" and \\"The Papercut Chronicles\\" were amazingly original. The live instruments backing Travis' lyrics broke up the monotony of today's hip hop.Now with this latest release has kept me wishing they had never signed with Fall Out Boy's label.They have replaced the primarily instrument driven music with samples. Travis lyrics still are very good, but nothing special in the world of conscious hip hop.So, the more I listen to As Cruel As... the more upset I get that they threw away something incredibly special for a more mainstream-pop sound.Maybe they will pull it together for a follow-up.COME BACK OLD GYM CLASS HEROES."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD is ok, Amazon's track list is WRONG","review":"I haven't listened to the entire CD yet, but it's only OK from what I have heard.

While I do admit, I do listen to the radio and I am a sucker for pop music, Gwen and No Doubt have always captured my attention. Gwen's cd is excellent with it's dance beats and awesome lyrics... the two songs that really hit home is her take a risk song \\"What You Waiting For?\\" and her \\"Long Way to Go\\" which refers to interracial dating. I for one am in a interracial relationship with an asian but I love him to death and would do anything for him...

I agree with deeper 83's review. This was a huge disappointment. All those collaborations were horrible. Andre 3000, come on! Why did she use the rhythm to a Notorious BIG song for luxurious?

She tries to be poetic, and empathetic, but she is really a bad singer. She tries to be madonna in her 'like a virgin' days. I hate this so much.

I know this review is a bit more scathing than it should be, but I feel that the wool (LAMB, wool, get it) has been pulled over my ears.

PICTURES, not METHODS","review":"The reader of this book will learn at least one thing from it; the author is a very good carver! It's pages are full of fine (but black & white) pictures of various aspects and stages of carving a decorative decoy.Unfortunately that's basically it -- pictures. There is little commentary to go with them. A detailed, step-by-step explanation of how to achieve what one sees in the pictures would've made this book very valuable, but no such explanations are there.To sum it up, if you think you can figure out how to woodburn a carving by looking at pictures, this book may be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good referance photos","review":"This book is a good referance for the craftsman who already knows how to use a woodburner and is looking for photos of how the feather groups are burned.

This was, by far, my least favorite. It was a complete waste of time.The first half is all about how Emily can't believe Michael is an angel. We get it - you don't buy it - move on! The entire story is absurdly superficial; I can summarize the plot in 2 sentences. No real romance. And somehow, in the end, Emily ends up with a perfect life and no recollection of how she really got there. Too bad my memory can't be erased of this awful experience, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"Reading this book was a waste of time. If you like this type of book read A knight in Shining Armor, When Lightening Strikes or Remembrance. I thought the plot idea was okay but the writing was terrible. The story was presented in a silly way and if you get to page 100 like I did, all you had to do was read the epilogue to find out what happened.I picked this book up for 25 cents at a used book sale,but it still was not worth my time to read it. Many better books are out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's been happening with you Ms. Deveraux?","review":"I don't know what's going on here. Jude Deveraux wrote so many good books, but this one was disapointing. I didn't laugh or cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fairly-packaged load of nothingness","review":"I was very disappointed by this new book by Deveraux. Like most other reviewers, I have read most of her books. I used to look forward to the Montgomery or Taggert sagas she so eloquently portrayed. But THIS? The heroine is too simple, too flat. The hero, too cute, too perfect. It seems to me there lacks a sense of characterization in the novel. So the plot IS predictible. But with some real characters, that wouldn't have been so bad. The whole ensemble, though, was a snore.Besides, can anyone really feel sexual towards an angel, especially one that stresses so often his non-human qualities? Or is it just me???"},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I sign up to be her editor and stop this nonsense?","review":"This is the worst book Jude Deveraux has written. The humour was forced and overdone, the plot was predictable, there were inconsistencies, and the characters were not well developed. The book, which I only finished because I paid good money for it, was strange.If this was your first Deveraux book, please don't be discouraged... Try The Black Lyon and start yourself on a love affair with the Montgomerys!Let's hope her next book is more of the usual Jude Deveraux caliber we are used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"A disappointing silly plot, with characters of less interest than usual.

I read it hoping that the story would get better but it didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A winner","review":"Not since her books \\"A Knight In Shining Armor\\" and \\"Sweet Liar\\" has Jude Deveraux written characters so interesting and believable. I couldn't put this book down (even waiting for the bus in the rain). For those new to Deveraux's books, this is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"I have to ditto Coffeegurl. I couldn't believe this was a story written by Jude, Jude who has made me laugh and cry. This book made me want to scream: \\"Okay??? So???\\" I kept waiting for the story to open up. It's hard for me to believe this one made to the printing press. For now I'll just go back and reread Return to Summerhouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"YAWN!","review":"This was a huge disappointment from my favorite author. I have read all of Jude Deveraux's books and I can say that this one read like the Dick and Jane books we grew up with. The characters were uninspiring and the chemistry was nil between the two. The only reason I finished it was because I actually paid money for the book rather than waiting for it at the library. Jude, take your time with your next book. Give us another Knight or Duchess."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Angel for Emily is a HUGE disappointment.","review":"After reading some good reviews from readers here at Amazon.com, I bought this new release. I could not believe that this book made it to publication! Jude Deveraux is a good author who consistently creates believable and loveable characters. This book is not worthy of her name. If it was a first attempt by a new author, I would at least be able to forgive the author even if I still disliked the book. The characters are one-dimensional, plot development is halting at best, and there are gaping holes in the storyline (inconsistencies and unresolved issues). I would not recommend this book at all and I hope that Jude Deveraux recovers before her next book as I look forward to all of her releases and don't want to be disappointed again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 1 star","review":"Don't waste your time and money. The humor was not funny, the editing was poor, and the fantasy didn't work. I started skimming the book about halfway through and wanted to trash it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame, I love Deveraux!","review":"I began reading Romance in 1978 with Jennifer Blake. Jude Deveraux was the next writer I tried. I was hooked BECAUSE of these two Authors (plus Johanna Lindsey). For Twenty-Two and a Half years I have read EVERYTHING any of the three have written. Deveraux should never have McNaught- erized her writing. It was GREAT already. As soon as she changed her style, her books suffered. I never finished Emily's Angel. The story was good but it was the worst book I ever read! Well...NOT as BAD as Cassie Edwards! NOBODY is that BAD, \\"MY LOVE\\",. I would love to read a Deveraux book written like her early stuff. I think that she is THE best Author I ever Read (before she tried to change). McNaught,Coulter,Lindsey,Robards,Blake,Roberts, are some of my favorites. Ms. Deveraux, please, Take this as it's intended...go back to , so called \\"little girl sentences\\" , etc. I LOVE your writing and if I could would do it myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Jude!!","review":"I couldn't make it through the first 4 chapters and trust me I tried so hard. This is the only book from Jude Deveraux I had to put down and couldn't pick back up. Boring a real snoozing book. Jude I love you babe but can't help you on this book. All the others were wonderful. I started with the Velvet Series and just worked my way down the list the rest are a must read but skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Undeserving of 1 star!","review":"I don't even know why I am bothering to write a review about this pathetic attempt at a book, probably in order to warn those who have not read it to PLEASE not waste your time! This book sounds like it is written by someone in the sixth grade. I have read some books that have not been too exciting, but this one is the worst ever! I have however read some of the other reviews about Devereaux's books, and MIGHT give the books on the Montgomerys a try. There seems to be a concensus that those are good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually deserves zero stars","review":"This makes the second and the last book I've brought by Jude Deveraux. My main regret is that I purchased this piece of garbage for $7.00 from a store. I definitely will not be risking my money on any of her other novels. I could not believe that Michael could possibly love this shrew of a woman. She didn't seem to have one redeeming characteristic. Not only was she a witch, she was also a gullible fool. I would warn other readers to stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your Classic Jude Book","review":"\\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" was a masterpiece; \\"Wishes\\" was a riot. This is so disappointing; even the title is trite. It was surprising that this new book was on the shelf at the library, usually Jude's books have waiting lists. But after reading it, I understand why. It has no pizazz at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to my favorite author????","review":"I hate to admit it, but I have to say I was very disappointed with this one. Usually, when I see a new one from Ms. Deveraux, I don't even read the synopsis, I just purchase it right then and there. Lately her novels have been very tired. The characters lack depth and personality. Her sharp wit and sense of humor are gone. I long for her books like the Montgomery annals. Those were great reading. What happened? It seems that she's lost the interest in writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT STORYLINE, BRINGS OUT THE ROMANTIC IN EVERYONE.","review":"THIS WAS THE SECOND BOOK THAT I READ BY JUDE.

Too sugary. All cotton candy fluff and no substance. I will still be looking forward to the new Jude Deveraux book when it comes out but I'm hoping it is more in line with the quality, suspence, feeling, etc. that I expect from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"The gong show goes angelic","review":"This was the first book that I have read by Jude Deveraux. I thought by the jacket it would be a cute, funny book. Well it tries to be funny and really doesn't make it. It tries to be romantic, but unless one has never heard of or doesn't believe in God, it doesn't stand as plausable. It tries to be a drama and comes up weak. Emily is a grown woman who has no idea what she wants or can get out of life. What seemed like a nice book in the beginning,finished with me still wanting to find some thread to believe in. I'm sure with all the books that Deveraux has written this must have been a \\"bad page day\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Fantasy","review":"This is a pretty good original fantasy filled with humor and unlikely situations. I enjoyed the premise and laughed at some of Michael the angels failings. The only thing i didn't like about this book was the hurried up ending. The book moves along enjoyably with nice banter between the characters and some humor but then it was almost as if the author decided it was time to end it so she quickly wraps it up and ends the story with two chapters of epilogues. Despite this weird ending I enjoyed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the best, but it's still good...","review":"I really do love Deveraux's work, like \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\", and I do agree that this isn't one of her best works, but I really enjoyed reading it, I think that she should get credit for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not finish this book it was so bad","review":"I really loved a \\"Knight in Shining Armor\\" and then went on to read as many Montgomery/Taggert books as I could find. I cannot believe that Ms. Deveraux actually wrote this book...it was so bad. The characters were unsympathetic. There was a distinct lack of wit and humor. I could not finish it although I really tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is garbage!","review":"i couldn't wait to read this book and when i finally did i was disappointed beyond belief! first of all, can anyone say \\"A Knight in Shining Armor?\\" actually, it's insulting to that wonderful story b/c \\"angel\\" is so horrible. what happened to originality and creativity, jude? this book fit every stereotype that people tack onto romance novels. the hero was annoying and so was the heroine. i can't even remember their names.oh yeah, can anyone say, \\"City of Angels,\\" hmmmmmm?"},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Com Enemy Unkown Remake","review":"I've been playing X-Com Enemy Unknown (UFO Defense) since I was 12 years old. UFO: Extraterrestrials is absolutely, 100%, without a doubt in my mind, the remake we have all been waiting for. There are very few bugs, it was professional developed and deserves the \\"funds\\" of every true X-Com fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"As a x-com series fan I was disappointed at this release. Yes the graphics are better BUT a lot of the x-com physics are missing. For example throwing grenades now is hit and miss whereas with the original you could hit walls and have the grenade bounce back. Also missing are a good variety of aliens, UFOs and a poor variety of maps which seem lifeless anyway. You'll find yourself doing missions which look almost exactly the same each time and you'll get bored of it very easily. Another thing is you only really have one operation base the rest can only be used for interceptors and the whole base management thing is a dumbed down version of the original.There are user mods around which make it a lot better but still it's a mediocre game. I wouldn't play it without the mods! Quite frankly you're better off with UFO: Alien Invasion which is still under development but is free and more true to the original (and fun as well)."},{"rating":"1","title":"to many annoyances to make it playable","review":"The biggest turn-off of this game is not being able to recruit new units. If you only get 1-2 units injured per mission you will soon have no one left to do anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been free!!","review":"This appears to be the classic case of grand ambition turned utter boredom. It is a clone of the original X-Com only so much less. Game play has actually been dumb'd down since the original. Graphics are poor. I cant figure out, 15 years later from original release, why there is no attempt at added features.This game is a poor excuse and the release of it should have been canceled. Later then release it as a \\"poor\\" mod like X-com. Referring to it as a mod is an insult to the folks that make them.This is a NO BUY. no matter the cost. I dropped $30 on it only to play it and start longing for the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I pre-ordered this game and when I finally recieved it I was not disappointed! This game is basicly X-com with up to date graphics. Excellent game play and very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original X-com Fan","review":"After reading reviews on the game from various forums I decided to give the game a try. I never played this game in it's original content but rather installed mods immediately. I found the game extremely similar to the old X-com (only with improved graphics and more technology options). I have over 40 hours invested in the game and have found it very enjoyable. I would definately buy the game again if I had to do it over."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a fan!","review":"This mix is much more representative of his live sets than some of his studio mixes. What separates DJ Dan from the other house DJ's is that he doesn't play the obvious house tracks/labels that circulate the house charts. Instead, DJ Dan distinguishes his sound by throwing down high powered tracks with catchy hooks which are often produced by the lesser-knowns. Furthermore, he's got a great feel for keeping the energy level up without going over the deep end.I was at Ruby Skye when he recorded the session. The DVD's features, which include live footage and a slide show of photos taken from the event, captured the atmosphere of the event and brought back a lot of great memories for me. This is probably the best DJ Dan cd out there. Of course, no cd will ever match the excitement of his live shows. Nonetheless, if you've got a good soundsystem and home entertainment center, this CD/DVD package aint' bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is House Music","review":"I have to agree with the reviewer here who says many of Dan's mixes seem to come in a few measures later than one would expect . Perhaps Dan is just going against the grain by not seamlessly mixing these tracks. Maybe he knows some people would take certain songs and burn them onto compilations and would like a song to have a full stop at the end. Who knows. It is only slightly jarring, after all, and doesn't necessarily ruin this mix. I'm crazy about this cd. It is full on hard house. Great four-on-the-floor beats, simple vocal lines and effects spinkled throughout. What I like best is that there are no pop singles remixed with a club beat, as so many other mix cd's seem to have these days. It is pure, unadulterated, underground house music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review the seller","review":"Can I review the seller? Because I never got it or the refund. Not a very honest sell.

I was envious of his deep, rich baritone vocals. I was moved at his ability to write songs that were so easy for me to relate to. I plunked down the money for this album. By the time I drove home, I was singing along to \\"Dogs & Thunder\\" and \\"Always\\". It's true that there's not much different here. There is a bit more of a pop sheen to most of the songs. Kind of a melancholy James Taylor vibe going on. I would submit to you that it's okay that John is John and we need to know he's there from time to time.

On the metal building the tool was good for the small screws and up to 1/2\\" bolts but that's it. It was useless for anything larger.

My problem with this DVD collection is they took out the narration. This may not seem like a big deal but the narration is a huge part of the show. It sets up everything and watching the show without the narration takes something away. Unfortunately this wasn't released directly by The Discovery Channel.

She told me that Amazon is still selling the unnarrarated version of the DVDs, which is why they are cheaper. Amazon does NOT have the corrected version of the DVDs yet. So if you're looking to buy this product, you're better off spending the extra money and buying it from Timeless Media Group. Their customer service was top notch, they were super friendly.

There are no cheesy re-enactments that a lot of other shows have. This show dramatizes the events very well. It is well-acted an well-edited. I have even added the show to my VCR for recording everyday.The one unusual question I have is this: Why does Discovery Channel air this show at 2 in the afternoon (I'm in California) instead of the evening when the show's creepy nature is most effective?Everytime I watch the show, I literally get goose bumps!

The effects are sufficiently spooky too. My only problem - do the hauntings all have to be evil and demonic? And they all start out the same - oblivious families moving into abandoned homes and finding out that they are haunted. Even though they are terrified out of their minds, they insist on staying in these demon-infested dwellings. I love a good ghost story as much as most do, but it's like they purposely showcased homes that have evil and demonic entities. If I had known that, I would not have bought these DVD's. So maybe my purpose here is just to warn some that if you would rather avoid viewing strictly demonic and evil spirited hauntings, don't buy this. Stick with Ghost Hunters. For those of you who get their thrill from watching exorcisms and people being terrified out of their minds, buy this and have a party.Oh, by the way, mine had narration. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"they are lucky to even get 1 star","review":"A haunting, my favorite show.

However, despite the I-just-escaped-from-a-Mary-Kay-convention look of the cover, Macmaster is amazing. The tone is sweet and the speed is amazing. As a side note, Victor Wooten steals the show, he emulates a bhouran (Irish Frame Drum) and also plays a duet with Natalie. Amazing. I would have to agree that the \\"master's hand\\" is at best dopey, and after wading through the grating lyrics I was disappointed not to hear some kind of killer violin solo.

I've tried using them in a camera and a mouse, but they either didn't work at all (camera), or just lasted for a few days (mouse). As a last resort I tried using them for backup memory in a land line phone. This is a very benign application with a very low current requirement, and yet the batteries would only last a week before completely discharging.

I then tried Sanyo eneloop batteries that are rated at 2000 mAh and they lasted 4 1/2 hours. If these actually provide 2700 mAh, then they do so while dropping in voltage to a point that equipment that requires the batteries to be near full voltage won't work for very long.Since rechargeables are supposed to remain at near their rated voltage for most of a charge (in this case 2700 mAh), I think these batteries are low quality.

Archaeopteryx lithographica is taken as a guide for a survey of current (well, 1998) thought about the origin of birds and the origin of bird flight. The fact that she doesn't really choose sides does not hinder her to conclude that those in favour of the 'ground-up' and dinosaurian origin of birds now have the upper hand - but then, any other conclusion would have been a distortion of fact. However, the arguments of the 'other side' are also presented, leaving the conclusion to the reader.

It also works well with Daikon, cabbages, turnips, pickles, etc.The design is sleek and I can wash it in the dishwasher.

Reasonable price!!","review":"I have bought this product several times now. It's a great healthy snack for my kids, one of whom does not tolerate gluten. I could not find a single super-market brand that was free of both gluten and MSG. These bags are 3oz and most of the \\"regular\\" jerkey bags in the stores are around 3.75 oz. In my stores, the bags are usually around $5, maybe $4 if you're lucky, and with Amazon's average pricing on this it comes out to be about $5.50 a bag. So a little bit smaller and a little bit more pricey but I think it's WELL worth it for organic beef with no MSG, not to mention the perk of no gluten that is necesary for so many these days.

I want to taste the meat, not the evaporated cane juice. I hate to give this product a bad review as it's just my personal taste. It's not a bad product--it's completely organic with no nitrites.

It was hard plastic and had a small scraping head, less than half an inch wide. It worked great. Recently, though, the handle broke so I needed a replacement. Thinking that any old scraper would do, I ordered this DenTek tongue cleaner because it was cheap. That was a mistake. The handle of the DenTek tongue cleaner is flexible as it nears the scraping head. So when I try to push down, the handle bends and I can't put any pressure on my tongue. Worse, the scraping head is too wide (almost an inch across). Thus, it doesn't even make contact with the middle part of my tongue. Finally, the scraping head itself is way too bulky. If I were to continue using it, which I'm not, the scraper would be more apt to cause a gagging reflex. Bottom line, if you're looking for a tongue scraper that actually works, don't get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too easily destroyable","review":"I gave this to my lab, turned my back and walked across the yard . . . and by the time I got back she had torn a hole in the canvas and was unraveling the woven rope!

(She's had the Ruff Wear one for almost two years and it's just fine.)I gave the disc 2 stars because she did like the squeaker inside it (although that probably hastened its destruction); plus, not all dogs are as destructive as mine, so this would probably be okay for a mellow dog.

It helped me explain to my husband how a Doula could benefit him as well as me during labor, for which he was relieved and grateful!

Great for the kids to bounce around on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, bit of a challenge to assemble","review":"If you want a mini-trampoline, I can recommend this one. It is built like a battleship, but assembly is non-trivial -- you need at least two adults (the instructions recommend three) to fight against the tension to pop everything in place. No big deal, but you are not going to put this together by yourself -- you can hurt yourself if something pops back due to the high tensions involved. The instruction book could use larger and clearer pictures. The legs screw on, and one of the legs in mine was slightly out-of-round, making for some stiff turning, but I got it on. There is an 800 number to call the manufacturer for any problems. I didn't need to call. We like this mini-trampoline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to expensive treadmill","review":"My 12 year old daughter and I put together the trampoline in a few minutes.

I decided to get this one because it's a few inches larger than the Galt one although it doesn't have the handle bar which would have been ideal for my 2.5 year old.Pros: Both boys love it. The 4.5 yr old is getting his much needed sensory fix. The 2.5 yr old loves to get on it but because he doesn't know how to jump with both feet off the ground, he just plays or hangs out on it for now.Cons: My husband and I put this together in roughly 20 minutes (it probably would have taken less time but my engineering husband was trying to figure out why the holes to bolt together the trampoline weren't aligned perfectly on one side).

If you want to know about long term durability our is still operable. We got this for rainy days when our kids needed to expend some pent up energy. They did tear the blue cover early on. But it didn't really affect the use of the trampoline. In the past year my children have figured out how to unscrew the legs. So if you have bright AND bored children, just be aware. My children have also used the trampoline as a slide by setting it on an angle, which has slightly bent the frame. So eighty pounds (2 small children) at an angle bent the frame slightly.

My guess is the manufacturer made some changes, because I assembled it all by myself without ANY difficulty. It required no strength.THE BAD: It's not a real trampoline. The first thing my 6 year old son said after trying it was \\"how come it's not bouncy?\\". He wasn't kidding. When you jump on it, it gives a little bit, then you hit the bottom VERY noticeably (the bounce stops and it feels like you're hitting the floor), which after about 20 jumps gave me a headache. It lacks that fun, bouncy, weightless feeling every true trampoline has. I suppose I should have known better, seeing that this trampoline does not have springs.

This was bought for and used by a 2 year old so we're not talking about a lot of weight. First, the circular frame is actually two half circles that are bolted together.

It a lot harder to bounce on then my last one which at first I thought well I'll get a better workout & burn more calories. But Ow! my feet don't seem to bounce flat thus making my ankles feet & knees hurt. So It is weird like you are bouncing on an angle almost like my feet sink in & turn my ankles in like it's not sturdy enough or not supportive enough & I'm only 130 pounds.

I immediately boxed it back up and returned the item.

Good: has 5 legs, elastic bands instead of metal springs, quiet bouncing, affordable, the size is suitable for kids, and indoor use.

The legs have some risk of caving in, hence my recommendation is for kids only. A single person can assemble the trampoline, but once going past 120 degre angle towards 180 degree, there is no turning back, you have to finish the job in one sitting, or the rim will forcefully whack you in the face if you try to bail out.

I was home alone. I read somewhere on web someone drove on one side with their car, another used couch (not this trampoline, but same difference). Car too dangerous, couch too light, however, I have a decently heavy Hope Chest... I used that as my \\"2 people holding it down\\" while I pushed down to snap the circle together. TA-DAH!

Needless to say I won't be dealing with Kryptonite again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely loved it","review":"I came across Tithe in the local library, the book stuffed behind three other books on one of the highest shelves. The summary had been scratched off, so I read the first page. I was not immediately hooked, but that was soon to change. I began reading the book on the way home and as soon as I met the daring Roiben, I was hooked.Holly Black is not afraid to write out scenes that would actually take place with teens, unlike some other authors. She knows how Kaye would react to a drunken mother and over-protective grand mother.I just finished the book and I have added it to my Christmas Wish-List. I love the book. It's as simple as that. I wouldn't change a thing about it. Well .. I'd change one thing. More Roiben. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Review for Tithe","review":"The book Tithe is a great but also complex book. It can be quite hard to understand at times but in the end you can pretty much piece it together. It is a story that makes you wonder, \\"What's going to happen next?\\" This fantasy story also has some romance and action. It's two main character's names are \\"Kaye\\" and \\"Roiben\\" and together they go through great adventure and threat.The description in this book makes you feel as though you are actually in the book, looking at the characters and the environment. It is about two courts of fantasy creatures (the Seelie and the Unseelie courts). The Unseelie court is the controlling court, and to remain in control they have to \\"tithe,\\" or sacrifice, a willing mortal. It is interesting how the author came up with this idea for the book. Once I picked up this book, I could barely put it down. This is a great book if you enjoy a great quantity of fantasy and fiction creatures and places."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty bad....","review":"This book was less than impressive. The writing style was juvenile, and the story was so choppy.There was excessive swearing, which added little to the story. The violence as described was also unnecessary.Even by the end of the book, you really don't have any reason to like the \\"heroine\\" of the story, Kaye. You don't like any of her \\"friends\\" either.The \\"hero\\" Roiben, although you like him a little better, sounds like a bad actor at a Renn Faire.Maybe it was because I had just finished reading a few books by Charles de Lint. Maybe it was because the book was just bad.If you are looking for urban fairy tales, try de Lint. Don't waste your time or money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and occasionally incoherent","review":"The book has no spark of life, and limited originality. Characters act without reason - stumbling from one mess to the next, creating little blobs of action rather than a narrative arc that spans the whole book.A lot of the reviews say this book is very \\"dark\\" and the world of the fey is terrifying as well as beautiful. I was disappointed to find that while there is a fair amount of vividly dark description, Holly's fairies essentially think and act like humans. They aren't convincingly different or other. This pretty much negated any impact that all of the dark and dangerous trappings might have had.The character of Roiben disappointed me as well. He's a lynchpin of the book - it's his sexual energy that is meant to charge the book, and he is also Kaye's primary liaison with the world of faerie. He's a make-or-break character, so when he became just as dull and human as the other fey in the book, I really lost interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough Characters","review":"Tough main character.Tough fairies.Tough friends.There is a lot of toughness in this book. For the main character Kaye, life has not been easy. Following her mother around as she sings with one rock band after another, mothering her mother so they can survive, and coming up with her own rules of shoplifting (with moral values of their own) so that she can live with herself as she gets through her nomadic life are all ways Kay has learned to cope. Finding out she's really a changling, a green pixie at that, didn't seem such a stretch.The fairies of this book aren't cute little Disney creations. They are ruthless and violent, but they are not unfeeling. She discovers this through her old childhood fairy friends, who nobody believes are real. She also discovers another fairy, one who seems to reciprocate her feelings for him.I listened to this book on CD and felt that Kate Rudd supplied the perfect teen voice to share Holly Black's book. Looking forward to reading/listening to more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it!","review":"I read this book when I was 16 and am now re-reading it... but I think it's a really good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I found this book total and complete fluff. While it is readable, and fairly easy to get through, the plot, characters and themes irritated me. The characters were either unbelievably angsty or unbelievably dumb, the main character holding both these qualities in great abundance. The writing itself was poor at best and most of the plot was taken from other stories and/or predictable. Those people who don't mind large amounts of angst or \\"why is she being so stupid?\\" moments won't mind this book, but if you are looking for a quality book, this isn't it.I give it two stars because it is readable (I was able to finish it easily), but there is not much else positive about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I read this book in one afternoon. Doing research into the UnSeelie Court I thought it'd be interesting to see how they fare in the modern world. I was disappointed because there still is that lack of \\"faerie evolution\\" that results in the fey NOT being bothered by iron, church bells, etc.As to the story itself - interesting but not unforgettable. Would like to have seen a little more development between Corny and the UnSeelie Prince other than a seeming reference to sado-masochism. Oh well . . .that's life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Part of it was good......I guess","review":"I was pretty excited for ths book after reading the reviews, it was presented as a gritty somewhat reaslistic portrail of a teenagers life with dark fantasy added in. A very cool concept that was just poorly executed. The story was interesting for sure, but it took almost the entire book to get it going, and then you just dont care anymore. It sets up the 2nd book to be the actual starting point while pretty much just wasting this book as filler. I would ignore this one, but thats just me. I finished it simply because I paid for it not because I enjoyed it. I did like all the people in the book though. They were well defined and very fleshed out. One of there strongpoints"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks","review":"Anyone looking to read this book should reconsider. It's a dry, overly detailed piece of fiction that sounds like almost any other work of faerie fiction--and when you take that into consideration, the others are MUCH more worth your time. Simply, this novel is trash about a stupid girl who gets tricked into helping the wrong people, abuses drugs and alcohol, and wants to sleep with a \\"knight\\"-type faerie.Other, more interesting books to try are: The Moorchild, The Forgotten Beasts of Eld, Artemis Fowl, and/or The Blue Girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!!","review":"I bought this book and the two others in the series because it was in the Young Adult section and usually that means that the books are good and mostly clean (no overt sex or foul language).

This is one of the books that I will never finish reading.The main character is like some dumb smoker dirty girl. And then she's going to somehow save us all from a dark faerie. Excuse me, but I'd rather be saved by Michael Jackson.Okay. And it must take SOMETHING for an editorial review to mark it's faults. Out of all the books I've seen, I've only seen maybe two that had the editorial review straightforwardly tell the faults of a book, even when it was a book that didn't get many good reviews from other people.OBVIOUSLY that must count for something.And oops.

There was only a little more than a slice of red where the sea met the sky. \\"No, what?\\" Janet said, holding the lipgloss out to Kaye. \\"Like he slit his wrists in a bathtub and the blood is all over the water.\\" My 13 year stopped reading this trash at this point and apologized for having wasted my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this young adult?","review":"Page 9...5 lines down: \\"...and your hair is F***ed up.\\"Amazon listed this book as being ages 13 and up.

I guess, if I had to put a word on it, I'd say that her writing style is very \\"cold\\" as is this alternative version of reality/the world of the fae, that she has created. While I have read multiple books by Ms. Black and enjoyed them, looking back, they just are \\"okay\\". I appreciate that the faery world can be a cold and dangerous place, but I like my main characters to have a little more warmth than Ms. Black's characters provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little RACY for our teenager!

Holly Black is a genious. While I was reading I felt like I was there, like I was the main character. If you like romance-fantasy or vise versa I highly sugest this book. It's full of imagination and creativity beyond belief. It will keep you on the edge of your seat. You can read it in one sitting, you wont be able to put it down even if you try. When I read it my eyes were glued to each page."},{"rating":"2","title":"Further Tales","review":"It is important to note that this book is not a continuation of the previous story.

I am perfectly enamored by it . . . such a beautifully written, wonderful novel. As another reviewer stated, it would have been nice to get to know some of the characters better, but I think Roiben was portrayed perfectly ~ although I was left quite entrigued by him, that was the right way to leave him. I don't know if this had been considered already, but Tithe would make an AMAZING movie, if done by the right people. To see Roiben, Kaye, all the faeries and Queens, other than trapped in my imagination as I read, would be a dream come true (sounds \\"corny\\" I know lol). Bottom line is, Holly Black is a fantastic novelist, and she knows exactly how to let you \\"feel\\" the story and characters.Can't wait to read Valiant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book price is a rip off","review":"Not sure why this book is being sold for $70 and more on this site, when it is still readily available at any book store. Don't get me wrong, it's a wonderful book, and worth it, but this seems a little dishonest to customers. The book can be bought for less than $10 pretty much anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling Story, Poorly Written","review":"I found the story itself to be fascinating. I actually wanted to see where it was going. However, the writing was not particularly good. In fact, there are many gaps where you have to just piece the story together. (And not in the clever way- it just felt disjointed and thoughtless.) There was nothing special in the way it was written- in fact, I happened to like the story despite the way it was written. However, I won't be reading more by this author.I was also disappointed with the foul language. If you are a parent, know this book contains underage drinking & smoking. It also deals with homosexuality and teen sexuality (in a very, very small capacity). The main character is also a high school drop out, though that seems neither condemned nor condoned in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"so not what i was expecting","review":"After reading Valiant by Black, i was really excited to read this. I was highly disappointed. Writing is bad, characters are not believable or well formed, storyline is not engaging or believable i know its fantasy, but the way the story plays out is just not very believable. She could not suspend my disbelief and draw me into this world). The whole time i was wondering how she could write such drivel after a stunner like valiant.

I didn't even bother reading the rest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely got through it","review":"I struggled to get through this book, it was my least favorite faerie/fantasy book I have read so far. It was my first Holly Black book and I don't think I'll be trying any more. The plot is weak, and the romance is actually a little creepy. Isn't he much older than Kay? That was a little weird. I just don't feel like Kay was a character with much depth, and the faerie world is just two dimensional. The writing is elementary - I know this is for young adults but give them a little credit. So many adults are reading YA since the Twilight series - well, this is one you can pass up. Trust me, you're not missing anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new twist in the world of Faerie","review":"Though this book is for young adults, it's sense of dark irony is purely adult.

My biggest problem with this book is that it is a young adult book. While I am not naive enough to believe that teens are exposed to this content in their everyday lives, this book just seemed to go a little far. I can see how the base story was good but I did not enjoy the writing. I am an avid reader and do not like skimming books or not finishing them. Some of my favorite books started with me hating them, but this book never did that for me and by the end I was skimming it. Which is the worst recommendation I can give. This book just left me feeling confused as to why it was recommended in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing and too many loose ends","review":"The story started off well, and I enjoyed some of the imagry descriptions Black used to describe the heroine's world. But then it just got too confusing.

So Roiben became the King of the Unseele, so what? Janet dies for seemingly no reason other than to get a funeral at the end. Is Kaye going into the faerie world or stay with her mom? What happened to her mom?! Who killed the Unseelie Queen?**spoiler over**Overall, I was really disappointed with this story b/c I feel Black seems to be trying too hard to make this story an anti-faerie tale that the story was in shatters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time...the book is as foul as the language in it !","review":"Foul language, sexual content, drugs, drinking....this is an adult book written about a teenager, not a YA book. It should'nt be in the YA section at all. There is hardly a paragraph without the 'F' word in it. The author seems to be completely going for shock value, rather than real dialogue. The characters seem to have no redeeming qualities to make me like them whatsoever. Don't waste your time....trash"},{"rating":"2","title":"tithe","review":"I thought that the book was good cause I like the fantasy books but I like the real life ones better. Kaye finds out things that are life changing some is good and some are bad. One of the main problems is that Kaye is a chain smoker.One of the things I did not like about it was it had a lot of swearing and sex and violence in it. The whole point of the story was to live life to the fullest and don't give up cause if you do bad things could happen to you. You never know until someone points it out then you will know.So I would recommend this book to other kids our age because I know that usually we like fantasy books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holly really knows her stuff!","review":"This was a REALLY good book. Holly Black, the author really knows her fairie folklore. The story line was really good, and it's dark, not all sickening sweet. The characters aren't cheerful happy, and it's not your typical Young-Adult book.I read it OVER and OVER and I couldn't put it down, and I recommend it to anyone, because it's really a wonderful book.

Let's hope it'll be as good as this. :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book!!! ;)","review":"What an excellent book! I've read it twice now... :)The story is rich and full of imagery. The romantic side slammed to the dark side of the fae is what keeps you hooked. It makes you want to go out by a hill and search for faerie lights.Holly Black's books are enchanting! I wrote to her and she wrote back writing such a sweet reply. She took her time to listen! In a few years I expect a sequel to this fascinating book. Pick it up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT What I excpected","review":"I chose this book looking for somthing similar to Libba Bray's A Great and Terrible Beauty, and discovered this book. It was not what I was expecting. It was a little to graphic, too many swear words, and all together an embarrasment to be reading.

Yes, it had its moments, but the shallow characterization and objectionable elements overwhelmed them for me. I won't get into the storyline, so as not to spoil it, but any book that has strong hints of sadomasochism doesn't belong under teen fiction, in my opinion. If you want to read a great novel that comes under the heading modern fantasy then pick up Emma Bull's War for the Oaks, a much superior example."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Dissapointment","review":"This book was a horrible dissapointment. It began with an interesting beginning that just turned into complete ... well, crap.

Right along the lines of Melissa Marr books. It does had a bit of inappropriate items for very young readers but for actual \\"Young Adults\\" it is just fine. Highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but unsatisfying.","review":"While I did indeed enjoy Holly Black's Tithe, it was as a brainless read. I found her inconsistent and choppy style of writing very unsatisfying. Things in her novel happen without reason and are entirely irrelevant to the plot, the main character seems distant and rather dumb in that the reader never gets to truly understand her thinking, her reasoning, her actions, anything, and everytime something happens, Black describes the event quickly and we never really learn the aftermath of the event. The book skips from scene to scene without explanation. I wish Black could elaborate more. Characters are killed off randomly for no reason, and the ones that weren't killed off, I couldn't connect or empathize with. Overall, a good read, but not one that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"struggling to get through this one","review":"I hate when you pick up a new book and within a few pages you realize it is becoming a chore to get through each paragraph- I am trying to get through to where the fairies become more prevalent, but it is slow going. I guess for a young teen this might be an 'amazing' book, perhaps I am just old- but being that I have been immersed in some great vamp novels recently, I thought a foray into the fairy world might be good- so far, not so good. Many of the passages so far are trite and not intriguing at all- I care not a scrap for the main character or anyone in her world... I will press on through at least another few chapters, but it won't be easy. (I have to comment on another reviewer's crack at Disney- those saccharin sweet fairies, like Tinkerbell, were created for the enjoyment of 5 year olds- try to keep it in perspective. Remember- these are fantasy characters, so if some prefer them blonde & cute with a touch of sparkly lime satin- to each his own!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent.","review":"I was looking through a small Waldenbooks to find a random book. I looked in the Young Adult section and saw a beautiful, brown-black paper-back book with two green wings on the cover, bearing the words \\"TITHE: A MODERN FAERIE TALE\\".As a little girl, I loved fairy tales. I knew I had to have this book. I bought it, went home, and read it.I was captivated. I couldn't put it down. It was everything a teenager would ever read in a fairy tale nowadays.This is one of the best books I have ever read. It contains sacrifice, love, and having the courage to do what you know is right.Roiben is hot =D"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tale of faeries.","review":"Kaye, a modern girl whose life is not even close to perfect, moves back to her grandma's house in New Jersey and re-encounters her \\"imaginary\\" friends of her childhood. Except they aren't imaginary, and her whole life gets turned upside down when she meets Roiben, an Seelie knight in the Unseelie court. After that, many strange happens and she finds out something about herself that she wouldn't have believed.Combine all of this with a kidnapping and you've got a great novel, full of everything great novels depend on. I was intrigued by this story and read all of it in one day. I couldn't put it down. I just hope that Holly Black writes a sequel or follow up to this story, because the ending ended but there was still so much more that could happen.Fantastic read. I would recommend this to anyone interested in fantasy and who likes many twists and turns during their story. Wonderful.Okie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gritty and real","review":"I love urban fantasy and this is it. The characters are real and the style of writing flows like water.

An amazing book series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WhatMissKelleyIsReading: bookitty.typepad.com","review":"Kaye has always been able to see faeries, and when she and her mother move back to her childhood home with Kaye's grandmother after years in the city, she sees them again. Only instead of the playful friends of her childhood, these faeries bring violence and even death.Tithe is subtitled \\"a modern faerie tale\\" and the back cover info invites readers to learn more about \\"dark faeries\\". This book is very much modern and dark; Kaye drinks, smokes, and swears, and there are real consequences for the actions that characters take in this book. Sexual violence and desire are also part of the story. Yet none of these choices are gratuitous, and they are absolutely fitting with the setting and time period of the story. I won't put this book out for my seventh graders, but I would absolutely recommend it to any high schoolers that I know. I can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept....poor execution","review":"I really wanted to like this book.

My daughter is 11 and is a very advanced reader, and she asked to read this book.I don't think this book is appropriate for someone her age. I would say it is appropriate for age 16 or older.

As I started reading Tithe I had to do a double take. Was this really a book for young adults? The language, the content and lack of imagination worthless. It was shocking to me that it received a YALSA best book for young adults. Shame on the Young Adult Library Services Association. This is just trash.I am an adult and read youth and young adult fantasy/scifi because I don't have to worry about the content being offensive.

I enjoyed the novel, as I have enjoyed all of Hamilton's Alex McKnight novels, not only because of the setting, but also because Hamilton is a darn good writer! You don't have to be from Nowhere to understand the need to isolate yourself in the beauty of Northern Michigan, and to fear and resent the greed which drives men to murder each other and despoil the environment. These are the themes of Steve Hamilton's books: weave them through an engrossing plot line filled with action and intelligence and you have this latest in the Alex McKnight series--and perhaps the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presentation, not content problems","review":"This is not a review of the content or the plot of this novel.

There is a great deal of difference between skillfully crafted noir-ish pain and sheer wallowing self pity which some seem to think means \\"They are senstive\\".Same complaints.

Undercooked."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dumb stay dumb!","review":"Alex McKnight spends half of this book telling us what a stupid and meaningless failure he is, and the other half proving it. Chief Roy Maven is still dumb as a post and twice as stupid (to make McKnight look good in comparison?). Leon Prudell quits the P.I. biz.I keep wishing that someone in this series would develop some brains, but no one ever does. Maven remains so incompetent, he couldn't solve a crime even if he saw it happen right in front of him. McKnight is still a brainless clod, and his friends pat him on the back only to find a nice soft spot to sink a knife into.I picked up two of Hamilton's Alex McKnight books from the 20 cent rack and feel like I didn't get my money's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book you could not put down.

I simply love it; however, the rest of the songs on Marvin's CD are sort of \\"off.\\" I can't quite explain it, but I can say that there is absolutely no way I would have purchased this CD had, \\"Never Would Have Made It\\" been on there. The other songs on the CD were not musically interesting. It's really bothersome when you purchase a CD and find only a couple of songs out of 10-12 worth really listening too. It appears to me as if Marvin needs someone else to write his songs. He has a beautiful voice and I expected so much more from him than what was delivered via this CD. Maybe it's just me, but I only enjoy listening to the one major hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"I bought this CD for my husband who really loves the 12th track, \\"Never Could Have Made It.\\" There are other great tracks on this cd that my husband is now fond of.

But this cd was a disappointment.Also, this is simply a personal choice, but the minister's attire on the cd cover makes him look like a pimp.

If you like atmosphere, buy one of their two classics: Overcast or Lucy ford. If you're new to hip-hop and dont like hip-hop that offends you or makes you think about white privilege or other such uncomfortable subjects of this inherently political movement, there are many other much better groups out there. Please do yourself a favor and avoid this album and this hiphop-turning-punk \\"movement\\" that slug's got going on. there are worlds and worlds of great non-offensive underground hip-hop out there that blow this album out of the water. If you're not afraid to have your horizons pushed a little, i would suggest such older groups like Boogiemonsters, Pete Rock & CL Smooth, A Tribe Called Quest and newer groups like Black Star, Cannibal Ox, and Binary Star. thank you"},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"this is definately not atmospheres best. it is his worst actually. godlovesugly is much better. lucy ford and overcast! are the best though. headshots:se7en i have not heard yet. dynospectrum is sum of slugs best work too. best songs on seven's travels are:trying to find a balance,birds sings why the caged i know, gotta lotta walls, key to life vs. 15 min, and always coming back home to u is probly slugs best song yet.check out sage francis, his new one is good but his older stuff is better too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitive Faux-Hip-Hop","review":"Essentially, this is \\"Hip-Hop\\" for people who normally would never listen to Hip-Hop. This is the kind of album, which as a hip-hop fan, is recommended to you by your friend who normally listens to fall out boy because he knows you're into hip-hop.This is a very feminine, wannabe-poetic attempt at \\"intelligent rap\\". The lyrics are mostly Slug's complaints about girls.The beats can be almost decent on some songs, but are generally diluted by some kinda of \\"artsy\\" elements.If you want hip-hop that isn't about money and violence, please don't think this junk is your only option.Atmosphere and the whole rhymesayer's posse are making underground hip-hop look bad. Yes, I said it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Downhill since the start","review":"Hey, if your just commin around to atmosphere, dont connect to this album.

If you like atmosphere, or anything like Atmosphere then you should definetly check out the Unknown Prophets.

The best hip hop is coming from Minneapolis these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Se7ens Travels","review":"The new album from Ant&Slug (aka Atmosphere),Sevens Travels, is SICK! they killed this album. The lyrics are one of a kind just like the beats. Probably the most popular song on the album is \\"Trying to Find a Balance\\" this would be the one everyones been seeing on MTV2. Now anyone who thinks hes selling out...shut your mouth! hes still writting his own material, making his own beats. He's just trying to make sum cash for his kid!! HES NOT SELLING OUT! To anyone that likes up-beat hip-hop or some deeper meaning hip-hop, i HIGHLY recommend Sevens Travels. He throws sum humor into his lyrics with songs like \\"Shoes\\", \\"National Disgrace\\" My Favorites are: Trying to find a balance, reflections, gotta lotta walls, cats van bags, los angeles, shoes, national disgrace, always coming back home to you...so buy it and enjoy and i can GURANTEE that anyone who hears it will love it! peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but lacking a production punch from ANT","review":"every song is lyrically perfect in my opinion, being a huge slug fan I believe he hit the right chord on every track especially the women with tattoed hands-esque \\"always coming back home to you\\". The album is great, worth picking up, but ANT has 1 or two weak beats, which is hard for me to say but true. The production on tracks three and eighteen in particular could be revised, but other than that, keep on doing what you're doing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as earlier albums, but still on target","review":"Atmosphere have once again put together a spectacular collection of songs that any true fan of hip-hop can appreciate. It's a bit of a shame that most of the songs on this album will never see radio airtime, but word-of-mouth is plenty to keep them afloat. The fist track and single, \\"Trying to Find a Balance,\\" sets the tone for the entire album; playful at times, serious at others, with touches of philosophy and self-examination to fill in the rest. As many reviewers have already stated, one of the best songs is actually the hidden track, \\"Shhh!\\" Anyone who grew up in a small town will instantly connect with it as much as someone who grew up in Slug's neighborhood. The final track on the album, \\"Always Coming Back Home to You,\\" is by far my favorite; taking a more serious look at life and love. Do yourself a favor and give \\"Seven's Travels\\" a listen, and while you're at it, check out the rest of the Rhymesayers catalogue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atmosphere is the coolest","review":"Atmosphere, or what people called him MC Slug, is one of the best rap artist of all time.

This album is good but it sounds like what it was originally supposed to be before Epitaph picked them up. It wasnt supposed to be an official album, it was supposed to be a bunch of new and unreleased material in the same vein as the se7en tape. Epitaph marketed it as an official Atmosphere album but it does'nt have that feel, I dont consider this Atmospheres 3rd album this belongs seperate with se7en and Lucy Ford and the Sad Clown Bad Dub series. If you dont understand what I'm writing its just a repeat of what I read from the insert that came with God Loves Ugly. Its good but there are too many unfinished songs and skits just like the se7en tape which was not marketed as an official album."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Rise By Sin\\"","review":"Atmosphere has been making top notch hip hop for several years now and nothing has changed on \\"Seven's Travels\\"... Slug is the next great MC, kinda like Eminem with a doctorate and a conscience... the review that lists Common, Kweli and Hi-Tek and The Roots as being in the same subgenre is obviously an individual who does not understand the delineation between underground and mainstream... all Atmosphere fans should check out http://www.risebysin.com to check out the future of independent film, which happens to feature several of Slug's underground classics. Peace!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Putting MN on the Map in a HUGE WAY","review":"For all of you who listen to Slug's lyrics and say that it's not hip-hop, quit paying attention to the Billboard Top 40 and open your eyes. Slug's lyrics are brilliant and each album has been better than the one presvious to it. If you actually HEAR what the album is doing then you will understand my concern with the commercial rap scene. The beats are amazing also, the mesh of the two makes for their best album yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is great!","review":"This is not Atmosphere's best work, but it is still one of the best albums out in the market today. Music does not get anymore real than this. The way Ant mixes the beats and Slug just tells a story that just really makes you think and comes close to home. The ideas and opinions of Slug and the most down-to-earth as they come. If only had $15.00 or so to live life with for a week, I would buy an Atmosphere album and lose myself in the music for a week.Take my advice and buy this album, the first 3 Atmosphere albums (Sad Clown, Lucy Ford EP, and God Loves Ugly), the Felt EP, and anything else that contains slug somewhere in the album.

The truth is the GL character has never lived up to its potential. Ever. Jon Stewart has been-and is the best GL- because he brings angst and attitude,not just cockiness. The two episodes in which he stars carry this collection. With the recent release of the Blackest Night series you have a great example of great story telling- with the Sinestro Corp carrying the series. The truth is GL is sub par, and will always be, when compared to DC's big three. My advice: buy teen titans instead; everyone one of those characters are more compelling than the other GLs in this collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used battery","review":"They sold a used battery.

The format of this book is the same as the earlier one: sections of the state are presented and then counties within each section, with the \\"lost\\" towns being listed by county. The descriptions of each town is thorough and interesting, with many photographs being included. Anyone interested in local history of Kansas will find this (and the earlier volume) indispensible.

I didn't know at the time that a live album was en route but later bought it the day it was released. The album captures the show, without mirroring it, and shows what a remarkable musician and social conscious this man is. After 20 or so listenings, I still cannot put it on without dancing in my computer chair while I try to work. The band's energy is in the red zone throughout, and the call and response, the crowd interaction and sing-alongs, the patter -- all integrate into and with the music rather than being an annoyance as is so often the case with live albums. A great pleasure all around and on every track. At 62, I'm old enough to remember when Grazing in the Grass was originally released. Although it immediately become a top 10 hit, I was never particularly fond of it. The contemporary live version included here overcomes my longstanding antipathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied!","review":"Got what I ordered just in time.

There is one bonus track: \\"Beautiful Savior\\".I enjoyed this, but buyers should be aware that there isn't much new here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This release is an absolute absurdity. A \\"live\\" album is not something that should be released after only one previous album. The only plus would be the DVD that has the American Dream video, but that is only granted you like that song.Don't purchase this CD. It is a marketing ploy, and nothing else."},{"rating":"2","title":"supplemental reading","review":"The density of the writing reflects, perhaps, the complexity of the topic: dealing with large-scale, deadly conflict (i.e. war). The book covers conflict resolution theory as well as violent conflict escalation and settlement. Case studies are used to good effect in Preventing Violent Conflict, Working in War Zones, and Ending Violent Conflict. If you're interested in this topic, I would recommend this as supplemental reading.I read this for an introductory, graduate-level class on Conflict Resolution Theory. I think this book would also be useful for students of international relations, industrial psychology, political science, international development, and sociology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let us continue the fun!","review":"The second volume has 10 episodes just as good as the first. Many of the guest stars would pop up later on in the 90's as main characters in their own movies and TV shows. Geordie Johnson does a great job as Dracula, bringing out both his humor and powerful intelligence.Sad to say, the series came to an end, right when it seems to be developing a future.

It's small enough that it doesn't crowd my room, but plenty big for him to be comfortable, and his bed fits in it perfectly!Ret cries like a baby when I leave him in a hard crate, but I put him in this crate for about 30 minutes tonight while I worked on homework in the other room, and heard hardly a peep from him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely dissapointing . . .","review":"I did not like the prequel of this book, \\"COME UP AND SEE ME SOMETIME\\", but in a moment of weakness I decided to give this novel a chance, hoping that Ms. Monroe would go back to the promise she showed in \\"THE REAL DEAL\\". Sadly, I was very dissapointed. The characters are flat, stereotypical, and annoying. They never show trust in one another. Almost up to the last page they are doubting each other's actions and intentions. Ms. Monroe's writing is also annoying because she keeps repeating and rehashing thoughts, emotions, and worse, the events that happened 18 months ago. This shows little respect for the readers' intelligence and tolerance. I won't be giving this author another chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay no attention to those glowing reviews","review":"Throughout the majority of this book, the heroine keeps some major secrets from the hero with only the slimmest of excuses.

It was too sweet, and not spicy enough. Also, when I got done chewing on a bunch of it, I would have a wad of unchewable fatty junk in my mouth which I had to spit out.Pros:-They use quality beef with no growth hormones or antibiotics-None of the chemicals that are in a lot of jerky-Texture was good, but not great-Good priceCons:-Not very spicy-Sugar is the second ingredient, making it way too sweet and not as healthy as it could be.-Beef cuts a little too fatty.I would definitely not buy this flavor again, and I would probably keep looking before considering another bag of Golden Valley Jerky."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"i have been buying this product for years. literally hundreds of bags. it is somewhat inconsistent, yet when it is right it is the finest jerky i have ever tasted. that said after receiving my order today i will never be purchasing it again. as recently as last week the jerky had arrived (as always) in 16oz bags like the one pictured above. all of a sudden they are in a different 12 oz bag (however still for the same price of $14.77). i supppose its my fault for not looking carefully enough at the site but there was no change in the package representation or the price so there was no other indication that they had reduced the quanity of jerky by 25%. i will enjoy my last four bags slowly and move on to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent and Poor Quality","review":"I've tried the peppered, spicy, and original. There is a lot of inconsistency between packages. The last batch I bought was the original flavor, and it has a very chewy, unpleasant texture. No flavor, unpleasant aftertaste. The smell is awful, it smells like a dog treat. Some pieces have a bunch of gristle attached.

Unfortunately, after giving Golden Valley a chance with both this and theirSweet N' Spicyflavor I couldn't make myself enjoy the taste. The texture is strange, it reminds me of chewing cube steak. You know it's beef but you also know it's a little too chewy to be steak. It's possible people who like their steak rare may enjoy the chewy texture as it's not too tough as far as beef jerky goes. Plus, something about the flavorings they use gives the meat a sour, almost rancid taste. I'm guessing it's the apple cider vinegar as it reminds me of fruit or apple juice that's turning bad. They need to improve their flavors before I try them again."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality beef jerky","review":"The meat was poor quality.

This thing is useless. Actually, I forgot and left the towels on overnight. Well, they weren't dry (and they weren't soaking wet to begin with either). So, I decided to give it another try.

Besides doing a great job of keeping the towels dry and fresh, it also saves space, because we can fit 5 towels on this rack in a space that would only hold 1 or 2 normal towel bars. It's true, as the other reviews say, that it doesn't warm the towels thoroughly - you need one with flat panels to do that - but it does make them \\"warm-ish\\" and DRY, which to me is the best part.

I snipped the cord off and used the broken one as a wall-mounted non-warming towel rack in the guest bath. Then, mounted the new one on the wall with the cord out of harm's way when cleaning.

It was neither the least, nor most expensive, and was rated well above average. To my dismay, I find it very disappointing. It does not warm my towel more than a bare minimum over the ambient room temperature, and that warmth is confined to the inner surfaces of the towel, which were in direct contact with the rack itself. Although all joints are fitted snug and fasteners tight, the rack itself is NOT a \\"rock-solid\\" unit, although for now it does not appear it will topple.

Wall attachments might work?","review":"I never actually got the chance to try out the warming part because I purchased this to be used as a stand-alone unit, and I could not get the legs to attach securely (did not try the wall attachments). The leg attachment screws included M6 x 35 were too long. I tried shorter M6x30 screws and they were too short! The attachment consists of a nut welded to the bottom of the rack, so just the TIP of the screw would attach (thus the flimsy at best fit). Even if I had the correct length of screw, it would only be holding on by a few threads. I suppose you could punch a hole in the bottom of the rail, but that may puncture some of the electrical work inside the rail tubing. I returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"towel warmer","review":"This warmer takes about 1/2 hr to hest up and then the towel doesnt even get very warm.

I needed something to dry the bath towels. First of all there is not space enough to dry 2 bath towels. Second, after a whole night the towels were not dried or I better say they were dried only on the parts that the railing touched the towels.

The bottom wall mount gets in the way of draping down a towel on the lower rungs.2. If your plug is behind the rack it gets in the way of draping a towel on the upper rungs.3. Cosmetically the plug sticks out well past the towels, can't be hidden, and is just an eyesore.I am returning mine and will make sure that my next towell warmer is specifically designed exclusively for wall mounted use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Towel Warmer/Dryer","review":"I bought it for drying the towels to be sure I had a dry fresh towel in the morning.

This towel warmer is a disaster of a product, at the low end of the scale even by Chinese manufacturing standards. The packaging was subpar. The directions for assembly are nearly indecipherable. The screws do not even fit the holes! There was a piece rattling around inside the warmer. Who knows what else is wrong with this thing?There's a reason they have a towel hanging over the product in the picture: it's to conceal the towel warmer underneath! That they are asking upwards of $80.00 for this product is deplorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"towel warmer not like European towel warmers","review":"Unfortunately what I remember of my European travels - the deep soaker tubs where you can practically submerge without bending your knees and the towels that are toasty warm when you take them from the towel warmers - are not to be found in the US. This towel warmer was no exception. The reviews that said it warmed a mere 3/4 inch where the towel touched the top bar of the warmer are true. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dud","review":"This product did not work. It got power, but did not heat up at all.

If you want a nice, warmed, dry towel on cool California winter mornings, than this is the towel warmer for you. I think mine is a good investment, it was easy to put together (I just screwed on the feet in about 5 minutes, but there's hardware included for mounting on the wall too), it's not very big or space-consuming, and it sure beats the still-damp towels I was dealing with. When I bought mine last week, it was only Twenty-nine ninety-nine, so it has gone up in price. Can't complain one iota, this is a nice, cheaply priced towel warmer. I use it to warm my bras and lingerie after rinsing them too!ETA: It only lasted a year. The electrical connection to the unit frayed to the point of being a hazard, and could no longer be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries Towels About As Well as Hanging on a Towel Rack","review":"I bought this for my wife last year, thinking that it would be nice if she could have heated towels when she got out of the shower. Boy did that backfire. If you leave it plugged in all night, with your towel on it, and take your shower in the morning, the towel will be slightly warmer than room temperature. This thing simply does not heat up enough to do a bit of good. Spend your money on a higher end one if you want heated towels - something that really warms up. Don't waste your money on this, unless all you want is an expensive towel rack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energy Consumption = 73 Watts","review":"I've had one of these units for many years, and I've never had any issues with it. I did recently get a Belkin Conserve power meter, and I was curious about how much energy the heated towel rack would draw. The literature only specified less than \\"an average lightbulb,\\" which could mean just about anything. I was pleased to see it was less than the 100 watts I was expecting, drawing a pretty consistent 73 watts while on. For us, that's about $5-$6 a month, which isn't crazy, and arguably worth it for warm towels.Like other people have mentioned, it's best to have some thickness to the towels you hang on the rack for good warmth. Don't do like the stock picture above and hang one towel all the way across, as it will be barely warm at all. Fold it a few times, and put one folded towel on each rung. The layers of towel will help trap the heat and warm the towel through. You don't get piping hot towels this way, but you will have a warm towel for when you need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than nothing, but.....","review":"This product is not worth the money! Yes, it warms your towel, but only on the sections that actually touch the bars. Also, in our small bathroom, someone was always bumping into the hot rails and getting an annoying \\"ouch!\\"Brookstone sells a version that works better. It's a small \\"box\\" that you put your towel in to warm it. I'd give it 3 or 4 stars, because it's not perfect either, but at least 90% of your towel heats up. It's WAY better than this thing for sure!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reliable, Dependable and Wonderful!","review":"Purchased my Warmrails a little over two months ago because my husband likes to hang his damp towels over doorknobs and over the shower door where it never dries and smells musty almost immediately. I have had a warmrails towel warmer before, it is over 8 years old and it is on all the time since it uses very little electric. The warm towel makes getting out of the shower such a pleasant and cozy experience. The warmth of the towel just wraps you in comfort! I recommend purchasing a towel warmer to all my friends and many bought them and love them too. Warmrails is one of the best, the price is right, and its an excellent value for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"This has been a great purchase.

They're probably one of my favorite bands of all time. The back-up vocals are amazing!All 3 singers voices' go perfectly together, and thats so important in a band. Promise is probably the best song on the cd, but its hard to pick cause they all rock. Lovers and Liars is the perfect example of complete harmony w/ all 3 singing at once, and of course the greatest fall(of all time) is a great song.

From the moment 'Introduction' ends and spills into the title track, things get crazy. Every song consistenly delivers emotion and energy, except for 'Tiger Lily', which is the one acoustic song and to me, one of the weakest points on the album. A few favourites of mine are \\"Your Stories, My Alibis\\", \\"My Eyes Burn\\" (this is possibly THE BEST song you're likely to hear this year, \\"The Greatest Fall (of all time).

Whenever the author reaches the simple concepts such as parsed entities, he gives a couple of examples, but for more complicated ones such as unparsed, the examples are vague and trivial.The same goes for explaining the attributes: CDATA is explained thoroughly (as in all other resources available on the web), but ID, IDREF, NMTOKEN,... just mentioned in one line, without a single example. I had to spend a lot of time surfing the web to find some clear explanations.You could argue that he was trying to present a brief introduction. Well, that's not exactly true.

As Toolan unites the spiritual with the scientific, he accents the idea that our evolutionary cosmos is filled with promise, is Christ-centered, with incarnational faith providing the appropriate setting for a contemporary scientific cosmology resulting in a fresh basis for an ecological ethic and a new social contract with nature. At Home In The Cosmos is enthusiastically recommended reading for students of Christian theology, the balanced roles of science and religion, and environmental issues within a Christian philosophy and perspective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed facts","review":"This book is one of the hardest books I have ever read.

It may not be dying, it will probably recover after we are gone, but we are making it an unfavorable place for ourselves to live in.That is the basic message. Unfortunately, Toolan gives this in a disjointed fashion, introducing experts that he gives little to no background for and having them give quotes. Some of his logic is also fuzzy, stating the beginning and the end of a line of thinking, but doesn't say how he got from the problem to the solution, yet we are forced to take his conclusion as fact to finish the passage."},{"rating":"1","title":"coolXterior","review":"Although the title says .Net \\"Applications\\", it fails tomention they are \\"Web\\" applications, meaning ASP.Net & WML Pages!

The review which follows from England is more a comment on the strangely vindictive and deliberately attacking mind of the English reviewer rather than a fair assessment of the book.

This story would make a wonderful movie or television series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Fatal Passion is a fatal flop...","review":"I have at least 100 different books about the Romanovs in my personal library, and I have to say that this is the bottom of the barrel. The writing is trite, the research is flawed, and there are so many inaccuracies that I question this book being called non-fiction. There were so many things Sullivan could have developed in greater depth--especially the relationship between Victoria and her sister. Of course, Ducky was such a shallow individual that I imagine it must have been difficult to write a biography about her. Past reviewers seemed to either love or hate this book. I suspect that the raves came from Sullivan's friends. Any historian familiar with Romanov history will identify this book for what it is--a very flawed attempt to make a minor character in Russian/German/English history into a major one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Royal Pain","review":"This is the biggest lot of historical nonsense. Sullivan has anirritating style and a gushing attitude towards his subject(either he's related to Ducky or madly in love with her). Hecannot get over how impossibly wonderful, gorgeous, perfect, etche thinks she was. This is a totally inappropriate stance for ahistorian towards a subject. He also trashes everyone Ducky knewto make her look better. Sullivan's treatment of the murderedEmpress Alexandra is particularly cruel and unnecessary. Bottomline: Ducky was an overrated, frumpy, greedy historical footnote.Cyril wanted to be Emperor, so why didn't he start by executingtraitors like himself and his wife? Their behavior was inexcusable, even during a revolution. This book is inexcusableas a history or as a biography. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book sunk by it's title.","review":"Other reviewers have pointed out the obvious, she was, poor soul, no beauty.Victoria Melita hadn't a prayer of being the last uncrowned Empress of Russia. She was not converted to the Orthodox religion when she married Grand Duke Kirill, she was a divorcee and they [Victoria and Kirill] were first cousins. Such a dynasty had, [indeed still has], written laws for the succession and this pair didn't qualify. Ever. Sorry folks.Written in a style that would make Angela Brazil blush I found it unreadable after a few chapters. I had the feeling that the author had an image of how he thought Victoria Melita was and proceeded to shape the historical figure to suit his image of her. Reading the many reviews of this book I am shocked how so many people are taken in by such rubbish as this and glad to see that it's also still not possible to fool all of the people all of the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to read, worse to contemplate","review":"Dear God this is one wretched book. By page 40 I thought if Sullivan used the phrase \\"the beautiful Grand Duchess\\" one more time I'd scream; then he managed to use that phrase twice on ONE PAGE. All of which is made worse by the fact that you can't help wondering \\"Is she related to Mr. Ed the Talking Horse on her mother's side or her father's side?\\" as you look at the pictures provided of Victoria Melita. If this woman was one of the great beauties of her day then these were ugly times. This book is riddled with factual errors - WHERE was the editor on this one? - at one point the author actually gets the century wrong. It's also contradictory, fawning and downright stupid at least once per page. Why the author felt the need to canonize Victoria Melita instead of presenting an honest portrait of a clearly complex (and selfish) woman is a mystery. Then again, it's also a mystery how this book ever found a publisher. Don't waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"A Fatal Passion\\" - Much Ado About Nothing","review":"Although the title suggests otherwise, this is not a particularly insightful or thought-provoking biography. Victoria Melita is portrayed by Michael John Sullivan as neither particularly human or even that interesting, but as a saint victimized by just about every one in her royal family tree: from her grandmother Queen Victoria, to her mother the Duchess of Edinburgh, to Czar Nicholas and Czarina Alexandra, her cousin and sister-in-law, to Ernie, her first husband and cousin, and Kirill, her second husband and cousin. As a biography, it is lopsided and clearly written not to offended Victoria Melita's descendants, and perhaps to further their claim to the Russian throne, as the final sentences of the book suggest. With that in mind, it probably would have made a better historical novel. Michael John Sullivan is a good writer, but a more balanced approach would have made this biography more palatable."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent biography","review":"THE AUTHOR HAS CRAFTED AN EXCELLENTLY RESEARCHED AND SKILLFULLY PRESENTED ACCOUNT OF VICTORIA MELITA'S LIFE. tHIS IS A VERY DRAMATIC STORY AND YOU WON'T WANT TO PUT IT DOWN ONCE YOU START READING IT. i READ IT TWICE"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all of the good reviews?","review":"I just read \\"A Fatal Passion\\" and I was very disappointed. The individual the author chose to write about, Princess Ducky, does not merit a biographical account. There are subjects of interest about her life, such as her divorce and her familial relationships with the royal houses of Europe, but beyond that Princess Ducky does not impress me as an a person to admire, nor does her life have a significant impact on 20th European history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly Infatuated with his subject","review":"The author clearly had a fatal passion for his subject- he grounds her into the floor with praises while subjectively pinning down her relatives. I found it unusual how none of \\"Ducky's\\" faults were mentioned while the author took ever oppertunity to hit down her family members. Clearly, this is a biased biography, however compelling the history itself WAS.And as a previous reviewer had mentioned, I do not see how Ducky was such a beauty. The pictures of her frightened me... her overlong, thin nose and drooping cheeks were painful to look at. There must be another biographer out there who has depicted Ducky under a more truthful light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddy colors...very disappointing","review":"The colors are way off...it looks like a before cleaning photo.

I had no problems at all. unlike the other reviews both fixtures matched and everything was intact. but one thing i worry about is how they are shipped which can cause some major damage. it was the two fixtures on top of one another with just some flimsy paper as very minimal padding. i suggest bubble wrap. but all in all they are pretty good and im satisfied for the low price. if you are relatively near Pennsylvania your shouldn't have damage problems"},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to Walmart","review":"Very very weak black light, barely lite up two posters I had up on my wall.

That is a hassle, plus the fact that you can only use it at night. I have two jobs, and by the time I get home, I'm too tired to go on a microscopic cat pee hunt.

I'm an electrician and solving the problem was easy. The switch is actually decent. The ballast is terrible. Its mounted on the front side of the blacklight. The only access point to the black lights are from the sides(two screws) The side the where the ballast is has rivets punched in. Making it impossible to replace!!!

Called Sam Ash (where it actually comes from) and they said they would sent another no charge - keep the first one, too difficult to ship back. Had to call back three times to receive the replacement. Finally arrived (Sam Ash was great about the problem with the order. Took too long, but they took responsibility.) Second finally arrived - with broken bulb. These T-8 bulbs are VERY hard to find for individual sale, and expensive. Rather than risk sending a third, Sam Ash refunded my purchase and told me to keep both defective units. I replaced the T8 ballast in the one and converted the second to a T-12 bulb and ballast for about $25 bucks. I now have two working units. Here's a better idea though: Go to Home Depot. Buy a cheap T12 fluorescent fixture and a T12 fluorescent bulb. Together maybe $20-$35 depending on the fixture you select. T12 bulbs are commonplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice, big black light for the price","review":"Cord isn't very long but that's the only con.

Some potential extension ideas:1. Recognize dialogue/use quotation marks... it's somehow more fun if you get to write and say AARRRRR every time to write a quote, correctly, using quotation marks.2.

They see the main character, a child name Jeremy, digging on the beach and ask him to come with them to help them bury a treasure. The boy goes with the pirates! The book explains, \\"I didn't think mom and dad would mind, as long as I got back in time for soccer practice the next day.\\" A very dangerous message for a young literal thinking child. If you get this book I would strongly urge you to make sure that your child understands that going with any stranger is never alright!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahoy, Buy this book for your little or big Pirate","review":"I bought this book for my son and he adored it.

Along the way we learn pirates don't brush their teeth or eat vegetables--cool!

Jeremy thinks better of his new career and goes home, along the way making sure the pirates return some day.

Finally he decides to go back to his family.This story is fun to read and the illustrations even capture my babies's eye :) I do like the importance based on having a family & having someone to comfort you & read to you.The only potential drawbacks & why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars (and I might be being critical) is that:1.) it might give the message that it is okay to leave your family to go off with strangers2.) also it is fun to not brush your teeth & eat like a slob.Overall, though, I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous book for kids and their parents!","review":"Once in a while, a great children's book comes along that gives you the parents as much joy in reading it as the kids get in hearing it.

After reading it, though, I decided against using it with three- and four-year-olds. I can see from many of these reviews that some children this age love this book, and it is certainly cleverly written (maybe too cleverly - do three's really need to know about Bora Bora? - or does that kind of thing mainly entertain parents?). However, first of all, on the back cover (not just the dust jacket but the real cover too) is a huge skull and crossbones. I may be old-fashioned but I feel this is inappropriate for young children. Also, the pirates, while buffoonish, do look menacing enough to frighten a small child.

The commercially professional and correct mixture of the \\"screaming\\" hard-hittnig songs with more plain heavy rock-like tunes only helps in this case, making the album interesting for much greater number of the heavier music fans.Lyrics and perfectly played instuments add a lot, and overall the recent release by Spineshank can easily and beautifully decorate rock charts, as well as any modern rock collection.Undoubtedly strong effort that's worth buying and real enjoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer","review":"Those of you fans of Spineshank, will appreciate this album.

If you expect the same understandable lyrics on the rest of this CD that you heard on the radio with \\"Smothered\\" then run away...run away fast. \\"Smothered\\" and the 5th track (\\"Beginning of the End\\") on this CD are the only tunes that are listenable here.

(buy the height of callousness as well)"},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly good cd","review":"Even though i personally like more of heavier music i feel spineshank is a great band.

I have no clue how strictly diesel is because i couldn't get the album but im trying. I think spineshank is a great band that is to \\"unknown\\" by people along with other great artists the haunted, motograter, fear factory, coal chamber and devil driver.Unlike some albums with this album you wont have to get up out of bed to switch through intro's or slow boring tracks and I like every track on the album except maybe the last songs that sound like he's whining but overall this album is worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoobashank","review":"Staple a huge, hairy pair of nuts on Hoobastank's best disc and you have Self-Destructive Pattern."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for fans of atreyu, flaw, and underoath fans","review":"First of all Skymac 2 Shut the F**k up and stop bitching about how U didn't expect to hear the F word on this CD alot how stupid can you be Why do you think they put a \\"PARENTAL ADVISORY\\" label on the CD case. now the album,it isn't bad A must for atreyu, underoath, and/or flaw fans.

Bottom line Buy this album and all the other spineshank albums"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corrosive Comeback","review":"Spineshank really won a lot of respect from me with this album. Their second release, \\"The Height of Calousness\\" was a decent album, but \\"Self-Destructive Pattern\\" is tons more fun. The opening 2 songs are among the heavier on the album (of course) but also the most fun, screaming fun repetitive lyrics (\\"THIIIIS! FEELS LIKE SLAVERY!\\"). From there the album kinda jumps up and down between mostly harder songs and more melodic songs. By far, the injection of more melodic choruses makes some of these tracks soar pretty well, especially in the title track \\"Self-Destructive Pattern.\\" Other notable tracks are \\"The Beginning of the End\\" (featured on the Freddy vs. Jason OST, and easily one of the best songs on the album), \\"Consumed (Obsessive Compulsive)\\", \\"Violent Mood Swings\\", and the title track.

This code is NOT on your invoice and can only be had by phoning this company, but since no one I talked to would give it to be, I couldn't return it. They said they would call me back, they didn't. They said they would email me back, they didn't. Furthermore you only have 14 days to return it so basically I got screwed. I lost $140 on a product that is so bad I will never use it.

The title of the book is profoundly misleading and should be changed to \\"Attacking Postmodernism: How to Discredit Ideas You Don't Understand.\\" This book consistently misrepresents postmodernism in an effort to discredit it. That said, the book is perfect for non-critical thinkers who are unconcerned with little things like accuracy, evidence, reasoning, and analysis.

The show was previously at the Musee d'Orsay in Paris. It is a lovely, intimate show. The majority of these gorgeous still lifes of fruits, vegetables and flowers were painted in the last three years of Manet's life. Unfortunately, the catalogue does not begin to do these beautful oil paintings and watercolors justice. The book's colorplates are of unsatisfactory quality and fail to capture the sumptuousness of these touching works of art. The book measures just shy of 9 inches by 9 inches, too small to get any partial enjoyment after seeing the exhibition. The text does not advance art scholarship. Not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but magnificent book","review":"The beautifully reproduced paintings. with some detail shots, in this potent package remind us that Manet truly is the 'father of modernism.' The still lifes of fruit alone would make this book a must have for any art book lover. His peaches, lemons, strawberries and plums are so full of longing, sadness, bliss and sheer beauty that they stop you in your tracks.

The footnotes are often the location for his discussion of the latest scholarly controversy at hand and were almost always worth reading.

It is not Red Badge of Courage, Shiloh, or the Killer Angels, which are considered the pinnacle of the genre, but it is a good read, encompassing a wider range of POVs than most of the other works. It takes elements from each of the works I have mentioned, and uses them to create a story in which it is easier to see how these people were.Fredericksburg is often compared with Gods & Generals... I can only say that I believe that Fredericksburg would make the better movie, if kept faithful to the book (unlike G&G, which was bogged down by civilian drivel for a good portion of the movie).

Instead it was just a long, sometimes tediously titillating narrative of what goes on in such places, albeit an ideal one, with unrelenting rudeness towards the pathetic anti-hero as the central focus. The ending was surprising, or more properly, unexpected, because it didn't really arise organically out of the groundwork laid out by the novel.

I enjoy this kind of book in principle, but the plot MUST make sense. Almost every page of this book (yeah, I'm exaggerating) describes an event that just doesn't happen in real life. Everything is so far-fetched and unreal. The characters act as they do without logical motives that make sense. Too bad, because I think this could have been a GOOD story if Mr. Flynn had spent just a little more time honing the plot into something more realistic. Oh well - a pretty bad story, so I'm not sure why I read all of it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable...","review":"...how bad this book is. I've been a thriller lover most of my life, and am usually pretty forgiving of minor flaws as long as the story is good. Unfortunately, this book is one of those rare exceptions. The plot is very weak and extremely unbelievable and the characters are cardboard figures, uninteresting and poorly developed. The only reason I kept reading it was because of the mostly favorable reviews posted here and I figured the book HAD to get better. The only real mystery involved with The Next President is where was Joseph Flynn's editor and why was it published. The only thrill for me was when I finally came to the end. I know some of you reading this negative review will be skeptical of it since it is in the minority of reviews to date. However, I don't want to see you waste your time and money -- as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"I DON'T SUGGEST BUYING THIS MODEL","review":"I bought this as a gift for Christmas. When the package arrived, I opened it to test it. After setting it up, and powering it on, the monitor flickered on for a second. The power supply light was blinking green which was an indication to me that something was wrong with the power supply. I went on the manufacturer's web site for troubleshooting solutions and to see what they had posted about this particular model. Apparently the manufacturer, Princeton Graphics, is fully aware of the problems with this model's power supply, and has since discontinued selling these models."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unexpected Enjoyment","review":"We travel to and through Louisiana quite a bit. Because of this, I tend to pick up books about Louisiana, particularly Louisiana history. I bought this book because I liked the pictures. However, once I began reading this book, I realized that there was much more to the cemeteries than interesting statues. I can honestly say that I enjoyed reading this book and found it as informative as it was interesting.This book begins with an introduction about cemeteries in Louisiana and then covers different cemeteries in Louisiana. Generally there is a history of the cemetery, an accounting of some of the more famous people buried in each cemetery and a lot of information.For someone visiting Louisiana, particularly someone who is considering a tour of the cemeteries, this book is a must."},{"rating":"1","title":"tired!","review":"I don't hate it as it didn't make me sick but I had NO positive effects and in fact after taking it all I could bring myself to do was sleep!

Upon receiving them, I'm led to believe that the reviews are actually for a different pillow in the Pacific Coast line. I did not have high expectations because I knew they were feather, not down, but I found them to be heavy and dense. But worst of all, the \\"special finishing that makes them leak proof\\" CRACKLES because there is evidently a layer of plastic/vinyl which serves to prevent the feathers from poking through. Oh well, I guess I should have know better... I'll be returning them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get these, get he $49.99 Pacific Coast Eurofeather PILLOWS","review":"I have a set of the $49.99 pillows that are titled \\"Pacific Coast Feather EuroFeather Queen Pillows, Set of 2\\"\\"Pillows\\" instead of this item which has \\"Pillow\\". It is well worth the $20, these cheap pillows are no were near as conforming as the $49.99 version. You can really feel the quills through the pillow but with a pillow cover not as much. I would recommend the $49.99 versions but not the $29.99 ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hate these pillows, they smell like a henhouse!","review":"Granted I have never had feather pillows before so maybe this is what is to be eppected but they have no neck support whatsoever, they make disturbing crunching noises whenever I move my head and they positively REEK like a dirty henhouse. Gross! Home on the range ain't for me. I detest these, and threw them out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sequel Please","review":"Loved this book, a unique premise about the devils work. The characters are individual and likable and the story is fast paced. Engrossed from the beginning it was very hard to put down. Full of action and humour, I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the Publisher","review":"\\"The paintings of Jonathan Green (American, b. 1955) masterfully convey the abiding rural Southern themes of work, love, belonging, and spirituality. Transcending cultural and ethnic boundaries, Green's paintings reflect a deep respect for human dignity and worth and a sense of joy and hope for the future. A graduate of the Art Institute of Chicago, Green has exhibited his works in group and solo exhibitions throughout the United States. The thirty colorful, sensitive paintings in this book of postcards capture the artist's memories of life on the inland marshlands of South Carolina.\\"Pomegranate's books of postcards contain thirty top-quality reproductions bound together in a handy collection.

Don't think I'll be able to send any of these postcard - they are just too beautiful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks are deceiving","review":"Judging by the picture alone I would have given this item 5 stars! Which is why I ordered it. Unfortunately, the item does not look like the picture. It's not nearly as full looking in person, kind of scrawny actually. It must be the angle and lighting they used to make it look more full. The box was smashed when I got it and I spent an hour \\"fluffing\\" it just to get it to look half way decent. So be warned. I've seen better at Walmart and Michaels for less then half the cost. Not worth $88.00 in my opinion plus another 20 in shipping (smashed box, no packing material). Do yourself a favor and buy one at Michaels for [...] bucks and save on the shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Die Form album","review":"This album feels like a more experiment, elborate, and advanced Die Form album. It's like they evolved. The music and vocals is similar and different to the older albums, both male and female vocals. The songs are as darkly strange as some of the older stuff like from Duality (which is my fav). Inhuman was mainly the female vocals and dance like music. Exhuman is a little of the dance music with a lot of darker moody stuff but it isn't as bizzarre. I guess thats the best I can describe it, but it is definately a must buy for any Die Form fan. I got the asian version which contained a bonus cd, which isn't very good and I don't think it is really Die Form (maybe some help from Die Form but it is other vocalists and it sounds hip-hopish and not dark at all; there are maybe 2 decent songs on it). I gave Exhuman 4 stars b/c it isn't quite as good as some of the older stuff but still definately one of the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great photos but that's it","review":"I had high expectations of learning more about the thought process that goes into the creation of Oudolf's garden's, useful information on structures and habits of particular plants. However there is none of that. The photos of gardens are beautiful and you can learn from looking - but info on individual plants is pretty minimal, and there is no discussion on the creating aspect of the gardens. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice cable set for the price.","review":"I needed a long component cable set that would have both audio and video on the same bundle to keep clutter at a minimum.

Alas, it's barely readable. The onionskin on which it is printed is so fine that the reverse side bleeds through. The print itself begs a magnifying glass (well, no - that's a bit exaggerated - but it's very tiny). The gutter size is so miserly that to fully open the book you practically have to break the binding. Forget any marginalia you wish to write - no room in the outside margins. Phaidon (the publisher) - are you listening? I will NEVER buy another book of yours unless I physically see it first. It's a real shame too because the notes are very scholarly, the picture plates are good too.My advice is to look for this book in its FIRST edition (around 1967) - I found one at the library in paperback. Generous margins, gutter, and print size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreed: Terrible second edition of a masterful collection","review":"I agree with the the one star review entirely. This edition is as cheaply made as possible and, sadly, extremely difficult to read as a result. I will take that reviewer's advice and look for a first edition. I plan on returning my copy of the second edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coming Community in Context","review":"The Coming Community by the Italian thinker Agamben, translated by Michael Hardt, is an indispensible work for anyone who is interested in a renewed thinking of a political community without identity.The Coming Community does not refer to a community that will arrive one day in a fixed form. Such an arrival would only indicate that it is not the community that we are talking about. Rather, it is a community which lacks precisely this fixed identity, and which beings must learn to belong to.This can be seen as a singular attempt at a renewed thinking of community against the background of Jean-Luc Nancy's work in Inoperative Community and Blanchot's Unavowable Community. Also, the work can be read in the context of Derrida's work on \\"the democracy-to-come\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I bought this card as an upgrade for my Dell Optiplex to drive two monitors.

Cheesy, low-budget, minimally acted, poorly (dare we even call it) scripted movies that make few demands on your grey matter. Just what the doctor ordered!It's a glimpse into adolescent male desires and fantasies (moving a bit beyond Princess Leia) which many of us never outgrow. We get women who can dominate us and not look like a Nazi prison camp commandant (ala Seven Beauties).The only one I have some misgivings with is The Warrior and the Sorceress because, frankly, I am utterly tired of David Carradine as Caine, Kain or whatever martial arts incarnate the industry want him to be.

Briggs is a jilted farmer with a huge chip on his shoulder hoping to avoid further emotional entanglement by marrying a woman he doesn't know. All of the secrets, deceptions and a general failure to communicate between these two characters made this a hard story to enjoy. This story was full of heartache, most of which could have been avoided by simple honesty much earlier in the story than it occurred. Living on the prairie in a sod house, produces trials enough, and watching them work together to get through those hardships, was by far the best part of this story. The ending was nice, but I felt like you had to wade through quite a bit to get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm your heart with this mail-order romance","review":"When rugged Kansas farmer Briggs Brigman advertises for a plain, uncomplicated wife to help him forge a future on the hard prairie, he gets more than he bargains for. Boston-bred Sarah MacFarland is not only far too beautiful for Briggs' comfort, but she has a dark secret, too. You will be drawn inexorably into their lives as new author Julianne MacLean spins this fast-paced tale of trust lost and regained.

The guns functioned just fine out of the box, but the plastic handle grips never fit right (a common complaint that I've read on here). Accuracy and velocity were very poor. Even with top quality paintballs they would curve every which way when exiting the barrel. The gun would also dry fire a lot due to poor loading. Despite this we enjoyed playing using them. But then it happened... after only 3 months the motherboard on my gun died. Customer Service at ViewLoader (owned by BrassEagle, owned by JT Sports, as you'll come to find out when you TRY and contact Customer Service for the first time) was extremely poor, after 3 months I couldn't get them to send me a replacement board.

You think they would try to keep a customer happy & offer a refund or replacement? NO, the response I recieved was \\"the items were shipped new from the manufacturer\\".

With first use, the handle snapped under the rubber grip area where the plastic is thin. If that were corrected, this would be a top-notch item. The mesh is thickly applied and covers the end well, the handle is comfortable and with the added \\"ergo grip\\" is easier to hang onto when wet and soapy.Since I am unable to use it for a long period of time, I cannot speak to whether the thick mesh will stay attached to the handle; it does seem like it may not be well attached and would \\"ungather\\" where it is gathered together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on the first use.","review":"It broke the very first time I used it.

Remember that at the time, nobody was really sure what a hiatus for the Dead meant, and Kingfish could have blossomed if the Dead had remained on the bricks. The \\"Lazy Lightning>Suppication is fluid and trippy, and the rest is NRPS quality jamming but with a strong lead guitar and harp in Matt Kelly.

Never before have I noticed such a stark difference in sound between the original record and a CD. The whole CD sounds like you are listening with tin cans pressed over your ears. I used to usher Dead shows and I barely recognize what they've done to Bobby's voice, no song, no sound system I have ever heard made his voice sound remotely like this CD does. As for the instruments the high end of drum and guitar sounds almost hurt. It's worse than sterilization, this is castration! Which is no small (de)feat with my tube amp warming up some 1950's klipshorns. If you own this album do not buy this CD, pay double or more if you must, but digitize from your vinyl version.

Yes, it is very generous in how it allows you to press and poke it to command a number of operations; but it is almost too generous, and with each push of a button it sinks into disrepute, servility and debasement.

The adhesive backed mount (the adhesive in the one I received was black and not white like in the picture, which goes much better with my dashboard) has so far survived about 12,000 driving miles, many of those on rough Alaskan and Canadian gravel highways, without ever letting the iPod slip. I have used it both with a dock mounted iTrip and with a Kensington transmitter charger; I cut a small slit in the front of the base portion so I could remove the iPod from the holder without unplugging the wired charger/transmitter, and I'm giving it 4 instead of 5 stars because I needed to make this mod - otherwise it's great. I haven't used the clips, but they seem very sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Design","review":"What I like best about this cradle is that the vent clips slide into place on the back of the unit and can be spaced any way you like--so that it is adjustible to ANY vent-spacing. Also, the vents-clips can be oriented either up-down or left-right, so that you can fit either vertical OR horizontal vents. Seems pretty universal in design, so I imagine it would fit any iPod, but it definitely fits my 60GB iPod Video."},{"rating":"1","title":"In Cold Temperatures - Won't Stick","review":"Great design but unfortunately wouldn't stay stuck in cold temperatures - I have a Saturn and the vent clip was not an option for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"...was hoping for something a little more durable...","review":"Loved the idea of being able to clip the iPod mount to the dash vents - unfortunately the execution of this concept was lacking in this product - the clips held to the vents - but they fell off the back of the mount.We have gone with plan \\"B\\" and used the self adhesive mount directly on the dash. Sticks well - but can't see the iPod once it is in the mount.

The 1st episode is about a deul between Nuku Nuku & Ms.Cheiko over a fried noodle bun (wow, what a plot). While they're deuling, Mishima is trying to find a \\"secret agent\\" who's destroying their plans to take over the world (you won't believe who they thought it was). In the next episode (which I REALLY hated) is when Ryunosuke drinks a DNA Changer that Dr.Ohizumi made & turns him into an alligator (now that's a stupid plot). The last special episode is when Nuku Nuku thinks she's been dumped by the Natsume's on New Years (the only interesting episode). It actually reveals some of her past. It's not that I hate this show now, it's just this volume absolutely stunk! I would say save your money!

I had always regreted not buying the CD when it was availible, so I decided to give this Karaoke CD a shot. I was shocked, repulsed, and more disappointed with a CD then I have ever been before IN MY LIFE. This CD is completely untrue to the movie's real music. I don't even know where to begin- the songs aren't even named the same on this CD! Let me assure you that the music from Newsies is *without a doubt* worth a 5-star rating, however, this Karaoke version is disgraceful. If you want the Newsies soundtrack, I suggest you look for one at an online auction or something, and DO NOT SETTLE for this appalling, piece of trash no-good fraud of a CD.

The lessons contained in EVERY SINGLE CHAPTER are so informative and instructive that I was genuinely saddened when the experience was over. The book is very well written and so reader friendly that it stands apart from every other book on this subject that I have read. I picked up another copy as a gift for my CEO.

If you tried to do everything the authors talk about it would take forever to get anything done, if you ever got a deal done. Some things sound good in theory but don't pass muster in the real world.

After reading this book, I know I have a better understanding about what really happened, but what the people at Mt. Carmel actually believed in, and how their religious beliefs all started. The book is a little heavy on the religion side, as far as explaining what the Branch Davidians believed in, and why, and how it came to be, but the author does a great job of using this to explain what happened.

Ellie's crafting is poppy, without being overly sweet, and her voice is haunting, and quite beautiful.

At 900W, they can easily be powered by a small generator for off-grid use. With a good cowl cover (old sleeping bag?) on the plane, the Little Buddy heater can be placed inside the cowl and will heat the entire engine up in a couple of hours. Much safer than a lot of other preheat options since there is no open flame and the heating element is shielded by the metal housing. For in-hangar use, I turn my Little Buddy heater on remotely with my smartphone using a Belkin WeMo switch. Even when hot pad engine pre-heaters are used, airplane engine cylinders may not be adequately preheated which is why I often use both together.In 15+ years of using these heaters (at least four different Little Buddy heaters), I have only had one heater fail.I highly recommend this heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this if you already live in the Rockies","review":"First let me say the quality of this is first rate, publishing and writing. However, for someone who lives in Denver and the heart of the Rockies I was very disappointed.Buy this book if 1.) You do NOT live in or near the Rockies. 2.) You are NOT \\"savvy\\" reading recreational atlas maps, AAA Guides, or using the Internet or Google Earth.I guess I simply had higher expectations for rides in \\"my backyard\\". There are only 6 trips in Colorado. Three are based out of Georgetown and three out of Durango. If you live near these areas I guarantee you probably have already ridden these rides. Looking at other areas I have ridden, (Grand Canyon, S. Utah, etc.), most of the rides are common sense easily inferred my looking at a map or if you subscribe to a magazine like \\"Road Runner\\" you probably already have the info.Again, high quality, but \\"locals\\" beware.

The genre is patterns of objects with breaks in the patterns. The children are expected to look at the patterns as groupings or shapes to figure out the total number of objects without counting one-by-one.This is a good book. The kids like it. The problems are amusing, even bordering on tickling. My only problem with this book is that an overview of methods for solving the problems should be at the beginning. But so what? There are a few ways to look at the problems and the kids actually sit down to do them without being pestered.Let me repeat this: after the initial disappointment that I had purchased math books, on their own the kids actually sat down to do the problems without being pestered. If this isn't an endorsement, then what is?"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Riddles, Patterns, and Problem Solving","review":"This great book provides the opportunity for children to enjoy mental math challenges. The riddles guide the reader to the author's solution. However, our son enjoyed looking for patterns and using his own clever ideas to quickly solve the problems. I gave this book to my six year old son the summer before he began second grade. He loved the rhymes and the pictures. He especially liked finding clever ways to count the objects without counting one by one. We made a family game of solving each riddle, working to see who would solve it first. Then we shared our strategies and reviewed the author's strategy which is presented in the back of the book.I highly recommend this book! It provides good mental math practice in a fun way. It also reinforces the fact that there are many ways to solve a problem. Gifted children love patterns. This book builds on that and helps them to see additional ways in which finding patterns could be useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"Thought I was a strong math student so was surprised when it took me a while to understand some of the concepts. Great pictures and my grandson (age 6), who is advanced in math likes it, which I guess is what is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"PCC Student Review","review":"My audience was a nephew who is currently in the 4th grade. Overall he found the book to be visually appealing and easy to follow. The math involved in the book seemed to be below his level of math comprehension as he was able to correctly and quickly see the patterns of the shapes and was able to come up with various way to find the correct answer. The patterns became easily visible to him, but only after one or two examples were done, from there on out he breezed through it. The rhymes placed a smile upon his face and I was asked to read the book one more time. Perhaps this book was a little above him, but for the target school year group of 1-4, its not at all bad to aid children in conceptualizing a typical problem in a different manner to ease solution finding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for kids","review":"This is a great book for a certain time in a kid's mathematical development, probably somewhere between first and fourth grade. It might be challenging on first read, but could then become a friend to return to again and again as the child matures.Although the book's content is extremely elementary, it illustrates some fundamental ways of thinking about math that can be important at any level, and it presents them in a humorous, friendly way. In particular, the habit of immediately looking for a clever solution to a problem is invaluable. Finding ways to count sets without actually listing their members is also an important skill in more advanced math. To see the value of developing general methods, think of trying to count how many bridge hands there are by listing them one by one.This book gives the reader a taste of how real mathematicians think. And it's fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"cd rail","review":"CD rail easy to install and adjust for length by sawing. Mounts easily inside of drawers. Can be expanded cheaply.

Thankfully, this is not a modern, historical-critical commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than one could ever hope for","review":"Christ in the Psalms is a first-class compendium of commentaries on the Bible's prayer book.

I was a friendly, mild skeptic when I purchased this book, having heard many seek to find the Lord in what seemed like every syllable of the Old Testament. \\"He's got to be in there somewhere!!!\\" This \\"Where's Waldo\\" approach to bible study has led to many excesses, and may seem as though the student is \\"seeking to find Christ\\" under every rock, behind every bush, and around every corner in the Old Testament!

In a sense the novel is very similar to novels (or non fiction books) about americans (or western men in general) who spend some time in Japan, teaching English and trying to adjust to a very different culture (like \\"Ransom\\" or \\"Angry White Pyjamas\\").Just don't read it for the Science in \\"Science Fiction\\"; it would probably disappoint you.Apart from this, I found it funny and touching, and the author surely has a vivid imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool watch","review":"This watch design may not be for everyone, but I love it when my wife wears it.

I am very glad I got this book and it may be my favorite book so far among those I have collected in the Hino Horror series.

You will enjoy this one and can't wait for the next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Interactive is back on track","review":"Her Interactive's latest game is a huge improvement over the last two: Creature of Kapu Cave and Danger by Design. The setting was interesting, the characters more engaging, and the mystery more fun. I had no problem getting the game to work. I liked the new format but did not like the new opening: I miss the old music and did not like having to start the game anew each time I wanted to open a saved game. However, the game overall is great. There were similarities to the earlier games, which is a very good thing. Now we just need another game in a museum. Egyptian maybe? Now that would make for a great Nancy Drew game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot rate...doesn't work on my computer","review":"I have never had a problem with any of the other Nancy Drew Mystery games (I own them all) except for this one. I can load the game unto my computer, hear voices and sound effects, see some text at the bottom of the screen, but everything else remains black. No video. I am VERY disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Nancy Drew","review":"I've played a few of the other ND mysteries and enjoyed them. The graphics for White Wolf are nice, and the story is pretty good. Most of the puzzles for this one are just okay, but the cooking 'drill' and housekeeping got repetitive and tedious. It kind of ruined the game for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I've played all the Nancy Drew games, and was so disappointed with the last two (Danger by Design, and The Creature of Kapu Cave) that I thought about not buying this one at all. But I really haven't found anything else to compare to these addictive games, and I enjoyed this one much more than the last two. The resort setting was similar to Treasure in the Royal Tower, and I found the puzzles to be interesting and mildly challenging. There was no weird switching back and forth between Nancy Drew and the Hardy Boys like in Kapu Cave (the Hardy Boys aren't in this one at all).A common complaint with these games is that they're too short, but the basic formula works for me. And I've never had any trouble playing any of the games on my computer, a 3 year old laptop that's not suitable at all for high graphics games."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"We have purchased and played every Nancy Drew game as a family. Our kids currently range in age from 6-15. We have been playing these for 6 or 7 years. Although there are some interesting twists and turns, overall this game lacked the excitement of many of the prior games. The kitchen,the snowball fight, and the snowmobile chase were all boring and repetitive. We like the puzzles which require thinking and remembering, and there are precious few in this game. This game also had so few characters and such a limited setting that it lacked much depth. This was our least favorite of all the Nancy Drew games. We hope for improvement in future games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but different than the other ones","review":"The format has been changed on this one so it takes a little getting used to.

I just hope they keep coming and are as good as this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the frustration","review":"I have played every Nancy Drew game and was completely irritated by this game. Some of the activities involved no thinking but took an extremely long time to finish while allowing for no quick way to complete. This game takes an extreme amount of patience to the point that it is not even fun anymore. Many of the clues were disjointed and difficult to obtain plausible conclusions. It is by far my least favorite, even liking the Kapu Cave and Danger and Design better even though they were not exactly my favorite either. I am shocked at the number of positive reviews of this game and I am hoping that none of the rest are set up with mind numbing tasks and repetitive errands like this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"More cooking?","review":"First of all, we hit a brick wall in the middle of this game. We finally gave up and downloaded a few cheat sheets. Even with the cheat sheets, the game would not let us go any farther.Aside from that, you have to cook breakfast, lunch and dinner for the guests at the lodge over and over and over again. Talk about monotony!We gave up on this game, and we don't miss it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Nancy Drew games, hated this one :(","review":"I have played the majority of games in this series. I love them, they are my guilty indulgence, but this one left me cold. 2 of the challenges were darned near impossible, and in fact by the time I got to the snowmobile race I was fed up and didn't even bother to finish. If I want to do chores there are plenty around the house,I don't need a game for that. Seriously, it's as if they ran out of puzzles and plot material so they got lazy and substituted that annoying cooking drill over and over. I haven't given up on Nancy Drew yet but if the Venice episode is like this one I just might!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is the first in the series, that will NOT work with Older Windows","review":"I have played every Nancy Drew game, until this one, which after buying it, will NOT work on Windows ME.

The best part of the whole game is the beautiful wolf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Disappointing","review":"I happened to recently read the hardcover edition of this book courtesy of the local library here in Las Vegas. Although it is 276 pages and written in 1976, it really only covers events through 1960. And those events are covered in a general nature, whereas things that I consider to be meaningless are covered in detail. Plus it kind of skips around chronologically. My guess is that since 1976, more information might appear in other books by Clark, or books related to American Bandstand; I would suggest those books be looked at first."},{"rating":"2","title":"the definitive field guide to dinosaur mainframes","review":"This is an excellent overview of various obsolete mainframe operating systems (not to mention Unix, which is not obsolete.)

For instance, 'Bergamasco' was spelled 'Bergamsco' which is a bit unprofessional if you ask me. Another thing that I was *shocked* to see was that they made the mistake of calling a rough collie a 'Long-haired border collie', which is a pretty hard mistake to make if you know anything about dogs. After seeing that, I shut the book immediately and just assumed that the author had no idea what she was doing when she wrote a book about dogs.

Over and over again, Masello interchanges the terms of devil worship and witchcraft. In so doing, he encourages the same beliefs that caused the burning times earlier in our history. As a witch, I was extremely offended by the author's comparing me to people who call down demons to do evil. Witches do not believe in a devil or demons, neither do they cast spells or make potions in order to do evil to another. Witchcraft teaches followers to bless others and to do good. Please do not read this book thinking you are getting honest information about witches and witchcraft. The information maybe true, but it is true only of people who worship the devil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Macroeconomics: Principles and Tools","review":"This easy-to-read, well-structured textbook is an excellent source of information for any economics student.

The blade guard makes it impossible to see where your cutting line is, even when I installed the blade upside down it was hard to see because of the sawdust accumulation. Also, the battery drains too quickly, 1/4\\" mdf kicked this saw's butt in less than 20 mins.

Tanner first wrote this book in the 1970's and updated it in 1996 after new light had been shed on the subject. I have been told by more than one person that this is the one book you need to read to understand the campaign. After finishing the book, I am absolutely convinced that this is the one book you must own on this campaign. Tanner covers everything from the Stonewall Brigade's reentry into the Valley all the way through the trip to Richmond prior to the Seven Days. Tanner analyses the action instead of just reciting what happened. He also offers more than one viewpoint in certain controversial areas of the Campaign. All in all a great book, and one that I'm glad to have in my collection. 599 pp, 14 maps"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tasting recipes...","review":"I received this cookbook as a gift.

But, we are having a problem with them leaking. I'm wondering if maybe we are doing something wrong when we put the nipples on? No one else who has left reviews seems to be having this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creates gas rather than reducing it.","review":"I'm so disappointed in this product. All of it ended up in the recycle bin after less than a week.The nipple collapses in upon itself pretty severely, creating gaps between my son's mouth and the nipple, through which he gulps down air. There's no air intake in the nipple so eventually the vacuum is so strong no more milk comes out. The only way to break the vacuum again is to pull the nipple out of his mouth and let it fill out. We have to do this about once a minute while feeding him, so maybe 20 times per feeding! Outrageous.We got these to try and reduce his gassiness, but instead he swallows so much air while feeding, he winds up with lots of gas and can't sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bottle my daughter will use!","review":"Finally, a bottle my daughter likes. My daughter is 6 months and she is breastfeed normally. But recently we decided to have a night out. So we start work with her with different bottle (kind of expensive but worth it). I finally started doing better research and discovered this bottles. Since we didn't start her on a bottle earlier she didn't know how to use a bottle. But this bottle is so much like breastfeed it is easy to switch back and forth. I love it! I am now a more relaxed and happy mom thanks to this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bottles for switching between nursing and bottle","review":"I have been nursing my 4 month son exclusively but introduced the bottle at 4-5 weeks, we tried several bottles before this one and he hated them all, they were too different from the breast. He loves this bottle and has no problem going back and forth between bottle and breast (even at 4-5 weeks). this bottle is the closest to the breast we have been able to find.I am going back to work soon and have switched to the stage 2 nipples to make the feeding a little faster, he seems fine with this and has gone back and forth between breast and bottle easily.No leaking problems at all, just read the instructions for how to use, its really quite easy. Also, he's not gassy with these bottles at all. LOVE THEM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"I have had these bottles for 5 weeks for my nursing baby. The latch is no different then an Avent bottle which is cheaper. The bottles leak and they are a pain to wash with the extra insert part. I have switched to Tomee Tippee bottles which are more like BF'n. The Breastflow bottles have a lot of air in them as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so great...","review":"I was very very excited about these bottles... however I soon grew to hate them and regret not buying more Avent. They leak like crazy... Its very annoying to have your baby crying and as soon as you give him the bottle, have the milk leak and have to take the bottle away and make her cry again while you put the milk in another bottle. I searched online and this happens to a lot of people, so its not just a bad batch that I got. I tried everything to make them work but nothing helped... and then, as soon as my daughter started having cereal in her milk, they became even more useless. Since the cereal makes the milk very thick, she has to suction very hard to get the milk out through both of the nipples. A bottle feeding of 5 minutes could easily take 45 minutes... and she eventually would get tired and give up and leave half of the milk in the bottle....not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"I bought these bottles because I liked the idea of the baby having to work a little harder to get milk out of the bottle & thought it would prevent the baby from becoming a lazy nurser at the breast. I have chronic low milk supply & have had to supplement all three of my babies. This bottle seemed like the perfect answer forngoing between breast & bottle. While it is similar to how baby has to suck at the breast, the bottle design does not work. The nipple collapses on itself so badly, you have to remove the nipple from baby's mouth frequently. Also, this bottle causes my child to ingest so much air that she becomes very fussy & extremely gassy!! It is not worth the discomfort to the baby! I would not recommend this bottle at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sadly disappointed","review":"I had originally registered for Dr. Brown's bottles as I had heard rave reviews from a number of friends and family. After having a pre-baby lactation consult, she convinced us that the breastflow bottles were a necessity for our expected twins. We brought the bottles to the hospital with us in case we needed to supplement- which we did. From the very start these bottles leaked, collapsed, and caused our twins to gulp air which resulted in terrible upset stomach and gas. Almost immediately their fussiness, upset stomach, and gas symptoms disappeared once we switched to Dr. Brown's. I would not recommend these bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"good idea - bad bottle","review":"I have noticed the same issue with the nipple collapsing. This is because air is not able to go back into the bottle while they are sucking. So, you have to pull the bottle away from them to let air in. My baby gets much gassier with this bottle because they end up swallowing a lot more air. I think the idea is great but execution is poor. Plus, at least a half ounce of milk gets trapped between the nipple pieces and I lose all that breastmilk because it does not empty. I have tried the Dr. Brown's bottles and the Born Free bottles and they are superior in quality and use to this bottle. Would not recommend this bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONLY BOTTLE YOU WILL EVER NEED!!","review":"I bought this first to try when I noticed the single small bottle in a Target. They didn't have this bottle available 4 years ago when my first child was born. I bought the brand new Platex VentAire for the newest addition and they leaked everytime. What a waste of money that was and you even have to buy new nipples as the baby gets older. NOT WITH FIRST YEARS BREAST FLOW!! Not only did my son go back and forth from my breast to the bottle daily at 1 month old but I never had to buy new nipples because he controlled the flow. I stopped breastfeeding when he was 6 months and have continued to use the same bottles. He is now 9 months old. I've recommended these to everyone I know. It made my life so much easier. The only thing is I don't see a lot of advertisements for these and I think First Years needs to get the word out more. I LOVE THESE BOTTLES!!

It vividly brings to life one of the most momenteous, shameful, but yet heroic eras in American History. The Agonitos skillfully weave the individual story of a single brave and courageous woman against the larger canvas of the trials and traumas of the Cheyenne. The reader cannot remain emotionally aloof from their struggles and passions, instead they are drawn in to their lives and times in a personal way. The imagery invoked by the authors makes the reader feel that he or she is right there as history and herstory unfolds. If you are a feminist, a student of History, or a lover of romance and drama, I highly recommend this book! It has been thorougly researched and is very easy and enjoyable to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Story decent, kindle lousy","review":"I love the tribble episodes, TOS and DS9, no question. I enjoy most of Carey's stories, too, no question about that either. And this is a decent novelization, though I expected more fleshing out.But the Kindle edition is almost impossible to read. There are no breaks between scenes -- every scene just runs into the next one. And there are neither breaks between paragraphs nor indenting of paragraphs. There were numerous times I had to go back and reread, and recall the episode, to realize, \\"ah, yes, we're in a new scene,\\" or \\"okay, this is where somebody else started acting or talking.\\"If a person hadn't seen the episode, I suspect they would be completely lost, trying to read this on Kindle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent novelisation of the Deep Space Nine Episode!!","review":"From the forward and history of the episode to the waythe episode was novelized, I thought it was one of theabsolute best of the ones done by the Star Trek franchise.The blending of original Star Trek episode with the newDeep Space Nine plotline interwoven was incredibly welldone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Handy to Heat/Dry","review":"I live in Southern California and I really appreciate this unit. My husband and I had an apartment in Paris that had a great towel warmer. It's hard to describe the European warmer, but it had more surface area. My complaint with the few units I've seen here in the United States is that they have rungs instead of a tile-like surface heating area, and therefore aren't as efficient and don't do as good a job of heating/drying. However, given that the European units don't seem to be available here, this unit works well enough. We use it to warm/dry our towels, dry swimsuits, etc. without having to start up the clothes dryer. It's also very nice to have a warmish towel when you step out of the shower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful item","review":"This is a very useful item to own. It is easy to assemble. It does a good job of drying towels. My husband and I hang our bath towels on it at night and then shut off the unit in the morning. We get a lot more use out of our towels this way.

It incorrectly states a zillion things like that the DAT is a paper test offered twice a year (uh no?). It also has a profile for each school but the information that it provides on each one is quite variable.

Michael Leahy's book, however, is neither good journalism nor fair. Instead of letting the reader judge Jordan by his actions, Leahy has to tell us that Jordan is selfish, vain and arrogant (gee, a superstar athlete that is vain and arrogant - is there something new here?). What's with all the italics and emphasis added? Heavy use of paraphrasing instead of quotes? Don't waste your time or money on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Account","review":"This book provides an inside look into Jordan's time with the wizards.

Most of the box is a two season long nightly box score of a Wizards game in which MJ floundered in the 4th quarter sandwiched n between flowery prose of 'heroes' and 'titans' and other overused sports metaphors. Then there are the countless personal insertions of how the author was just as important to the story as Michael Jordan himself (how he was on the road on Thanksgiving or his presence in the locker room). The book could have been edited in half and been just as useful. I found little insight and to me the reader it looks like the author wasted two years of his life following MJ as the book didn't dent MJ's facade, which was clearly the author's intention. Michael Leahy will hate me saying this, but Michael Wilbon could have written this much better. I could care less how in bed Wilbon is with Jordan, but Leahy couldn't get Jordan to talk at all. Leahy failed. Terrible book."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't read if you love Jordan.","review":"This book will really kill your love for MJ, so if you idolize him, stay away! The author paints a picture of MJ as a bad teammate who tears down anyone who does not conform to his image of how a basketball team should be run. The author also made Jordan out to be a diva who could not adapt to a running playing style, forcing his teammates and coach to operate a slow offense suited to his needs rather than those of his team.The author followed MJ (stalked him) for about two years to write this book, and Jordan did not cooperate with him. It is possible that the lens through which he views Jordan is biased. Whether this book is factual or not, don't read it if you are fond of MJ. If you like books that expose the flaws in athletes, then you will love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's still the best there ever was....","review":"Michael Leahy obviously likes to tear down icons. In doing so he comes over as petulant and singularly lacking in the understanding of what it takes for a Michael Jordan to be as successful as he was.All of the NBA elite are tough in an over the top alpha male hyper competitive environment. If they are not, they quickly fall by the way side. Obviously the author failed to grasp this fact.That Jordan wasn't a crack executive is neither here nor there. His single minded successful quest to be the best player ever, did not leave him much room to observe and learn board room politics.If Mr. Leahy ecomes half the writer that MJ was as a player he would have world's of success and probably win a Pulitzer, however, he will more likely have a career mirroring a Brad Sellers, just not good in the clutch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!","review":"Maybe I am lucky... i have the original, limited edition New Falcon version.. even autographed by Chris Hyatt.

I can certainly understand the appeal of playing Quidditch (though the rules remain as impenetrable to me as American Football - sorry US friends!) and of flying and so on. However, Israel Regardie et al seem to be so into the arcane \\"Ceremonial Magick\\" esoterica that they miss the things that the common man like me would welcome - to wit, most of the tricks in the film \\"Matilda\\" and showing off at dinner parties. Being honest, this didn't even help me improve my sleight of hand. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"why is the kindle edition lacking?","review":"i bought the kindle edition of this book Golden Dawn.

I did not realize that my Palm had fallen off my belt until at least 3 hours later. If it were not for a Good Samaritan that found the PDA and returned it, I would have been out $200 for a new one.

Unfortunately, despite the one other review, which I belive comes from the record label itself,they haven't developed much in those 4+ years. The music is Allman Brother's-esque, but poorly done.

The old one worked fine, just getting a bit shop worn and had a nick in it. Since the old one was such a great sharpener, I suspected the new one would be as well. Surprise, surprise! The new Diamond Vee is worthless. I think it may have actually dulled the blade. I tried to slice a tomato after sharpening a knife with the new Diamond Vee and it wouldn't nick the skin! I ran it over the old one a couple of strokes and it sliced the tomato like it was water! I think I will drop this baby in the trash where it belongs! Glad I didn't throw the old one out.

Rather than sending it back I decided to get one of these and re-profile the edge myself. This was a hard steel alloy (S30V) so I knew it would take some effort. By the time I got the edge back to the proper angle, the diamond abrasive surface was completely worn away. I got one sharpening out of it for 30+ dollars. I think the sharpener will work well for soft 440 stainless knives like you have in your kitchen or your swiss army knife for quite a few uses, but forget about it for quality knife steel. The adhesive they use to bond the diamond dust to the rods is not strong enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete disapointment","review":"I have a few DMT products and they are all great, except for this one !

They've asked me to read it about twice a week since then - and we have so many books, that's quite significant!What I loved about it, more than the fact that the kid can really see how *everybody* sank the boat (very clearly illustrated), is the fact that it clearly presents a common narrative form - the most unlikely person is the one who sinks the boat.The first time I read it, I paused to ask the older niece if she knew who sank the boat (the question is repeated several times throughout the book), and she answered it correctly, without even thinking - of *course* it's the teeny tiny mouse who sank the boat!

Sadly, the flesh is meagre and quickly becomes a bloated bloodless corpse becalmed in a sea of ennui.Too often we see young childrens' book writers tackle great themes only to founder in their own syntax. Sadly, there are no great themes here, and Ms. Allen is not a young writer but an aged academic who has spent too much time in libraries and not enough on the Main, hoisting herself through the lubber's-hole over the futtock shrouds.Tales of Adventure on the high seas this ain't. Rather, a prolix insight into one man's wasted life in the cafeterias and chat-rooms of an East-Anglian polytechnic. Without any malice I would suggest the author make a sea-change and open a video shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinking Science","review":"This book is great for getting kids to think about what makes things float or sink, as well as how things balance.

Having seen it only twice myself when it appeared on HBO in the late seventies, it remained in my memory as very erotic though not terribly well acted. The cut available (R rated) from this site is not the same cut I, nor my friend saw when viewed shortly after it's original release and I'm reasonably sure that even in it's raw, formative stages, HBO wasn't airing an X-rated version.

While the camera, for example, is focused on the lovely star of the film speaking to another actor one hears a phone ringing and hears the star say hello, then the frame switches to the phone (apparently ringing) which is then picked up and moved to the star's face while....arrgghhh!

There are really only four other game surfaces, the hockey is fine and the ping pong plays well, the pool is cute and fun.

I read from so many sources that Soothie would make the transition the easiest for babies. I bought a starter kit and several other bottles. I was greatly dissapointed to learn that out of all the bottle that I purchased only one did not leak. I tried repositioning the nipple and I tried to tighten the lid. Nothing helped.

The opening of the bottle is wide--great for pouring formula in--but it makes it really hard to feed. In order to get the last oz. in the bottle, you practically have to suffocate your baby because the nipple is in the center of this wide-mouthed bottle. So in order for fluid to get to the nipple, you have to tilt the bottle 90 degrees over the mouth of your baby. The result of this problem led to a lot of gas. This bottle might not be so bad if they made the the mouth of the bottle narrower or moved the the nipple away from center."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST bottle out there!","review":"I am a 4th time mom and have used alot of types of bottles over the last 10 years. Soothies Bottles are hands down THE BEST! My son is 4 days old, only will take the Soothie bink and he drinks like a champ from the Soothie bottle. I havent had any complications with him going to the breast either. They are easy for mixing formula and storing breastmilk because of the wide opening.I have had no problems with leaks and no collapsing nipples.The price is fantastic too! Five stars from me!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not designed well for newborns","review":"Cons:1) The nipple on the bottles are too big for newborns. My daughter's nose always looked as if it was being squished and she had difficulty breathing while feeding.2) To get the last ounce or so, you have to pretty much put the baby lying down to get the milk in the nipple. Lots of formula wasted!!3) My daughter always looked angry and frustrated while drinking and sucked in too much gas.4) Beware of the nipple flow! 2 nipples in this kit are a size 2 (not appropriate for newborns).Pros:1) The soothie is great.2) The bottles are wide and easy to clean.3) Probably better for older infants.My daughter is doing much better with the Playtex Advance bottles. I would recommend you try another alternative, especially if you want to reduce gas or refrain from feeding your child lying down for her to finish the last ounce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked it but didn't work out","review":"My kids have always used the Soothie pacifiers so I was excited to see they were coming out with bottles. I bought these for my 3rd child, I was impressed with the way they were made they seemed durable enough to last and didn't leak the few times we did get to use them. I never did use the little storage containers that came with them, not sure I would trust them too much as the lid just sort of sits inside it. Unfortunately my daughter had reflux and would scream & cry any time she was fed so we switched to another bottle (Dr. Browns) which really helped her out in the long run. She still used her Soothie paci though until she found her thumb which she prefers over anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped my son feed better!","review":"I was using gerber bottles until he started having a lot of problems eating from them for some reason. I tried these because they match his pacifiers and he has no prob sucking on those. I think it worked out very well he seems happier as am I. The little cups for the bottom are really a great idea it should come with more. They not only hook on the botton of the bottles but u can stick them all together and add a lid to the top and its a great snack holder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gassy baby","review":"I have used these bottles fot two weeks with my newborn and I am not impressed. My daughter was very difficult to burp and was vomiting frequently because of trapped gas. I experimented with the Dr. Brown bottle and the Playtex Vent-Air.

The starter set is great. First the nipple is just like the pacifier which I could not believe. The first time we tried during feeding he did not have any trouble getting the formula out. The nipple was not to fast or slow. Another great feature is the fact that the tops fit on the bottom of these bottles so you won't forget them at a resturant or just misplace them in the house. ALSO the formula/snack containers also fit on the bottle - then the top of the bottle attachs to the bottle of the container. We have not tried the stage two nipples at this point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Leaky","review":"I tried the Soothie bottle because my baby was having trouble deciding what bottle she liked. This bottle leaked a lot. I liked the size of the bottle because it was easy to hold, but the size also made it difficult to warm and keep fluid in the nipple when it runs low. My favorite bottles are the Dr. Browns and there is a Parents Choice one that is similar to Dr. Browns."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKY!!","review":"I bought these bottles because of all the positive online reviews. I also liked that they are easy to clean. I was VERY disappointed. These bottles are very leaky (moreso than the Avent). It was impossible to shake the bottle to mix the formula and not get it all over the place. The nipple is okay, but the stage 1 nipple flow is too fast and my daughter had problems eating. I switched back to the Playtex Vent Aire which is by far a superior bottle. There are more pieces to clean, but it's definitely worth it. I would not recommend the Soothie bottles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but....","review":"This is a good CD except that \\"Love the One Your With\\" is performed by the Isley Brothers not Stephen Stills.

Maybe, but then it seems to segue into a romance.Keep reading; it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Conceit","review":"Cameron's Andorra presents a problem for the reviewer: to describe the perfection of its literary conceit is to ruin its effect.

The flap piqued my interest. The plot was mildly ammusing, though ocassional tedious. My biggest problem remained the use of the name of an actual country, without use of the actually country side. (i.e. Andorra, the country, is land-locked and \\"Andorra,\\" the book, takes place by the sea.The plot became very reminiscent of \\"Camera Obsura\\" without the interesting facts and tidbits of data. And tords the end it seemed the author was trying to wrap up story lines without clear-cut reasoning.While every book is a learning experience, this was a bit of a let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A triumph of style over substance","review":"Cameron's prose is wonderful if hardly original. Sadly, the novel places all its bets on a narrative technique that fails utterly. The revelation at the end of the book is supposed to recast the entire first-person narrative but this is so heavily foreshadowed that I felt as if the author must believe his readers to be imbeciles. A shame, but I will give Cameron's next novel a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read - bad details!!","review":"A jolly romp but, having been to Andorra myself, I could not recognise the country; I do not remember any beaches nor do I remember a harbour - let alone onecapable of holding \\"a few ostentatious yachts\\".Andorra is high in the Pyrenees and is land-locked.I doubt if the author has ever been to Andorra.Also Mrs Reinhardt comes from the English countyof Barsetshire; which does not exist.If you're an American I suppose you'll enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS FOR THE RAVEN IMPORT, FAR BETTER AUDIO","review":"This is, of course, by far the biggest selling Hollies \\"best of\\" disc.However, a much better-sounding alternative import single-disc compilation,On a Carousel, 1963-1974: The Ultimate Hollies, made available by Australia's Raven Records label.The remastered audio on the Raven disc is far and away superior to this disc, even though it was re-vamped just a few years ago.The Raven CD has every track on this disc, but has nearly double the music, 25 tracks vs. the paltry 13 here.The import is a little extra money, but eminently more worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright and tuneful pop","review":"This was the epitome of cheerful Britpop in the 1960s. The teenage love songs like Carrie-Anne, Looking Through Any Window and Bus Stop still shine with their shimmering harmonies and exuberant playing on catchy tunes and romantic lyrics. This bright vocal pop is often disdained by rock snobs, but none can deny that these songs were well crafted and expertly performed. Just consider The Hollies a UK male version of Phil Spector's famous girl groups. Later, in the 1970s, they became more serious with songs like He Aint Heavy and The Air That I Breathe, two slow ballads with much gravitas. The frenzied rock of Long Cool Woman is atypical of their style but gave them a huge hit. This Very Best album is by no means comprehensive but does contain their most familiar songs, being the perfect collection for the casual fan. For completists, there are more extensive compilations available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hollies","review":"Songs from my youth, just as I remembered them.

No vocal is heard through the left speaker. I owned this collection before it was remastered and I don't recall this happening.

Alot of their stuff has an oldies kind of sound to it, but then again so does the Beatles, and that doesn't keep it from being great. Possibly their biggest hit \\"Long Cool Woman In A Black Dress\\" doesn't quite sound like the rest here, but who doesn't love that track? Other favorites are \\"Carrie-Anne\\", \\"He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother\\", and \\"Long Dark Road\\". But they're all good. If you enjoy The Animals, The Mamas And Papas, or The Monkees, you should dig this, and of course Graham Nash left The Hollies to form C.S.N. as well.

The Hollies are no exception to the politics of record companies marketing. I needed this for my collection, having enjoyed the album when it was first released (pre-cd). This collection includes Dear Eloise and King Midas in Reverse, which are not included in other collelctions. What makes this collection stand out from all the others is the sound!.

They had 5 Top 10 hits and 2 Gold Singles - Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress and The Air That I Breathe (first recorded by Albert Hammond in 1972). With or without Graham Nash, The Hollies remain one of the all-time great groups from across the Big Pond and their Greatest Hits CD just reinforces what a musical force they were from 1966 (Bus Stop) through 1974 (TATIB). My two favorites: Carrie-Anne (written for Marinne Faithful) - nobody's EVER used steel drums as effectively in a song - and He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother (re-recorded by Neil Diamond in 1970. Enjoy the ride On a Carousel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Quick Overview","review":"The Hollies were one of my favorite British Invasion bands. This CD presents a baker's dozen of their hits. The sound quality is good and the song selection is uniformly great. The only problem is the version of \\"Look Through Any Window\\" included here is an alternate mix from a British EP and not the hit single version. It includes harmonized o-o-o-o-s sung over the 'middle eight' and the ending guitar. Other than that one flaw,this is a great compilation at a great price for the casual Hollies fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music","review":"some of the best music the hollies put out. brings back memories hearing it again and even in the movies with the music is great feelings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for some great music.","review":"I love the Hollies music, and to get so many of my favorite songs for a very good price, I couldn't be more happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Memories","review":"I bought this CD for one song: Long Cool Woman in a Black Dress.

It applies to today's dangerous world in ways that anyone can understand. It's not, \\"fast paced\\", it roars. The characters are not, \\"believable\\", they are your next door neighbors.

Looking at it from both the American and Mexican side he has highlighted many problems not commonly reported by the media and thus unknown by the average American. Adding a highly plausable connection with Islamic Jehadism to this situation captives the reader with the realization that his story is not only possible, but under certain circumstnces, highly likely. Current events since his writing have born out many of his conclusion in the book.

It's a glimmering kaleidoscope of organs, pianos, saxophones, bass, guitar, and drums, all led by jive-talking wild man ringleader Springsteen, who has perfected his Van Morrison-after-a-year-in-the-swamp hoot and growl. Somersaultingly lyrical, breathtaking in its youthful inventiveness, and incessantly energizing, from the raucous opening number to the sweeping romanticism of the nine-minute epic \\"New York City Serenade,\\" \\"The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle\\" is one of rock music's most magnificent achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classical Classic Rock","review":"The Wild,the Innocent, and the E-Street shuffle did not sell well enough to suit the Columbia Records boys. After this one, he got it right in their eyes (and ears) when Born to Run hit the steets in '75, but E-Street Shuffle was a one of a kind masterpiece. Friends who jumped on the Bruce bandwagon in the 80's and 90's, but never cared about his old stuff, are floored when they really LISTEN to this album.I agree with another reviewer that hearing New York City Serenade on tv would be a religious experience. I believe it is one of the most underrated tunes ever recorded.I've been listening to this album for almost (gak!) 30 years, and I never get tired of it - so much soul and sweet imagery... Sancious is masterful on the keyboards. This is Bruce's biggest sleeper of them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar Work","review":"Spectacular work by Springsteen. I like this because it is different from what one would expect (after hearing Born in the USA). This is like comparing fine wines; they are just different. When you play this CD you will feel good about yourself. Darkness on the Edge of Town is my other favorite Boss CD; but for a different and more melancholy frame of mind. The Wild, the Innocent & the E Street Shuffle is the first in a trilogy that turns into Born to Run and then Darkness On the Edge of Town. And what a stunning trip that is. Just sit back and let the album speak for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brought me back","review":"I had this on vinyl in high school in the 80s.

I'd like to listen to it three more times tonight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bruces Scores","review":"The Wild, The Innocent & The E Street shuffle may only contain 7 songs, but they pack a punch and are among the finest of Bruce's career. The album opens with the funky guitar riff of \\"The E Street Shuffle\\". \\"4th Of July\\" is the song that made Asbury Park famous and Madame Marie's a mecca for Bruce fans. \\"Kitty's Back\\" is a blazing rock 'n' soul workout and is followed by the comical \\"Wild Billy's Circus Story\\". On the original album, the last three songs constituted side two and it is about as perfect of an album side as there is in history. \\"Incident on 57th Street\\", \\"Rosalita\\" and \\"New York City Serenade\\" is a three part musical suite and they flow seemlessly into one another. The stories they tell are so vivid that they are almost like musical literature. Bruce has released albums that were musically superior to Wild, but never one that was this much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Early Springsteen Album","review":"THE WILD, THE INNOCENT, & THE E STREET SHUFFLE is a great early album by Bruce Springsteen, although he got even better when he ditched the story songs for gritty realism with the follow-ups, BORN TO RUN, DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, and THE RIVER. This album does, however contain the immortal \\"Rosalita\\", plus several other wonderful numbers that have been, sadly, forgotten over the years. You should buy this one if you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid as always..","review":"Altough still going for his best, this second album by Bruce was a huge improvement over his first one.The seven songs are strong, and it becomes obvious that Max Weinberg is a better drummer than Vincent Lopez, who was fired after this album.A very enjoyable album."},{"rating":"1","title":"For completists only","review":"Sure, Rosilita is a fun tune, but nothing here compares to the Bruce of Born to Run, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Nebraska, or Tunnel of Love. If you already own all of those, though, this is a cheaper Bruce-dose than The River or Human Touch, and has about the same percentage of great songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry.................","review":"I know many of you diehard Bruce fans rate this album high but.............. I think at this point in his career he was lacking musical direction. This album shows. Sure, it includes the classic \\"roseletta\\" but that's about it. He tries to jazz, tries to be like Dylan. Some of the lyrics are bad too. If you're a diehard buy it, but if you are a newbee to Bruce get \\"born to run\\" or \\"darkness at the edge of town\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Working class hero first, songwriter....uh...seventh or so..","review":"He's The Boss.

Most of the time, he comes on as a highly electrified and energetic version of Van Morrison's \\"Astral Weeks\\"-era soulster; he spins lengthy narratives that lack the stark, economical power of his later work but which contain intricasies that he began to sheer away as he reached for a pop audience. The music here is broad, sometimes jazzy, sometimes hard-rocking, other times folky. Here, Springsteen paints with a broader musical and lyrical pallate than he ever would again. He and his band play with the fervor of true rock 'n' roll revivalists and he sings like his throat's on fire."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't compare to later Bruce!!","review":"A Brilliant sophomore effort! No, this isn't \\"pop\\"...it is not traditional AABA songwriting (pay attention kids, I didn't say \\"ABBA\\"); but it is a young man with a lot to say.Do NOT bother if you consider \\"Born in the U.S.A. to be \\"early Springsteen\\". This is a poet, an artist, a man with nothing to lose playing what he feels. \\"Kitty's Back\\", \\"Rosalita\\", \\"Incident on 57th St.\\", and \\"Sandy\\", all are brilliant, but they have so very little in common with what Bruce became!I love Bruce today, I love Bruce then. He NEVER tried to make the same album over and over (like, oh, every artist since?), but he said what he felt like saying at the time. Brillaint, poetic, rocking, touching, songs of life, love, youth, understanding...they are all in this album. Love it for what it is!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Paddles are fine","review":"Price is great. The paddles are very spongy.

Personally I love the instrumental stuff, but if you don't you can get \\"Heaven's Door,\\" on a lot of compilations, but without this record, you'll miss out on \\"Billy.\\" Four stars for this one, even though \\"Turkey Chase,\\" is a hoot and the beautiful and haunting \\"Final Theme will chill your soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"it fell apart trying to get it out of the box!","review":"Shoddy construction,,,,,,As i was pulling the item out of the box, it fell apart in my hands.(the area where notes etc go)' looking at the construction, i saw it was held together with only very tiny little nails and believe that the normal shifting of the unit on the desk, would only contribute to it falling apart sooner or later - most likely sooner.It never left the box before i sent it back......"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a phone stand.","review":"My phone sits on it.

This has the real spirit of Thanksgiving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The heating element didn't work at all. The massaging controls worked well.

It's uncomfortable to sit on because the vibrators poke into your back. The heat is weak.

My old one would put my legs to sleep because the motors were right under my thighs, not a problem with this one.

Even though it was on for an hour, I couldn't feel any more than when I pulled it out of the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heater is way too weak!","review":"Don't buy this product as a seat warmer! Its heater is way too weak. The problem is that it heats AND massages. Since both can be on simultaneously, its maximum heat wattage must be low to avoid blowing the car's fuse. I bought it for its battery-saving, automatic, heater shut-off, but I sent it back after I gamely tried it for two days in two cars. The shut-off, which turns off the heater when there is no weight on the seat, is a terrific idea for people with cars whose 12V plug remains on when the car key is removed, but someone needs to sell an automatic-shut-off seat warmer without a massage (and with adequate heating like the far cheaper heat-only versions). Without the messaging mechanism it would also be far more comfortable. I'd buy two of those!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"We got this as a gift for a friend. When she used it the massager part worked great but the heating element did not even come on at all. Looking for a new brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much vibration!","review":"I had to return this product because while I liked the heat component the vibration was more annoying than helpful. It does have a few sections that you can individually select to vibrate, but I found with even just one on it was too much for my sensitive body. I also found the vibration pads in the seat under my thigh were large enough to be noticeable to me, making my legs feel lifted uncomfortably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommend","review":"The on/off switch broke within five minutes.

Tidwell's book is one of the most enjoyable and entertaining I can remember reading. I have lived in Louisiana for over ten years, and was able to recall many of Tidwell's descriptions as he recounted visits with most of the \\"players\\" in the Lower Louisiana coastal area, as well as with the bureaucratic brick-walls standing in the way (locally and nationally). An intricate pattern is woven by Tidwell, demonstrating how one industry/community/culture can have a domino effect on many others.

But it was terrific, and I cannot praise it too highly. I have to believe that anyone from a bright junior higher to a scientific Nobel laureate, if not versed in the subject, can read this book with pleasure and profit. This book is light and easy to work through, but rich in content. It will carry you along with almost no effort while introducing you to exotic things from Klein bottles to periodic and curved spaces. The line diagrams filling the book are crystal clear and add charm all by themselves. This book could only be created by someone who loves the subject and loves to teach.

The bottom is raised so the ash can be warm and still be placed on your carpet, but if you have an option, I'd still place it on stone or tile unless you know the ash is well cooled. The lid seals tightly. I'd guess it could probably fall over and not spill, but I'm not going to try it out.

When you are running a wood stove most of the day to heat the house, you can't just wait for the ash to be cold before cleaning it out.The shovel cleans nicely and the lid fits well on the bucket. The wood handle is a nice touch and easier on the hands. The size of the bucket also works well. I didn't give it 5 stars because, well, I just couldn't give 5 stars to a bucket and shovel. However, for what they are they work great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price","review":"I researched ash buckets online and found comparable products for almost double the price than what Amazon is charging.

Buyer Beware!","review":"I just received this product. It did not come with the duck in Amazon's photo or any other photo I've found for this product on other sites. I contacted Johnson & Johnson today. They advised me that the product first came with a yellow duck, then it was changed to a blue hippo. The hippo was removed as of Dec 2009.

The bucket is also useful to store baby items and is even fun for baby to play with. My little one likes to empty it and fill it up.A couple of the included items are low-use for us, but it's still handy to have them around the house. The one thing I thought was pretty silly was the cotton swabs--why not just use regular q-tips? I put them in the cupboard and didn't think much of them until we ran out of regular q-tips in the kids' bathroom. Then I decided to try them out... I LOVE THESE COTTON SWABS FOR BABIES! :) I do clean my baby's ears after baths and I used to have to be extra careful and look out for wiggles. These swabs prevent you from going too far into the ear and the larger section cleans outside the ear canal at the same time. I logged on today just to write a review about them, and I just ordered some more so that I can put boxes in other rooms. Now that we've tried them, we can't go back! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bath Time Essential!","review":"I bought this for our newborn baby before she was born.

Operatic baritone Ezio Pinza and perky Broadway minx Mary Martin might seem like a most unlikely couple, but that's half the point of the romance, and their chemistry ignites this memorable score. Amusing ensemble numbers including \\"I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair\\" and \\"There Is Nothin' Like a Dame\\" are offset by stirring ballads (\\"Some Enchanted Evening,\\" \\"Younger Than Springtime\\") and a scathing denouncement of racism (\\"You've Got to Be Carefully Taught\\"). The appears to be a transfer from the original LP master."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title","review":"This is an exceptional look into the America in the West in the mid 1800s.

Back in the 90s MC Hammer and Vanilla ice created Hip Hop & Rap. things were great before fakes started taking over the scene! Studio gangsters like NWA, Snoop Dogg, Warren G, Ice Cube, 2Pac, and Notorious BIG became famous and everyone forgot about good music like MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice.Anywho..this 2Pac faked his death to make more money! I mean comon, its sooooooo obvious hes not dead. If he were dead than why would his album still be for sale? Not to mention he cant rap and his beats suck!!

In my opinion there is no original work anywhere on the album. It takes a large amount of dedication and work to produce an album of completely original music, which is something 2Pac didn't seem to want to do. I am a really open minded person, so to find true originality one might listen to soulfly, who actually bases there music on feelings and devotion.

Don't get duped into buying a cd with one or two new tracks or a 'best of' that is incomplete. Get this if you're looking for the best of/greatest hits. This has songs from every era of his recording career, and the chosen songs are the best he released. If you don't have this cd, get it.

This greatest hits CD is the only Tupac CD you'll ever need, though. SO ATTENTION KIDS WHO ARE JUST GETTING INTO TUPAC....His new CD titled 'Loyal to the Game' may showcase his great lyricism, but the production just isn't the type that you will hear on this greatest hits CD.

Standouts on this album are \\"Hit em up\\" and \\"Life goes on\\". Also check out 2pac newest release: \\"Still I rise\\".

I picked up this album immediately after being briefly introduced to Tupac by a friend a while back. After hearing the first song on disc one, Keep Ya Head Up, I stayed up all night listening to the rest. Tupac is a brilliant rhymist, and it shows throughout this entire two disc set. Disc 2 is far superior however with amazing singles such as: California Love(feat. Dr. Dre), Dear Mama, Brenda's got a baby, To Live & Die in L.A., and my personal favorite, Changes.If you are a die-hard rap fan-You should already have this CD and should not be reading this review right now. If you are just being introduced to rap-you should definitely pick this up right away. It will help you know the krunk from the junk and lead you to other great cds.

This compilation is another reason why music fans around the world gotta give props ta 2pac.

I'm sure if his life hadn't been cut short, his \\"Greatest Hits\\" stuff would only have been the beginning. People need to respect 2pac for his artistry, for music that was to the point and always on the real.To Johnny \\"J\\": I hope you find another artist who can equal 2pac in bringin out all those dope cuts that you produced.

Greatest Hits is a very outdrawn cd spread out in songs from HARD CORE gangsta rap to softer choices (Dear Mama, Changes, Life goes on, etc.) I think this is a very well described cd of 2Pac's life and songs. It practically tells his whole life...It's definetely a MUST. Other rap cd's I reccomend: Life After Death --Notorious B.I.G.; All Eyes On Me --2Pac; Kiluminati: 7 Day Theory --Makaveli (a.k.a. 2Pac in a different form) Doggystyle --Snoop Doggy Dogg; 2001 --Dr.Dre; Ghetto D --Master P; The Predator --Ice Cube; Death Certificate --Ice Cube; Lethal Injection --Ice Cube; Bulworth Soundtrack; Friday Soundtrack"},{"rating":"2","title":"RIP 2PAC!","review":"This album iz great!

Pac fans are all riders who blindly worship him even though in their hearts they know he was simply terrible on the mic.

His words touched the world bydoing the one thing that singers dont do any more. And that is write songs based on reality, love and heart. And to not be afraid to express yourself. He preached the word of respect to the world, and wanted to try to end violence among race and culture. Althogh in his lyrics he used very explicit content, he was just expressing himself, and thats what poetry is all about. His songs were based on his life. This Album supplies some of his best work throughout his life. It is a great album that everybody should just kick back and liste to his preaches and not judge him by language. As onced said in the novel \\"To Kill A Mocking Bird\\": \\".. don't ever judge a person until you crawl in his skin and walk around in it...\\". Respect the mans word. Leave him in peace.

I saw them open up for The Cult this week in New Orleans (after the show there was a shooting-death just outside the House of Blues-Isn't New Orleans predictable?) They were excellent-California produces talent like no other. Great music, huge stage presence, fun to watch...\\"Go ahead and clap, we like it.\\" they said to an audience that eventually warmed to them. This is a band that I see as a legitimate follow-up to the Red Hot Chili Peppers-not because of the similarity to each other's music-but, for sheer LA attitude on stage. They love to perform. We loved to watch them. See if you can check them out with The Cult (on tour now) and see what you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Whiskey","review":"Saw them at the Whiskey in LA and got my head blown off- They are so freaky without trying...

It's all great songwriting and lots of vibe- In your face r and r with an indie rock twist- really cool stuff :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Music tends to sound the same","review":"I actually started writing a feature review for this one, but after the first few songs I ran out of things to say. The Bangkok Five pride themselves on their indie rock DIY work ethic, which is good in some regards, but short-changes them in the production aspects of this album. Although the songs are catchy and have some killer hooks here and there (\\"Who's Gonna Take Us Alive\\" and \\"Giana\\"), the music tends to sound the same and gets a little boring at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is advertised","review":"I ordered the Sanyo VPC HD2, clearly described as an SD camecorder, including the correct picture.

I shipped it back, but they never credited me after they had received the item back. I had to dispute the charge via my credit card company. I did not try Amazon's A-Z guarantee.

Almost evrytime, after a while, I do see \\"System error\\" on the screen, and then the firmware is hung. After a power-cycle, the last recorded clip is gone! Some issues with the basics...so I called Sanyo service, they said this is happening because I'm using a 4GB plain SD card. Acc to the support guy, max of 2GB of plain SD is supported , for more GB, a SDHC card is needed. I could not find this info on the manual or spec...so I'm not sure how true is this. If anyone of you know about this , please let me know.Video is okay for my need...still is too bad.Firmware is just about average..not too great.

Yes I'm sure you will find a camcorder that records better HD footage than this but in all probability you may well be unlikely to have it with you when there's something to shoot! That's it's main plus point, it's size coupled with an entry level price! If you are after better quality then expect to pay a lot more. Once bought and docked into it's power/hdmi holster.. make sure you use the remote, if trying to playback whilst pressing the buttons on the camcorder can cause the sound to cut out, any small movement must cause a bad connection.... use the remote! Yes pleased with the still quality too and I don't have a problem with the quality of the video footage, for the most part and certainly for filming the kids / holidays etc, this is perfect.

Regardless of the specs, the wives don't lie - the picture quality just doesn't cut it. It's unacceptably noisey in all but the brightest of light and is an incremental improvement over my 6 year old Sony DVR. The product design is cool, the price is good, the SD card recording idea is perfect, but the HD promise doesn't come close to paying off.If you're looking for sharp, crystal clear images - you're just not going to be happy with this camera unless the gathering of technology and low price are enough to cause you to settle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice form - but definitely not great at any one thing.","review":"I had to double check the label as I was under the impression that this camera was an HD (720p) camera. Well I guess there are no requirements or guidelines for marketing a camera as HD. The first thing I did when I received this camera was shoot some HD footage and then watch it on my HD tv. Boy - was I surprised. The footage looked awful. To be honest I have seen regular cameras and even cell phones that could give the video feature a run for it money.The standard photos looked pretty good, but shutter lag was a pain. The only reason I rated this camera a 2 is that the form factor was great and it is a good idea. Needless to say this camera was returned the very next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE Item shipped is not the Sanyo Xacti VPC-HD2","review":"BEWARE - Item shipped does not match description.

I did some research on lasers of this rating. The highest value of a 473nm, <5mW Class IIIa Laser is no more than 300$ for the Finest of crafted quality by a legit Laser Production Company(with a warranty). There is no Excuse for 800$ and 100$ shipping. For this Price I would expect a Laser that could cut things with ease, something 5mW is not even close to doing. (Granted anything that powerful would not be sold to the public.) So Please viewers do not get fooled by this 900$ Laser. If you want fun look around at the 20-50$ Lasers. I bought some from HDE Storefront on Amazon a Violet and Green 30mW for like barely 15$ and they are Awesome!

(Regardless of how horrible the cover art was.) I should have paid a little more attention to who the executive producer of this effort was!! I couldn't believe the lack of sound quality and extremely slow tempo of most of the songs. Although there were a few sweet moments in both of the cd's, I just can't recommend to buy this.

Wait till you hear how Jerry and the band take the Stones' Lets Spend the Night Together and make it into a so-sweet love ballad! Price of admission is worth it right there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add on to the Amazon Review","review":"Clearly, the Amazon review is right on in the respect that this album seeks to pick up some of the \\"loose ends\\" of songs not picked up by other JGB releases of 1990's vintage.Still, even for the unfamilar, this album demonstates the critical element of a Jerry Garcia Band performance -- the phenomenon of taking a whole variety of material from pop rock to Motown to Soul and wrapping it all together with the Jerry Garcia signature.While this might sound trite, I think the performance of Let's Spend the Night Together, while not the outstanding track on the album, is a wonderful case in point. Garcia transforms the classic Stones tune of youthful, male seduction into a song of longing, loneliness and unrequited love. In the process, he puts a standard pop song into his slingshot and sends it to Jupiter.Really extraordinary stuff.Bart"},{"rating":"2","title":"stunning","review":"Five words: \\"Everybody Needs Somebody To Love.\\" I could go on about the hilights of this release for me, but music is a subjective experience, so everyone should find what they like best about this album.

Worth the price of admission. Jim Logan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shining Star indeed","review":"What a TERRIFIC addition to the Jerry catalog.

I found it not helpful at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven","review":"There are great songs here, but you're better off hearing the live versions on Songs In The Attic, or any of his other live discs. The problem here is the sound quality (probably of the original recordings) is very poor. Clearly, you can tell that great things were ahead for the relative unknown singer-songwriter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birthday present","review":"I bought this for my daughter for her birthday.The only song on this album worth listening to is piano man....I recommend a greatest hits album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We were very disappointed with the quality of the \\"supposed\\" surround sound. Our MDX did great with the Beatles \\"Love\\" but this sounded flat and no different than the radio. It was truly a big waste of our money."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst of his studio albums","review":"This lacks the raw emotional punch of 'Cold Spring Harbor' and it's certainly not as good as the albums he wrote afterwards. The title track is on every compilation and the three other best songs here are on the must-own live album 'Songs in the Attic' in highly improved versions. This album is mostly obsolete. However, 'If I only had the Words' and 'Travelin Prayer' aren't bad. They are the only reasons to buy this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most underrated song is found on \\"Piano Man\\"","review":"What is all this talk about \\"Ain't No Crime\\" being a weak song? It's my favorite Billy Joel song ever! And I've never heard it on the radio. No one ever talks about it, though I might mention that I haven't read too far in these reviews. I have to say that I think it runs circles around \\"Travelin' Prayer,\\" \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" (with all that Elmer Bernstein western hokum) and \\"You're My Home.\\" The back-up singers are on fire, the energy is fantastic, the song simply rules!"},{"rating":"2","title":"forgot how good this cd was!","review":"It's been years since I had heard this cd- album. And I had forgot most of the songs. Well it will go back into the lineup again. Billy sure can play a piano! You forget these things as life takes you forward into other relms,as you get on with the daily grind. It's good to know somethings remain the same. Thanks amazon for great deals on music as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Landmark album for Billy Joel","review":"Captures the essence of Joel's everyman, modest non-comformity, and emotional intimacy that would be the hallmark's of Joel's career. Many have criticized Joel for not having a more creative musical vision, but the arrangements and instrumental diversity on this album are outstanding. Joel has a tremendous talent at seizing an audience's attention and tapping into their soul. His songwriting, lyrics, piano virtuosity, and honesty have made him an american and world treasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"Mofi needs to sharpen up their act. Many of the latest releases sound a bit lifeless and do not sound better than the original remaster from Sony(and others). This mofi sounds a bit veiled compared to the Sony remaster. Why pay USD 30 then? Similar to mofi Stevie Ray Vaughan-Texas Flood, which is very very disapointing. On B. Joel-Turnstilles, mofi didn't even bother to print lyrics, and no info in general. Why? When record companys release remasters these gays, you get bonus cuts, extencive booklets, etc. Not so with mofi. What a shame and letdown for us consumers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather disapointing","review":"I bought this cd soley for the title song, Piano Man, which I think is absolutely fantastic. However, I was very disapointed with the rest of this cd. I've listened to it a hundred times, but I just can't get into any of the songs except Piano Man. I wasn't impressed by the rest of the selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Destined Genius!","review":"I am a huge Billy Joel fan, but the only songs I had already heard from this album were \\"Piano Man\\" and \\"Captain Jack.\\" But now I've heard them all. Billy's piano playing on this album is absolutely phenomenal! An inspiration to piano players like myself. And as usual the songs are catchy and memorable. Thank you Billy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Joel's First BIG Masterpiece!","review":"This limited edition of the classic Billy Joel album is not to be missed, even by a casual fan. Mobile Fidelity has taken the original analog master tapes and reconstructed the sound quality that rivals the best vinyl (note that this album is also available in 180 gram vinyl now). Always speaking to the middle-class heroes, Joel's 1973 release was an instant hit and the start of an amazing career. How many people memorized the lyrics to \\"Piano Man\\" or the hilariously, bittersweet song that is \\"Captain Jack\\". In fact the latter song makes a rousing anthemic closing song. Nearly all the songs on this album are pop classics.Note that this SACD is not multi-channel, but stereo. Oh but what a great, clean, crisp, well-rounded sound it has. SACD releases like this do not last and end up in the hundreds of dollars when out of print. But this version is a real keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piano Man","review":"Typical Billy Joel easy to listen to ballads and some rocking songs as well. Well recorded. Nice discount on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible version of a Great Album","review":"Just walk away from it unless you can get an original vinyl or a decent CD. The mastering is horrible on this version. I have the original vinyl, but it's really seen better days so I thought I'd get a \\"cleaner\\" version.Wow, was that a mistake! The original vinyl, scratches and all, is far superior to this copy of a copy of a copy. The songs have been transferred either too fast or too slow. At first I thought it was my hearing, but when I compared the original to the new one I could definitely hear the difference. Very disappointed in this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital mistake","review":"I was thrilled when I saw that Piano Man was re-released on SACD. I could finally enjoy one of my favorite albums in Hi Rez with jet black backgrounds and explosive dynamic range.Wrong!!!!The album sounds like somebody threw a pillow over the microphone. The background isn't silent, it's muffled. The highs don't soar - like they should - they are dead and gone.My old 1998 Columbia version is clearly better for an audiophile. I had to check to make sure I didn't get the discs mixed up.This disc sounds just as bad through my Sennheiser HD800 headphones as my Bosendorfer speakers.On the other hand - the Animals Retrospective SACD album is a treasure if you're looking for a place to spend your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A couple of essential hits among many entertaining songs","review":"Billy JoelPiano ManThis album has the great title track and \\"Captain Jack\\".

Even though I prefer 52nd St to this, this would be my second favorite Joel album then after that would have to be the off the wall and strange Nylon Curtain. This is a must have for every Billy Joel fan. Don't be surpried that you acutally might like the rest of the songs then \\"Piano Man\\" cause I think Travelin Prayer and Stop in Nevada and Your my Home are much better..ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Billy's Best","review":"Billy Joel has made many great albums, but this one is possibly his best. \\"Piano Man,\\" \\"Captain Jack,\\" and \\"The Ballad of Billy the Kid\\" are some of the best songs ever written. The LP also has many fan favorites such as \\"Somewhere along the Line,\\" and \\"You're My Home.\\" The album has a great flow to it from start to finish, and has some of the best piano playing I've ever heard. Everyone needs to have this album, simply because every song on it is good. In my opinion, this is the best album ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad song on this album","review":"This is one of those rare albums where every song on it I would consider either great or near-great. Standouts are of course the title track, as well as \\"Captain Jack\\" and \\"If I Only Had The Words\\"(which at some future date will be remade into a #1 hit by Mariah Carey or like diva). This was gritty Joel, angry Joel, the Joel who would continue to make great records thru 1982's \\"The Nylon Curtain\\". It was at this point that Joel began his transformation from rocker to safe-as-milk, lightweight pop crooner, a la Rod Stewart and Elton John. But despite the fact that it might not be \\"hip\\" to listen to Joel today, \\"Piano Man\\" stands out as one of 1974's truly great rock albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Piano Man is the best song ever","review":"I just love this!!!!! Especially Piano Man. That is the most touching song ever, and every time I hear it I just cry. There are so many memories attached to that wonderful song. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice but not great","review":"When I saw this album being released on sacd I had high hopes (like the stranger sacd 5.1). this transfer is the best of piano man by far but why isn't there a 5.1 version?? The stranger sounded so great in 5.1 and I wanted so much the same for piano man. In any event the 2ch sacd version does sound the best that you will get, as of this date, for this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm with the 4 stars on this one","review":"It's Billy Joel, great music, but thought the SACD could have been better.Found the Turnstiles SACD worth a 5 star rating.If you can find \\"The Stranger\\" in 5.1, that's the best SACD out there of Billy Joel'sThey need to do more multichannel versions, his music is definitely worth the effort"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Billy Joel Sound","review":"This SACD release of Billy Joel's Piano Man is unusual in that it sounds EXACTLY like its 1970's vintage vinyl counterpart. If you were blindfolded, I don't think you'd be able to tell the two apart. So this is good, right? Well, in this case, not really, because this particular album has a somewhat soft, chocolatey, non-dynamic sound that could probably have benefitted from a remaster using the original session tapes. But that's not the concept, I suppose, of this \\"original master recording\\" series, so I guess I can't complain. Overall, the sound is very smooth and natural, particularly vocals, and much more reminiscent of vinyl than standard CD. If you're lucky enough to have the original album (in good condition) and a high quality turntable, there's no need to purchase this SACD. If not, buy this version and enjoy some vintage Billy J., complete with vintage sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your time or money","review":"I didnt even have enough patience to put this toy together.my husband and 11 year old sent many hours putting it together. my son who is 3 could have cared less about the thing,his cousin however managed to have it disassembled in a matter of minutes.The only reason I spent so much money on this toy(we evan bought the plane,baggage carrier,and taxi)was becase when researching toys I read good reviews about playmobil toys,but in my opinion dont bother,my son has much more fun with a bucket of legos."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good dvd","review":"very good dvd, i enjoyed mick introducing the spots, giving back story, and re-watching some classic matches. personal favorite is the falls count anywhere match with sting. as for the douche bag who wrote the comment about mick foley not being a wrestler, that's not what a review is for, moron. in defense of mick, his wrestling made more sense then others, he worked stiff, and he entertained...and that's what wrestling is supposed to be about."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hardcore legend Mick Foley!","review":"Cactus Jack vs Vadermatch rating: 8/10Falls count any were match Cactus Jack and Max Payne vs the Nasty Boysmatch rating: 10/10Cactus Jack vs Sabumatch rating: 5/10Cactus Jack vs Chris Candidomatch rating: 4/10Cactus Jack vs The Sandmanmatch rating: 6/10Cactus Jack and Raven vs Terry Funk and Tommy Dreamermatch rating: 10/10Cactus Jack vs Mikey Whipwreckmatch rating: 8/10Mankind vs HBKmatch rating: 10/10Falls count any were match Cactus Jack vs HHHmatch rating: 9/10Falls count any were match Cactus Jack vs Terry Funkmatch rating: 7/10Dude Love vs Stone Cold Steve Austinmatch rating: 10/10Hell in a cell match Mankind vs The Undertakermatch rating: 10/10Mankind vs The Rockmatch rating: 8/10Street Fight Cactus Jack vs HHHmatch rating: 10/10"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD, Except for one Thing","review":"This a good dvd that covers his WCW, ECW, SMW, and WWE days. The only problem that I see with the DVD is the Mick Foley matches from 1998-2000. Which is part of the WWF Attitude era. The WWF logo is smugged out on everything you can think of: Turnbuckles, banners, ring apprains, t-shirts etc... This is pretty annoying and I don't care how diehard of a fan you are because it is an eye sore. I have to tell like it is just like Jesse Ventura. If I was Vince, I would resolve the problem right away with the World Wildlife Foundation because if not fans are just going to buy WWE bootleg dvd's. Which will hurt the company's bottomline. I just don't see people paying $20 to $30 for this shotty production everytime. \\"Monday Night Wars\\" and Kurt Angle are the next future WWE DVD releases. I tell you people something, I'm sorry to say this but I'm not that excited it about it. I hope my review helps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dvd for A Great Wrestler","review":"I got this as a gift the toher day. I actually watched it all already. Those shots by Vader to Foley's head were brutal. You see them connect unlike a lot of other wrestler's punches in the business. Sabu and Foley: If you see these two names in one match you know it will be crazy.Foley in my opinion had his best matches in his career against Undertaker, Terry Funk, and Stone Cold. All of which you can see on this dvd. Every match has it's share of brutality in it. It's amazing that Foely is actually walking today. He gives you insight on each match before and after that match happens. So get this dvd NOW!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Add it to your collection!","review":"This DVD isn't as good as the Shawn Michaels or Ric Flair collection, but it is still well worth adding to your wrestling archives. This DVD includes the infamous fall from the Hell in a Cell match vs. Undertaker and a lot of classic ECW stuff from the career of Cactus Jack. Mick introduces each match and gives some insight and background on them. The extras are also pretty good even though Mick was never a truly great interview, even though he apparently thinks that he was. Don't get me wrong, I'm a Mick fan and I think he is the classic example of an overachiever in the sport? of pro wrestling. He gave good interviews, but he never approached the great ones like Ric Flair, Dusty Rhodes, Roddy Piper, etc. Anyway this is a good DVD if you are a wrestling fan and well worth adding to your collection. But get the Michaels and Flair DVD's first... they are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A diverse selection of matches and Foley doing intro","review":"This review is for the 2-disc version without the 'hardcore edition' label in front. First off I found this set to be a pleasant surprise. Instead of having the usual one hour biography segment, Mick Foley does a short in-studio intro before every match.I found Mick to be candid and pleasant. He gave some interesting anecdotes and it was nice to see his everyday persona(as opposed to his wrestling characters). On a couple of the ECW matches, he also does commentary with 'the Coach'.The matches included was diverse and gave a nice sampling of Foley's body of work(ECW,WCW,WWF). Also included are his promo spots/interviews over the years with his many different personas. I found out later that there was a newer 'Hardcore Edition' with his WWE matches(I've never seen these). I recommend this newer edition(with 3-disc)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reviewing the Shawn Micheals bout. *SPOILERS AHEAD* (possible)","review":"MATCH ONE: Shawn Micheals vs MankindAbsolutley sensational match. Perfect, perfect, perfect. Great areal stunts by both men. At one point they both land on a table outside of the ring. Makes a loud crash. Another intense moment was when Micheals does an impressive superkick from the steel chair to Mankind while on the top turnbuckle! Then you'll see a wicked piledriver from Mankind on the center of the ring. Awsomeley performed and great psychology means this match gets an \\"A\\" Well done, Mick.Every other match was great.

Camelot was an excellent musical, a classic of the early sixties, but the cast album was even better. They kept in songs on the album that were actually cut from the stage production, Fie On Goodness, and Take Me To The Fair, and with good reason, they actually stopped the show, not enhancing character or plot at all, and added to the shows running time of over 4 hrs. Wisely excised, but thankfully preserved on the album.The performances are now legendery, Richard Burton's only, and magnificent, musical, Julie Andrews sublime as Guenevere, and Robert Goulet's definitive version of If Ever I Would Leave You. The orchestrations are thrilling, the overture causes goose bumps, the rest of the album is on the same level. A must have for any musical theater fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Camelot- Original Broadway Cast recording","review":"Well, as an avid Julie Andrews fan, I can not remain completely unbiased. I love the CD, and the performances are certainly worth the price. This is a real treasure, and every song is done beautifully. I particularly like \\"If Ever I Would Leave You.\\" Love songs just aren't done that well anymore. Also, every track by JA is exceptional, those songs alone are enough to purchase the CD. I highly reccomend it for anyone who loves Broadway or simply enjoys a good story, because the songs alone tell a wonderful tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"For one brief shining moment","review":"Richard Burton, Julie Andrews, Robert Goulet.... who could ask for more? This CD is a must for the musical lover. To have seen the original broadway show must have been magical.... now lost in time - with only \\"performances\\" on the Ed Sullivan show and stills to taunt us with what we missed. However, if you close your eyes while listening to this high quality CD, you come pretty close to being there. Though Julie's voice seems at times perhaps too perfect or angelic to be the passionate Guinevere, I imagine that she must have pulled it off well. In any case, she's a joy to listen to. What a pity this cast didn't take the show to the silver screen! For the musical history buff, Julie Andrews fan, Goulet or Burton fan, this is a must. Excellent little history of the production pamphlet too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tremendous Voice and Album","review":"This is a flawless album sung by a man with a flawless voice.

This is one of the very few videos of him in action(Mr. Copeland died in 1997.). It might be the only one because I have not seen any others for sale.Copeland and a few others like him(e.g., Otis Rush) changed the way electric blues guitars were played long before SRV had even picked up a guitar for the first time. What we get from SRV is due in no little part to people like Copeland. Copeland had already been playing and recording for thirty years before he went onstage at Montreaux with SRV and coincidentally, perhaps, it was only in the 80's that Johnny Copeland began getting the recognition he so deeply deserved.Definitely worth 10 or 15 buck$..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!

I discovered the two Dragonsinger books (Dragonsong and Dragonsinger) in the local library while I was recovering from a work injury and devoured them both in 48 hours.I bought both in paperback many years ago, and they are yellow with age but still get re-read every couple of years. When I need something I know will give me a lift I reach for this book. Now have purchased it again as a Kindle book.This is about a young and gifted girl hoping to attain her dream. I have just re-read it (probably for the tenth time)in my 50s and still finished it with tears in my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Think Harry Potter but without Voldemort","review":"Okay, I admit this one isn't quite as good asDragonsong (Harper Hall Trilogy, Book 1), but then, what is? If I were to give Dragonsinger a grade, it'd be an A-. Not perfect, but close.Menolly's adventures continue, this time among people who appreciate her talents... only some folks resent her because of her talents and because she's a girl. It all takes place at what amounts to a prep school as she learns to develop and use her talents. Think Harry Potter going to Hogwarts, only without the overarching menance of Voldemort... and with music instead of magic... plus a bunch of mini-dragons and a few big ones. Menolly only has to worry about her classmates. And teachers. And her dorm mother. And her dorm mates. And... you get the idea.As with the previous book, it's a simple story beautifully executed. And it too kept me up until 2 am."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good YA book","review":"\\"Dragonsinger\\" picks up pretty much immediately after the end of \\"Dragonsong\\", with Menolly's arrival at Harper Hall. This story covers her settling into the Hall and starting on the path to being a Harper.Over all I enjoyed the story told in this book. It was fun seeing Menolly meet all the different teachers at the Hall and otherwise adjust to life outside of the Seahold.The biggest problem that I had with this book is that the plot and characters are a bit simplistic. However, keeping in mind that this book was written for young adults and not for actual adults, I don't hold this against the book.Certainly a good book for lover's of Pern who want all the stories they can, and for young adults looking for something good to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dragons!","review":"The harper Hall Trilogy is my favorite set by McCaffrey and interestingly the first books I read by her. I love dragons and there for dragon stories, particularly ones were dragons are not mindless monsters of destruction, so it would be odd for me not to like these books. The story is very original and the characters well written. If your not sure of getting into the Pern books, this is the series to read! Dragonsinger is a really strong book, despite being in the middle of a set. The story keeps going strong and the characters stay true to themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly my favorite novel by Anne McCaffrey","review":"I've read this book many times. It's a lot more lighthearted than Dragonsong. At times, Menolly might be a little aggravating because she seems to care a little too much what others think of her, but then she has enough backbone to stick up for herself when one or two petty characters try to take her down. Most readers are going to know that she'll succeed in the end and become a harper, so I don't think I'm spoiling anything by stating that. The novel is more about finding out what happens to Menolly during her first crucial week at the Harpercraft Hall and how she wins powerful people to her side with her unassuming personality.This is a great book about one of the more influential characters in the Dragonriders of Pern series. Dragonsong and Dragonsinger are also great books for pre-teens and are short enough to be accessible for children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pern; the world I wish I lived on!","review":"This is my personal favorite of the Harper Hall Trilogy, but anything by McCaffrey is exellent. I can understand how Menolly feels and how much she loves music. Great story line and I enjoy it no matter how many times I have read it(Which is at least five) I would recomend this to anyone with a taste for fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a must read.","review":"I was introduced into Anne McCaffrey by my older sister (thanks a bunch Dana!) She told me about DRAGONSONG and suggested that I read it. I read it and instantly I was a Anne McCaffrey fan. I went on to read DRAGONSINGER and DRAGONDRUMS. But out of all three, DRAGONSINGER was the best. I've read the book over and over. A corner of the cover is torn off and the pages, well, you can tell this book has been read a lot. My only complaints:What about some of her old friends like Audiva, what happens to her? And the last complaint: Anne McCaffrey needs to write more about Menolly in later years. To all those people who think Anne McCaffrey's a bad writer-oh, never mind! I don't wanna even think about those people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book about saving student potential from being lost","review":"This is the best of Ms. McCaffrey's books. The biggest waste is the waste of human minds. Good metoring is essential to develop students' potential to the fullest. Most students, lacking such mentoring, eventually become discouraged and never discover their own abilities. This book is about the joy of the relationship between a talented student (Menolly) and a caring teacher (Robinton). Forget Pern, forget dragons and fire lizards - this is a rare tribute to the profession of teaching and to the fostering of young talent. A truly joyous and inspiring book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Menolly's arrival at Harper Hall leaves her overwhelmed.","review":"How did Menolly become a Journeywoman so close to Master Robinton?

Veri fun 2 read from start to end"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Book of All Time?","review":"This is quite possibly my favorite book from my favorite author. As a teen I read Dragon Song and Dragon Singer and came as close as anyone can to falling in love with a character in a book. Anne puts more real emotions and situations into her science fiction novels than most writers of \\"reality based\\" fiction ever could. I do not know how anyone could read this book and not feel that Menolly and Robington and their fire lizards must exist in some plane of existance and that Anne is merely conveying their very real story. If Frank L. Baum declared himself the royal historian of Oz, then Anne to has claimed that position for an equally fantastic, and yet real place; Pern."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once you read this one, you'll want to read the whole series","review":"Achieves the perfect balance between fantasy and reality.

And, surprise surprise, the political stance is that \\"War is bad\\" -- and the moral: \\"The establishment can't be trusted.\\" No bravery here. No reason ever to revisit this, either.

It is such a sweet and romantic story (really 2 stories). I won't give away too much by saying the story is about a pediatrician, also a single parent, who adopts newborn triplets, all boys. The romance that begins is quite unexpected to \\"Doc\\" and is really a lovely story. Risa's (Doc) obvious love for children in her professional life as a pediatrician and in her personal life is very compelling. Although she will take a long leave of absence to care for her babies, she is already feeling the pull of a working mother while hoping there will be enough time for a relationship which is still very new. I wanted the story to go on much longer. I can't wait for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Romp of a Good Read","review":"Prince of Frogs is a fun, funny, sweet story of a modern woman on the verge of having her every wish fulfilled, of having it all, and yet whose romanctic hook-up is maddeningly illusive.

Join this crew for a bumpy leap-frog romp through the perils of modern dating, California style. It's an entertaining whirl of a read you won't soon forget."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check it out from the library","review":"The story line had potential, and the characters were well-written and likeable. My main problem was the dialogue between the adults; it was so jerky and awkward. They supposedly flirt with innuendos and what-not, but I completely missed it. Were these lines deleted? I found myself often saying, \\"huh?\\" and having to re-read several scenes. Risa, the main female protagonist, had a best friend whose husband was unfaithful. Right away, after being \\"broken-hearted,\\" she jumps right into the sack with some other guy. And I mean right away, as in the next day. These characters had so much potential being that they sounded funny and likeable, but the writing didn't flow at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book was not at all what I was expecting and not in the good way. There were certain parts of the book that just didn't make any sense and didn't have any fluidity. At times it seems as if the author knew where she was going but didn't display that to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good premise, poor editing","review":"I had a hard time finishing this book even though I found the characters enjoyable and the overall premise engaging. I can't help but think this book could have been many times better had the author's editor had a firm hand in ensuring the dialog flowed from one paragraph to the next. I was constantly going back to read previous paragraphs and pages to see if I missed something (nope!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Here's another one I don't get","review":"This is going to be a fun farce. That's what I was thinking I'd get with this book. Not even close. I like the heroine. I liked the hero. There was some possibility of chemistry. There really was. And then it started unraveling. I couldn't believe the strange, odd, unbelievably juvenile scenes and reactions and dialogue. I didn't make it past chapter 5. And I was forcing myself to get that far. I'm sorry. I don't know what happens. I don't care. If there was a half a star, I'd give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't want to hurt the author's feelings...","review":"Because I gather this is a first book. But the dialog in this book was weak, the humor adolescent, and the characters very similar. You know it's a bad sign when the author needs to tell you when the character is telling a joke. It's even worse when the author does it over and over, and you're not laughing. The jokes were mostly puns and cliches (on the level of \\"don't assume, it makes an...\\" come on!), and self-conscious \\"bedroom\\" talk, where the characters literally get embarrassed for using the word \\"bed\\" in mixed company. No, I'm not kidding. This is a contemporary romance about a divorcee and a widower! That said, the clean prose and light-hearted tone saved the book from getting 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ughhhh","review":"Let me start by saying, the characters were believable and lovable. The story line was good and a little unbelievable. The part that irks me is the actual writing (and I don't know if I should blame this on myself, for only reading after a long day-with my mind not always into it, but.....); in one area Ben's having Molly straight out of college-that puts him at 26 (at best), but he started college at 16, so maybe he's only 20 now? In all other areas, it's implied that he's in his late 30s/early 40s, welllll which is it? In other parts, we just jumped into things, I kept asking myself \\"how'd that happen?\\" \\"where did that come from?\\". And I'd reread the last page to try and make it make sense, and sure enough-there is no explanation! Even with a good story line, only sheer determination got me to finish this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUCH more than a romance!","review":"A quick, engaging read! It's definitely a romance novel - filled with sexual tensions and innuendos, but even most of that is in fun, verbal banter...More importantly, there are SO MANY REAL-LIFE THEMES running through the book at the same time:* wanting more time with significant others,* wanting more time for our kids,* professionals (men and women) and their conflict to achieve at work and be supportive at home, and* the ever-present need for good friends to confide in!I introduced this book at a women's discussion group (where we're mostly in our 30's and 40's), and we spent the majority of the time talking about these vital issues that hit so close to home for all of us!Don't let the pink cover and the romance packaging fool you, this fun book offers lots for thinking women to mull over, too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad","review":"It looks pretty and nice but it was defective .The lead does not come out and for the expensive price it has !!!!pay 20 dollars to buy a defective item .It makes you think are these online sellers trying to sell an item or trying to get rid of defective products!!!! it seems like no one checks on them .Very nice pencil but did not work even for a day .just a waste of money .WHen it arrived there was a lot of dust on the box that had not been removed before putting in the box also."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked great!","review":"You just have to make sure you select the size of the bottle, then hit the \\"on\\" button(It says to do this right on the adapter).

My wife and I were out about over the holidays doing some shopping, and our daughter got hungry while we were on the road, we attempted to use this thing to heat 4 ounces of milk in a glass bottle, that had been in the diaper bag freezer pouch for at least an hour, and 20 minutes after my daughter screaming in absolutely agony from hunger pains, the bottle was lukewarm, while the warmer itself was impossible to hold because it was so hot.

We tried it in both of our cars, and followed the instructions exactly - by pushing both buttons. I only give it one star because zero wasn't an option.

Otherwise spend the money to get real bocce balls. These are made from a soft plastic so they don't knock each other around like they should, they just sort of bump. They are water filled and vary from 100% full to half full. So they don't weigh the same or behave the same. That makes it impossible to be consistent.Completely worthless junk unless, like I said, you need to keep some kids busy. In that case they are very inexpensive fun crap.

The author seems to emphasize his career and studies more than keeping the reader engaged in his book.

It covers mostly the second, but it has some history of the first. Out of the entire book, only about 1/3 is history. The rest is the modern organization, weapons, training, people and duties of the last remaining parachute regiment. The author writes well, and much of the book he describes a personal trip he took to Calvi, Corsica to interview, observe, and interact with the legionnaires of the 2eme REP. This book also covers much of the Legion in general, so this book is off all prospective recruits.

It makes for easy reading, that is hard to put down till the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all entertaining","review":"I was not at all entertained by this book. I have read several books on the French Foreign Legion and this one was probably the most boring; in fact, it was text-book-boring.

Once this is ripped open and the case is unzipped, the buyer is surprised to find that the balls - every single one of them - are marred in one way or another.

The Philips is much lighter and seems of poorer quality than the Durabrand. The sound comparison is incredible! The difference in quality from Durabrand to Philips was hands down in favor of Durabrand! The Philips sound is tinny and gives terrible static noise. The controls for Stop, On/Off, and Volume on the Philips were all poorly located and difficult to find and operate. I would not recommend the Philips and that surprises me.

We chose this one because it is able to play Divx files stored on SD cards in addition to DVDs. It would have been more convenient if it had a USB port, but it works quite well from the SD card. The screen is clear and bright, and the DVD player functions perfectly without skipping even when strapped to our rocky elliptical trainer.If you do intend to play digital files using the SD slot, do note that it will NOT play SDHC (high capacity) cards. We were able to find a couple of 4gb non-HC cards, but they are somewhat rare. It's unfortunate, because all of the newer, larger cards will be SDHC, so stock up while you can.We purchased this player for $129.In summary...Pros:Plays Divx filesSD slotGood volumenice screenCons:No USB portDoes not accept SDHCiPod Touch does not fit in iPod port"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like other negative reviewers, mine broke within a year","review":"I bought this one to replace a Cyberhome 7\\" portable.

More precisely, it defines \\"serious\\" Wicca as the traditions, rituals, and beliefs made up by a coven (as opposed to solitary practitioners), which is then forced upon any who wish to join the coven. The greatest part of this book is spent building and reiterating this theme, with a few chapters in the back devoted to a cursory discussion of rituals, Sabbats, gods/goddesses, etc. With so many excellent beginning Wicca books on the market, new practitioners should not waste their money on The Heart of Wicca. Those of us who have been around longer will not pick up new insights here, and will have long since made up our minds as to what constitutes serious Wiccan practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not my cup of tea","review":"I was not impressed w/this book. Someone else had mentioned that it was preachy and I have to agree. But I'm going to take it one step further and say that I felt it was slightly condescending. Being that she claims she's a crone, I have to assume she's older and I got the \\"I've been around longer and know more about this stuff than you young whipper snappers\\" feeling from her writing. I was hoping to find something that would tell me something new, but not in this book.

The music moves you, draws you in and, with the images in the film, opens your mind.

This flaw in the plating seems to be causing rust spots on my blades. It is frustrating because the flaw is due to faulty workmanship - exterior surfaces on this razor are polished to a shine before plating, however the inside of the razor was not polished to a shine before plating. This is likely the cause of the plating flaw.This makes me hesitant to buy another Merkur because:1) I need to ship to Germany for a warranty claim - an extended period of time without my razor2) I read recently on Badger and Blade that people are having trouble with Merkur warranty claims since Merkur won't cover corrosion and plating flaws"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bon Appetie","review":"How can we not be satisfied with Julia Child,I learn so much with her and still do, with her books and video it is so easy to do what she took so much time to teach us.She is unique."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am glad to hear this worked for other people...","review":"...but black lint/particles were coming off of the product that I received, so I stopped using it and eventually threw it away.

So Ken Russell meets musical theater? How wonderful! NOT.First of all, it's dull. I kept waiting for it to pull me in with something: the story, the musical numbers, the dancing, a fun twist, given that this is Ken Russell...but it seems like just so much bad vaudeville. I enjoyed Glenda Jackson's cameos - she fully embodies the character in her scene with Twiggy.Some of the old musicals were really just an excuse for wonderful numbers - and you tolerated the boring parts waiting for the brilliance of, say, Fred Astaire and Eleanor Powell tapping to Begin the Beguine in the otherwise forgettable Broadway Melody of 1940.

Unlistenable. The high-end sounds--especially the open hi-hat--sound as tinny as a low-grade mp3. Needles in my ears. The mix--and I'm assuming this problem originated with the LP's release--is insane. The drums are barely audible. Complex, layered rhythms are buried beneath sludgy, grubby mid and low-end registers. The entire disc is, without exception, utterly unlistenable.It's frustrating, too, because the music itself is brilliant.

My son likes the camera, so I'm not going to complain. If it was for me, though, I'd send it back in a heartbeat, just because of the misleading ad. The sound quality (when files are moved to the computer) is pretty good. The software for transferring the files to the computer is glitchy at best. Sometimes it works, but most of the time it loads and says that there's no camera connected. Funny thing is, windows explorer has no problem seeing it (and what caused the program to auto-launch in the first place?) and moving the files. I went to the manufacturer's website and found the software and drivers had not been updated since 2003. To be honest I am very disappointed, even at the price I paid.

The software are not required to use with this device...if you want to compare this with other competitors software such as kodak's or HP's, you're wasting your time - they are not necessary for the camera to work. The mp3 ability is nice, the placement of the speakers in the front while recording, the ability to zoom while taking a video, all in all this was a great buy for the price.

The digital stills are usable, and if you have photoshop, the quality really doesn't matter anyways. As a college student, I find that the voice recorder is great on days when you don't really feel like listening, and the mp3 player makes walking to class a little easier. The only real downside is that the audio quality when recording video is not that spectacular, a mic input would be the only thing I would add to this little wonder.

When I'm done I can just slip the camcorder into my shirt pocket.

It offers a lot of bells and whistles for features but the output quality of both still and movie films is unacceptable. It is very convenient to use but again the picture quality is not even close to other 4.0 megapixel cameras. The movie pictures move with the grace of pictures you've seen shot from another planet, i.e., choppy and slow. Many of the still pictures are grainy.

The only problem I had was my own fault because I didn't let the hose warm up before installing it and it was still a little curly from being wound up, but it flattened out when we had a warm spell. I didn't put the hose piece on the end by the garage door because the drainage is good there and it's easier to drive over without it. It's also much easier to sweep it off when needed without the hose there. It's slippery if it's wet when you get out of the car, but not nearly as bad as having the whole floor wet I no longer have a big wet, slippery spot in front of my steps!

I've got an old Pentax 135mm f2.5 that I couldn't stand to give up; it clicks right on my *ist DL and takes beautiful pictures. The kit 18-55 is not bad at all.

You will find yourself spending way too much time fussing with it while you are trying to drive.In addition, the design is AWFUL. It pivots around on the headphone jack and does not stay stable at all. In addition, the on/off button is placed in such a way that you can virtually guarantee that you will accidentally turn it on if you put this in a pocket, briefcase, backpack.

It has her usual psycological insight into her characters, which are very well-developed, not just \\"stock\\" characters. The entire book takes place in just a few weeks, but with deft storytelling that spans an array of events. The main character is Jim, who is a selfless, devoted family man, and his beautiful, self-centered wife, Stella. Stella's greedy, overbearing mother figures strongly in their lives (more than either one realizes). The story slowly builds steam by paying attention to character, detail, and pacing, and sets in motion a domino of events which results in a suprising ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walk Into My Parlour by Norah Lofts","review":"Description from the book back cover:Jim and Stella both came from Shore Street, but Jim's mother,ambitious for her only son, had refused to allow him to mixwith the Bridie brood. Through his mother's efforts, and hisown, Jim graduated into the white-collar class. Then he metStella again - Stella grown-up, vain, selfish and incrediblybeautiful. When she accepted his proposal of marriage hecouldn't beleive his luck, and it was quite a while beforeJim realised that life with Stella wasn't quite the paradisehe had envisaged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy and helpful","review":"This book helped me answer many questions that I had or someone asked me about my Christian faith. It is not easy to find someone around me who can answer these questions that are addressed in this book in the same contexts as the question itself, scientific or philosophic. The answers that are given are brief and sufficient to any sincere truth seeking person. I always get careful about who the writer is so that that whether I can trust his analysis of a subject on Christian faith or not, and I was happy to know about Norman Geisler through the book \\"I Don't Have Enough Faith to Be an Atheist\\" who gained my trust and he in turn lead me to many other truthful writers like the coeditor of this book Ravi Zacharias."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another useful book by Ravi Zacharias","review":"This book has been helpful in guiding my direction with helping children with tough questions.

If I were wavering between Christianity and another religion, I'd lose even more faith in Christianity after reading it, because of how Christianity is presented and the author's uneven treatment of other faiths and beliefs versus Christianity. It's a shame that it's not well written as the topic is fascinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evangelical Christian view ONLY","review":"I wish some other reviewer or the synopsis had warned me of the narrow and excluding point of view of most of this book. It is no excuse saying the reader is supposed to assume this point of view since this is a book of apologetics, I happen to enjoy C.S.Lewis very much without having to agree with every word of the Bible or all the tenets of a specific branch of a Christian church.In my opinion this book teaches christians to look down on all other faiths in spite of professing to respect them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic introduction to apologetics","review":"As other reviewers have stated, this is a basic introduction to Christian apologetics. It is not, and is not intended to be, the primary source foranswers to problem areas confronting believers when dealing with skeptics.However, I found it to be a good, basic resource for many of the common questions asked by skeptics and seekers. As other reviewers have stated, the footnotesthemselves are a valuable resource by themselves for further study.If you are looking for a detailed, comprehensive textbook in Christian apologetics, this book is not it.

I would have to categorize it as a \\"nice try\\". It definitely has a visual style and a kind of ominous undertone but the weakness of the script hurts it immeasurably. The characters are one dimensional and hollow and their actions have no basis in reality. It seems to be merely an excercise in style.

These reviews all sound like they came right out of a press release."},{"rating":"1","title":"the wind BLOWS","review":"This is quite possibly the worst film. Ever. The acting was dramatically chiche and just plain BAD. The director was attempting artful Quentin Tarantino-like shots, but completely missed. And the soundtrack? I think it happened like this: \\"Hey guys, I have a friend who has this keyboard and he could totally score this movie if we gave him 15 bucks.\\"And the whole, \\"If you don't like The Wind, you totally don't get it\\" thing doesn't hold water. The script is completely unengaging besides the fact that it doesn't even much sense. So, if you like, rent or buy this movie if you don't mind paying good $$ to waste 2 hours of your life that you will never get back."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS WIND BLOWS","review":"To get to the point, THE WIND is just that---a big gust of emptiness, illogical writing, inept acting and imaginative but uninspired direction. After starting off with the apocalyptic wrath of the wind, the movie shows us typical teenage stereotypes doing typically stereotypical things. A real waste of time and/or money. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthy of NO stars","review":"Words that describe this movie: amateurish, boring, dull, ridiculous, pointless, poor dialogue, etc. Eventually I wondered why I was wasting so much time watching, so I started fast forwarding though it. Then even THAT was sucking up too much of my life, so I stopped watching. Don't waste your time or money on this one. High school drama students could have done a better job. And it's obvious that those earlier reviews, which all praised the movie and were spaced within a few days of each other, were planted. A movie worth watching does not need people posting false reviews to get others to watch or buy or rent it. A movie worth watching will stand on its own, which this movie does not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiot Wind","review":"This is the single-worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of watching. It is not horrifying, it is not compelling. It is not intelligent. I find it very hard to believe that the good reviews are legitimate. The movie stars out with an interesting introduction, and then turns into a high-school-film-class quality production. there is no story to speak of, the acting was bad, the directing was bad, the editing was terrible. Certain scenes were remarkably drawn out into unbearable torture (the scene with the female character loping gaily through a field, for example). Yeah, I \\"get\\" the point of the movie. You don't have to be an Einstein to figure out that Mongillo was aiming toward some kind of Lord of the Flies psyche piece, but it fails miserably.I will now risk being cliched and say, \\"The Wind Blows!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Great directing, satisfactory acting, bad story/script","review":"We watched it, all felt the same. Great directing, cinematography, excellent visual quality, lots of style, audio quality, editing, enjoyable score. Acting was back-and-forth. Some things carried-off very well, very believable. Other things not done so well. No single actor was always great or always bad. They each did some very good stuff and some not so good. But the script was bad. Not horrible, just weak. Story was muddied, sometimes confusing, meandering. A lot of activities occurred, but the story didn't really progress much. It's as if almost nothing happened at all, just a lot of activity. Some surprises, but no feeling of suspense or expectation. No satisfying build-up, climax, then resolution. You never really cared about any of the characters or what happened in the story. The characters needed to evolve more from the opening to the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not a good movie.","review":"Extremely thin (if any) character-development, predictable plot twists, irritating techno score... the filmmakers have the pretension toward a cold, Kubrickian examination of power and violence but not the skill to pull it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE WIND is Brave, Exciting, Engaging and Intelligent","review":"Unlike the heavy-handed movies that seem to be the norm nowadays, the filmmakers of THE WIND want you to answer the questions they raise about circumstantial ethics yourself. \\"Love comes in many forms\\" (the original tagline of this movie), as do horror movies, and THE WIND is a horror movie in the sense that, say, Peter Weir's PICNIC AT HANGING ROCK or Stanley Kubrick's EYES WIDE SHUT are horror movies. This kind of social horror can seem intellectual (and it is, to a point) yet, at its core, it is about the horrifying contradictions of real human emotion. Make no mistake, THE WIND is action-packed with plenty of shocking moments, but its chilling realism and brave insightfulness elevates it way above mere exploitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read the Book","review":"7 Tattoos is a good read for anyone who has spent sometime on the wild side and can relate to what Trachtenberg is saying, and what an amazing trip he has had becoming what we assume is a responsible adult. A little reminiscent of Jack Kerouac's 'On the Road', but not as ugly and Trachtenberg at least expressed a concience about most of his trangressions. I did an immediate re-read as I was intigued and wanted a deeper understanding. On the second pass I found myself wondering where he got the money to travel so much and was he sponging off his hard working second generation Holocost parents? The second pass also gave focus to the self indulgence present in his inner child ramblings, but what are memoirs for? It feels honest and alleviates one's own paranoia about self loathing and guilt - we all got some."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing book concerning tattoos and more...","review":"Upon first purchasing this book, I was expecting it to enlighten me on the intricacies of tattooing. Although it didn't do this, the memoirs are some of the best I have ever read. If you are interested in tattoos -- and even if you're not, this book is a must read. It is a very touching a frank overview of a mans life which happened to involve tattoos as a form of expression.

In my opinion, however, the author is way off base in concluding that \\"West Virginia is not really west of Virginia\\".Another interesting fact: The Mona Lisa, painted by Leonardo DaVinci, was not called the Mona Lisa until a later period. Thus states the author: \\"Leonardo DaVinci didn't paint the Mona Lisa.\\"Another totally inappropriate entry is the author's personal interpretation of the US 2nd Amendment presented as fact.These are probably the worst items in the book, however, and there was some pretty good information besides.If you would like a trove of fascinating information, however, I would instead recommend Bill McLain's 'What Makes Flamingos Pink?'"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those fun 'bet you didn't know' books","review":"It always amazes me when people go nuts in reviews with respect to books like this.

An example is that the Battle of Waterloo did not take place at Waterloo, or that the strawberry really is not a berry. There are others that surprise and, often, shock you, for they dispel preconceived notions we have, or we have been taught, either by teachers or by reading other books.If you're not particularly interested in cramming your brain with a bunch of facts that are useless to you unless you try to \\"one-up\\" another person's knowledge, you might want to skip this book.

I also have the optional pad sold separately, which I found to be of very little use.Two side notes.

Sometimes I get a red mark where the bottom of the belt hits the very top of my thigh (groin area) after sitting. I also use a TENS unit and am able to put the belt over the wires, no problem. The only times I had trouble with the belt riding up was when wearing a lower rise jean that sat at the same height of the belt and over underwear that were silky.

The protagonist (and evidently the writer) states that many cases are solved by accident, not through any skill on the part of the police. That is how it is resolved - just by dumb luck, and no reason is ever given for why the killer started the spree in the first place. I had never read anything by Pawson before and I thought the development was OK, but wrapping it up was just a huge slap in the reader's face.

So, it's always ready to play, even when in a bag or in my pocket. And it does. Often.I've come across it singing to itself in my pocket or bag. This can kill the array of batteries at times.

The volume control tends to move all the way to off when I put the device in my pocket. When I pull it out and press a button, nothing happens, so I press it again. Then I turn the volume up. Still nothing (because I pressed the same button twice). Finally I press the button again and get blasted with a much louder sound than I had wanted!The buttons are arranged in two rows, but the positions are not intuitive.

Yes, the versions of \\"People,\\" \\"Second Hand Rose\\" and \\"Don't Rain on my Parade\\" are inventive takes on the songs, and others, such as \\"I Got Rhythm\\" are just heavenly, but this is just too weird to work as an album on its own.The t.v. special, which I saw for the first time only recently, is fantastic, and something all fans will love.

Why did \\"The World is a Concerto\\" have to include appliances, which are totally distracting. There are some gems here, \\"I never has seen snow\\" is absolutely divine and nearly worth the price of the CD.

Not finding any of Keating's books in local bookstores to try to judge whether he would be to my taste, I ordered the book anyway. This was one of those times that the chance did not win out. What may have been a good short story was a slow paced and boring novel that, if it weren't so easy to read, I would have put down long before its 270+ pages had come to their own merciful end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eric Kaz Craig Fuller","review":"Great Music. Just got the CD last week and it brought back wonderful memories. Still looking for the --Eric Kaz Craig Fuller-- album/cd that came out around the same time. I have the album but it's beat up. It has some great tracks and has a superlative rendition of --Cry Like a Rainstorm-- and --Ways of a Woman--. Wish I could find this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forty Shades of Boring","review":"This was the most boring film I've seen in a while. It was nearly impossible to connect with any of the characters which made a nearly plot-less film drudgery. I only finished it because I was SURE that SOMETHING had to happen. I was wrong. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't ever get that 90 minutes back","review":"Moves incredibly slow. I didn't care about any of the characters. I just wasted 90 minutes of my life. Excruciating"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a horrible movie","review":"One of the worst movies I've seen. Dialogs are slow and every single performance is emotionless. I did not build any kind of sympathy towards Rip Torn's character or his wife. Yeah, you do get a sense that she's lonely, you do get a sense that he is a has-been still living the life of the rich and famous and you do see his somewhat distant son get it on with his mother-in-law. But might as well read it here as you'll feel no emotion whatsoever finding it out in the movie. The music is the only thing that spares it from being terrible.This movie is ranked right at the bottom of my list along with Van Sant's Last Days. People seem to overrate these pieces of film waste just because they're different. But my God, you can be different and good, entertaining and thought-provoking.DO NOT BUY OR RENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST for ANY family having a child w/ attachment issues.","review":"This book MUST be required reading for ALL adoptive families for insuring they have true insight on parenting their child responsivly. Being a mother desperately looking for the \\"why\\" my adopted child behaves as he does and \\"why\\" four years of traditional treatment hasn't mattered, I now have these answers and far greater insight as to what to do next. Dr. Fahlberg has provided the comprehensive guide for all who care about advocating children with all kinds of behavior and disorder issues. Dr. Fahlberg's \\"A Child's Journey Through Placement\\" is the Dr. Spock book for all adoptive parenting - outstanding material, information and very well written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Arm Yourself With Knowledge!","review":"This book is a must have for foster parents, adoptive parents, & professionals. Yes, some of it gets very tedious & dry, & the editing is horrendous; but...there is a lot of value here. Not only does the author give explanations, activities, & study based back-up, but she also walks you through her chapters with several case studies. This helps the reader to better apply the knowledge they are absorbing.One reviewer mentioned their disgust for the author's mention of holding therapy. I have to agree with that reviewer, but keep in mind that this book was written in 1996...BEFORE holding therapy had gotten much attention & caused a public outcry.This book is both interesting & informative, & I highly recommend it to anyone with an interest in special needs children.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although this book is recommended by many as a standard work in the field, I personally found it unreliable and uneven.Fahlberg focuses on attachment to the exclusion of all other special needs and developmental tasks, and recommends techniques (such as \\"holding therapy\\") which many experts on attachment have criticized as harmful and even abusive. I found her account of separation issues to be much less sensitive and thoughtful than that of Claudia Jewett (\\"Helping Children Cope with Separation and Loss\\"), for example.There is almost no reference to organic mental or physical disabilities, except for outdated references to \\"schizophrenic children\\" dating from the 1960s.There is useful advice in it, but it doesn't extend far beyond common sense and is undermined by inaccuracies and omissions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Should be part of any 'older child adoption' library","review":"I found this book very helpful in preparing for my daughter's arrival in our family, at age four. It is true that there are quite a few typos; just ignore them, and ignore the 'holding therapy' recommendation. It still is packed with insights into how trauma and abuse effects children and impacts their ability to form relationships. When adopting a child past age two, you really need all the information you can get your hands on. This should be part of your reading, in my opinion.Christine Mitchell, author and illustrator of:Family Day: Celebrating Ethan's Adoption AnniversaryandWelcome Home, Forever Child: A Celebration of Children Adopted as Toddlers, Preschoolers, and Beyond"}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(a=>setTimeout(a,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},C={class:"card-container"},B=["disabled"],N={key:0},x={key:1};function M(a,e,n,u,r,s){const c=w("PoemCard");return o(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",C,[(o(!0),i(y,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,g)=>(o(),p(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(o(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(o(),i("span",x,"Loading...")):(o(),i("span",N,"See more"))],8,B)):b("",!0)])}const W=d(O,[["render",M],["__scopeId","data-v-2a68596e"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/31.md","filePath":"library/31.md"}'),R={name:"library/31.md"},P=Object.assign(R,{setup(a){return(e,n)=>(o(),i("div",null,[v(W)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
