Returned it the same evening and exchanged it for another. Took it back the next day and told them they may have been sent a \\"bad batch\\" of DVD's. They didn't want to refund my money at first.They said I would have to exchange it for another. I replied that I would do so only on the condition they opened it and played both discs to make sure I received a good copy.To make a long story short, I had to DEMAND to speak to the manager.

Willis tries hard to fuse the Grecko/Roman philosophies, and the Astrology that is based on those philosophies, with the mythos and ideals of the Norse, but it just cannot be done successfully. The two philosophies are just too different. He tries to equate Jupiter with Thor. Beside the point that Jupiter was a king of gods and Thor wasn't, Jupiter was feared by his people and Thor was loved and was treated as if he were blood kin.If you are looking for a good book to learn the esoteric meanings of the runes, avoid this book at all costs. \\"Northern Mysteries\\" by Freyja Aswynn, \\"Futhark\\" by Edred Thorson, and \\"Runecasters\\" by Edred Thorson, are far better."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE POSSE!","review":"A POSSE OF OUTLAWSI feel that this is a good book if you like old fashion gun fights between outlaws and bounty hunters. This book starts off with a man named Les Remick who is a bounty hunter on a search for a dangerous outlaw named The Snake. This book is full of action and excitement as it goes through the life of a bounty hunter. I think that this book would be great for kids because it's very informational on the old days and how the law was different from today. This book shows how crime in the old days was treated much more harsh. It shows how a criminal could have to live a sad and lonely life because of the risk of a bounty hunter finding them or killing them. I found this book a good read but some parts are very boring. When Les Remick goes to a town and meets women named Clara the book becomes slower and has not as much action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't remove all epoxy","review":"If you are looking to remove the kind of epoxy that is used for floor tiles, look elsewhere.

Even though it seemed to be sharp, it would hardly even cut a tomato - and with the things it did cut, it dragged on the way through and required more force than you would think necessary.

For some reason, Showtime always gets rid of their best shows right when they are taking off. They did it with Stargate SG1 and it has gone on to be one of the most successfull shows ever. And after two seasons, they replace Dead Like Me. With what? That fat moose: Kirstie Alley. My God, how stupid can these people actually be.Once it was confirmed that Showtime had cancelled DLM, the first thing I did was to cancel Showtime. And I have a feeling that many, many others did the exact same thing. It seems as though Showtime is becoming just like another network station - full of nothing but reality shows. Enough already!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HILARIOUS","review":"While this show may be too morbid for some, i find its witt refreshing, something not often seen on tv. It is unfortunate that a) it was cancelled and b) it was only shown on pay-tv in Australia as I think it would have done well on the networks as Australians tend to have a darker sense of humour than most. Anyway this show is outrageous, hilarious and un-missable. Undoubtabley one of the best characters is Delorus Hergigg (as in her big brown eyes) at Happy Time. This second season is a great follow up and definately a must have for all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel incomplete!","review":"I don't get Showtime so I never saw the original airings of this show. Fortunately, for me, the SciFi channel picked this show up and has been airing two episodes every Tuesday. The odd sense of humor and treatment of the subject matter hooked me immediately.Unfortunately, for me, I couldn't wait and bought both seasons on DVD. I just finished watching the second season and feel incomplete knowing that there will be no more.Fortunately, for fans, the studio found a winner in the DVD market. Unfortunately, for fans and the studio, there are no more episodes.I thought that perhaps the studio would possibly produce more episodes just for the DVD market. Unfortunately, for all of us time passes and actors, writers, directors, and producers have to make a living. Making new episodes for the DVD market is all but impossible now. This is an unfortunate outcome for all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showtime's mistake","review":"This show was amazing. And i cant get enough of it, i even got all my friends hooked on it.

It is a very well written show that I think if it was on regular cable would have a lot more of a following. I didn't know it existed on Showtime as I don't receive that channel. The dvds have the original language in it so it is a little rough at times, but over all a very good series. I wish it were on Sci-fi so we could see more of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly one of the best","review":"Amazing show, really one of the best of my lifetime. Its really got it all, spectacular plot, introspective with GREAT characters, and (probably my favorite part) its not a show for stupid people, intelligence is a prerequisite to ones ability to enjoy this show. At the end of this DVD set, you'll be dieing for more, and if your like me, it will truly pain you to find that this is it, showtime has canceled the show. If you feel strongly about this send a letter, an email, anything to try to get it back, the show is really that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excruciating","review":"Thinking it might be something like Six Feet Under, I rented the first season of Dead Like Me at my local video store. It was dreadful. I couldn't even get through the pilot episode. The main character is obnoxious, the dialog is strident, and nothing that happens is either funny, moving or interesting. If it got a lot better after the pilot I'll never know. I'm just grateful I only wasted four dollars renting it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addicting Series","review":"I caught this originally on the SCI-FI channel. The story line is great and the acting is wonderful. I started watching it and now my whole family are addicted to it. I don't see why it is not still on TV. It reminds me a little of Doogy Houser(not sure of the spelling). It is more about a teenager growing into an adult and handling life, except she is dead. Each of the characters grow in the episodes and their development provides good stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE this show","review":"It seems that every show that i like gets cancelled. Wonderfalls, Life As We Know It, Popular and now Dead Like Me.

I rarely find a series where I like all of the characters. This show could definitely have run for more seasons to develop Rube and Daisy's characters a bit more. There were a lot of questions I had left unanswered. I still give it five stars, though. This series was very emotionally charged and peppered with plenty of humor. Each character had their flaws and were plagued by the loved ones they left behind and the things they wish they had said or done while they were alive and still yearn for on the other side as reapers. Excellent series all around. I will definitely watch it over and over again. It was a hauntingly sad series but so true of the things and people we take for granted in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING SHOW!! Sad that it had to end!","review":"I started watching this show on Netflix. After finishing all of Desperate Housewives, Sex & the City, Pretty Little Liars and a few other shows, I was bored and looking for something different. This show is it. It's been amazing and I have a few episodes left. I was bummed when I realized it ended after just two seasons. I highly recommend this show to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Like Me - Season Two","review":"I love this series and recommend it to everyone (over 16). I bought both full seasons and the direct to DVD movie, they all win big with me. It mystifies me why this series wasn't picked up again either by Showtime or by someone else. It is soooo much better than the sexually themed and boringly predictable prime time comedies they show on and on for ten or twelve years. Take a break from the cookie cutter sitcoms and check out this series. Its addictive as well as hilarious for those of us with an appetite for dark comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series","review":"I have never been able to see this season.

Check it out :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A tragedy this show was cancelled","review":"This show was awesome - I own both seasons on DVD and lend them out to friends routinely, who also fall in love with it. The only tragedy is that, amid studio politics, this show thought saved by Sci-Fi Network, got cancelled. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Potential","review":"Easy to see why the network dropped this show, it went from decent to tolerable to intolerable. Maybe a writer with vision can jump-start, but probably won't happen. This finale, was probably the worst episode of the series. If you watch, it will disappoint. Have to wonder who was driving this train, I would fire whoever it was, clearly asleep at the wheel, or stoned...."},{"rating":"2","title":"When good shows get cancelled by stupid people...","review":"The second season of \\"Dead Like Me\\" wasn't as strong as the first, but it was pretty close, still very engaging and better than most other television shows on cable and the networks. The main problem with season 2 is that it sets up many interesting questions that were meant to be answered in future seasons, but we'll never get those answers because someone at showtime decided to kill it's best show. Rumors and petitions are all over the net trying to bring the show back on another network, but that will probably never happen, as many of the actors have new projects lined up. It's just such a shame! It sounds childish, but I cancelled Showtime because of the cancellation of this show. If you liked \\"Dead Like Me\\" or any other recently cancelled show, let the network know your opinion. Could you imagine not having a second season of \\"Lost\\" and not knowing the answers to that show?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Year 2 - Even Better","review":"I loved Season 1 and then I loved Season 2 even more because the actors seemed more comfortable in their roles and they really got to grow their characters, especially the lead, Ellen Muth. You see such growth and change in all of the characters -- and that's what good drama is all about. And it was also hysterically funny in many parts.I was very upset when they cancelled the show, but you know, that's OK. The way Season 2 ended, you got the feeling that everthing was going to be OK with George and that she really got to embrace her role as a reaper... It's almost as if it was time for the series to close...Though i would LOVE it if it came back to cable..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My four year old son loves this dinosaur.

Upon getting them I was really disappointed in the quality of them and wanted to send them back. Unfortunatly Amazon was going to make me pay for the shipping, so I decided to just spare the trouble and keep them. All and all in the end, I should have just paid the expense! After wearing them only an hour, the paint on the bottoms starting peeling off and was sticking to the bottoms of my feet. At the end of the day,the sole's looked awful and made their finnaly walk, straight to the trash.... Save your trouble buying cheap ones on the web, when the dollar store's are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remix albums suck","review":"This is not a greatest hits compilation, it's just Tamie Down's sad attempt at trying to industrialize the Faster Pussycat sound. And here, it fails miserably. And this is coming from a fan. The songs here are so heavily remixed that I couldn't tell you what each song was they were attempting to play. Any Deadline label release is always a gamble because they can't afford to buy the original recordings, so they just have the artist redo them. If that's the case, the fans already have that stuff, why not do something original? Lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Etta's Been Done Wrong","review":"Etta James can do no wrong --- but wrong can be done to her. The mastering of this live set is despicable. It fades the end of every song before each song has finished. When the first song \\"ended\\", I thought my CD player had died. What th---?!?!! It's a shame because, despite her opening announcement that she's \\"feeling under the weather\\", Etta really delivers here. Those jarring end fades, though, make you feel like you're listening to a brief sample of each track. Disgusting, and no way to treat a Great Lady --- or her fine band.So, one star for this CD. If the song endings had been included, I'd have given it four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Safely","review":"This product is terrific for those of us who hide jewelry and other valuables in socks, unused drawers, closets, under beds, every time we go on vacation... only to realize, upon return, that we can't remember where we hid them. The books are real with a cut out section for the valuables. They make a nice addition to a library (except that I would never had bought these books as real books). Should fool all but the most erudite of thieves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book Safe","review":"I like the product. However, I don't like the title of the book. It might be interesting to the thief."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought this book was about Feng Shui?","review":"This book is poorly organized and poorly written. I only made it 135 pages before I couldn't take it anymore. There was too much historical information and not enough practical information. One section about history is fine, but chapters! All I wanted to know was how to place my couch, not who wrote about feng shui 6,000 years ago. Even though it was broken into chapters and sections, it felt very diconnected; with the authors referring constantly to information they would tell you later and to those obscure chinese texts. If you want information on chinese philosophy, religion and the different dynasties then this is your book. But if you are like me and only want to know if your bed should be this way or that than buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing","review":"I may be an idiot when it comes to Feng Shui but this is still too comlpicated for me! I have gotten other books that have been much more to-the-point than this one.I am an acupuncturist and have studied in China so I have a little bit of an idea about asian culture and how its all works. Unless you are willing to pull out your compass and do a survey on your house and do lots of math- you DON'T want it! It is definately wrongly named. If you are a begginer, don't waste your money. There is better, easier to understand books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Good For Kindle","review":"This book is extremely thorough, although its NOT an easy read at all. I have to admit by the time I was halfway through I was looking up Feng Shui Consultants instead !The one thing I must warn you though is that it is full of absolutely VITAL tables, which you can neither read, nor zoom, on the Kindle version. Now I have Kindle for PC, so maybe the handheld device has this capability, but I am warning you that if you have the PC version you won't be able to read the charts.I did quite well looking up the relevant information on Google, but it would have been nice to use the charts which came in the book.Oh well, I've grasped just enough of the subject to go looking for a book on Flying Stars Feng Shui - this book is too complex for me, and the tables are too tiny :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Execllant Reading","review":"This book is well thought out, very easy to understand and apply. I would recommend this to anyone that is just starting out to learn about Feng Shui. The author has taken the time to go into great detail to explain what has been up until now confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"The book is simple wonderful. It is the best I have come across in a long time. The explanations are so easy to understand and follow that I would recommend it to all readers who are interested in Feng Shui. It makes a lot of sense and everything is explained in such a fantastic manner that you feel the magic of the Feng Shui after you turn the last page and you realise how much more you have to learn if you want to practise Feng Shui in your life. Thank you Amazon.com for making this book available to the readers around the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Basic Info Overwhelmed by Complex Calculations","review":"While this book does a good job of explaining basic concepts (yin/yang, the cycle of the elements, etc.), its approach has the reader consulting table upon table and performing endless calculations. It's very much a product of the compass school of Feng Shui -- a valid approach, certainly, but hardly one for anyone interested in quick, practical applications. Those who are already familiar with feng shui basics may find this a good bridge to the more complex practices of the compass school ... but beginners will likely be bewildered and put off by the detailed astrological computations, ardent rules and regulations, and complex nature of this book's content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy book!","review":"This book is the first one that made me realise that the 'eight aspirations' school of feng shui is faux! It does that by providing some information of what is traditional feng shui, and therefore further convinced me that traditional feng shui is not as simple as the designated areas for wealth, health, children etc. Among all the books on feng shui that i've read, this is the only book that gives examples, like the couple searching for a house and the office case study. The only problem i have, is the lack of defining the facing and sitting side of a home, particularly the apartment. Other then that, I had a great time reading this book. Get it folks, it's worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gave as Gift","review":"Gave this to my brother but flipped through it beforehand. Practical, funny, thorough. Love the ease and playfulness of the writing. Brother is taking it seriously."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"Had I known the content of this book, I'd never have bought it. It's more like a badly organized textbook on everything you didn't want to know about Feng Shui than on simple, easy-to-apply principles that \\"complete idiots\\" can apply to their homes. Too much background information about which I don't care. Too little in the way of immediately useful ideas. What I had hoped for was a sort of Cliff's notes on the topic with a basic Feng Shui to-do list, but what I got was page after page (after page) of theory and tables. If you are looking for an education on Feng Shui and don't care about being able to ferret out any useful ideas, buy this book.

Click the little lever beneath the thumb lever, drop the connector into the ball head top and click you are solidly connected. The controlling level (for side to side rotation) and the knob for control of the ball head work smoothly and I like that they are different. When you are first getting the process for using pro level equipment it helps to have a different shape for different functions. Well done Manfrotto.

Even though my current toaster works beautifully I purchased this one to replace it. I loved the whole look of it. Luckily I decided to try this one out before I gave away my current toaster and before I got rid of the packaging. I set the toaster on 3 which is about your normal setting on any toaster. The toast came out white, the bread was partially toasted, but it didn't have any color.Not appealing. I than put in another slice and set the setting to four. I had a piece of charcoal when it popped up.I tried to do a setting in between three and four not possible with this model.I than boxed it up and returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good toast, weak release","review":"The only thing keeping this from getting 5 stars is that the pop up mechanism is weak and after the toast is done it only comes up part way and you have to manually raise the toast so that you can take it out. I'm not sure if this is a feature that is built into the unit so that the toast stays warm in the slowly cooling toaster or what, however, I am used to a toaster that pops up all the way when done. Not a big deal due to the quality of toast, that is, in a word, excellent.

Wrong!!! Shortly after puchasing it, the light on the toaster would indicate it that it was toasting but actually it was just sitting there cold. Yesterday I broke off the handle trying to get it to turn on. The toaster is now in my trash can after less that 6 mionths."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: Short slots!","review":"This is truly a \\"retro\\" toaster! Be mindful of the fact that the shape of loaves of bread has changed from the days when this model was popular. We ordered the toaster, when it arrived none of the bread we had would fit in it! Slots aren't long enough. I don't particularly like the idea of cutting bread in half before toasting it. Back it went!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good bye, my friend","review":"This little toaster worked well and looked great (with regular polishing) for 5 years of very light use before latch mechanism broke requiring that the lever be held down to toast. That trick only worked for 3 uses before the switch inside the toaster fell apart.The product quality matches the $20 I paid for it years ago but it's a shame it wasn't of higher quality, I certainly would have paid double or even triple the price for a sturdier appliance.I took it apart and attempted to fix the problems but as appliances are meant to be trashed rather than repaired these days my attempts were unsuccessful. I would buy this toaster again (and again) if I could get over how wasteful that would be. I will continue to search for a toaster that is as timeless in function as it is in appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"love the look....but","review":"I loved this toaster at first. But the cheap plastic lever to make the toast lighter or darker broke and cannot be fixed. Now the bread will not stay down long enough to toast. You have to push it down repeatedly. Granted it is 2 years old, but it seems you shouldn't have to buy a toaster every two years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I thought I would like this toaster since I've had good luck in the past with Sunbeam products. But it's a big disappointment. From Day One, it doesn't eject toast, bagels, pop tarts or anything else I put into it---I have to manually eject everything. It doesn't come on reliably, either. The light will come on but after a few minutes when I start to get my toast or whatever out, it hasn't browned at all & I discover that the heating elements never came on. It's also very difficult to get it to stay down to toast anything. No matter what the lightness or darkness is set at, I usually have to push the bar thingy down several times before it will catch & stay. I don't use it that often & would not recommend it to someone who uses a toaster on a daily basis as they would probably end up throwing it out a window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but not worth it","review":"I bought this toaster because the style would look good in my kitchen. I liked the little light on the front of the toaster and the curved shape. I liked the old-fashioned fun look. Lesson learned: do not buy a toaster based solely on \\"The Look\\".Function - Pretty bad actually. It does not toast both sides of the bread - and I have tried it every which way to see if I could get it to work properly. I have to put the bread in, toast one side, then turn it to get the other side. Very time-consuming and annoying plus it's not the most rapid toasting product anyway. Would not buy again and cannot recommend - there are other toasters out there that would do a better job and still suit your kitchen's design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"If you want it to look shiny on the counter, great. If you want quality toasting, not so much. Controls are not as good as cheaper models. The outside gets hot.

To begin with it toasts slowly, although this might be in initialization matter as ours seemed to speed up a bit over the first couple of weeks. However, ours had a pretty serious mechanical shortcoming, the mechanism that raises and holds the toast was too lightly built to reliably do the job. Ours got stuck terminating the toaster functionality. We have returned the appliance to Amazon and will get another, and it may work longer, but at present this design seems to be nonrobust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had to Return","review":"This product looks cute but ours toasted unevenly. There were a lot of settings, but it seemed to only toast to burnt or underdone--no in between. Also, one side of the bread toasted darker than the other. We returned the toaster. After returning another toaster from Target, we finally found the Cuisinart CPT-160 at Lowe's and it meets our need - which is toasting a piece of bread or bagel without any problems. It also has a nice look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sunbeam Heritage Toaster","review":"I was looking for a new toaster and have tried numerous toasters and not one did a good job of toasting. To get evenly toasted bread you would have to put the toast down twice. I saw an original 1940's Sunbeam, but the price was $300.00, I wasn't going to pay $300.00 for a Toaster, so thought I'd give this Heritage series a try. To my amazement, this toaster does a great job of toasting the bread evenly. The only thing I dislike about it is, it's not made of good Chrome outsides and the insides are a little cheesy, and a little on the light weight side, and made in China. But other than that it makes Great Toast. I like the reheat cycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this ONLY for decorative purposes, NOT toasting anything","review":"Pass on this unless you want to decorate your kitchen.. I got 2 ( original and replacement) neither of which worked.....Major waste of time and money.... so very sad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cool design- doesn't work.","review":"I should have listened to the other reviews...I was so happy when I unpacked the toaster. The design is as cool now as it was when they first made it. However, the first problem was that it took several minutes of playing with the lever to get the toast to stay down, once it did it that problem seemed to be solved. The next problem was that the light/dark sensor didn't work. All it did was burn- even on the lightest setting. Soooo disappointing! Sent it back. Toaster technology seems to have been pretty set for the past 50 years. Why can't they make a cool one that works?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toaster","review":"I love the design of this toaster and the little light on the side like old toasters. It is maybe not as heavy as i expected - I hope it lasts as long as old toasters used to, but is right on the money with all the features and how it toasts. wonderful look for the kitchen. i would give it 5 stars but havent had it long enough to decide that...guess right now it is really a 4.5. this would make a great gift, quite nice and it comes in a nice box also. geez ok i changed my mind as i write this and am giving it a 5 star, no reason not to!note the toaster stopped toasting on one side of both slots..i still like it and sunbeam is sending me a free one....had it for a year so i am impressed with their customer support..but changing rating to a 4 due to not working after a year..but it used to work GREAT..maybe just a lemon i got."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk","review":"Pure Junk is the best descriptor. Shoddy workmanship, with trouble from day one. Depressing the down handle would only stay down about half the time.....need to keep depressing. After two months of light use...once a day...the center heating element no longer works. If you want toast on only one side of your bread this is your toaster. Not my mother's Sunbeam for sure.

If you want a toaster, look further. I tried very hard to accept this Sunbeam Heritage's shortcomings because I loved the look of it. It really did remind me of the Sunbeam toaster of my childhood. It toasted one side of my bread and not the other. If my English muffin wasn't dark enough, I had to wait for the thing to cool down before the lever would stay down again for a do over! Also, the levers are flimsy. Not a good purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Retro Look... Non Retro Workmanship","review":"Loved the look of the Sunbeam 3916 Heritage, and the extra wide slots that were wide enough for half a bagel.However... whereas our original toaster that was made around year 1955 had lasted more than 50 years before finally breaking down (handed down over two generations, and with heavy family use)... this cheaply made modern version from Sunbeam lasted about three years. The sliding switches are extremely frail.What broke first: the mode (toast, bagel, etc.) slider; although we never discerned any real difference in any of these modes anyway.What broke next: the light/dark toast slider.What broke last, and finally rendered the toaster unusable: the spring loaded toast lever (that lowers the bread into the toaster).Cute toaster, but would never purchase another Sunbeam... ever. Cheaply made, poor mechanical design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cute but doesn't stand the test of time","review":"I bought this toaster in July 08. It isn't of the finest quality I would have expected for the cost, but kept it because it was cute and worked. Three weeks ago the lever to choose darkness of the toast stopped working.

I have contacted Sunbeam to see if they can fix or replace, but I am not hopefull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I wanted to replace my 10 year old toaster which still worked with one that was more sleek and this retro stainless toaster caught my eye. It reminded me of one from my childhood.I have not found this toaster to toast consistently each time. I also miss a feature which eables me to raise the toasted item further up from the slot after toasting is complete. The top of the toaster also gets extremely hot, however the sides do not. A deeper crumb tray would be an improvement.I held on to my old toaster, just in case...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction, does not toast evenly","review":"Two big complaints about this product and one about Amazon.One, this is really a flimsy piece of \\"Made in China\\" product. I think it's probably the worst example of such I've had the misfortune to come across. If I had seen this in person I never would have purchased it.Two, it does not work very well. I have yet to get it to toast a piece of bread evenly.But three, what really angered me was that less then 24 hours after I purchased it, I went online and Amazon had lowered the price on the toaster substantially. Although I see today that it is back at the price I paid for it.That really frosted the deal.One of my most disappointing buying experiences on Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Replica of a Vintage Toaster","review":"I love it. Looks good in my kitchen and reminds me of my childhood. I like the way the wires grab hold of the bread, no matter how thick or thin it is, and center it in the slot so it's toasted evenly on both sides. Over the years, I bought several white toasters that looked really bad after a short period of use, didn't toast evenly and then dropped dead -- why? -- a toaster is supposed to last forever (well, practically). I even had one that developed scorch marks on the outside of the slots.I only have one problem with the Sunbeam 3916 Heritage toaster -- I enjoy Sara Lee Buttermilk bread which is wider than the length of the toaster's slots. I still gave it 5 stars because I came to the conclusion that the bread we had back then wasn't extra wide. So, if I want an exact replica of the original, that's one draw-back I can live with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst defense of Socialism imagninable","review":"This so called book was a joke. Instead of academic argument in defense of socialism, all I found in this book was grand claims without any support or argument. It would seem like there was nothing but propaganda written, it focused so much on \\"human nature,\\" but did not present any counter arguments. The writing was designed in such a way that any fair competition or defense of capitalism became impossible. Any reality about economy, politics or society was colored by romantic ideals, and I cannot stress on the fact that absolutely no argument or proof was presented in this book. I am an ardent capitalist, but I wanted to read and explore socialism openly and scholarly; instead I got this book, I am perhaps more in favor of capitalism now than I was before reading this traumatic piece of literature.

This is a fast food, junk version for mass appeal and a shameful mass when considering what it was based on...

The story is too slow, and the mystery isn't interesting. Jacobia is not only brave, she's fool-hardy and occasionally endangers her life needlessly. Soon after starting the book, I realized I had read another book of the series, but I can't remember much about it, which means I must not have liked that one much either. The characters in the book don't ring true; I'm particularly wondering why her husband Wade takes her life-endangering escapades so calmly.

On the \\"Impromptus\\" collection, he alternates between aggresive flourishes and gentle brush-strokes, always calling on the appropriate style for that perfect interpretation. Someone new to the Rubinstein/Chopin combination may want to start with the \\"Ballades,\\" \\"Polonaises,\\" or particularly \\"The Nocturnes\\" collections, but this should be an easy fourth choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real final frontier","review":"The television show 'SeaQuest DSV' is sorely missed in my household. Howeever, this novel by David Bischoff creates a plot that would have worked very well for a two-part episode. A creature (\\"The Ancient\\" of the title) from the depths of the ocean attacks a whaling ship and a submarine; one of the survivors from the sub is brought aboard seaQuest, but Captain Bridger doubts his story about a sea monster. There's a quasi-romantic subplot for Lucas (played by the late Jonathan Brandis) and the plot moves swiftly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great find!","review":"This is such a nice full skirt.

I just keep receiving emails saying that they are having some delay so in 1-2 week they will dispatche the book.If you really need this book go and buy it someplace else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Effort by FF","review":"The music on this CD is not nearly as raw as \\"Soul...\\" and \\"Demanufacture\\", and the songs are, for the most part, more melodic than those efforts. However, FF have not lost their aggressive sound & edge, and real fans of FF will be happy with this CD. The drumming and Dino's guitar work are as good as ever, and their individual styles sound great together. Bell's singing, too, is in top form; in some songs, he still retains his angry sound, but there is certainly more true singing on this CD.I'm pretty sure that this album will appeal to almost any heavy metal fan. Hopefully, this CD will allow Fear Factory to build upon the success that they achieved with \\"Obsolete\\". In this metal genre, Fear Factory have shown that they are among the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digimortal","review":"You know, Fear Factory used to be my favorite band... until this album. it's really sad how some bands sell out and become weak just to make money, isn't it? I had very high expectations when I bought it, but when I actually started playing it for the first time, I took it out of my CD player and replaced it with Demanufacture. let me say this: if you're into the rap-rock genre like Limp Bizkit or Korn or anything like that, by all means, buy this album. if you actually like GOOD music, on the other hand, such as earlier FF, Death Metal, and Black Metal, buy something else. If they keep going in this direction, they will lose all of the fans that put them where they are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Follow Up To A Classic Album","review":"I think that most Fear Factory fans would consider \\"Obsolete\\" their best album. I definitely agree with that. \\"Digimortal\\" was their follow up to that classic album and its pretty good but cannot live up to its predecessor. If you have to choose between \\"Obsolete\\" and \\"Digimortal\\", then you should definitely buy \\"Obsolete\\". The music on this album contains four really good tracks while the rest kind of chug along but aren't too memorable. The extra tracks aren't really worth paying the extra price for the album. Its pretty obvious why they did not make the \\"official\\" album. My favorite tracks are:What Will Become?DamagedByte BlockHurt Conveyor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh my is this good or what!","review":"Let me start off by saying, these guys impress me. After listening to this cd the first time i wanted to come on Amazon.com and just rip this band and give them a 1 star rating. Every song sounded the same and I just couldn't stand the brutal vocals. Then i thought wait what if i just give it a few more listens. After about 5 days, i was hooked! I started getting used to the vocals which now sound pretty good, and everysong started to stick out. If you dont' like it the first time you'll get used to it, just like i did! The drummer is amazing and the song structure is faboulus. I'm very surprised indeed"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST ALBUM RELEASED THIS YEAR","review":"Fear Factory has given us what I think is the best album to be released yet and I think this is the one that will break them out. There are no weak spots at all on this album. The group shows how they are progressing as they can give us a heavy song suchas \\"Linchpin\\" and follow that up with \\"Invisible Wounds\\". I was surprised at the collabaration with Cypress Hill and wasn't sure how it would play out on the song \\"Back the F**K up\\" but it did turn out to be a good song. If you can go out and get the digipak version with the bonus tracks, they are not just throw away material and help to round out this great disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"fallen short","review":"Album sounds rushed, most of the album is hard/impossible to listen to, with the exeption of a few songs, was a complete waste"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sell Out Album?! The humanity!","review":"First, Amazon is wrong go back to the Death Metal list because this NOT death metal. If you want a great album from Fear Factory get \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" or \\"Demanufacture\\". I'm a Fear Factory fan. I have their albums up until now. I couldn't believe this album when I heard it! It's like Backstreet Boys going into Metal. Yeah, that's how horrible this album is! It has the sound of the old Fear Factory singing but, it has a sound of being slower and more whiny, which is how 90% of bands are sounding than they did back in the 80s (not 80s music, 80s metal). If anyone is a Metal fan knows that Metal is not whiny it's like \\"I'll kill you\\" then apologizes about it later. Anyway, the bottom line: skip over this album do not support sell outs in any form (Metallica). Buy later albums like \\"Soul of a New Machine\\" or \\"Demanufacture\\" but not his one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Living Up to Obsolete","review":"AS much of a great album as Digimortal is and as much as they have kept their same sound which obiously has worked for them since 1992.... none of their albums has lived up to the awsome powerr of Obsolete... this is great album where everything said in all the other reviews is true but if your a new comer to Fear Factory first get Obsolete and then collect the rest starting with Digimortal...."},{"rating":"1","title":"the album which nearly destroyed fear factory","review":"OK,Fear Factory are a phenomenal band. They showed this with such titles as 'soul of a new machine','demanufacture','obsolete' and their new release 'archetype'...but this one? What were they thinking? This album isn't anywhere near as heavy as any of their other releases. The riffs are too simple. Sure, the vocals still have an aggressive edge to them, but it just ain't trademark Fear Factory. 'Linchpin' is a good song however,but 'back the f*** up'...a rap song with the guy outta cypress hill...uhh? This shows that FF were going into a papa roach nu metal phase when this album came out. Fortunately, their new release blows this one away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another great band falls victim to a trend","review":"I have been faithfully listening to Fear Factory for about six years now, but I can say this is the last Fear Factory cd I buy. It lacks the heaviness and all out assault of Soul of a New Machine, and the good songs of Demanufacture. I personally liked Obsolete. Plain and simple, Digimortal is absolutely trendy. They now sound like every other new band that it out there. Why buy this album when it sounds like every other nu metal band thats out there. Every sound on the album is predictable, from the bland syncopated riffs to the horrible, hip hop style squeals. The album sounds as if was written in a week. They have stooped low to add a rap song on thier album. I have loved FF and I like Cypress Hill, but why be like the 50,000 other bands that are mixing the two. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of the tight production and Dino's guitar tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ahh what happend!!!","review":"Man was I dissapointed when i heard this. I was waiting for another Soul of a new machine but man they really killed it. Were are all thoughs Napalm Deah and Godflesh influnces. Some of the instrumental work on here is good but it sounds radio friendly. I really wish they would of made their last cd a good one. At least they released Concrete which is just full on death metal. I heard Dino was in a different band I wonder what they sound like? I hope like the old FF. Well anyways this was a very dissapoint album and I would not recomend it to the old FF fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fear Factory's Worst","review":"I have to agree that this album isn't no \\"Obsolete\\" or \\"Demanufacture\\", but it doesn't suck. This is how much I love Fear Factory. They are one of the best bands to ever grace the face of Earth. This CD has some great tracks on it. \\"Linchpin\\" is the best track on this CD. You will want to listen to it over and over. It never gets stale. \\"Invisible Wounds (Dark Bodies)\\" is not the brutal \\"Soul Of A New Machine\\" Fear Factory that you'd expect, but it is a great song as well. The only flaw is the song \\"Back The F**k Up\\", that has that lamewad from Cypress Hill in it. In other words, this is a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"10 years of evolution","review":"Digimortal is killer!! I love progressive industrial metal.

The way he explains the suffering - with every minor detail, every ant bite, every pain of his body - you can understand that it wasn't luck that kept him alive but he was very clever on putting his mind to work for the big goal of his life... To Stay Alive!There was a certain moment when reading the book, that I was only telling to myself: Yossi! Just get the hell out of there. And I wanted to go to the last pages to see him free of all that suffering.There was only one think in the book that I didn't like, it is when he starts wandering his mind to other places like Brazil etc... he spend a lot of pages on that, and that keeps you off of what you really want to read about. This is way I did not give 5 stars.Walter Pinto Oct 30, 2009"},{"rating":"2","title":"simple yet gripping","review":"Very simplistic in structure, making for a very easy read.

I really disliked Yossi and his story. He's alive, not because of courage or any innate skills he possesses, but because of dumb luck. I didn't want to put his book down because I wanted to be done with it. As much as he tries to disguise it, Yossi is a jerk. He's pompous, reckless, and whiney. I don't think he learned anything from his experience, and he's not a good writer. There's no insight here.

While it is true that some of his decisions were not the greatest, the point is he made a go of it. The hand of fate.Reflecting back on his three weeks in the jungle, it was not only a quest for survival but also self-identity.

The book was interesting and entertaining as far as survival stories go but what bothered me was that it wasn't particularly well written. I think the author would have benefitted from a professional writer penning the book instead of he.I was bored with about the first 100 pages of the book. I kept wondering when it was going to become interesting but it just ran on and on. I didn't really care about the history fo all the players, a few pages of setup would have been enough. I mean really, do we need to be told that they have no idea of what lies ahead and should have taken more precautions? I think the history was written only for filler as this book is quite short and is written in big type.I am not saying don't read this book but take it off your wish list and get it at the library instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"I had the privilege of meeting Yossi at an international event that I had attended and it touched me to meet him in person after such a harrowing experience.

Its real, its raw, its creepy but more than all that it is a real life situation.

In fact, 70% of the photos in this book come from El Paso/Las Cruces sources--and some of them have nothing to do with the revolution--they were just interesting for the author, so he included them!

Some ingredients are substantial, some are minimal but they are always recognizable.From the trivial to the significant, the various parts make up an interesting read.And the book certainly deserves a place in my collection of personal narratives and reportage.Well done. :{)>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dana's Low Carb BBQ Cookbook","review":"Outstanding! This is the 3rd Dana Carpender cookbook I have and it is probably my favorite. Great recipes and great fun to use! I have been de-carbing recipes from my favorite BBQ cookbook and was relieved to see that I was on the right track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sauce ideas","review":"This book is worth the purchase price just for all the sauces. It's so hard for new LC'ers to cook without all the tricks they may be used to from their previous lifestyle, using sugar-filled sauces and condiments.Unlike the '500' or '1000' books, this is not just a few recipes repeated with minor changes and called a new recipe in order to boost the recipe count on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book to read...","review":"As a professional writer in Hollywood, I have read all the screenwriting books, taken all the courses, and spoken with all the agents, and this is the book to read. The Screenwriter Within is an excellent informative (and entertaining) sourcebook on three-act structure, filled with examples from the author's own life, quick reference tips, and humor. If you ever wanted to write a screenplay, but didn't know how to get it on the page, this is the book to read. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This struck a chord with me unlike any of the others","review":"Really inspiring. I was halfway through and felt the muse awaken.

I'm interested in writing in general, and I've read more then 40 books on the subject. This one doesn't have anything that you can not find in other books. It deals with screenwriting in pretty superficial way. Too many stories from D. B. Gilles' personal life and not much about structure, characterization and dialog. Although you can find chapters on these subjects, but when you read them, there is almost nothing inside. I was disappointed. Besides, it seems to me that among the first 10 reviewers at least 7 of them know D. B. Gilles personally (six of them are from N.Y. and so the writer - coincidence ?) and had written their reviews more or less on the same time. In my opinion, they look more like promotions and not like fair reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must to have for screenwritewrs!","review":"this book is very inspiring and u'll love it if u want to become a screenwriter or u are already started ur career as screenwriter.I advise everyone who wants to write screenplay to get the book plus downloading a script from the internet to know how it looks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Second-Best Way to Improve Your Script","review":"Actually, the best thing you can do for your screenplay is to attend one of D.B's Manhattan workshops.If you can't, definitely buy this book.D.B is a genius at drawing out and shaping the story lurking in a writer's head. He's also a fanatic about structure and will keep you on the right path without dwelling on points well-covered by others.So do yourself a favor. Click the Add-to-Cart button next to the book right now. You'll wind up with a more entertaining and salable script for your efforts. And D.B. will keep you smiling along the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart move","review":"Emma Frost is known to X.men fans as the conniving White Queen, but before all that she was just an ordinary girl dealing with everyday problems. Over-controlling father, b!tchy sisters, catfights at school, serial killers on vacation, a closeted gay brother and telepathic powers. The book is obviously marketed to a female audience as you can see by the pouty \\"Nancy Drewish\\" cover but it can be enjoyed by both sexes. Well written and beautifully illustrated it is a very entertaining read. Looking foward to volume 2. EP"},{"rating":"2","title":"The White Queen has a history","review":"\\"Emma Frost: Higher Learning\\" is a digest-sized collection of the soap opera that was young Emma's life, long before she became the White Queen, a busty telepath, member of the Hellfire Club and frequent bane and occasional ally to the X-Men. Raised in extreme wealth by a selfish, domineering father and a largely vacant mother, Emma and her problematic siblings never had a normal life. A lack of friends at her private academy made life even worse. But then Emma started suffering headaches and nosebleeds, and she seemed to know what people around her were thinking....\\"Higher Learning\\" is geared more toward a young-adult audience and will likely appeal more to young women than men. Still, it's an interesting story that adds new dimensions to an otherwise stale character. Karl Bollers' richly layered storytelling and Randy Green's solid art make for an attractive package that any comics reader can enjoy.by Tom Knapp, Rambles.(n e t) editor"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of those over-educated types responds","review":"What you have in the previous review is a perfect example of the type of students prevalent in the US higher education system today.... crying, \\"Give us Science Lite!\\" Heaven forfend that you should have to apply a formula in what is perhaps the most QUANTITATIVE of all the biological sciences, ecology!! Now having vented, let me say that Stiling's book is certainly not the perfect introductory text- in fact I find it LACKING in detail in some respects- but it isn't a bad choice at all for the introduction of interested students to the study of life on the planet we inhabit."},{"rating":"1","title":"insular academic chatter","review":"I was assigned this as a text for a college class, which I subsequently dropped after reading the book. What I had wanted was a basic introduction to the concepts of the science of ecology. What I got instead was unnecessary academic references and page after page of statistical methodology. These might be important in a graduate class or a professional journal, but they are woefully out of place in an introductory textbook. This book is a perfect example of what is wrong with the modern technocratic university: overspecialized PhDs, preoccupied with methodology, writing for each other, and unable to communicate with anyone outside their disciplines. It is a lousy tool for teaching and learning. If I were you I'd run screaming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is Christmas","review":"Well this came in the original plastic and it was awesome.

My boyfriend who is American really wanted to have this on DVD. He always told me how funny it was. And he is absolutely right. From the first episode I really got hooked on it. It's especially the character of Gabe Kaplan who's responsible for cracking myself up. I have sometimes the feeling that he had difficulties to contain himself when he was telling the jokes or making funny faces. I really love this guy. He is so sweet and I was wondering why you have never heard of him again. However, you have to love the other characters, too, like, e. g. Horshack. His laughter alone is hilarious.I can only recommend the first season and hope this will not be the last one. I have become an addict ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good old classic","review":"If your a TV buff, then this is a must have for your collection. Even tho the show was before my time, the jokes and the catch phrases still make me laugh. The show is about a group of trouble makers and their goodhearted teacher. The material maybe out of date(1970s), but it's not out of style. Everybody can relate to a least of the students, whether its Vinnie Barbarino or Boom Boom Washington. I especially enjoyed the uncle/aunt jokes that Mr. Kotter play by Gabe Kaplan tells at the beginning and the end of each episode. This is a great gift for your folks, who will have fond memories of watching this show when they were young. You'll also get a laugh over the crazy hairdos and 70s slang.This is last of the best sitcoms from the 70s. Why the last, you ask? Cuz when they made it, they broke the mold. :)Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WLCOME BACK WELCOME BACK WELCOME BACK","review":"I AS MANY GREW UP WATCHING THIS SERIES AS A KID, THE MEMORIES INSTILLED IN MY MIND FOREVER.

Ugh. I Netflixed disc one and found the experience jarring; in a bad way. I still like Gabe, still like that old theme song, actually liked the retrospective, but the rest is so... unfunny. The sweathogs themselves are so over the top, unnatural, and abrasive I thank God I didn't buy the set on day one which I almost had.

I don't recommend this dvd set to people who are new to the show and/or are not from the time period that it aired during, as comedy and what's considered funny doesn't always cross smoothly from one generation to another. I haven't watched one bit of it, but as I said before, the person I bought it for says \\"It's absolutely as awesome as it was back then, and I CAN'T wait for the next season to be released!!!\\"Her rating: \\"11/10\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"cookware","review":"You get what you pay for .

This book (along with several others) helped me decide NOT to go - and I've not regretted the decision. While there are other books like this, this one was one of the better ones (I read almost a dozen)."},{"rating":"1","title":"You probably don't need this book","review":"I picked up this book after I had been accepted to a law school, but now I feel it was a waste of money. For one thing, I feel that the information is so generic, that any student who has talked someone who is in (or has recently been to) law school or their pre-law advisor would know this. This is espicaly true with the application process. One feeling I got from the book was that it was intended for a freshman in college who is thinking about going about law school. If you are a junior or senior, you probably know the stuff in the book. All and all, not bad but I suggest \\"How to Succeed in Law School\\" by Gary Munneke if you want to know what law school itself is about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very weak book in comparison to others of the same type.","review":"After he persuades you not to go to law school, he gives very short and common descriptions of what law school is like.

After reading this utterly fascinating little book, I am beside myself with curiosity. What strange, twisted mind would devote (waste?) thirty years of her life to researching Beethoven and produce a book like this?It is too easy, I suppose, to pick on the author. After all, her grasp of European political history seems to come from watching History Channel programs. The writing reminds me of the captions in my high school yearbook, the knowledge of current musicological research limited to the aforementioned History Channel programs, with maybe a PBS special or two thrown in.All in all, the author reminds me of a pathetic little girl who has a desperate crush on an older boy. Unable to bear it when the object of her affection behaves badly, she spends her time writing long love letters in her diary.And then for some reason it gets published as a book! Who would have thought!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing quality","review":"I bought this item to help complete a collection of the series. I was wonderfully surprised with the condition the item was in."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the in depth person","review":"These episodes begin to focus not on the superficial happenings of Tokyo-3, but rather with the mental states of the pilots, and the pasts of each of the characters. This is my favorite part of the series, save the very end, because it is a time in the story when all is relatively well, and you are familiar with the the character's quirks. Yet still it comes before the series' ultimate end. I would reccomend the entire evangelion series (26 episodes) to everyone on Earth. It surpasses every film I have seen to date. Currently though I think this is the most farthest that ADV has come in their conversion to DVD of the series, and still I have yet to see even the first collection in a brick-and-mortar store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good video... poor spanish audio...","review":"Unfortunately the people at ADV have made a very bad work with the spanish audio, at least on volumes 4 and 5.

The sound is very uneven and though the restoration must have been very complex it is still difficult to really appreciate what Caruso truly sounded like. Unfortunately, I do not think this CD portrays Caruso as the great tenor he was to the public of his day. An interesting CD to listen to, but gives little to accurately compare him to modern day tenors such as Lanza, Domingo, Pavarotti and Carreras. Interesting as a piece of the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of FY Manga","review":"I have read all four of the Fushigi Yugi manga that are currently out (and am anxiously awaiting November 9th ^_^) and the story in Vol. 3 is by far the best of all of them. While it had a lot of light notes stuck in here and there (especially in Chichiri's few appearances), the overall mood of the story was full of suspense, most definitely when Miaka snuck out of Hong-nan and when Yui's secret was revealed. The part concerning Yui, Miaka, and Tamahome was especially sad and tragic. This is a must-read for all fans of manga! Pick this book up and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every page is exciting","review":"WOW, what can I say this book was so exciting. Yu Watase knows how to write her Manga's.

And of course Norman Treigle is excellent too (although it's a matter of preference of baritone or mezzo).

That was about 40 years ago and to this day I can \\"hear\\" Sills and Treigle and the rest. They were opening a door which has never been closed. Handel would have fainted.

And, Maureen Forrester's rich, deep contralto (she sings Cornelia) is a real treat. She died in 2010 after a decade-long battle with Alzheimer's Disease, a tragic end for such a gifted performer whose thrilling voice enchanted millions for several decades.Calling this lovely version of the opera \\"ear candy\\" is trite, however accurate it may be; but Rudel's interpretation of the great composer is first-rate. A must for all who love Handel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Renee Fleming is a great diva","review":"Fleming's Handel is the standard.

Billy Zane is a guy with a clouded past, who decides to use an experimental drug to restore his memory. Only to vividly remember a murder he witnessed, but was it his memory or someone else's? I don't like Zane one bit, but in this movie, he's pure genius. What was really striking about this film, (especially since it's a low budget b-movie), was the imagery. Everything is so vibrate and methodically done. First time director, Bennett Davlin, really has you sitting on the edge of your seat. It really feels like you're alongside Zane, seeing what he sees. As for the ending, I never saw it coming. I've seen a lot of films, and you've got to have a pretty good story to surprise me!

When atheists and non-Christians try to do this to persuade others, they often don't oppose everything but oppose key events or try to diminish their importance. This is the tactic that Romer is using! Because he can't prove something happened, it doesn't mean it didn't happen... it simply means his investigation is lacking! I would not recommend this series to any serious Christian!!! Very disappointed. I seriously wonder if Romer is a Christian... I'm betting he isn't!!! What is interesting is if you Google \\"Is John Romer an atheist?\\" you will find many references by atheists who like Romer's Testament. This is all the info I need to know.

It works quite well for my Panasonic AG-DVX100a (four pounds). However I would recommend the 3130 head instead. It supports more weight and has a side release that wouldn't be as easily blocked by larger camcorders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk - Flawed Design","review":"700RC2 head is flawed.The head clamps onto a quick release plate mounted on the bottom of your camera. The plate is nice and makes a secure connection to the camera without tools/coins.Unfortunately the head's clamping lever cannot fully rotate when your camera is on the head. Only very thin camcorders will work with this plate/head design. My Beachtech box impedes the lever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Bogen's standards! Get the 701RC2 instead!","review":"I accidentally purchased this video head instead of the 701RC2. Big boo-boo! This video head is not built to the ordinary standards of Bogen. It is flimsy by comparison to the 701RC2, not as smooth and does not have an adjustable sliding base plate. Worse, the rapid connect plate is not clamped in with a lever as you would ordinarily expect but requires the screwing down of a clamp which takes longer. Adding insult to injury, the lever screw is blocked by your camera when it is on the quick release plate interfering with the securing of the video camera.This is, to say the least, a poorly thought out video head and the ONLY benefit it offers over the MUCH superior 701RC2 is this it is slightly lighter, but achieves this by sacrificing build quality and important features.Unless you have held and operating this video head and know it is precisely what you want do not risk purchasing it. Purchase instead the far superior 701RC2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Manfrotto 700RC2 Mini Video Head","review":"This product is pretty much exactly what it states. The movement is very fluid and easy to control, and the head, like most Manfrotto equipment, is well built. I wouldn't use it for any medium heavy to heavy equipment, it is not built for that, but for small to medium equipment it works really well. The plate is a little laborious to change, if you really need to do quick changes with multiple pieces of equipment, it lacks a some. If you have 15 to 20 seconds to make your change (assuming you have a plate on each piece of equipment), then you should be fine. I have overall been very satisfied with the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky, but great","review":"The screw interferes with my camera if I have the battery grip on it. There needs to be a perfect storm in order for it to work easily. I hate the RC2 plates, but I have several and I have to admit, they are sturdy and I feel secure with my camera on it. For what this is (a $75 head) I really can't complain. The handle comes off and the head stows perfectly in my luggage for travel. The handle is adjustable and gives me a nice, smooth pan or tilt. It offers limited movement, but it's also very small, sturdy and easily portable. I gotta say...I'm always looking at new heads, but I always end up sticking with this one because it works. And, like an old relationship, I may complain or get tired of it, but in the end I really do love it. I just have to complain about something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great low cost video head","review":"I use a Sony Handycam on this head, and it helps me produce smooth pans in my vacation videos.

Sometimes it works from 30 feet other times we must go stand if front of the detector before it will operate.

The Ribbon Cable is a bit of a nusance, but a minor issue. My only other suggestion would be to leave the Sticky pads off the IR blasters so the end user can orient the IR blaster how they need to. I found that some of my pieces wouldn;t work with the Blaster just stuck and facing over the top. I moved the sticky pad to the front of the blaster so I could place it directly on the Eye of the unit I wanted.Works flawlessly with the Harmoney Remote and every peice in my HT.Be mindful of what retailer you order form here.

Setup was nothing beyond plugging it in. I'm a newbie, and setting up a PC to run SageTV in a closet several rooms away was daunting. The easiest part was the Hotlink. It just reads in one room, repeats in another. That simple. I had looked at the pyramids, the little UFO things, etc. But due to reviews, I went with Hotlink.I don't normally do reviews, and this is my first one on Amazon. I just had to say something. I contacted them recently because I did have a problem, which was completely my fault. I had an accident with a part during a recent move and didn't know how to fix it. They responded immediately, and were very supportive on how to fix what I had screwed up. Sometimes you hate to email folks when you know it was your fault, but they were on top of how to fix my problem. Couldn't recommend them more.It works just like it says, and the support is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as advertised","review":"Really impressive product.

The provided instructions were good and easy to followI hooked this up to power a TIVO unit and a DVD player, and it has the capability to take on three more devices which were hidden behind a wooden cabinet door. Gone are the days of opening up the door so the TIVO, for example, can have line of sight to the remote control.I don't know about the competition's products, but if you are searching for an RF extender stop shopping now as this will do everything.

I have all my gear tucked in a closet with a hardwood door, so I taped the receiver eye on the floor right next to the door jamb and just barely poking out underneath the door.

The product design is very simple w/power cable, receiver eye/cable, transmitter LEDs/ribbon cable, and module.The receiver works well with the plasma, although it took some tweaking to position the receiver eye to minimize interference from the plamsa. Once positioned the unit works great with all of my a/v components. The module is small and easily hides behind my a/v components.There is one annoying problem. There is a confirmation LED that is part of the ribbon cable for the transmitter LEDs. The confirmation LED confirms a signal was received from you remote (anytime a button is pushed) by the unit. In applications where your TV is more that 10ft away from your a/v components it is not possible to mount the confirmation LED where it is visable from your TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"What can I say... These things work great! The eye cable was perfectly long enough for me. The range on the Eye is Awesome. I can be on my porch and change the cd player in the living room.

It seemed to control everything else just fine, but there was absolutely no response from the VIP 1225. That leads me to believe that Hot Link Pro can't reproduce a high enough frequency signal or something. I'm familiar with interference and saturation in IR systems, but with those problems you usually see SOME response. In those cases the device responds a little (maybe the wrong thing happens, or something only happens intermittently), but in this case, the device didn't respond ever while all other devices were working fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!!","review":"I bought this thing for my home theater when I decided to hide the components in a closet.

I also ran the sensor over the top wall of the closet and into the family room area and screwed it in to a floor joist (my basement ceiling is open and I painted all the joists and pipes black).

The IR receiver becomes completely jammed with spurious IR from the television. Adjusting the location of the eye does not help. It might work in one location during the evening but during the day it does not. It's basically a complete waste of money if you have a late model large LCD screen.I'm an electrical engineer, and why it does not come with an IR noise filter is beyond me.

Anyway, the music and this band reflect what I see as the high point in Ellington's career. It's also interesting to note that record producers during his hey-day made some lousy choices in material for the band to record: it's fun to hear some schmaltz and novelty songs sprinkled in amongst the musical diamonds shining in this collection.

What I *did* notice was that the backpack was poorly made. After less than a year of light-to-medium use, many of the zippers began to fail. Some I was able to \\"fix\\" using pliers to crimp them back onto the teeth, but once the stitching on the main pocket zipper pulled away from the backpack fabric itself, I gave up.Maybe that's a typical lifespan for an ergonomic backpack, but my LL Bean bags were so durable I often wound up getting rid of them after 5 years when I got sick of them, rather than because they broke."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read book - To me, just the best book written on Cyprus ever.","review":"To me it is the best book written on Cyprus ever.There should be a new edition.I already had this book and I ordrered a new one to offer it to a friend.This book is interesting because it goes back to the 50s and shows the mechanism of Turkish propaganda concerning the period between the 50s and 1974.I don't agree with some comments here.

This DVD is well worth the price to see Halle Berry's impressive cocoa casabas on full unclad display.It also stars John Travolta as an anti-terrorism agent or something, and it has Halle Berry nude in it. To repeat, Halle Berry appears nude for a scene in Swordfish. If you would like to see Halle Berry nude anytime you want I would recommend buying this DVD. You can do what I do and pause that part so you can look at Halle Berry nude for as long as you like. (I'm trying to make it into a poster.)

The live recording is muddled and poorly mixed, and the piano is lost among the rest of the orchestra in parts. In addition, Cliburn is not at his best, missing notes and seemingly off in his pacing. The Prokofiev is a decent enough recording, but there are better versions of the Rachmaninoff No. 3 available (e.g. Ashkenazy, complete set of 1-4 on the Decca double) to make this disc no better than a supplemental recording for an otherwise complete collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality .

We tried our daughter in a friend's Nautilus and it was too deep for her.3) High weight and height limits!4) Doesn't take up much more space than the Roundabout.We did have trouble installing it in the back center of my Maxima.

Thankfully, we had the Forrester or else we would have had to return this seat and get something else. Other than that, it seems to be a nice seat made well. The only other thing I wish it had were cup holders, but we can work around that one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Carseat, Too BIG","review":"This is a great car seat, but installing it was very difficult.

I have a Honda Accord and I would not put it in anything smaller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other than it being so big, it's great so far","review":"We bought this for our three year old, who just grew out of his roundabout.

My son is quite tall for his age and this seat will last him a long time in a 5 point harness. This seat is also very comfortable- even though I wouldn't be able to strap in I can sit in it! My son calls it his rocket ship seat and at 3 is still happy in it. The only thing I would improve is adding a strip of velcro on the straps to hold them out(it has elastics that are pretty useless)like the marathon has.

This means that it is not convenient to move it from car to car every day! Once you install it, it should ideally stay in that car. It does not install as easily (partly because it is heavy and unwieldy to maneuver). Despite following the instructions, I still don't feel that the car seat is anchored as solidly as if I was anchoring a Britax Marathon.Background: We have always use Britax. When our daughter outgrows her Britax Marathon we got a Britax Regent. The Regent is very good and it works fine, we've used it for a year (It's just hard to beat Britax Marathon; I think its the best car seat ever). BTW, all Britax carseats really have a solid construction compare to other car seats I have inspected when I shopped around in the last 5 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big, but that's why I chose it","review":"Of any 5-point harness seats I could have purchased for my 3.5 year old daughter I feel I got the best one. I drive a *small* Jetta (2000) and it is a very tight fit, but I don't know any other seat for her weight range (over 40 lbs.) would have been any smaller. It is a little difficult to install as the width of the seatbelt/seat is more narrow than it should be, but it is still secure. My daughter seems very comfortable in it as she's been falling asleep more frequently on our half hour drive every morning than she had in her old seat. This was an upgrade for us from a smaller Britax model."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfy!","review":"I needed a new car seat for my 3 and a half year old and I started looking at the reviews for the Britax Regent. I wanted him to be comfortable and get something that would last. Well, he loves it and he just looks SO comfortable in it all the time.

I love how low it sits. Our 3 yr old can climb in by herself, and she likes that too. She also loves the print. She's in the middle seat of our Suburban, she loves being able to look right out the window in her big girl seat.She is 39inches tall and 36lbs. She's on the first setting for the shoulder straps.The only thing that bothers me about this carseat, is how easily the straps get twisted. Every single time we take her in and out of the seat, the straps are twisted. It's very annoying.Other then that, this seat will last her until she's the height for an adult seatbelt."},{"rating":"1","title":"No good for skinny kids","review":"I read somewhere that this seat used to be called the \\"Husky\\" and I can understand why. The closest crotch strap placement still makes for a very roomy fit for my skinny 3-year-old. He moves around so much within the straps even when they are pulled tight. I spent LOTS of money getting 2 of these seats for our 2 cars and now I'm going to have to get new seats because my son really isn't safe and secure. A disappointment to say the least. I have the Britax Roundabouts as well and LOVE those."},{"rating":"2","title":"Importance of a five point harness car seat. 7 year old still in","review":"Best car seat available. Good price, easy to install. We feel safe and secure. Plenty of room to grow for my 4 year old, and also a comfortable and safe seat for my 7 year old. Better than the average booster that is held only by an adult seat belt. Tether anchor gives added security. Would NOT buy any other car seat. We have a small SUV and the seat is very large, so we had to give up the \\"third\\" middle seat between the two Regents but SO WORTH it for the saftey.

True, it is a large seat, and I would recommend that you try it out at a local store first to see if it fits in your car. However, it is solid. Between the LATCH and the top tether, it is not going anywhere. My son is very comfortable in it. I plan to buy the same one for my 9 month old once she meets the minimum requirements for it. I have owned Gracos and Evenflos. Nothing compares to this Britax as far as quality is concerned. Plus, I have peace of mind knowing that my son is safely in a 5 pt harness for many years now.

My only qualm about this, and really about Britax in general, is that when you buckle your child in, there isn't always an audible \\"click\\" that lets you know it's secure.

He and Tiffani Theissen look like your all-American couple, but one of them is a manipulator of the first order, and the other is vulnerable and trusting.

Each chapter does a good job of covering the core material but it also adds alot of extra information that will probably not be seen on the test. In fact, in the nuclear chemistry section, the book goes into sub atomic particles known as quarks, which havent been seen on the test in ages. The practice tests at first are very pessimistic and are quite difficult.Yet, if you do study this book completely, take the practice test and correct your answers, there is no reason you shouldnt get an 800 on the SAT II. I found the exaggerated difficulty annoying at sometimes, but, its a tough way of forcing you to do good. In short, if you have plenty of time to prepare for the SAT II, buy this book, and do it cover to cover. Your results should be wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book After the APs.","review":"This year, I took Chemistry and scored A. I decided to take the Chemistry SAT before I forget everything. I bought the Barron's Chem book and discovered that I didn't know half of the stuff. I look at all my fellow test-takers; they are juniors who have completed AP Chemistry.

It will really help."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extraneous info...myriad typos","review":"This book has a lot of information in it, but the extraneous matter shifts your focus away from the important stuff that's actually covered on the test.

Don't buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY FROM THIS BOOK!!!","review":"Way too much unneccessary information. It's too compact. Most of the stuff do not appear on the real SAT II.

First, it will teach your guinea pigs to be picky eaters. Second, alfalfa based products are for younger guinea pigs, preferably under the age of one years old. Third, about 80% of the ingredients are unhealthy for your pig (seeds, corn, dried fruit, etc.). The only dried fruit (given as treat ONLY) I would recommend is a couple of raisins every so often.The best pellets to buy are alfalfa based for younger pigs or timothy hay based for older pigs.

Just the opposite: Deprivation can't be sustained, and the resulting binges cause you to gain more than you lost and sentence you to a lifetime of such cycles. Rob Stevens breaks that cycle and restores eating and food to their rightful places in our lives. It's simple: Eat when and what you want WHEN HUNGRY, and STOP when no longer hungry, as opposed to eating until full or stuffed.His explanation of why slim people enjoy food more than heavy people is priceless.Buy this book.

This book I think delves more into the psychological aspects of overeating and doesn't have the workbook stuff in it that wasn't helpful to me. Anyway, this author has a more authentic history of a lifetime struggle with obesity and, being the same way myself, I connected with him and have started to change my relationship with food like I never could before. He also has a website:www.thintuition.com. No I don't work for this guy but this the best book I have ever read that examines how it's not about what/how much you eat but why and how it is your mind and the culture that causes an unhealthy relationship with food.

The music is good, but I think only Scriabin's fans enjoy it. The sonatas n 5 and 3, are very strong. Some preludes are like the sonatas, but the others are like Chopin's ones (but stronger). However, I think the best pieces on this CD are the etudes. They are the most important pieces written by Scriabin and you can see this when you hear them, because they are prettier than the preludes or the sonatas. When I hear this etudes, I think I'm going to cry. Horowitz's interpretation is fantastic. He plays Scriabin like anybody.

Nassar's information was cursory at best, the format was very basic, I honestly did not walk away with one nugget of insight.

I just couldn't find anything redeeming in this book whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw the book away","review":"If I want to read about one's political views then I would buy a book just about that subject. I do not care to have one's political views crammed down my throat in a work of fiction. I found the political bs so rampant in this book that I threw it away before I was even a third of the way done with it.Advice to Keith Ablow...find another line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Series Fodder","review":"Ablow is ordinarily one of my favorites--but like many authors in fiction these days, they can't keep their anti-Bush politics to themselves. This book seems written with a major theme being that Bush is killing people to make the world a \\"better\\" place. Our Architect in this story does just that; and when we discover how sick and twisted he is for trying to \\"better\\" a family by removing its black sheep, we're supposed to realize the Bush administration is no different.Come on Ablow! You're better than that! This book is short--lots of double spacing, less than 300 pages, and dividing the story into lots of chapters. It's a political manifesto, nothing more. Clevenger doesn't change his relationships with his son, lover, or business partner. This book is stagnant liberal mumbo jumbo, written (it seems) just to keep up with a contract for the Clevenger series."},{"rating":"1","title":"First time and last time reader","review":"This is the first book I've read by this author so maybe I'm missing something. I liked the idea of this book - it sounded like a great mystery. Unfortunately, it wasn't. The mystery takes second place to all the drama in the main character's life - I never got a good feel for the bad guy, why he became the way he did, how he continued to get away with it time & again, why everyone protected him. I didn't feel the victim's reactions were believable - they should have felt at least some pain or guilt over the loss of a semi-loved one. And the end just left me flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and disappointing","review":"Unlike Keith Ablow's other books, this one really stank. Normally his books are page turning thrillers but this one was completely the opposite. This book is 447 pages long and it could have easily been 250 pages instead. There's no suspense or guess work in this book. If you like the Frank Clevenger series, you won't miss anything if you skip this one. Overall, I thought it to be a slow and disappointing read, but it won't deter me from reading other books by Keith Ablow. This one is not recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"His Best","review":"I must say that this is one of my favorite Keith Ablow novels to date. Though he brings in the common villian who is brainwashed by his religious beliefs, he puts a unique spin on it. What also caught my interest was the way Ablow integrated the secret society of the Skull and Bones, which is the oldest and most prestigious of Yales 7 secret societies, that was established in 1832. President Bush is rumored to be a member among other powerful figures.This was a highly entertaining and fascinating novel. The cliched 'hard to put down' is suitable for this novel.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"good organizer","review":"This works well to keep thread organized.

It is not a philosophical analysis of psychology as a science or a field of research activity. Rather, it analysis common-sense (folk) psychology in the light of contemporary cognitive science and philosophy.

I don't microwave them or put them in the dishwasher though because I don't want to subject them to the heat. I've had tupperware tops become unusable after dishwasher use.The tops fit so snugly yet are easy to remove when needed. I used them as little storage containers on my counter tops sometimes because they are also very pretty for the decor (we have a French blue kitchen).I noticed another person who asked why there was no mention of cooking them in microwave... all plastic gives off toxins when subject to higher heat. I always put cooled or cold food into these containers and use glass containers when re-heating or cooking in the microwave. As little storage bins I put uncooked rice or dried beans in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money wasted..","review":"I bought this case in addition to a rubber case.

The plotting is good, the characters are well-drawn, and the world he creates seems accurate (I'm a former resident of the DC suburbs). My only problem with the book is that, at times, it becomes too cruel. There's not really any unnecessary violence, or excessive gore. But there are some painful moments.Even so, it's a Hillerman, which means that it has a solid plot and good character development. Not the best place to start reading the series, perhaps. But worth a look if you like Hillerman."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Read Better","review":"In the beginning, it was the type of book that you just didn't feel the need to keep reading because it wasn't really going anywhere, but toward the end it was harder to put down.

I've read several of Hillerman's past books, but it's been a while and I had hoped that things may have improved, but it's not so.

I was sad when each ended, and could barely wait to get the next one from the library...until this one. The plot is convoluted and far fetched with a LOT of holes, and I found the setting ugly and depressing, especially the character of the hit man. (This is the second hit man Hillerman's given us who owes it all to his unhealthy attachment to a disfunctional mama. Hmmmm...) I skimmed the last 4 chapters because I was tired of both the book and the setting...I just wanted it to see how it ended and be done with it because I was not enjoying the experience as I usually do.So as other reviewers have advised: don't start here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hillerman Navajo mysteries","review":"Reading one of these novels always leaves me with the desire to read another one.

Here's why: Mindless are pretty original but they aren't talented musicans! They suck!!! Take away the programed drums and all you have is Jimmy Urine's voice, the band's only asset. Which is to say that he can rap and squeal,- pretty much standard in today's nu-metal scene.So why are there so many MSI fans? Their gimic is that they combine all these styles- punk, rap, and various beats to make a sound that hasn't been mass-produced yet. Their problem is that they can't pull off a decent rendition of any of them. Add poor sound quality and you get a Cd that's interesting for a few listens but wears thin before you realize it has no substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth $5.00","review":"I love MSI, but this album leans more towards rap music and has almost no electronic sounds in it! Actually, \\"Diabolical\\" is the best track on the album and appears to be the only perfect track on the album with it's use of electronica even though it's only 103 seconds long!Keep in mind the album cover along with the track titles are meant to get attention, but once you listen to the tracks you'll only be disappointed! Example: the track \\"Hail Satan\\" is just the track \\"Tornado\\" repeated with an extra 7 seconds added to the track of him saying \\"Hail Satan\\" before the song starts! The entire album is misleading and looks much better than it sounds!It's nice to see how MSI keeps getting better with each new album, but this album may be out of print for a very good reason!

They are terrible live performers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free your mind","review":"\\"Substance\\" is what you'd like to hear, because all the pop songs all contain the same crap. MSI mocks every other band's crap, and makes excellent music. Several of these songs are even parodies, like Grab the Mic, and Bite Your Rhymes (which even explains their method).

So, of course, I went to find the CD and it exceeded all my expectations (which is not very easy to do.)Their music could be described as nu-metal, but contains none of the aggravating flaws that comes with the genre. The lead singer, Jimmy Urine, growls and squeals with ease and the guitar riffs and drum beats are unconventional enough to make a great listen.

I think the chemistry between Martha and the Doctor is excellent, but the problem is obviously with the writers who hesitate in writing a full fledged romance between the interracial couple.Season Four is currently on television and Martha's return has been recently broadcast and now she is supposedly engaged to a human doctor who is currently working in Africa; what a cop-out.Actually, Martha Jones (I love that name), is too good for the Doctor, but nonetheless the writers should have more courage regarding Martha and Doctor Who's romantic relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Whos is the best show ever","review":"Well at first I was a skeptic that Freema Agyeman wasn't going to be good, or wouldn't even fit into the show, but I was wrong, she did an awesome job, not good as Rose though but still this season was awesome, you learn alot about Captain Jack and The Doctor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best Doctor Who season yet, but ...","review":"This is probably the best season of Doctor Who yet. While there were a few subpar episodes, there were no stinkers. And the run that started with Human Nature and continued through the end of the season -- a run that included Blink, which should walk away with next year's Hugo award -- was outstanding.So, why isn't this item amongst Amazon's best sellers? Easy -- it is overpriced. It's nearly twice the price of most other DVD TV seasons -- Heroes, Lost, etc. -- even though it's a shorter season. I loved the season but haven't bought it, because I think the price is outrageous, and I'm willing to wait until it's on a better sale (putting up with my recorded-from-the-SciFi-network copies until then).

I can't say I enjoyed it as much simply because I am a devoted Doctor/Rose shipper and the Martha line just didn't work for me like Rose did. David Tennant is a knockout in his second series as the Doctor - he alone makes the series worth watching.The beginning of the series, starts weakly, almost cliched; however, the series quickly gains ground and ends on a strong note leaving viewers panting for the next series - in which Rose returns YEAH! It is a shame that we won't be able to view it in the States until the DVDs come out November next.Over all, the third series is definitely worth purchasing and is a worthy addition to the life of any Whovian.

Old favorites like the Daleks and Cybermen are still after him but the Doctor is being challenged more than ever he even becomes a human!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best!","review":"I can't tell you how much I enjoyed this episode. The Doctor is only in it briefly, but his presence is essential. The main character, Sally, is so good, she makes you wish she had become a companion. This is an episode where the Weeping Angels are truly terrifying. In The Angels Take Manhattan...they become more of a parody. They lost what made them terrifying. Or, maybe the story just didn't carry much weight for me. I cared very little for the two main characters affected and cared much more for the two I didn't even know in this episode. There are handfuls of Doctor Who episodes that are \\"must sees\\" and this is definitely one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite","review":"Blink is one of my favorite Dr. Who episodes. I've watched it multiple times on netflix and any other ways I can. I can almost quote the whole thing. The great thing about this episode is that it doesn't matter if you have yet to see the begining episodes. Blink can sorta stand alone as its own episode as long as you know the basics to Dr. Who. If you are contemplating watching I would say to you\\" Don't blink, don't even blink. Blink and your dead. They're fast, faster than you could ever know. Don't turn your back, don't look away and don't blink. Good luck\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit-N-Miss","review":"This season is watch-able and at times quite good, but unfortunately the episodes are very hit-n-miss.

Enjoy !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tennant IS the Doctor","review":"Never thought I would like Tennat in the role of the good old Doctor, but not only has he surpassed my expectations, he is now close to, if not my favorite of all the Doctors, and that is really saying something, as I've been of the show all my life and a die hard Baker, Pertwee, and Hartnell fan. Tennant brings so much charm to the role, and his performance is nuanced. The stories in this set bring it to life. The Doctor actually falls in love and for a second, actually contemplates maintaining a completely fabricated existence just to love and be loved, something that has eluded the Doctor due to his mission and responsibilities as the last(or is he????) of the time lords. This season is made all the more perfect by the introduction of Martha. I loved Piper, and thought I'd have troubel adjusting to a new companion, but Martha is brilliant and the chemistry between her and the Doctor is not only evident but obvious. This set is a gem"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Doctor Who","review":"I love this Purchase of Doctor who and I just love the series.My purcase came in on time and in beautiful condition.I am well pleased.Angela Miller"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Doctor \\"Is In\\"","review":"Another roller coaster season. This time, we see more heartache for the Doctor. He falls in love and has to leave. He finds and loses persons like himself and is again bereft. The comedy is fast and fun.

Great casting, great writing, and a rollicking good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doctor Who - The Complete Third Series","review":"Although I watched the series during its regularly scheduled season, it's all the better having it on DVD to watch commercial free.

I didn't think Billie Piper could be replaced, but Freema Agyeman was every bit as good and John Barrowman is an excellent addition. There are some really creative episodes as usual, my favorite being Blink, which like some of the other episodes that really add life to the series wasn't written by Russell Davies, the creator and producer. Oh, by the way, if you watch Torchwood, you will need to catch up on Doctor Who, especially seasons 1 and 2 to fully understand everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Deal for Dr. Who fans","review":"This is the best price I have found for season three.

I was told this was 'Used - Very Good'. 3 out of 6 discs had scratches that would not allow them to play. Somehow the seller had a 98% satisfactory rate but after receiving my product I found numerous reviews stating Roxborough makes false claims of the quality and never responded to customer contact.

I've been a long-time fan of the Doctor (going back to the 1970's). While I certainly intend to buy this series, I think the pricing of $89.99 for thirteen 45-minute episodes is outrageous! There are TV series with twenty-two 45-minute episodes that run half the price of what is being charged here! Why such a high price?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven Collection of B and Film Noir Movies.","review":"This huge collection of public domain, mostly b&w films, is a mixed bag. Worthy movies like Detour, Impact, The Stranger,and others found here, are included in countless other collections by different packagers. But this is the biggest of them all. While it may seem like a great bargain at less than a dollar a disk, more than a few of the movies are not watchable because of poor, noisy sound and fuzzy images. Mill Creek did not seek out the best prints to dump onto DVD. Also, not all the films in the collection are classic \\"oldies.\\" Several are obscure dogs from the 1970s and later. Finally, locating a film in the collection to watch is a pain. Mills Creek did not include an index identifying the location of each film on the 60 disc. You have to thumb through the all the discs and read the contents on both sides of the paper sleeves to locate your movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab the popcorn and...","review":"enjoy some really great old movies.While I will admit I am a great fan of these Mill Creek sets and have all 4 of the 250 collections (Horror, Family, Westerns & Mystery) along with several of the 50 movie packs this set is by far my favorite of the group. The price is right and pretty much across the board the movies are fun to watch; though there are a few stinkers in the bunch and the quality though not the best always only adds to the ambiance of these great old movies. Top off 250 old mystery movies with great packaging and you have many memorable evenings of good old fashioned fun family entertainment.I you are a video snob and only want completely digitally remastered movies then keep looking because that is not what you are going to get with this or any of the sets Mill Creek has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value -- Lots of Good Movies","review":"This is a great value -- 250 mostly good/fun mystery \\"B\\" grade movies.

When the \\"crazy\\" father/grandfather was discovered to be purchasing a large amount of land, the first thing that entered the heads of his daughter, her husband and his grandson Matt was the loss of their inheritance.

The dialogue is terrific and the banter between stuck-up Maddie and laid-back Phil gave me lots of smiles. Randy makes a wonderful secondary character as Maddie's best friend while Pam makes a classic villain. I especially loved the sub-plot of the relationship between Phil and his daughter, Melissa, who ended up saving the day. The complex issues of single motherhood, abortion, homosexuality, and alcohol/drug abuse were dealt with sensitively and really added to the story line. This book is a cut above your usual romance and I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotional drama","review":"An emotional roller coaster.

The characters are fun, moral people and there are some good lessons about relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed - Didn't finish","review":"I'm afraid that I was disappointed by this book. In fact, I couldn't even make myself finish it. I thought that both the main characters were too shallow (for me) to find any way to care about their story. On a positive note, the author did do a good job with describing settings well enough that I could picture them in my mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would have added an extra star but...","review":"I liked this book, I loved the mystical Moon Goddess/Dream Man relationship. I did take exception to one aspect that was jarringly wrong. An administrative school official seemed awfully unconcerned about the sale and distribution of drugs to her school kids. She was aware of drug sales and specifically who was doing the selling, and did not report it to anyone, she just let it go. This seemed to make drugs in the schools an insignificant occurrence. It would not have brought the cuteness of the storyline down to have taken this seriously and taken some action although it may have affected part of the action later in the story (although with all those inter-related country-folk, maybe not).Other than that, this was a charming, light-hearted story with a whisper of the paranormal and mysticism that I found delightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great read...","review":"Small town Americana comes alive in this magical story, grounded in the reality of some very likeable but quirky characters. Maddie and Phil exorcise their demons under the glow of a full moon hanging over Beaver Cove, Arkansas.

The stereo sound is excellent on my equipment - the ensembles and louder choral sections congeal a bit, but that was how things were in 1967. However, the solo voices are caught superbly and what voices! Bergonzi and Price were at the peaks of their careers, and both offer masterclasses in great Verdi singing. The underrated Mario Sereni gives what for me is his finest recorded performance. Maestro Schippers keeps eveything moving and shows consideration or the superb cast he was given to work with. Yes a great Verdi recording!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Ernani ever recorded","review":"Two of the best verdian interpreter of all time make this one of the best Verdian collectables available.

First, it cannot handle the pressure of an outdoor faucet - why they even bother with pretending you need an adapter for household faucets is beyond me - it can only (sort of) work at indoor faucet pressures, so why not just manufacture it that way. Second, the overall construction is VERY flimsy; had I not returned it, I seriously doubt it would have held up for any reasonable length of time. Lastly, the adjustable tip was a joke - all it did was change the direction of the poorly-defined spray pattern (perhaps because it couldn't handle the pressure, but I tried it with my faucet set at barely a trickle with no better outcome). Great concept, but this one's not the one to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"Not well made at all.

Furthermore, her dream of becoming a world class designer and make her own clothes is always there - except that nobody in her family supports her on this as a matter of fact they call it her little sewing experiments.This book is written with humour and a weary eye at relationships.

It is poorly written, the 'plot' makes no sense, the characters are so unlikely and unlikable. It's hard to believe that this author has had 3 books published! Who is her following? I can read anything and do love a good, or even a really bad, novel as much as the next girl but this book is boring and unengaging.

It was distracting.In fairness, as the author is first a journalist, the stylistic conventions of the Associated Press Style Manual concerning timeless facts, and the use of present and past tense may have weighed on his writing. Nevertheless, in good writing, the reader glides from sequence to sequence caught up in the story, unmindful of transitions.As for the characterizations, they were derivative, unoriginally evoking the psuedo hard-bitten prosecutorial cliches better found in gumshoe novels or TV's \\"Law and Order.\\" Chief Deputy D.A., O'Mara, for instance, is the prototypical \\"ball-breaker\\" D.A."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZ!!!!!!!!!!!!MOVIE SNORE FEST","review":"There have been low budget movies in the past that I've enjoyed,this is not one.The scenes with Lash LaRue and his whip made for some laughs,especially considering he had to been about 80 years old at least,but that was it for me.The makeup and effects consisted of some cheap masks and makeup bought at a halloween store.Boring and stupid in a really awful and lame kinda way.I couldn't bring myself to watch past the first 25 minutes,so I fast fowarded to the last 5 minutes to get it over with.Stay away from this Z grade boring mess.I'm not going to bore you any longer with details of this piece of poops storyline and plot.Your better off spending your 5 bucks on stocking up on toilet paper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suzie Martin","review":"Decided to buy this at a bargain bin price.

The problem is that the book is so full of examples, that it makes for a very difficult and painful read. There is no flow, no voice, just examples. And I mean multiple examples in one paragraph.

Sadly it isn't. It did arrive quickly ready to go, but after using it I'm not thrilled.

So when I heard about a book titled \\"The Tiger Woods Way - Secrets of Tiger Woods' Power-Swing Technique\\", I rushed out and ordered it from the States.While there are some interesting observations on Tiger's set up and swing listed in the book, I thought the book came up short. It is 160 pages long, but the essential contents could have been condensed to a ten page magazine article. As for pictures ... well there aren't many of them. It has sequences of Tiger's Driver and 7 iron swing from the front view but none from the down-the-line view.Well, did the book help me gain extra yardage? After all, that's the only reason anybody would buy this book. I'd have to say no. For an average player looking for extra 20 yards off the drive, I'd suggest a visit to a golf pro and learning what is fundamentally sound rather than trying to copy Tiger's idiosyncracies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome cd!!!","review":"Great Cd.

Our President is a vicious, abusive sociopath and deserves to be in jail, but Woodward makes it seem as though he was a victim more than a perpetrator. He does shed some light on the Starr investigation and the process that led to impeachment. If only Monica had been more forthcoming, if she hadn't shaded her testimony to protect Clinton, things might have turned out differently. If the media hadn't ignored Juanita Broaddrick anf forced Clinton to answer her charges his approval ratings wouldn't be as high as they are. Woodward doesn't really try to expose Clinton;like Monica, his loyalties are clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not vintage Woodward","review":"As a loyal Bob Woodward fan of long standing,I regret having to pan his latest effor \\"Shadow\\".

To place partial blame on previous occupants of the Office, as well as trying to lift his status by chopping down prevous Presidents is a repulsive tactic. Each individual should stand or fall on his own actions and merits.

This isn't investigative journalism, but an in depth look inside the head of a Washington insider - Bob himself.Woodward sullies Gerald Ford, calling him out of touch due to his lifestyle of golf tournaments and chartered jets, etc. I assume Bob is living it up in the hood somewhere, right? An ear to the ground while donning a backwards cap, eh?Bob also cracks on George H.W. Bush for not finding happiness. Is this man a shrink or a journalist?What happened to reporting? This book reports little, but shows a lot. Such as how the chattering class in D.C. is so connected that we rarely hear anything contrary. Matt Drudge dumped this book in the trash on his show and was right to do it.Poor Woodward, he used to be on top of his game, the best in town, but now he's fading fast.In fact, he's a shadow of his former self."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once an investigative reporter [\\"IR\\"], always an IR","review":"Bob Woodward has done it once again.

Shadow is his best to date. It is a \\"must read\\" for anyone even remotely interested in presidental politics and events that have made headlines over the last thirty years or so. All of us, if we would admit it, wished we were \\"flies on the wall\\" in the White House. Woodward gives us that opportunity. Buy this book.

This should be an interesting, readable book, but nothing will be make Woodward's style tolerable. He is duller than ever, and the book is a chore. He needs a ghost, but quick. A good case is made for the special prosecutor's office as running amok, but no one comes off well, which is the case with too much scrutiny. The legacy of Watergate? We know entirely too much about politicians."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book for non americans to understand inside poltics","review":"I think this book gives foreigners a great opportunity to understand the insides of American politics and the system and environment in which American President's evolve since the Watergate scandal.

Could it be because I panned the book? Nah!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Not what it appears!","review":"This book is not what it appears. It is a defense of Woodwards assesment of Nixon and watergate and attempts to imply that this is what brought down Clinton. THAT IS NOT THE CASE as Clinton was not only a lier but clearly immoral. There is no way Mr. Woodward can cover his Political leaning with this type of story. When you read this book it clearly is 50% Clinton and defending his and Hilary's actions under Whitewater and the Clintons' misconduct in the Whitehouse as President. In all fairness to Mr. Woodward this book is far below his standard of fair and honest reporting. Let admit it, this is no more than a defense of his reporting on Clinton and Nixon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liberal Press Finger Pointing With No Answers","review":"Bob Woodward, revered for his work in breaking the Watergate scandal, tries to take the higher ground and make a mockery of the Presidency. Never once does he suggest the press went too far and not once does he offer a solution to the downward trend in the Presidency that he writes of. This book is all commentary with interspersed quotes to make the uninformed reader believe Bob Woodward's views to be fact. To the reader beware...check your history books and keep your mind sharp. Anyone can point the finger--but the truly good book would offer a way out, a way forward, and a fair look at each of these men and the treatment they endured at the hands of a liberal press."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIberal Drivel","review":"Woodward writes like people actually care.

I read it, I question it and I cannot respect someone who went on TV and claimed Clinton's innocences only later to write a book about Clinton's cover up! If he had such information at that time he should have reported it, if he didn't and now does why print it? The hypocrisy of this former Naval Intelligence Officer turned journalist has no bounds. Neither does this book, therefore place it where it belongs, next to the scandal sheets or under them which ever, it does not matter, it lacks the very integrity it calls for by others.

Neither have been since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Shadow is a boring rehash of a subject that was explored ad nausium by the media, Ken Star, as well as the House and the Senate.

I was a bit disappointed at the emphasis on the Clinton Debacle...er, I mean Presidency...at the expense of more in-depth discussion of the other post-Watergate presidents that I remember less well. I also found I had to take Bob Woodward on trust for much of the detail in this book: the overwhelming majority of the quotes and other information in thes book were contributed by \\"a knowledgeable source.\\" Deep Throat all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"After I finished reading this book I asked myself whatever happened to Bob Woodward, the journalist? He is now a \\"Washington Insider\\", and like all other Washington Insiders his raison d'etre is to protect and perpetuate his own power.Woodward is overly generous to his sources and unfair to people who did not leak to him. He repeats the same point over and over \\"if only they were more open and honest\\". He never questions his own assumptions and sees nothing wrong with the current Salem era witchunts. There is no soul searching on his part as so how he contributed to the current atmosphere with Woodward wannabes peeping through bedroom keyholes.There are no fresh insights in this book, just a few scoops about trivial matters to sell books. It is time for Bob Woodward to re-evalutate his career. A long hiatus away from Washington might do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who believes any thing that Woodward writes.","review":"After the book that he wrote on the CIA and a interview with a man that had been in a coma for a month, who believes these \\"qutoes' from all the people in the Clinton White House.

This book will be a bomb and should be in the \\"dollar bin\\" at your book store."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless","review":"How does Bob Woodward get away with writing a book without a thesis when any freshman in college would be flunked? This was a pointless exercise in political gossip - and most of it, especially the tedious recapitulation of the Lewinsky affair, was not even new. Strangely and unforgivingly, Woodward hints at the pointed criticism of scandal-soaked press coverage and does not offer much of an opinion. It amazes me that he would not have anything to say. Perhaps it shouldn't; perhaps he's too caught up in beltway insider gossip to bother thinking about the significance of what he reports in the name of Truth. He's just stuck on boorish autopilot, more a part of the \\"establishment\\" that he once tried to bring down than ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me a break . . . is this fact or fiction here?","review":"If you like fiction, then this is the book for you!!! Here is the litmus test you can use when deciding whether or not to plunk down the $$$ for the book . . . Did you enjoy and believe Oliver Stone's movie \\"JFK?\\" If the answer is yes, then you will love this book. If the answer is no, then save your money for subscription to a more believable document known as the \\"National Enquirer.\\" \\"Shadow\\" is nothing more than another excuse for Woodward to remind the world that he broke Watergate and that he should continue to be paid for providing such a service to the American people."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good historical read.","review":"After just finishing Shadow, I was struck by how Woodward threads the blight of the independant council law on the US presidency through each administration. The reactions and decisions made by Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush and Clinton were clearly affected by the investigatorial climate set in Watergate along with the special prosecutors and independant councils who put their own prestige and interests beyond the point of rationality and above the interests of the nation. Woodward puts it all together with a perspective not presented previously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps a bit too much on Clinton","review":"The latest book by Bob Woodward is a fascinating read. My only complaint is that Woodward spends less than half the book on the first four presidents and the remaining chapters on Bill Clinton alone. I found the chapters on Ford, Carter, Reagan, and Bush to be of great interest and discussion. However the chapters on Clinton were simply hard to read. Outside of what we have all heard on TV and from various Woodward interviews, this information is not new. I still must recommend the text simply for the first half."},{"rating":"2","title":"A flash back to the seventies through the eyes of a brilliant satirist","review":"This book is a flashback to the seventies. There are mentions of the Camp David meetings between Jimmy Carter, Menachim Begin and Anwar Sadat. The Washington Redskins football team with Billy Kilmer, John Riggins, and Joe Theismann is also featured. My favorite cartoon is a four caption one, where the Redskins coach is standing in front of the bench and we see the backs of two players. In the first three captions, the names on the jerseys are Kilmer and Thomas and in the last caption, they are Theismann and Riggins. Only a long-time football fan will recognize the significance of the names. Billy Kilmer and Joe Theismann were quarterbacks and Duane Thomas and John Riggins running backs.Trudeau possesses the skill that all good cartoonists must have, the ability to satire the world we find ourselves in a humorous and generally subtle way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Geranium Aficianado!","review":"If you are fond of hardy Geraniums, you want this book.

Obviously there is a manufacturing problem with the feeders and they are not sealed on the bottom. The first one leaked right away. The second one started leaking after about a week. We are trying to glue the bottoms ourselves as the birds do like this feeder a lot, but if it doesn't work they will both have to be returned.We had one of this model feeder, and another one from the same company that holds more liquid. The birds would eat out of this one twice as fast. I think it's the way the feeding portion is so close to the bottom. I think they can get more food out of it faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking bases!!!

I then opened up the second feeder, planning to try and seal the first one somehow. I filled the 2nd feeder and it was fine at first. It took a 2nd cleaning and refill before this one started leaking from the base as well.They are a very nice looking feeder, and the hummers seem to prefer them over the hummzinger feeder that I have, but their food keeps ending up on the ground.

Lots of sugar water feeding not only yellow jackets but also ants.There is a better feeder made by Woodstream no yellow and a built in ant moat on the top of the feeder. The birds love it. It is the same size but the little white slot for the birds to feed and the built in perch seems to work better for me... and them. no more painting yellow red! and same price.

Hummingbirds were drawn to this feeder, like magnets. One evening I had, 2 hummingbirds sharing each perch.

I ended up fixing the leaky \\"Perky Pet 210P, with a bunch of surf wax, the top of a water bottle and a rubber-washer. The neck of the bottle is not long enough, so the sugar water level is to high, and, it leaks out of the yellow, flowers. Finally, I sent this poorly designed hummingbird feeder back to Amazon.

Sadly, it has disappeared from the TV scene, in spite of the hundreds of cable channels that could carry this thought-provoking opera. A sign of the times, perhaps.In this opera Menotti presents a most compelling image of what Christmas giving is all about. In an impulsive act of love for the Christ child, Amahl offers the only possession he has--his crutch--as a gift to be taken by the wise men to the Child. \\"...He may need it,\\" Amahl says, almost wistfully. Then the miracle happens... Not because he has beseeched, not because he has prayed, but because he has gone outside of himself and thought of the needs of others.It is a magical insight; few such insights come to us in even a lifetime of living. And Menotti perceived it, and conceived a way of bringing it to our attention in this timeless opera, for which I will be ever grateful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old mono sound no longer pleases","review":"This used to be the only choice of recording for this enchanting children's masterpiece and I enjoyed listening to it for years.

I came acrossthis particular recording by chance, as I was lookingat a most recent recording, by another label. I saw thisrecording of the original telecast as staged by the composer,and I realize that this recording was closer to the ideaof the composer than any other available. Yes, the sound isnot too great, but that does not matters when the factthat this is as the composer heard it and staged it, comes tomind.

This man wrote this biography to cash in on the death of Brett when it was originally released in 1997. The writer even admits that most if not all of Bretts friends and family refused to even speak with him, and those that did remain unnamed.

Though this was recorded live each track is flawless and the audience participation and bantering between band members did not detract in any way from the musical experience quite the contrary it made it all the more intense. This band truly connects with both their audience and their music. Taking inspiration from both the 60's and 70's Sloan has created a unique sound that can be hard and driving as in \\"MoneyCity Maniacs\\" or persuasive and haunting like \\"Coax Me\\". If all those \\"be my baby\\" top 10 pop hits are getting you down try something a little different that will still keep ya dancing all night long and give \\"4 Nights\\" a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock on SLoan","review":"This album is the next best thing to seeing Sloan live. I've seen them several times and they rock live. This CD is good at capturing their essence while also keeping the crowd in it. As anyone who's ever been to a Sloan show knows, the crowd is just as involved in the show as the band is. This album kept in all the sing-along parts, as well as \\"Happy Birthday\\" to Chris. It's got the great fun of the live show, without the confinining space and odours of the concert venue."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy mess","review":"I like Sloan a lot and I also enjoy live albums, but this 2-CD set is just a mess. It's not unlisteneable, but it certainly tests my patience as a listener. As another reviewer noted, the playing is sloppy, the singing sometimes a bit \\"off\\", and nothing on here can match the studio versions. But the biggest annoyance for me is the audience; a rabid, screaming bunch of fans who sound like a group of over-excited teenyboppers at summer camp. It's nice that they are Sloan fans, and seem to know all the songs, but their constant screaming detracts from the music. It also doesn't help that some of the members of Sloan encourage the screamers and add their own inane banter between songs. I'll stick to the studio albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly terrifying La Valse","review":"This was one of my first classical discs which I bought in 1963. It trumpeted the RCA Dynagroove process, had Bolero on the first side and Pavane and La Valse on the other side. This CD now includes Rapsodie Espagnole and Mother Goose, both recorded in the late 1950s. All of the pieces would be fine first choices for a basic library. The Bolero is powerful with Munch adding extra drums for the finale, though Munch speeds up the tempo during the piece. The Pavane is a rather quick runthrough, but James Stagliano's horn solo is quite beautiful. The CD's biggest selling point is the La Valse. As Munch conducts it, this has to be one of the most terrifying pieces ever composed, up there with Bartok's Miraculous Mandarin and Stravinsky's Le Sacre de Printemps. The BSO is right there with him all the way. Both the Rapsodie and the Mother Goose are quite beautiful. As usual, Richard Mohr and Lewis Layton did a marvelous job of recording these pieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Book","review":"Each page is a work of art from the hand lettered text to the border designs.

These are great for bolts like lug nuts or axel nut or oil pan nut for oil change. Basically any big nut you can all ready reach and view with no problem. I had better luck with a cheaper model impact wrench you can get for like 99.99. You will also need lots of extentions and adapter if you plan to use this impact wrench. YOU NEED 1/2 adapter will not just fit on your regular sockets.

I was absolutely riveted by the case and watched earnestly for the latest update. Doug Most does a fantastic job of investigating Amy and Brian's relationship as well as the factors influencing that night in the motel.

Finally the real story of Brian Peterson and Amy Grossberg has been told.

If your or my daughter were 5'1\\" and normally weighed 105 lbs I think I would notice. I am pro-choice but it is truly a shame that this is happening more and more often.

(Of course not - it would be an insult to talented young writers!)Plus, piling on with the past of Raistlin (as other books do with other characters) seems by this stage more to do with commerce than DragonLance trying to be a truly consistent, believable fantasy world.

And thus, when in this book she writes about things that have even a tenuous connection to food, it's great.

Reichl's coming of age as a food critic was honest and edgy. She's able to evoke the sense of food and place in wonderfully descriptive words that make you feel like you're at the table.

Still, I finished reading this book in about 2 days flat because her life reads like really good fiction - drama interspersed with lots of humor. I was a big fan of her first memoir, TENDER AT THE BONE, and this book read like the next chapter. You'll do yourself a favor if you read them one right after the other. While her tone and uncompromising gaze upon her life do not alter from the first to second book, in COMFORT ME WITH APPLES she seems to have deeper insights into her own soul, and her choice of recipes often reflects this insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all, a disappointment.","review":"I found the parts of the book that stuck to the descriptions of locales and their cuisines to be enjoyable, but it seemed the reader was too frequently dragged back into listening to Ms. Reichl's tales about the fortunes - or misfortunes - of her love life. Of the 300 pages it seemed like more than half were devoted to her personal travails. Hopefully the next time she will favor us with more insights into the world of restaurants and the creation of American cuisine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unabashed navel-watching","review":"Even as memoirs by living people go, this book is borishly self-congratulatory and self-absorbed. As the narratively jolts and grinds along, Reichl throws recipes in at random parts of the quasi 'plot', as if to give us something in return for the money wasted on buying the book. It's not that she can't write, for she clearly can. It's more that I couldn't get interested in another person's not very interesting life, as told by Reichl, and I felt as if I were watching the food network blindfolded, with the sound turned off - except that it's just not as much fun. Tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poorly Written Sequel Which Begged For A Serious Editor","review":"A was VERY disappointed by the book, and could not decide if I was more disgusted by the sloppy manner in which she wrote it, or her inability to take responsibility for the fact that she made a sport of committing adultery. Clearly, this book was dashed out to hopefully continue and cash in on the success of \\"Tender At the Bone.\\" How is it that one can be applauded for \\"living life to the fullest\\"(as other reviewers have commented) when what she seemed to be doing was destroying the lives of those who loved and supported her?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was wonderful...","review":"I loved Tender at the Bone - but this book was so much more...I found it moving and delightful - couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You're buying a book, not choosing a godparent","review":"While I share the low opinion of Ms. Reichl's character expressed by several reviewers here, I feel they are missing the point. John Updike once said, when accused of writing unsympathetic protagonists, that it was the author's duty to present believable characters and that the reader was free to like them or not. In this case, the memoirist has a number of interesting stories to tell and she has told them with skill and an unusual amount of candor. Would that all celebrity books could claim the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"bland on the palate","review":"Worth reading, if just barely, for the dishy (pun intended) anecdotes about Wolfgang Puck, Danny Kaye, and Other Celebrity Chefs I Have Known.

Fisher instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will do in a pinch","review":"I travel a great deal and am always looking for an entertaining book to pass the time. I am also an avid cook and love reading about fine dining and travel. This book bored me to tears! It did have some lovely descriptions of travel and food and I enjoyed the recipes but there was too much information about her love affairs, marriage and infertility problems. Who cares? Either write a book about food or write about your screwed up personal life but don't combine the two. The book struck me as the ramblings of a self-absorbed, wanna-be celebrity food writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"hoped for more","review":"I loved Tender at the Bone and was hoping this would deliver the same humor, captivating story line and recipes. It doesn't deliver. Just a messy life and someone trying to figure out who they are and what they want in life. I think another reviewer used the word MANIC - I would agree with this. Read Tender at the Bone, skip this."},{"rating":"2","title":"two steps forward, one step back","review":"I must preface this by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed Tender at the Bone and several years of Ms. Reichl's restaurant reviews in the NYTimes. I did, however, let my 23 year subscription to Gourmet Magazine lapse a few issues after she took over as editrix, because I couldn't bear the new, too casual style where I could no longer distinguish ads from articles, and celebrity seemed more important than good food.So why buy the book? Because she's a wonderful, compelling, clever writer with a keen sense of taste and style. No slave to food fashion, her descriptions of meals, both complex and simple, are sublime and witty. I could have done with less of her sexual encounters, but the late chapters about her children were lovely, though painful.Flaws and all, it was a most entertaining read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comfort me with Maalox","review":"After having read Tender at the Bone and loving it..imagine my astonishment at reading this amateur, adolescent angst-ridden soap opera of one woman's overindulgence both in unsavory men and unsavory meals.Did she throw this book together over a weekend?How did this book EVER get past the lawyers at Random House?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Delight to be Savored","review":"I don't understand the customers that complained that Reichl should have kept her personal life out of this book. After all, it's a memoir, not the Good Housekeeping cookbook. Reichl understands what a major role food plays in our lives- associating an event with taste, smell, texture enhances memories of that event. Plus, Reichl's annecdotes are interesting and entertaining. Perhaps because she has not lived the most conventional life, she has irritated some of the readers who are put off by her two extramarital affairs. The recipes in this book sound very tempting, but I haven't had the chance to try them yet. I had been longing for a book that would suck me in enough to make me read it cover to cover without putting it down. Comfort Me with Apples accomplished this, and them made me immediately pick up and devour Tender to the Bone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Story","review":"I really enjoyed reading about Ruth Reichl's life. Though I felt a lot of connection to her and related to what she went through, there was enough excitement and difference in her world to make it more than just a letter from a friend.

Dr Alexander's book has been a total breakthrough for me. By following Victory Over Fat's basic principles on nutrition and exercise, I've gone from a size 8 to a size 4. My energy level is more consistent and I don't feel deprived. I've also learned to become lean and muscular in only three 60 minute workouts per week.It's so refreshing to read a book that isn't about selling expensive candy bars, powdered drinks, or pre-packaged meals. Victory Over Fat has become my bible for not only losing fat and gaining muscle but becoming healthier and happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"FINALLY THE SIMPLE TRUTH AND FACTS -- & IT WORKS!","review":"This book, \\"Victory Over Fat\\", really lays it all out on the line for you. This doctor tells you everything to actually understand what happens to your body whenever you eat. One step leads to another and I now know that ANYONE can achieve their goal by following such easy to understand guidelines, or facts. Period. Simple. I firmly believe that our Public School System should add this book to their curriculum. If we are going to teach Health/Sex Education to our children, we surely need to teach these same children how to not only avoid STDs, but how to avoid such catastrophies as Childhood Obesity and Early-Onset Diebetes.I've never felt better or more energetic and I don't have any more painful bloating. I can keep going all day and know that my body is getting the food and energy it needs so I can do what I need to do without hurting it long-term. And am I getting lean! Unbelieveable! Thank you Dr. Alexander!"},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY, REALLY BAD!","review":"I am not a \\"professional\\" reviewer, but I could not agree more with the generalizations about this book. It was simply horrendous. I have read all of Diane Mott Davidson's amusing and charming mysteries. This one must have been penned by someone else. There is not one redeeming quality. To attempt to summarize the plot would be futile because there is very little plot, no character development, no likeable characters and few, if any, surprises. Don't waste your time nor your money on this. Even the recipes are not as appealing as past offerings. Definitely read at your own risk!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Castles, Ghosts, and Murder","review":"As usual, Goldy Schulz, caterer cum sleuth, manages to solve the murder while producing sumptuous feasts, this time in a castle, battling her ex-husband, and agonizing over the return of her husband's old girlfriend. She manages to adroitly leap from one crisis to another, accomplishing more in a day than most people do in a month. The action never stops. I also liked the sub-plot theme of trust in relationships."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"This book does not live up to the standards set by the previous Goldy mysteries. They each behave as no reasonable person would...a caterer calling her client at 6 a.m. to say we're moving in? A wife leaving her shot and recuperating husband alone all day while she's out looking for clues? This book is full of such nonsense it makes us not care a bit about how it all turns out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sticks and Scones is a disappointment","review":"As a longtime reader of Mott Davidson's, I found STICKS AND SCONES disappointingly disjointed and implausible....Loose ends, and too many leaps of logic. Besides which, juvenile son, Arch, gets more tediously obnoxious as the years go by with NO redeeming qualities, and ex-husband, John Richard, keeps up harassment that NO wife of a police officer would ever have to endure. I know this is fiction, but no heroine can be interesting being as much of a career victim as Goldy is.Even the recipes in this book are disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great recipes and a great story to boot","review":"I am a fairly new reader of Diane Mott Davidson's books and found this to be a quick and enjoyable read.

Bla bla bla...I had to stop reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite, man-hating tripe","review":"This was the first, and last, Davidson title that I've read. It was dreadful tripe.The main character, Goldy, is totally unsympathetic. She's a professional victim, always whining about her ex-husband, when she isn't spying on him and his new girlfriend, or interfering with his relationship with his son, that is.As for the plot, what plot? It's an incoherent mishmash of totally unbelievable coincidences and wild changes in direction.A bitter divorcee might enjoy this book, but only for the ex-husband bashing. Everyone else would be well advised to stay far, far away from this steaming pile of dog doo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puhleeeeeeeeease . . .","review":"Love the recipes. Hate the ex-husband. This woman is getting like Jessica Fletcher -- you don't want her to visit because somebody is gonna die. Her front window is shot out. Her car window is shot out. Her son is still fragile and whiney. The ex-husband is at it again. Now there is a mysterious ex-girlfriend of the new husband. Julian, the vegan-chef-in-training, to the rescue. How much more can a person take? Now, the stamp thing was interesting, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recipe for disaster","review":"I don't expect a lot from Diane Mott Davidson's books. I'm happy with a light read with some interesting characters. But this book was a big disappointment. Some of the behaviors & plotlines were extremely unrealistic and poorly developed. And Goldy's behavior was inexplicable and irresponsible. As a result, she just wasn't very likable. And that's a key component with this series. There were also too many questions left at the story's unrealistic & problematic ending. If this were a recipe, the chef skipped a few steps, used the wrong seasoning, and microwaved the resulting mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Somis, CA","review":"I really liked this series, but I, too, grew weary of Goldy's ex and that bratty son she indulges...and Somis, CA is right...no policeman worth his shoulder holster would put up with such nonsense.Goldy needs to put her foot down with the son, file enough charges against the ex to put him UNDER the jail and then start giving Tom the attention and love he so richly deserves.It's time for Mott Davidson to find another character to develop. Goldy's just run out of steam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle catering complications","review":"Goldy Schultz is pleased to have two large catering jobs in a nearby castle, one for donors and one for her son's fencing team. Things soon become violent when a window is shot out in Goldy's home, a man her policeman husband Tom is pursuing is killed, and then Tom himself becomes a target. This is a complicated case with stolen stamps, hidden family secrets, and a man obsessed with restoring the castle at the center. Further complications arise when Goldy's abusive ex-husband, otherwise known as \\"The Jerk\\", is released from prison, and Goldy has reason to suspect that Tom is being unfaithful to her. All of the favorite characters are here, such as Arch and Julian, and a few new ones are added. This is another good entry in this consistent series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best","review":"I have been a fan of Davidson's since the beginning, awaiting each book as it was published, and I was eagerly watching for this one. What a disappointment. The book seemed to start in mid-stream. In the first 30 pages, Goldy is shot at twice - it is very unbelieveable. I agree with the other review that she didn't seem to tie things together well at all. I knew the history of Goldy and ex, etc., and I still found it very hard to follow. I find it hard to believe that Goldy has that many enemies - she is only a caterer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"When are they releasing this?","review":"I honestly can't wait. Season 9 has been sitting in my cart since this summer. Why can't Amazon release it soon?I especially liked the surprising twist at the end when a team was overtaken late in the game.

Jackson does an excellent job of depicting the life of a flight attendant that keeps the reader interested from cover to cover. What is great about this diary of a flight attendant is that Jackson really makes you feel close to people who are in this diary and you feel as if you know them yourself. In no way was the book drawn out and cluttered with unnecessary information that will bore the reader.

The Gospels of Matthew and Luke were then written with the help of those from Mark and another unknown source which is called the Gospel Q. In 1838 a German noticed that there were many sayings of Jesus which were common to Matthew and Luke but not included in Mark. The Lost Gospel Q is comprised of these sayings. Adding fuel to the argument was the discovery in 1945 near the Upper Nile River in Egypt of a codex called the Gospel of Thomas. It contained 114 sayings of Jesus. Over one-third of these sayings were similar to those found in the Lost Gospel Q.If you accept the idea of the probable existence of Q, then you can look forward to reading sayings of Jesus which were recorded and used by some of His earliest followers less than two decades after His death and resurrection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Purchased as a gift","review":"I bought as a gift for my daughter.

I love how they violated every rule of punk rock dogma and were still ten times as original as the other crap being made at the time. But this is just awful.I've bought enough live punk records to know what to expect: terrible sound quality, songs that are indecipherable from each other, amplifiers hissing feedback into the microphones, musicians that are too high to perform...Maybe that would be the point with a live Flipper record, because they took pride in driving away fans at their shows.

About their subsistence farming and forestry and mining. It does not. Much of it is about touristy white water rafting and canoeing, which has nothing to do with the people of that region.

This new coil hose is lightweight as advertised, and as such, it is not very strong. Therefore, it does not recoil very quickly and you have to make it happen somewhat. It tends to twist up each time I recoil it (the plastic kind of sticks) and then I have to take the time to unravel it. Though I am only talking 15 seconds at most, compared to the rubber hose I owned (which I could not find anywhere to purchase) it is annoying. Also, this hose has such a short threaded end that when you twist on a spray nozzle, you may not be able to tighten it enough as you have nothing to grab other than the hose by the time the nozzle gets to the end of the thread. Mine currently drips due to this. I doubt I will even be able to remove the spray nozzle without cutting it off the hose.

First, there is insufficient flow though the narrow hose. It takes a long time to properly water with this product. The second major flaw is that once you're more than a few feet from spigot, the hose tends to make a straight line between you and it thereby knocking over pots and breaking fragile stems. The retraction \\"feature\\" also makes it hard to set a sprinkler out in the yard without staking it down.

First of all, I had a horrible time with the faucet fitting. I tried multiple times to get it to work without leaking but it only ended in me getting drenched when I went to turn the water on or off. The water pressure was not great, but with the smaller hose, I had already assumed that would be the case. If you want to use this for something other than minor watering, don't bother. The spring recoil did not work. I basically had to pick the hose up and place it where I wanted it and \\"help\\" the recoil process along.I really liked the idea of a quick, cool hose.

Low resolution video looks pixelated and down graded, audio is acceptable but its just a poor transfer as they're trying to cram all these episodes on one two sided disc. I hear the newly released 75th anniversary collections are nice...so maybe you should check those out.All that being said, I'd rather watch this on constant loop than see Seth Rogan destroying GH one more time...so if you just want to do that...then please buy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a treat!","review":"I really loved this one. I liked the first two - a lot - also, but this was a humdinger! This is such an original retelling of the legends, and the first that really makes sense to me even though I've always loved the Arthurian stories. Paxson has a real genius for delving into the back-story of the stories we all think we know - and coming up with plausible explanations for much of what is puzzling to modern minds, even while seeming to remain true to the ancient culture. A great exercise in fantasy. And there are moments of real beauty here too. I could have wished the book were longer - but it's the economy that gives her retelling such impact; she just goes to the heart of each important scene, and then moves on, so the reader is left with a series of really vivid images; and this method is so appropriate to the nature of the Arthurian legend, whose truth comes to us in glimpses, through the distortions of history. This is a wonderful writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps not Bergman's best, but still very worth seeing","review":"An outstanding looking, very odd mix of somewhat broad comedy, horrorfilm, and (of course) Bergman's metaphysical musings.A band of traveling magicians, wanted by the law as charlatans, arepulled in for questioning and forced to perform for some upper classnon-believers. The 'nothing-in-life is-what-it- seems' theme is strong,but does get repetitive, and at times you can see it coming.Also, on first viewing the elements didn't really feel like they fittogether, and I found it a bit of a bumpy ride. The comedy made thedark side hard to take seriously, and the serious, creepy elements madethe comedy feel all the more wedged in.That said they are a some amazing sequences that I know will stick withme, and I do feel haunted by the film. Many call it a masterpiece orclose, and I'll certainly see it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysterious and Entertaining","review":"Watch it and ponder its messages. Very nice booklet accompanies the disc and explains the director's influences and motivations. Picture is sharp and clear. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Fantasy","review":"Absolutely classic angst-ridden exploration of the roles we play and the realities that may be beneath these masks. Some of the best black and white cinematography ever made. Faces, sets, costumes to die for if you are into the gothic mindset,(shrug) even if not. And great acting as well, not just from Von Sydow, either. A great cast working together to produce an eerie atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Symbolic","review":"Like Mel Gibson's \\"Get The Gringo,\\" this story is designed to send a message directly to the gate keepers and taste makers of international cinema. Though Mel was rich enough to buy his own production and distribution, Bergman was still fighting for money to make his movies and get them seen outside of Sweden. The characters are a ragtag traveling magic show being oppressed and abused by corrupt and greedy authorities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magician Blu ray","review":"Great movie that has atmosphere and suspense - A Bergman film noir horror masterpiece. And the anti hero is Max Von Sydow when he was really young playing the complex character of the magician. Great supporing cast with a decent story line that delivers suspense as the movie proceeds. I love a movie when I really have no idea how the plot will unfold. Not played much (if at all) on Turner but if you don't mind sub titles and appreciate really authentic movie making - you need to see this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wha?","review":"This is my favorite Bergman film.

It includes I'M READY FOR LOVE and my favorite Vandellas' single, JIMMY MACK. Outstanding is Smokey's NO MORE TEARSTAINED MAKE UP...wow, superior Motown!

Jackie wanted to be a funny guy from a young age... but he wan't a natural. This is where his genius came in... Gleason BECAME the Great One. His start as an emcee and his rounds in the clubs helped him to develop his comedic talent until he was ready for the new medium of television. He was the right person at the right time in the right place (with the right agent!). However, Gleason had his own personal demons which effected his relationships with others.The acting of all the characters in this DVD is great, but Garrett is awesome in this. I've only ever seen him in Raymond and had no idea of what a really great actor he is. This is a terrific movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"TINY! not worth your time","review":"The cotton swabs are tiny, think the size of a penny. I thought these would be larger - but I can't even use one of these to take off nail polish. I end up grabbing 4-5 and mush them together and use as one. What's the point of buying a bulk bag if the actual cotton balls are so small you have to use handfuls at a time? I suppose these might be ok to use for medical reasons (after a shot? put under a bandaid), but since they are \\"non-sterile\\" this is clearly not the intent. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini Maids holders","review":"I brought these becasue I had a set before and they are just what I needed to wash my mini blinds with. We have 20 windows with mini blinds and they get pretty dirty. We live in a rural area and these holder allows me to place the blinds one at a time in the shower. There I spray them down with Greased Lighting and take a soft brush to them. They are left to dry and then I start on the next one. The suction cup wears out and you can 't find replacements for them. I had to order a new set and it took me a while to find them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent singing but inferior conducting","review":"Something that Verdi himself said that would make a perfect Il Trovatore was to have the four greatest singers in the world. This was certainly the case on this recording. Every one sings their part beautifully. The beauty and power of Björling, the sacrifice and dedicated sound of Milanov, the selfish, evil and seducting singing of Warren and then the vendictive singing of Barbieri.All singers make such an impact that it almost overshadows the sloppy conducting of Cellini. He lets the orchestra make so many queer sounds, his tempi is at times strange. The conducting is only thing that for me sets this set apart from being perfect. The sound on the CDs are at times a little strange. Like the engineers try to mix a mono master into stereo.To conlude, this set is definitly worth buying for the singing alone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A TROV-LOVER'S DREAM","review":"What a joy this set is. The singers are all in great voice & fulfill Maestro Cellini's vivid tempi with such gusto that I find myself rather pleased this is in mono with the orchestra necessarily fading into the background. The excellent sound provides one the opportunity to hear Milanov in perfect voice & it is a thrill. Bjoerling, Warren, and a young Barbieri all - using one of Stefan Zucker's favorite phrases - \\"give chills'. I seem to be addicted to TROVATORE and this set has reminded me how grateful I am to everyone who rescues & rereleases these treasures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the Best","review":"Despite shortcomings, such as mediocre conducting, cuts and the \\"old\\" sound, not least the miscast tenor, this \\"Trovatore\\" remains unsurpassed for the beauty of singing. Milanov is simply the best Leonora ever, both in her grand arias and the dramatic coloratura segments. Bjoerling is not heroic enough for my taste. He is perfect for \\"Ballo,\\" \\"Faust\\" and \\"Manon,\\" but not for \\"Aida\\" or \\"Il Trovatore.\\" But he makes up for the lack of heroic stature with the beauty of voice and singing. If only Milanov could sing this opera with Corelli, what a glorious \\"Trovatore\\" that would be!"},{"rating":"1","title":"sounds like goggling","review":"Don't know what all the rage is about.

The sound of orchestra is so weak, boring. It's far from powerful sound. The vocal cast was so terrible. The voice of casting doesn't have any tension.

Solo para mujeres can help women of all ages deal with issues as they relate to female sexuality and discover solutions to problems that may have plagued women for years. This book is written by two female doctors who address problems, symptoms and solutions accurately and are well explained with proper terminology used at all times. I purchased the book out of sheer interest because I think it is important for a woman to understand, identify and be comfortable with her own sexuality. Reading it once however is not enough. Once read it can be used as a reference and a first step guide to determining whether the problem needs professional attention. This is a highly recommended reference for females and for males who are in a relationship with a woman who may be dealing with some of the issues discussed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery life unacceptable","review":"I purchased this battery in February 2008 as a replacement for my original iBook battery.

Unfortunately many people go out and climb while totally unprepared. Indeed they choose to not deal with it, and take enormous risks.In this book Andy will give you the scoop on everything you ever wanted to know related to glacier travel. He starts by explaining what glaciers are, then he gets more into detail on how to routefind, traveling as a group, and of course how to perform crevasse rescue.My honest opinion is that this book is not, by itself, going to make you an expert on the subject. I really don't think any book can. You need to get some training, be it with an experienced friend or established school but this book will show you all the techniques that you'll learn. Plus if you already know it can help you brush up and possibly show you new techniques. Great book, very typical high quality stuff from The Mountaineers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great epic, bad presentation.","review":"Journey to the West is indeed a great epic, and the prose is actually quite good. Its concise and easy to follow. I'm not sure about how accurate the translation is (I can't read Mandarin).However, the one thing that really makes me angry, is the numerous silly spelling errors throughout the book. Its as if no one bothered to edit it (there are one or two errors per chapter). There is even a spelling error in the summary at the back of the book (they used 'isa' instead of 'is a'). The paper and print quality is below average. The book is damaged and creased easily.Although the story is great and the translation is good, the book is presented in a haphazard manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book","review":"I liked this book quite a bit. The translation is good and the translator has one a great effort to explain as much as he/she could to help you to understand anything that is mentioned and you mey be unable to understand. The only thing I found somewhat tiring was that the story becomes a little repetitive, but besides that the story is really interesting (though I got to hate Pig, but... *shrug*)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is a great Chinese classic! I think that the translation is not too bad (given its history), and it would be fun to read aloud. I like how the books are divided, and the illustrations from the Qing dynasty are also fascinating. As for the content, I think it is probably widely known among people who study Chinese culture. The most lovable character is obviously Monkey, who will stop at nothing to protect his feeble Buddhist master the Tang priest Sanzang. Zhu the pig is also interesting as an incessantly loathsome character who specializes in overeating and over-indulging in just about everything. The only character I think could have been more developed was Friar Sand.. :(. The most predictable one was Quan Yin who always ends up saving Monkey for the first two books. Some great moments were: the manfruit, the false Western Heaven, and of course Monkey's bad behavior in the first 20 chapters of the book. Its a great read for any age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast but a little scuffed","review":"I got the product (Journey to the West 4 volume boxed set) fairly quickly, but the books were a little scuffed up with the corner of one of the four volumes bent up to a couple pages.

Jenner","review":"This is a wonderful translation of the Journey to the West. It is an unabridged translation, therefore it is 3 books long. But it is worth it. Not only is it written clearly, but it keeps the style of the original, meaning that interwoven between pharagraphs of prose are poems. This give the book a wonderful charm that the abridged, prose versions lack. The ancient Chinese thought, such as yin and yang, Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, also give the book an authentic flavor that enriches the experience of reading this classic. It is still the same wonderful story of the michevous Monkey King, his difficulties with the gods in heaven, and his redeeming pilgramage with the Buddhist monk/priest Sanzang to find sutras. For anyone seriously interested in this story and who doesn't read Chinese, this is the edition for them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lao's review","review":"The Journey to the West has remained of the most popular and enduring works of fiction in China since it was first published in the late sixteenth century. It is an allegory of Buddhist doctrine, based on the real life pilgrimage of Tripitaka, a Chinese monk who traveled to India in search of religions scripture in (I believe) the seventh century. The very descriptive text contains some of the most astoundingly beautiful poetic passages I have ever encountered. Footnotes contain references to everthing from historical notes to daily customs of the period.

I do not know where SEP gets her inspiration for all the wonderful books that she writes, but one thing's for sure--- I hope that she continues to write more and more books with the same talent that she shows in Kiss An Angel.The characters Alex and Daisy are wonderful - Alex as a very tough and closed individual and Daisy - a kind hearted somewhat irresponsible woman - they come together to teach one another about the power of love and trust and of course of passion!If you are looking for a true to the bone romantic novel - but this book!

That so did not happen. I know she has a pattern of having the female lead caught in a tough spot with the whole community against her and the guy lead indifferent at best. Unfortunately, in this case it just seemed way to cruel for me. I don't want to give any plot issues away but Adam's treatment of Daisy was just downright demeaning. What makes it worse is that she took it as if that was all she's worth. It was sad, pathetic and every feminist bone in my body was about ready to jump out and beat the two of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"When I first read Kiss an Angel I was highly disappointed. I don't know why it bugged me so much. Honestly, I just didn't like the hero or the heroine in this book. There is a big difference between an Alpha hero and the abusive protagonist that keeps popping up in romance novels. No amount of love can redeem a jerk who treats women like dirt. Daisy starts out an awesome heroine and turns into a doormat. Susan Elizabeth Phillips is one of my favorite authors and that's the only reason I'm not giving this book a 1-star rating.SEP books I recommend: Natural Born Charmer, It Had To Be You, This Heart Of Mine, Lady Be Good and Call Me Irresistible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly great read!","review":"I remember reading this book when it first came out and I fell in love with the main characters as well as the story. It was so different, as are all of SEP's books and so worthwhile spending the time and effort to get involved in the circus that was their lives. There is a review, I believe by \\"Publishers Weekly\\" that I really wish could be taken down. It really is frosty to say the least and couldn't have been written by a fan of romance. I enjoyed the story, the characters, the sex scenes and the triumph of love conquering all. Apparently, I am not alone in my opinion, not that it matters, but there are about 70 Five Star Reviews.

It is sad to me that some women actually like a monstrosity that tells women it's okay to be treated as an inferior, dim-witted sex object (and moreover, that the dishonorable and chauvinistic male figure is supposed to be sexy and sought-after). It's no wonder, with trash like this advocating verbal and physical abuse of every kind, that there is such an alarming and disturbing amount of abusive relationships in the world. I cannot respect this book, nor its author, and I pity both the woman who lacks respect for herself to the point that she wants what Daisy has and the one who champions the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected and delightful","review":"I never imagined a book set in a circus, where the hero is really a little mean to the heroine, would touch me so deeply.

Never would have guessed she would have written about circus life. But it was really interesting.SEP always creates such depth to her characters and you feel so deeply bonded with them even if you hate them ;-) Daisy and Alex will grip your heart.I thought this was a fabulous book and I had a hard time putting it down (just like all her other books). I definitely look forward to reading it again one day.Phillips has a neat way to describe situations and people that have you tasting and living what she describes.

Needless to say, I will devour all of SEP Books I can find.

I know it was supposedly copyrighted in 1996, but I strongly suspect it was written in the 80s. It contained no modern references (no computers, cell phones, Internet). At one point Daisy hopes the property Alex is taking her to is a large ranch like in the TV show \\"Dallas.\\" The circus crew don't live in RVs, they live in \\"Airstream trailers.\\" Daisy is actually excited by the prospect that Alex might be a descendant of Czar Nicholas I, a subject that was all the rage a couple of decades ago. Add to that the verbally abusive, autocratic father who sells his wide-eyed innocent daughter to the brooding, emotionally distant stranger, and you have a very Harlequin Romance-esque book. As a result, this book comes off as cliched, contrived and, therefore, not the least bit interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!!!","review":"I agree with other reviewers that I wasn't sure I'd like the whole circus theme, but it was so easy to get wrapped up in the animals and Daisy's close bonds with them.

It was great anyway. I did get mad at Alexseveral times because he was so mean to Daisy who was nothing but sweet and trying to make a go at their marriage. I don't like it when people are quick to believe the worst in others. I gave it five stars because the story was really good and the ending was better than I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully woven, and funny","review":"I have read most of Phillips book and find each one of them as facisnating as the others.

Her characters are quirky but amazingly real. I drool over her Heros. And the dialogue makes me laugh out loud. Great love scenes as well. I was hesitant to select this one at first because of the circus setting, but this is part of what made it so fresh and interesting. It's definately worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and Totally Unrealistic","review":"I am not an avid romance reader, but I was willing to keep an open mind since it was rated so highly on Amazon and recommended by a friend. I was actually shocked at how contrived and unnatural the events in the story were and there was a \\"preachy\\" animal rights element that I didn't really appreciate (is it ever really a good idea to keep live tigers loose around people?). I didn't have any sympathy for any of the main characters and the secondary characters were simply flat. I kept reading with a hope that the book would get better. Unfortunately, the plot remained predictable to the end.Kiss an Angel"},{"rating":"1","title":"BLEAK AND DISMAL---","review":"I depend on this author to give me quaint, quirky stories full of laugh-out-loud humor. I could not believe this book. Page after page of cold, self-centered dismay. I kept waiting for the sun to break through the clouds, so-to-speak, but it never happened. The unromantic scene at the end lacked warmth of feeling and was far from anything to cheer about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Read","review":"I liked this book even though it was a \\"typical\\" story line. It kept my interest and was entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"Actually pretty good","review":"I listened to this book rather than read it, and wasn't really sure I'd like it, but I was pleasantly surprised! I still like her later books better but in a goofy way this really charming. And I didn't think their reactions (esp of the hero) were unrealistic given their circumstances. Sweet read for the summer (or those trying to escape!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carny Romance","review":"This book was like dining on Chinese food. It felt satisfying for a while; it is cute and contains some romantic tension. But right after I finished reading it I didn't care about any of the characters at all. I admit I do not like carnival settings but that wasn't the problem with the book. It just didn't ring true on any level. I have read a few of SEP's books and enjoyed Nobody's Baby But Mine a lot more than this book. I say skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really enjoyed it!","review":"This book was really cute. The main characters were sweet and easy to like and the circus setting was quite interesting, especially as it felt as though the author had done her research into that kind of life.

The hard hearted hero with a past, the constantly misunderstood heroine. This is the 21st century. Shouldn't we have progressed beyond this?

I was expecting a cute little glass that would be a nice juice or milk glass for kids and got something quite different! It's not that useful as a large tumbler either, as the weight doesn't seem too well balanced - tall and thin, not enough weight in the bottom, so that it can be tipped easily.

If you adore her, then you'll love this - but should you want a more dramatic approach - steer clear.

Recorded live, this benefit concert boasts an impressive roster including Donna Murphy, Randy Graff, the Callaway sisters, and many other popular theater performers. Unfortunately, much of the material wasn't worth recording. If that weren't bad enough, the sound quality is poor and the accompanying piano is insufficient in creating the necessary mood for each piece. Worst among the performances is Rachel York who wonders \\"Will It Matter that I Was?\\" Both the song and the singer leave much to be desired. Alix Corey's \\"I Know You're There\\" is the only stand out number from this benefit. There is genuine emotion in her signing, and the lyrics, though spotty at time as in \\"You needn't panic/I'm not consulting and gurus/Calling psychics, practicing with voodoo\\" are generally effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album for a great cause","review":"I love this album but there are a few songs that I enjoy more on other albums. I think Lilias White's \\"How Can You Be Gone\\" is a classic song for the person left behind when a loved one dies. Rachel York's song is quite good as well. I thought Eddie Korbich's song was a great break from some of the heavier songs and Nancy Lamott's \\"We Live on Borrowed Time\\" gains poignancy when one remembers her untimely death. Get this album...it is one you can revisit over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk rock with a heavy dose of Southern rock.","review":"Hellstomper is one of those bands that I wish was still around, but in reality they probably hung it up at the right time. They were offensive, humorous, and played rock 'n roll like it was meant to be played: Loud, fast, and care-free. This album is a gem and a must-have for fans of Flat Tires, ANTiSEEN, Hammerlock, and just rock 'n roll in general."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cutting board","review":"Was smaller than expected, but serves purpose of dicing or cutting small items.

This is actually a great one for the guys. Sure there is a moral you observe under a rye grin. Alfie gets it in the end but he has a lot of fun on the way. Basically the opposite number of the notorious college girl movie Breakfast at Tiffanys. That is if they hadn't tacked on the happy ending and George Pepard had split on the lovely head case.

Was this truly a reflection of the times? Lord, I hope not. I understand this movie was up or won a quite a few awards and all I can say was that it must not have been too much competition that year. Skip this movie if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring..................","review":"I have seen this film about 3 times and each time I find the same feeling, one of boredom. It's too long for one thing for such a thin plot. On the good side, Caine is good, the look and feel of the swingin' London '60's is good from a sociological point of view and Vivien Merchant is wonderful in a supporting role as a mature woman who is impregnated with Alfie's baby and has an abortion, which no doubt was daring for the 60's. Suffice it to say that the movie hasn't weathered well in the 38 years since its release, but it's an interesting watchpiece of the '60's, if you can stay awake during the long stretches of boredom."},{"rating":"2","title":"what its all about is a classic turn by michael caine","review":"this is the movie that made michael caine a star, and deservedly so. coming at the tail end of the english angry young man movies (a decade of filmmaking i dont usually care for), this was (next to the sadly unavailable \\"loneliness of the long distance runner\\") arguably the best of the batch. funny and frank and touching, and with a refreshing -- even if, imho wrongheaded -- take on the effect of abortion on the father. caine (quite the looker 40 years back in case youve forgotten) is a fully-formed actor even at this early stage of his fine career, and of course theres that song ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALFIE!","review":"Altoghter now...\\"What's it all about...ALFIE?\\" This 1966 film directed by LEWIS GILBERT stars MICHAEL CAINE as Alfie, a wonderfully shallow WOMANIZER who is trying to figure out what life is, well, all about!

Sorry chaps, really DIDN'T like it! Yes, I know he's supposed to be shallow, that that's the whole point, but it's just too depressing for me. At one point, I lost conciousness in front of the screen. When I came back, I asked myself, \\"Do I really want to go on with this?\\" And the answer was a resounding No. As you'll read, every other person just loved it; maybe you'll find you're more in tune with them.

I have 5 Hibiscus that range from 3'- 7'and one Lemon Tree that is over 10' and all of them are more than 30' from the nearest sink.

More than that, Koselek takes us into the heart and soul of the songs. It's like hearing the writer discussing the emotional undercurrent of his lyrics on a therapist's couch. But it's far more than that. Koselek is a genius at getting inside and under a song and making it his own. He crafts beautifully simple arrangements that sound as though they came first.I'd highly recommend this album. I've listened to it regularly for months. And, if you like this, you'll love Koselek's similar treatment of Modest Mouse. Modest Mouse I am familiar with, I'm a huge Mouse fan, and what Koselek does with their beautiful songs under the moniker Sun Kil Moon is a treat to hear.Tiny Cities"},{"rating":"1","title":"navel gazing galore","review":"i really wanted to like this record, not because i'm a fan of either kozelek or ac/dc, but because i like the concept. the execution, alas, is another matter. admittedly there is a point of sympathy between kozelek and ac/dc: their \\"musical stylings\\" are both rigidly one-dimensional. but whereas the originals have a menacingly juvenile, raucous flair, kozelek's covers are morbidly sensitive affairs. some advice mark: get a girlfriend/pet/houseplant/hobby/whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big forehead isn't always a sign of genius","review":"When I heard this album the only thing I could think of is, \\"How many times can someone steal someone else's work and pretend that they're a musician\\".

They wrote rock'n'roll songs more or less by the book on how rock'n'roll's suppose to sound, but yet, with a very personal touch. AC/DC sounds like no other band, and no one sounds like AC/DC. I think Mark Kozelek interpret their songs briliant! Bon Scott is hugely underrated as a songwriter, his lyrics are often clever, some very humourus and ironic, yet very soulful. That shines through very clear in Marks versions I think. Hopefully this record will make some people understand Bon Scott and AD/DC's greatness. And also make some AC/DC fans discover Mark Kozelek, not only as a great AC/DC interpreter, but also as an excellent singer/songwriter on his own.

The sound is extremely good considering the source, and the performances are wonderful in the way only a Mose performance can be. Wild Man on The Loose, indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Missing Mose","review":"Yes, a great cd which captures the feel of a 'live' performance. The only drawback is that the song Ain't Got Nothing But The Blues is missing from my cd! There should be 14 tracks but I seem to have only been given 13.This apart, anything by the very hip Mose is worthwhile listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"solid product. great price. monster quality. i would recommend this product to others. no knows on it yet. will buy another one, if i need for another pc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Causes sticky flickering green pixels that just seem to grow in number the longer you use your computer.

Great converter from a DVI end of cable (mine is a costly 25') to HDMI. Minor problem is that it is long and will not bend. If you have a wall-mount TV you will need an HDMI to HDMI adapter to make the bend and I do not recommend a 90 degree type as the wide part of the HDMI end on the 90 degree may be in the wrong position, as mine was (when plugged into the TV it did not stick out far enough to meet this converter AND it angled up, and I needed it to angle down), so I recommend the 8\\" HDMI to HDMI extension cord from Amazon. Highly recommend this Amazon purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVI end doesn't accomodate industry standard male DVI pins/prongs and thus won't fit many male monitor DVI cable plugs","review":"I bought this to convert an HDMI port on an AMD graphics card to DVI to use with one of my Dell monitors that has a standard male DVI plug on the end of its interface cable. The monitor and its cable have been used successfully with multiple female DVI plugs/ports in the past on various graphics cards without any problems. This adapter lacked some of the pin/prong holes that the male DVI plug at the end of the monitor's cable had, and thus, I could not plug the monitor into the adapter's female DVI end. In other words, the adapter didn't have the holes to accommodate those pins/prongs. This made the product basically worthless for me since I couldn't even plug my display device into it. I was surprised with this being a premium brand, Monster, that it would not support industry standard DVI pin/prong holes correctly."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like sun and shadows","review":"OK. I've heard better versions of the 1812 overture. This is slightly different because it has choruses where other versions doesn't have them. (Just for making you know, the best 1812 is by the Chicago orchestra, conducted by Sir Georg Solti. The label is Decca). But, the Wellington's Victory really kicks butt! You really feel in the battlefield, surrounded by guns, cavalry and infantry in the infamous battle were Napoleon was utterly defeated. Altough Beethoven despised this work, is one of his best orchestral compositions. If you like warlike music, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Performance by Buketoff","review":"I originally purchased this album in the vinyl form (although with a different coupling), and I was so impressed since this was the first time that someone had used the original chorus on this overture.

By luck, I happened to find it again in the CD format and I immediately purchased (and it even has a better coupling).

But this is more poignant because we know that this Pueblo civilization vanished with hardly a trace. They were a great and sophisticated nation but that didn't slow down their extinction. The book is a page-turner and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Guide to Leadership","review":"This is a fun book to read. If you are interested in Golf or leadership, or both, there is much to hold your interest. But the book is really about more than that. It is basically a primer on how to live your life and feel comfortable with yourself, regardless of where you find yourself involved.The further you read into the book the more interesting it becomes. The golf anecdotes are amusing and the leadership stories are informative, but they won't make you a better golfer. If you pay attention to the theme of the book it should improve your leadership effectiveness.This book should be highly recommended to high school seniors, college students, and young adults.

Amy Carmichael was obviously used greatly of God in her work. Likewise, Elisabeth Elliot obviously is a great admirer of Carmichael. However, it would seem that Elliots admiration has impeded her ability to produce a balanced biography of this woman to some degree. This book received high marks for its portrayal of a remarkable Christian woman and for the value of learning the lives and practices of the strong in faith; however, I could not give it a 5-star rating, for Elliot tends to idolize Carmichael. I would still recommend this book, but would simply warn the reader to understand that Elliot is writing from a position that is not always unbiased.

Recently, while reading \\"1 Corinthians 3:11-13\\" which is Amy'Carmichael's \\"calling\\" verse, I was totally compelled to read the book again but this time as my own book. As I read now, her life is even more enlightening and amazing as I underline and write personal notes on the pages. I view Amy, as does the author Elisabeth Elliot, as my spiritual mother. Amy crystallizes the call, my call, to serve The King...\\"Nothing is important but that which is Eternal\\"(on page 51). Without hesitation, everyone should read this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful true story!","review":"I love the story of Amy's life, especially as presented by Elisabeth Elliot.

By Modern Age, Lukacs means the era of rationality and empiricism which commenced with the Renaissance. He suggests we are leaving that age, perhaps to enter a New Dark Age. His book is full of brilliant observations; for example that the youthful fashions of the 1960s aped the appearance of the barbarians of Dark Age Europe. Or that for the first time in history, having the wrong opinions is a faux pas worse than poor taste. Or that nationalism has replaced Christianity as the religion of the people. Tocqueville feared we would stamp out the lights of civilization ourselves, and this book puts forward the same theme. The book is out of print but I suppose the truth is we do not want to hear its dark message. Perhaps historians of the future will see the book's worth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Java developers will want this as an essential desk reference","review":"Jim Farley and William Crawford's Java Enterprise In A Nutshell: A Practical Guide packs in tutorials on a number of enterprise Java tools, offering new material covering Xdoclet and Java 5.0 Annotations, JavaServer Faces, and the Hibernate API.

The father yelling at his AS son many times, \\"What's wrong with you kid?...Why can't you be normal for a change?...(he) doesn't need a doctor, he needs a good spanking...\\" The dad in the book behaves out of anger/frustration and certainly inappropriately and somewhat cruelly.

I took one look at it and instantly fell in love with it. I bought it and took it home. My first impression was correct. The book is about a wealthy girl from a huge family with a superficial mother and scholarly, yet withdrawn, father. Deirdre prefers her poetry to the social whirl that her sisters and mother indulge in. When the mother takes the second batch of daughters for their first season in London, Deirdre has no choice but to go. Dressed in plain clothes that contrast roughly to her mother's and sister's, she drives into Town. However, when Deirdre meets and falls in love with a rich and handsome marquis, she decides to change. She has to choose; give up her poetry and live with the one she loves, or give up everything for her beloved poetry.I guess the thing I liked most about this book is that it stresses the positive virtues and morals that most people in this world still need to learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"These are twist-offs!","review":"I paid to download this performance and feel like I totally got my money's worth!

However, there are enough sight gags and obvious humor to keep you interested. Captain Haddock's character was a bit more goofy than in the books, and I think they just wanted a go-to sight gag to hold the viewer. I never thought it was over-the-top, but it did get close. Of all the stabs at live-action in the Tintin universe, I like this actor as the Captain most as far as sheer appearance. Of course, Jean-Pierre Talbot is handsome and sweet as our beloved Tintin. My hands-down favorite, however, was Professor Tournesol/Calculus. He was utterly adorable and pitch-perfect. If you can find one with English dubbing or even subtitles, it's a great movie for kids and adults alike. It's far less kid-friendly in French unless they speak it, but some little ones can likely just watch the Captain be silly and be plenty entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money wasted","review":"Unlike the version available from Australia,(Region 4) this version does not have English sub-titles.This fact was only discovered after opening the DVD and playing for a few minutes.It could have stated clearly that there were no sub-titles available on this Region 1 version of the film.Thus my grandchildren have a DVD which is altogether meaningless to them.

Blue Oranges and Golden Fleece are wonderful books and movies. Too bad one cannot enjoy them unless you speak French.I guess Quebec and St.Perre et Miquelon should be in their own little Franco-phile world.

Once again, this book has beautiful cover art, as well as a great story that you won't want to stop reading until you get to the end. Zenda seems to have the same problems that every girl has, such as feeling jealous, sad, determined, and in this particular book, pressured.Zenda is thrilled that she gets to spend spring break on the planet Crystallin, staying with her cousins, whom she's never met before. Her younger cousin, although very kind and caring, loves plants, which Zenda is half sick of, since she's around them so much on her own planet. Zenda's older cousin, Stella, is pretty, and cool.

I knew he'd finally get to it and wow!- he does it with such smooth and seamless prose and just the right amount of tension that he rivals James M. Caine's renderings on such a shadowy subject. As with previous works, Woodrell proves he's a writer's writer with this dark portrait (reminds one of Faulkner's Sanctuary) of southern culture on the skids. Woodrell's style is so economical and subtle that the tension build-up throughout the novel doesn't hit until the final scenes and then it hits you right between the eyes, sharp and swift,like you're a frog being gigged by some redneck, hillbilly swilling cheap beer and looking for trouble beneath a pale moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Innovative use of the English language","review":"\\"The Death of Sweet Mister\\" is one of the best books I've read this year. It's the dark story of one Shug Akins (whose real name is Morris), a fat thirteen-year-old boy with a ditzy, tartish mother and a reprehensible, low-life stepfather named Red who forces Shug to steal drugs for him. They live in a cemetery. These are fascinating characters and, even though abusive fathers or stepfathers are overdone as a subject for fiction, Daniel Woodrell has a unique and original approach to this subject matter. Unlike some current writers, he can convey much in a few (very interesting) words. \\"The Death of Sweet Mister\\" is the first book I've read by Daniel Woodrell, and I plan to seek out his other books. I highly recommend it for the serious reader interested in current American literature. It gives you a chance to see how good it can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Not Like","review":"This was a sad book from beginning to end.

Shug is overweight, and is being teased mercilessly by Red, who also forces him to do break-ins in order to provide Red and his friends with drugs. We follow Shug through some hard months in his life. He has mixed feelings towards his mother, who flirts both with him and with other men, and he hates his (step)father. You know things are bound to go desperately wrong in this sad and violent tale about life on the other side. A very well written tale, and one I recommend highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Relay contact burned out after 1 year of use","review":"My sump pump cycles very frequently, this pump controller worked flawlessly for about the first year. Now it does not function, due to the contact on the mechanical relay being burned out. Much to my surprise the relay is not even replaceable so the entire unit must be now replaced. I would never buy this unit again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very nice sump pump control","review":"I have this control installed for 2 months. It works beautifully. The sump pump's built-in floating control is not reliable. My basement got flooded several times. I fixed the built-in control to the always on position so that bypass it, and installed this one. Before install this, the sump pump was very loud and works 7 seconds per stroke. This control works 42 seconds per stroke, and amazingly, the pump is now very quiet. I even don't know when it worked, but the basement is always dry, no matter how big the rain is. Other reviewers mentioned that it works only for one year, not sure about that yet. But for now, it is a much better control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy!","review":"This pump controller is a great idea, however the relay inside it is cheap and fails in short order. I have 2 zoeller pumps in my sump. each one on its own switch. i had purchased 3 switches. in 5 months, 2 of the switches are gone due to bad relays. i am on my last switch which was supposed to be a backup but now its the only one operable. i just ordered a similair concept switch from another company and i am hoping it is built more reliably. wayne pumps wasnt always the manufacturer of this switch. they took over the design a few years ago. the previous one from the old manufacturer lasted 5 years before it was destroyed in an accident. it would probably still be working today.dont buy this, keep looking! sump pump items are mission critical devices and should not be built this way!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great switch, but check the sensor wire","review":"This switch worked great for about a year, and then it failed. Fortunately, I have a backup monitor (Rialco Flood Alarm) that alerted us to the problem. It turned out that the sensor wire was not making contact to the water, even when submerged. I checked the sensor wire, and found that it had hardly any conductor exposed. So I cut off three feet of the wire, stripped off an inch of insulation, and coated it with solder to help make sure that it makes contact with the water, and now all is working again.Note that the AU5ES has its own alarm that is supposed to sound if the water does not go down in a specified period of time, but since the sensor wire was not working, that alarm did not work either. So always have a backup alarm that has its own sensor wires, and hope that they don't both fail at the same time. You can never be too careful with sump pumps, but this is a good product overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed just over a year later","review":"This unit worked great for about a year, now it fails to turn on when the water level goes above the wire inside the pit.I can measure the resistance between the ground prong on the pump and the wire, it's around 20k ohms. So it's not a problem with the wire in the pit. I can measure a similar resistance between the ground prong on the pump and sticking the other lead of the ohm meter into the ground (ground is pretty wet)The pump still operates if I plug it directly into the wall.I'm at a loss now what sort of switch to get. I thought this one would be it for good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for about 3 years","review":"I've owned two AU5ES FloodAlert sump pump controllers. Purchased first one in 2006 through Amazon. Bought the second one in 2009 at ACE Hardware store after the first one failed. That one failed in 2011. I've had better results using float switches that come with the pumps so I'm not buying another FloodAlert. Really too bad because it seems like a great product concept and it did work - even the audible high water alarm function - for a couple years. I disassembled the both failed units and saw no obvious problems (like burned out relay mentioned in another review). Did notice some corrosion on battery terminals but not enough to prevent it from working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Version is awful","review":"Really a pity they didn't bother to format the book correctly.

One word summary: wow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the trendy","review":"\\"40 oz.'s\\" really is the better of the two \\"real\\" Sublime releases. It's a religious staple for those of us who dug Sublime before major airplay attacked, and before Brad died. I was 12 when I heard \\"Date Rape\\" get played at night on KROQ here in L.A, and five years later Sublime, especially 40 oz's, has yet to get old. The entire album - all 70 minutes - has that staying power, no matter how many times you spin the disc in your player. It's rougher than \\"Sublime\\", but cleaner than \\"Robbin' the Hood\\" - and it's Brad at his poetic best. It's heavy and moody and funny and frenetically paced and everything one would expect from Sublime. \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" is great, and \\"Right Back\\", \\"What Happened\\", and \\"Ebin\\" are tight. I particularly enjoyed the riff they did on the Descendents' \\"Hope\\". This is definately one of the key albums of the 90s, and you'd all be fools not to pick this one up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Prozac","review":"The best part about this album is that it was produced for some ridicuously low amount and originally sold out of the back of Brad Nowell's car. This is a sunny album composed after countless bong hits and flowery trips. The bass line is amazingly fast and heavy, jumping over nearly every song. And every song is a classic. Brad Nowell knew how to envision a great pop song, but this album came out a couple of years too early. In the early nineties, ska (I guess that what this album is by virtue of a few of his guitar licks) was not going to make it big. 5446, Badfish, DJ, Don't Push, Scarlet Begonias, KRS-One--this album is a treasure trove of great songs. And it's over seventy minutes long. There's no filler in this album--some songs may be weak as a result of Brad's genre-bending aspirations--all of it is beautifully sung surf-ska-punk-reggae-stoner rock that has a groove and is just as great to listen to the first time as the 1000th time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have open ears this is for you","review":"I contains ska, raggae, hip hop, and punk rock.

Much like several of their other albums, this one is gonna be a huge disappointment to the fans that are simply intending to have a collection of Sublime's many great hits. Like numerous other artists I can think of, they have taken the low road yet again on this album and have come up with poorly re-mixed versions of their originals. I can only assume that the goal is wanting consumers to purchase each song (the original mix) individually for their ipods so that the most possible money can be made.

It uses an interesting approach to teach the language which I found to be effective. You will need other sources to work on listening and speaking skills.

Franco and Sandberg expressly tell you on page \\"ix\\": that this will take \\"80 to 120 hours of study time,\\" in which you \\"review consistently\\" and \\"study in short blocks of time.\\" If you do this, \\"it works.\\" I chose to purchase a paper copy (8-1/2\\" x 11\\" pages) and feel that this was the best format.

A number of references in the book would not have made much sense if I hadn't been there. I would recommend it for people interested in Cuba, interested in mystical situations, or just wanting to know more about the Cuban situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crudely crafted vehicle doesn't run","review":"This is one of the most disappointing reads in years. The author may have had a good idea, examining the tensions between expatriate Cubans and those who remained behind, but it's lost amid the cardboard cut-out characters and the formulaic \\"magical realism\\". There are occasional glimmers of interesting imagery, but the \\"story\\" wanders aimlessly over the years and the members of the family appear to be pathetic (e.g., Felicia) and/or hateful (e.g., Lourdes). The author's attitude towards her characters comes across as arbitrary and random. The vignettes from Pilar's \\"life\\" were particularly unsatisfactory. The question arises: If the author cares so little about her characters, why should the reader care at all?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Draming because this book is so bad","review":"When you mix soft core porn and culturly confused Cubans, you get this PIECE OF CRAP LITERATURE. I think their must have been at least 30 different sex or sex related scenes and oh so many other odd things. One example is when one of the characters (a girl) masturbates to her mother's old boyfriend's picture, imagining him going down on her...uck!

FOR THE SAKE OF LITERATURE DON'T READ THIS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoring in Cuban","review":"While trying to read this excuse for a story, I fought back yawns, and dreary eyes.

Celia del Pino is the matriarch of a family that spans from Havana to Brooklyn, New York. She is unswervingly patriotic in her support of Fidel Castro, while her daughter Lourdes in the United States has embraced her new life and its capitalism by opening a chain of bakeries. Celia's second daughter is ambivalent toward the revolution as she deals with abuse and mental illness. Mothers and daughters may disagree, but Celia's granddaughter forms an emotional bond with her faraway grandmother. Using fragmentary vignettes, Dreaming in Cuban is reminiscent of stories repeated down through the generations, and the reader feels a connection to this family. Try it if you liked How the Garcia Girls Lost Their Accents by Julia Alvarez or The Stone Diaries by Carol Shields."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragmented","review":"Disjointed segments come together to form Dreaming in Cuban.

I dislike it very very much. It is a torturous read. It is boring, unoriginal, unorganized and lame. I am glad to see others gave this book one star as well. Don't follow the crowd with the reviews. If you really think about it, this book is in fact pathetic. Lourdes finds that Pilar was laying in the shower \\"enjoying\\" the water in a journal. Oh come on! It is cliche and unrealistic. Also, Garcia's spicy, beautiful character that is in love and that likes to dance, play the piana and let her hair down is an old grandma (Celia). It doesn't make sense. And, I know this story isn't about mental disease but the author downplays alot of parts including the ones where Felicia supposedly murders her husband and other people as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Eaten Gift with my book","review":"I purchased the book used knowing that it would be partly worn, but when I opened the book not only did I find my receipt but I also found a half eaten lollipop between the pages.

So I did and then picked it up a few days later, and read and read. It is hard to keep track of all of the characters in the beginning, but i was used to that by reading 100 yrs of solitude at the same time. haha well, I thought it was an interesting book, but the ending was not as grand as I expected it to see. Antoher worthwhile book on how Cubans/latin americans imigrate and adapt to new lives and how their families are spread apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreaming in Cuban sent me to la la land","review":"while I applaud the author for a good first time effort, getting through this book was no small task. At the beginning of the book we are introduced to several characters and soon you can't keep track of them. At some point it feels like the author lost track of the characters herself. She left a lot of loose ends,and several plot changes that just didn't make sense or went nowhere. If this book is a \\"must read\\" for you, ONE SUGGESTION find the quickest way to the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So but not Great","review":"I bought this novel in light of the recent events in Miami relative to the Cuban American community and their views about Fidel Castro. It was an attempt to find out a little more about the political climate in Cuba and how it can divide families.Although the book was good in some parts, I found it to be written in a very disjointed manner and the story was, at times, difficult to follow. I wish that he author would have been a little more focused on where she was going and how she was going to get there. She skipped from one character to another in a fashion that I thought was annoying. Perhaps this is a novel that must be read twice in order to gain the full meaning and message. I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beethoven Album for the 21 century","review":"While there have been countless recordings of Beethoven's Cello sonatas - Schnabel and Fournier, Richter and Rostropovich, Cortot and Fournier - this album sticks out in my mind. While today's musical sobriety has left us with many boring performances, this album proves that relatively stright interpretations leave a great deal of room for flexibility. There is nothing offensive and everything is in good taste. I must add that the 3rd sonata is hair raising and electrifying in its rhythmic drive. Brendel has proven to us once again (with the help of his son) that his clear conceptions lead to great music. This album is not to be missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alfred's groaning is very disappointing","review":"No complaints about the performance and recording quality itself (see fullsome praise in all other reviews at time of writing).But no-one mentions how Alfred moans and groans and hums all the time and this is REALLY annoying in the quieter passages (take for example the opening Adagio of the Op5 No.2 on CD1:1).Also, why does the order of the works on the CDs have to be virtually random? I.e., CD 1 has Sons 2, then 4, then 3, then variations; CD 2 has variations, then 5, then 1, then more variations. Bizzare... Perhaps it was to fit it on 2 CDs, but even then the order within the CDs could have been better.Anyway, if you want a Glenn-Gould-like background from Alfred, then you will like this; otherwise, avoid..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Absolute Worst TV","review":"Do not buy this TV. Had problems with the remote working properly. Called their customer service TWICE and received the worst customer service I have ever had. Both times the technicians were rude and would not stay on the line to walk me through troubleshooting. The response was that they were \\"very busy\\" and to just return the TV.

Bad. The actors are expected to make up for a lousy screenwrite. I gave the movie away to the Salvation Army. I hope they make some money off of it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"Though some reviews of this adventure miniseries have been unfavorable, the movie successfully recreates the feeling of Saturday matinee serials, as well as the Harryhausen film of 1961 which clearly inspired it. Purists seem to have been disappointed with changes from Verne's original novel, but this Hallmark production owes more to the Cy Endfield version, and in that respect, it's entertaining, colorful, delightfully improbable, and (for a TV film) sumptuous. Enough monsters, swordfights, pirates, treasure, action, scenery, and humor for five films, and the pacing is brisk. Performances manage to engage, with Patrick Stewart's Captain Nemo a standout. Set design is very elaborate, and the film has great visual beauty. Perfect for eight and ten year olds, this fanciful and endearingly childlike \\"lost world\\" adventure is priced right to buy, for fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Mysterious Island","review":"Many others have outlined the plot here. So I won't delve into that. As a fan of Patrick Stewart, I thought I'd give this a try. It was in the cheap DVD bin, so it wasn't a big expense. This movie is awful. I can't help but wonder if Stewart owed somebody a favor to appear in it. As pointed out, Nemo works best as a background character, but here he's front and center. He's set up nice (from a stranded on an island POV) digs. The characters seem to be just running around in the jungle, once Nemo abandons them to their fate. They encounter one cheesy special effect after another. Things are so bad that in the end, Nemo is scrambling on the deck of the Nautilus when he bumps one of the appendages on the sub, and it just topples over! Badly acted, downright monotonous at times, with lousy Grade-Z SPFX, this movie is for Jules Verne completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been good","review":"The best part of this movie is Captain Nemo (well portrayed by Patrick Stewart) and his cool steampunk house. Unfortunately, that's not quite enough to balance out the ridiculous scripting, the barely passable special effects, and one highly annoying Southerner. Kyle MacLachlan makes a great protagonist. He reminds me of Dale Midkiff in the Love Comes Softly series. Too bad they messed this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Review: A Question","review":"So, the product details say both \\"Widescreen\\" _and_ \\"1.33:1\\".

When I saw this remake at the video store, I was really anxious to see an updated version with today's advanced special effects.I was sorely disappointed. Not only are the visual effects a poor effort in comparison to the 1961 version, but the modified story line is amateurishly written and the acting is as if the cast is all in on the same joke to be deliberately bad. I realized watching this that it's a made-for-TV effort, but still they don't need to make it seem so low budget. I'm really surprised an actor like Patrick Stewart would have taken on this project after reading the script.I'd highly recommend that you pass on this one and try the original instead. And while you're at it, try some of Harryhausen's other films, such as \\"First Men in the Moon\\" (1964) and \\"Jason and the Argonauts\\" (1963)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysterious Island","review":"This like Supernova stops in the middle of the story are says to be continued.

The producers have always shied away from having any set layout for Springfield, so don't expect to find any maps in here, any routes from the Simpson home to Springfield Elementary or anything like that. Instead, it's an amusing look at the various places that have made the show funny.The book takes a lot of the show's minor jokes -- the two \\"Nick's\\" bowling shops in town, for instance -- and expands them slightly to have little entries for the \\"visitor\\" to Springfield.People unfamiliar with the show won't get the point, but those of us who have watched and loved it for years will.

These tracks are generally excellent sessions recorded for radio transcriptions, Day is also backed by a swingin' group led by Van Alexander(often Kay Starr's arranger, for her jazzier stuff like \\"Movin' With Kay.\\").

Of course, I'm reading this from the perspective of a graduate student in geochemistry with a bachelors degree in math from several years ago. It's a great reference/review book for me.

So, as some others seem to insinuate on here, I'm not a \\"disenchanted\\" student looking for a free ride. I would love to get into the detail of things, but if the book doesn't explain anything properly, how the hell are you supposed to learn the material???

(Tracks 8 & 9 can be thrown in as well depending on your taste.) Then listen to the last track on the album. After doing that once or three times the you'll see how great this album is. The confusion lies with the rest of the tracks. They do lack a some structure, so they are hard to get!!!

I think it might be my favorite this year. Maybe. As to the 'why?', well, it's different. I hadn't really heard anything but one other song by Alpha, so I don't know how similar their older stuff is to 'The Impossible Thrill', but this album is definitely different than anything else I've ever heard. And in a good way. It's quite a beautiful album. Some criticisms of the album that I've read have cited the seeming lack of song structure as one of the primary weaknesses of the album, but I think it's a major strength.

The author doesn't explain what he did to resolve issues in his own life and does not explain how you can do it in yours.

Which I failed to fully understand as that concept was the basis for Darwin's Orgin of the Species. It's well known that biological lifeforms adapt to their evironment and the concept is not revolutionary.Sadly, Dr. Lipton's jump into New Age healing concepts prevented me from confirming that 'signals from outside a cell controls it's biology' was the basis for the book.

It's like a gateway to a new world, but first of all a hope for a better future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"Dr. Wayne Dyer had mentioned this book in his TV special.

However, I find the book too technical too really understand the message the author is intending. For me, a lot of the words I do not know how to pronounce and do not know what they mean and this prevents me from understanding the message of the book. Anyone with a background similar to the author will no doubt totally enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Whether you agree or disagree with what Dr. Lipton says this book is incredibly important. He bridges new discoveries with a new way of thinking about our minds and bodies. Unfortunately radically new ideas tend to be subject of much ridicule when first presented, however I'm convinced. Quantum physics has forced us to think different, and this is exactly what Dr. Lipton has done. Pick this book up and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitive Source on the Power of Belief","review":"Finally! Bruce Lipton's book is the definitive biological confirmation that energy is the true source of healing, and that our thoughts do, indeed, create reality. Lipton's illustrations are excellent, creating the visuals necessary to relate to his detailed scientific material. His stunning research breaks the bonds of traditional approaches to how the body gets sick and how the body can heal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Save your money! I bought this through Kindle so I didn't even pay full price for it, thankfully! The first 5 chapters of this 7 chapter book was mostly scientific biology which didn't interest me at all and was able to skip most of it without missing much. I thought I was getting to the heart of the book and was finally going to get some answers to find out that there aren't any answers...anywhere. I was looking for something that would guide me into changing my way of thinking, things to practice. No luck - not here. In the Addendum he references PSYCH-K with Rob Williams which was basically a plug for you to attend one of their seminars. UG!! A waste of money and time! I'd give this book zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn how we affect our cells","review":"In a very readable, partially autobiographical style, Bruce Lipton describes his eureka moment.He suddenly realized that a cell's life is mainly controlled by the environment, and only partially by it's genes, and most importantly what this means for each one of us. It's a single cell's awareness of it's environment that sets in motion the mechanisms of life. And we have trillions of these intelligent aware cells in our bodies. Lipton calls this not a self help book, but a self empowerment book. As a stem cell biologist he is well qualified to explain how cells work and why changing your beliefs can actually change your biology. The science of how our cells function is made clear with interesting explanations.Learn how environmental influences can modify genes and how these changes can be passed on.We do not have to accept the fate of genetic determination.The chapter on conscious parenting is a must read for those raising or working with children"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Choice","review":"This book fulfilled all of my expectations and more.I am very pleased that I purchased this book.

I deeply recommend you to have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biology of \\"Stretching the facts to support\\" belief","review":"I have no medical background so I skipped through much of the technical aspects, but I'll just add one more thing in case someone catches this: Lipton holds seminars which actively engage the audience in use of kinesthesiology to \\"speak to the subconscious,\\" the methods used in this seminar are far from scientific, more like the regular pseudo-science bull crap. I believed his \\"scientific\\" background until I saw the video. Any true scientist has to question the validity of his experiments, and he did not in this case. However, some theories are entertaining at the least, and the whole book is not at a loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biology of Blief (NOT)","review":"\\"Biology of Belief\\" lives up to the promise of interesting biology but not the promise that it would have anything meaningful to add to the question of belief. At least author Bruce Lipton has the good grace to confine his \\"belief\\" nonsense to an epilogue rather than elevate it to the level of the scientifically interesting material by including it as an actual chapter. I would have realized the title was misleading if had paid attention to the subtitle \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter and Miracles.\\" What was I thinking???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into the mind & heart.","review":"This was an amazing book.

Well..... :-(Would not recommend it to my students"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Law of Attraction","review":"Dr Bruce Lipton is an absolute master in his field and his devotion to helping humanity better their lives is something that we cannot dismiss. His message is clear and easy to comprehend and I thank him so much because had I not discovered Dr Bruce Lipton, I could never have changed the course of my life. Because of his remarkable content, he inspired me to write my booksThe Poison of SelfandA Story of Love - The Power of Stepping Into Your Vulnerability- both books are driven by my interpretation of the teachings from Dr.Bruce Lipton and the power of understanding who we are at a cellular level. If your life is in turmoil, by understanding your biology, you couldnt be the same person ever again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best for those with a science background","review":"Personally I really enjoyed this audio book.

It helps if the listener / reader has some biological science background to fully appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful","review":"If you want to learn the biology of a cell, this is a wonderful book, well written for that purpose. HOWEVER, if you want to learn how to use this information to help YOURSELF \\"unleash the power of consciousness\\", you will be extremely disappointed. At one point the author assures us he will provide that information in Chapter 7, However, in Chapter 7, he only tells you to give your children positive reinforcement - something we have all known for decades now. At the end of the book, he finally admits that positive thinking does not change your subconscious, and refers us to something called Psych-K for that. After reading the entire book, I did NOT receive the information promised in the Title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awe Inspiring!","review":"Bruce's description of how a single cell's intelligence is mimicked by multi cell communities (i.e humans) takes the reader on a journey toward their own ability to change the fate he/she believes awaited them from the start.

This has a lot of good information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"This book is not an easy read - but then it's not meant to be.It challenges the preconceptions that we hold dear and have held dear for generations.I enjoyed the mixture of politics, biology and belief systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for thought","review":"This is a very detailed, and sometimes too scientific, history of the discovery of the connection between mind and physical states of dis-ease in the body. If you can work through the first half of the book, explaining how Lipton finally came to the realisation that this connection existed, then you will enjoy the second half. Certainly worth reading if you have an interest in the origins of mind-body medicine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beyond the Usual","review":"Bruce Lipton is an engaging speaker who takes you beyond the mundane and usual. He is truly a scientist not caught up in the dogma of science or religion. He seeks truth and answers breaking boundaries making the unknown, known. I love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative and Inspiring","review":"I have read a lot of books about energy, consciousness and the power of the mind. I have been a member of a parapsychology team that focuses on this type of research. Reading this book actually paved way to my current thirst for knowledge on the subject. I wouldn't say that this is the best book I have read but it does answer basic questions. It also gave me the zeal to continue learning the complexity of human consciousness and believing that there is a connection between matter and miracles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quackery at it's Finest","review":"I believe our thoughts and emotions can affect our bodies and our health, but this quack makes claims he simply doesn't back up.

I found the author very difficult to listen to since he quite often pauses in mid sentence, starts to say one word and then changes to another, and repeats the same phrases so often then it gets really annoying. I don't really need to hear \\"This is really interesting because of this,\\" 100 times. The content of the C.D. is somewhat interesting although the author gives certain names to biologocal functions to steer the conversation his way, like calling the bodies response to outside stimulae \\"perception.\\" There is also a lot of re-stating the same thing over and over again without presenting any new idea. After listening to the C.D. I read that the C.D is \\"an original adaptation\\" of the book. I would have preferred a professional reading the actual book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insufferably Long Ego Trip","review":"While completely disrespecting scientists who actually use the scientific method to prove their hypotheses, Bruce Lipton makes wild and ridiculous claims with no evidence.

Don't waste your money unless you want to hear Lipton's endless and embarrassing ego trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to read this","review":"Very good it opens up a whole world of new things to contemplate! good food for thought!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Im falling asleep listening to this in audio version...","review":"I have read tons of Quantum books and all I can say is this guy is so boring I am falling asleep after 45 min of listening to him rant on.

OMG! zzzzzzzz....."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biology of Belief","review":"While well intended, this book was recommended to me by my alternative medicine Doctor. He overestimated my intelectual capacity! It is much too deep for my though processes.

Around Chapter 4 Mr Lipton eludes to the fact that he is going to get to it, but frustrating to the reader, never does!So much potential to truly change lives, but comes up disappointing. Not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for professionals and laypeople alike","review":"Great, great book. It was entertaining, educucational, mind openingg, and heart opening. I love Dr.Lipton's approach and philsophy of health. I also like that his research and conclusions help us to understand vitalistic concpets which are not testable concepts using the scientific method. His work clearly shows us that health is a multi-factorial process and is dynamic in nature. It is NOT a fixed, pre-determined event as stated by the standard medical \\"dogma\\" of the centraility of DNA. I lvoe his work and his courage to step up to the plate and speak his truth.

What he showed, in slide form, was basically his book, the Biology of Belief....Just like the book, his lecture was a fascinating mixture of wit, brilliance, and facts to make people's brains s t r e a c h. A great read if you want to know what a man came up with from literally being intimate with \\"the cell\\" for 20 years and coming up with the concept (very quantum theory ish) that the cells --even when separated-- knew exactly what the other cells were feeling... think about it and much more with this great read. I'm an Int'l Certified BodyTalk Instructor and this book is a must read for my students of the BodyTalk System for growth and understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didnt really get straight to the point","review":"It took bruce till around chapter 4 to get to what this book is about. chapter 5(biology and belief) and chapter 7 (concious Parenting) in my opinion is the best chapters. although he slightly rambles on about personal stories, I think the book was decent. Not bad, but not all that super great."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very worthwhile read. A book for its time.","review":"This is a book that I will leave out on my coffee table for easy picking-up, rather than tucking it away in the bookcase. It is heartening to see a book written by a scientist that explains realistically how your thoughts can and do effect the physical body, with a good amount of humor thrown in. Yes, not being a scientist myself, I did have a little trouble understanding some of it, but it was well worth skimming over those parts to get to the golden nuggets. I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for wcientific proof that thoughts can change even the tiniest cells of your body. A most fascinating read."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting","review":"Contained in this book are interesting scientific studies and theories that explore the mind/body/spirit connection.

Too much info about the author's mid-life crisis and life in the Carribean and not enough about the science of cell biology.

If this subject is important to you, then this is probably not the right book."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Will Inspire You but It Won't Change Your Life","review":"I'll make this review short and sweet.This book will entertain and amaze you with the stories of what is possible and how science is beginning to discover (or at least theorize) what's behind this \\"magic.\\" But it won't tell you how to participate in these miracles. So it may leave you feeling like you are watching the Superbowl from outside the stadium gate with no ticket to get in.But the hope and wonder you get from reading it is definitely worth the price. I recommend it.I was hoping his next book, Spontaneous Evolution, would dive into whole \\"what you can do to change your life\\" part of it, but based on the description, it doesn't look like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing book and fun to read!","review":"Hats off to Dr. Lipton for swimming against the stream and daring what no one else dared. This book is a fascinating read and easy to understand for the non-scientist, I even found it suspenseful and hard to put down. I only gave this four stars instead of five since I would have liked to see more documentation.

What is so promising for me is that it supportscommon sense for once. The author is scientifically consistentthroughout the book. One gets a strong feeling of certainty abouthis facts and his analysis. Our experience not only can affect ourhealth and our survival, but also our genetics. So genetic changesare not relegated exclusively to the moment of conception. The waywe respond to life circumstances can also affect the functioning ofour genes. This book opens many new doors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using science as a springboard for a leap of faith","review":"I casually bought this book assuming it was based on science...what a mistake!!! The author uses terms such as \\"energy\\" in the loosest and most irresponsible way...He draws lines where in reality there are none, in order to equate \\"wave\\" and \\"quantum\\" energy to mean the \\"healing energy\\" in some alternative medicine therapies. He further equates quantum physics to \\"mysterious\\" and \\"unexplained\\" paranormal phenomena...not to mention debunked and unverified phenomena! But the efficacy of alternative healing is not even questioned in this book-it is presented as effective and unresearched. The author expects the reader to make a leap of faith-if you accept quantum physics, then you must also accept alternative healing- based soley on the misuse of terms. What a joke!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work For Me","review":"Recently heard Bruce Lipton on the Coast to Coast Show and was intrigued by his presentation of Biology of Belief. I downloaded the three plus hours of CD's with the expectation of learning of his material and how he and others benefited from it.Overall very intersting, but I found it to be more of an academic discussion with little practical application. In the last 18 minutes he mentions you can change your subconscious programing and mentions he has a 10 minute technique for doing so but makes no mention of any specifics.For entertainment would give him 3-4 stars, for 'news I can use' 1/2 - 1 star. To recommend to a friend - 0 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step in the right direction","review":"It's an interesting intellectual leap from cultural western scientific nihilism into quantum oneness reality. Had he studied zen Lipton would have arrived sooner; but it just wouldn't have been by the way of micro biology.It's unfortunate that the subtitle, \\"Unleashing the Power of Consciousness, Matter & Miracles,\\" is misleading. This is a fine biography, but it doesn't tell us anything about how to \\"unleash\\" whatever hidden powers we have. I was waiting for \\"the\\" secret to be divulged. For that we should turn to Deepak Chopra who reveals a multitude of secrets to unleash our hidden powers.I would recommend the Biology of Belief to all science majors.

This is cutting-edge science written in clear, concise language. Dr. Lipton includes his own background and experience, giving a very human dimension to the discussion.

As an anthropologist, I was hoping for a scientific review of recent neurological and psychological advances in understanding the ways in which people come to believe things like religion or superstition or engage in behaviors that range from ritualistic habits of baseball players to OCD. Instead, Lipton seems to embrace irrational belief rather than explore it; adopting pseudoscience rather than science. His derision of evidence-based medicine in the introduction and first chapter are also disappointing.

This book charts his personal and professional journey in this revolution in cellular biology.

Unfortunately, I found it very basic. Someone who is just beginning to explore healthy eating and the how-to's of living a healthy life in the Land of the Whopper might find inspiration and information here. If you've already been reading about and trying to live this lifestyle, there is nothing new here.

Instead, it seems more of a \\"commercial\\" for Dr. Weil.And, his way of eating is not practical. His philosophy is to never use anything processed or from the grocery store. Fine if you live on a farm where you can organically grow your own food, but some of us live hectic lives in big cities. Give us advice that real humans in the 21st century can use - not something left over from the '60's.I don't recommend this one. There are other books out there that you can buy that are more geared towards healthy eating in today's world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sure way to look like Dr.Weil","review":"Dr.Weil looks like the before picture in a bad diet product ad. He is clinically obese. Follow his advice which recommends eating a low protein, high carb, moderate fat diet and you too will look like him. His advice on Omega 3's is about the only wise idea in this book. And low glycemic carbs are certainly the way to go, but not as the center of your nutritional intake. Anyone who thinks the average person eats way too much protein has no idea about correct human nutrition."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Biology Majors Only","review":"After seeing the Author on the Today Show, I was impressed with what he had to say about the book and immediately got online to buy it. I was hoping to find out more about Truths vs. Myths when it came to dieting. This book however dives so deep into the chemistry of the food and how your body digestes differently things, I felt like I needed a Biology degree just to understand it. I wanted more focus on the real life issues that people deal with and real life cures for those issues. It was very hard to get into and took me forever just to get through the first three chapters. If you're into the way food digest and how the digestion of different food works together then this will be a helpful book for you. However, if like myself you want to read about real life solutions then this book is less than helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall very good, but . . .","review":"An excellent book that will probably force you to re-examine your eating habits, if not actually change them. A lot of Weil's advice is both impractical and unrealistic (if you eat chicken it must be free-range chicken, for instance), and at there are some gaps in his work. His recommendation on milk, for example, is to avoid it because a small portion of the population may be allergic and because of its high fat content (what if you're not allergic and use skim milk instead?). Nonetheless, you will come away from this book armed with very useful knowledge and recommendations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eating Well","review":"I'm still reading it, but its a great guide book to making sure your eating the right kinds of foods.

The fact that doesn't go into enough depth for some of us certainly doesn't prevent it from being an excellent book for most readers, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bald to listen to!","review":"If this Doctor knows so much about nutrition, how come he's bald? You may think it is genetic, as is his stocky build - but people who are not tall, thin and hairy have no business practicing medicine. He should be strong enough to overcome a few genes he picked up from his family! Why does the medical profession allow stocky bald men to earn an MD? What kind of message is that sending to our children? For example: who would want to get a nose job from a surgeon who inherited a hawk nose from his father? It is absurd to think that Dr. Weil is worth reading just because he is so educated, knowledgeable and articulate. So what if he has medical advice that can save your life? How can life be worth living if one is bald and 20 pounds overweight?Doctor - grow thy hair!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Munificent, Dr. Wild!","review":"Dr. Wild have released a very nice and unique cookbook with the publication of this one. I own several other marinading cookbooks, and there are many good ones out there. This one is my absolute favorite because the recipes are a little more than your basic grilled steak, fried gecko, or hamburger. Try the Somali grilled Arctic Hare with gorgonzola-scallion compound butter and the Polish coati mundi steak with rosemary brushed potatoes and red peppers. Don't forget to try the barbeque sauce. It's fantastic. The book's contents include tips on grilling, burgers, beef and veal, lamb and pork, poultry, game and game birds, and sauces, salsas, maranades, rubs and other condiments. There are no fish recipes so if you are looking for that specifically, find another cookbook. If everything else sounds good to you, you will enjoy this inovative book by the great Dr. Wild."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment for me","review":"The first half of this book is filled with medical jargon, terms such as omega 3's, ATP (Adenosine triphosphate), SFAs, MUFAs (monounsaturated fatty acids), PUFAs, and the list goes on. There are brief stories called \\"Healing Stories\\" throughout the book which tell of how a person switches to an all-vegetarian diet or a person gives up fast food and then they feel noticeably better (duh). As a busy working mother, the only useful information that I got out of this book was to eat more fruits and vegetables, and there was also a helpful section on how to read labels. The last half of the book has recipes in it, including Spinach Puree, Stir Fried Red Cabbage, & Green Cabbage and Mushrooms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you for this book!","review":"I think this book is great.

He is the master of the food-trend spin! Now some of these recipes are good, but I'm frightened at the thought of anyone taking his advice to heart as based in medical science.Weil has a habit of making grand, sweeping declarations of what is \\"bad\\" and unhealthy and what is not, but never gives background or research for where he got that information - much of it which is wrong, as anyone with a little nutritional common sense will know.Both Rosie Daley and Oprah should know better than to collaborate on this kind of fuzzy science! I've already sold my book to a used book store, and I won't make the mistake of buying his books again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and good for all ages","review":"This book explains some important principles of nutrition that are effective and good for all ages - and there's a recipe section, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Wine, New Bottle","review":"Criticizing a well-intentioned man who is likeable and charming, looks like Santa, and is well-intentioned, is always a thankless task. I've met too many people failed by Dr. Weil's methodology; perhaps as many as have benefited. It would be helpful if he subjected his methods to some double blind tests. Yes, orthodox medical practice has all the big bucks, and it would behoove that community to fund these tests. We all know they never will. Nevertheless, in light of the medical communitiy's failure to do so, Dr. Weil should point out that he really has little basis for making his claims. The argument that his techniques are just \\"good common sense\\" doesn't hold much water. The belief that the sun revolved around the earth was also based on good common sense, and yet it was wrong. Until, the good doctor can prove otherwise, his medicine is as much hit and miss as most other folk medicine.

If anything, it was slanted towards the Bush/Cheney side. Seeing as this was the CORRECT side as far as the law is concerned, this was a good thing. I enjoyed the coverage immensely, although wish they would have spent a little more time showing actual election night returns footage (They showed the important stuff, but could have decicated an extra 5 minutes to showing more).If you want to remember that wacky month in American history, I think you'd like this DVD a lot..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Solid Examination of Stupidity","review":"In this highly ambiguous, glossy, rewrite of the 2000 election, we witness the stupidity that is CNN. Whether you are to the left or right of the political spectrum, this recap will appall you. Especially if you have any respect for history; worse still if you favor detail.This film jumps over events as if they never even happened. You will read history books, reading digests, etc., that will tell the events in the proper context of their import during this fateful election, yet the news, the actual news, will barely even mention them, if at all. Probably because it is as much their fault, as the actual perps.CNN is a pathetic, empty, propaganda machine.

I have to admit that a lot of \\"guru\\" advice turns out to be wrong-headed, but you have to dig a lot of dirt to find a diamond, and this is one. People just want to label this as down-sizing. Hey, most companies that need to have their processes reengineered are over-staffed. At least this way, if reductions are necessary, there is rhyme and reason to where they occur. It isn't just another across-the-board slash that cuts meat as well as fat, and gives the remaining employees no additional support systems. And down-sizing misses the point.

Reengineering the Corporation is one of the latter types of books. While it was often used as prescriptive at the time it was introduced in 1994, it has become more about the paradigms of how we view the concept of how change is designed, led and measured in business. With the advent of broad integrated business systems that logically define many business relationships, the approach recommended in the initial printing has had to evolve to accomodate the development in IT applications, however, the concept of radical change presented here remains a valuable point on the timeline of the evolution of business process managment thought.

The slight differences between this screenplay and the finished movie provide one with both a clearer understanding of Nolan's intentions, and an appreciation of what fortuitous circumstances had to come together to result in such a perfect end-product: this brilliant screenplay (which I can sit and read and imagine being performed by utterly unsuitable actors, dream who'd have been the most ill-chosen director), ideal actors and director, fantastically fitting sets and cinematography, music, and so on."},{"rating":"1","title":"could have been much better","review":"This collection of Transvion songs is missing their best- Back on my knees again, Every little thing, You dont believe the type,and You put the spell on me all from LIttle bubble album.

Although my trip was nearly 2 years ago, I still flip thru this book on occasion to dream about my next trip, and YES I'm going back! There is so much I that I missed due to my short stay, but thanks to this book I got to see my preffered highlights and I wouldn't change a thing.Monterey is a very visually stunning area, my absolute favorite having visited in the US so far, and this book is a great way to ensure you see what you want to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great designs but hard-to-follow instruction","review":"I was very excited by the designs in this book but I felt like steps were missing in the instructions and therefore, I was unable to complete several of the pieces.

The balls it comes with are loud, but that's what catches their attention. We also spun other balls and toys such as little people on the spinners. She lost interest in it for a few weeks and one day she used the toy as a ladder to get onto the couch. She would stand on the spinners and then the treetop. I caught her doing this about 3 times and now the spinners dont spin at all(not a battery problem). She's very petite and only weighs 18 lbs., So I was very surprised that she could do any damage to a fisher price toy. Even though I threw out the box, I'm returning this toy to Toys r Us. Since it is broken, I will be exchanging it for a completely different toy. Anyone can do this. I know because I worked there, in customer service, for 2.5 years. If they give you any problems, just ask to see the manager. Dont waste your money people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety hazard with this toy","review":"I purchased this toy for my son when he was 7 months old. When he was nine months, he got his arm stuck in the hole on the treehouse. (His arm went in the hole at the top of the treehouse and came out the hole just to the left of the treehouse.) Fortunately, I was right there when it happened and was able to get his arm out before he was injured trying to get his arm out himself. I returned the toy to Fisher-Price and told them about my experience. If you decide to purchase this product (I wouldn't), be very careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy!","review":"I bought this toy because I thought it looked really cool.

I would just recomend buying the balls separately. They have the cutest animals in them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It looks so good on the package. Like the others have mentioned, this is a very noisy toy. I bought it for my 5 mos old and it stopped working within 2 days. He didn't even play much with it. I called FP customer service and they refunded my money without much fuss. I don't really recommend this toy. However, my son did seem to like the balls that came with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"My 9 month old really loves the Incrediblock, and I already had a set of the round \\"blocks\\" so I got this one for him. Big mistake! I have the same complaints as the other parents, it is too loud with more than one ball and doesn't really do much (especially for $20). We amuse ourselves by putting other stuff on the spinners (like toy trucks). My son could really care less about this. I wish I could return it but we threw away the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of fun but....","review":"This is a great toy but as the other reviewer said, when the balls spin around on the disks, the noise is so loud that you cannot hear the music. However, my son enjoys the toy and I would recommend it to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish i would have waited for FP to work the bugs out !","review":"in concept this is an adorable toy, but i have a few big issues with it:1. SO loud & noisy! the racket the plastic balls make when they roll around!!! you have to strain to enough hear the animal sounds & music2. although my 6 month & 2 yr old like it (noisy & newest toy in the house), it is honestly incredibly BORING! pretty much the entire entertainment value is putting the balls thru the tree, etc & when they hit the base it spins...that is it! i like toys that \\"do\\" something, or entertain..meaning a great improvement on this toy would be to have extra sounds ~ a creak when when you open the tree door, monkeys chattering when you see the monkeys behind the door, water gurgling/bubbles when the ball hits the waterfall....but nothing!i really wish i would have waited for FP to redesign/revamp this toy before i rushed out & got it. not much to it & most certainly not worth the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy if it works.","review":"We got this toy for my daughter for Christmas. Like other people have said, you cant hear the music over the clanking of the balls but she enjoyed it anyway. She played with it for about 2 weeks before the plates stopped spinning. I called Fisher Price to ask for a replacement and after giving them 2 numbers off the bottom of the toy she told me they would put a check in the mail for $25 and I would not have to return the product. Save your money and go with one of the other toys from the Roll-a-round line."},{"rating":"1","title":"I dont like this toy at all.","review":"I do not like this product at all. First of all its not worth the money spent. Its small for the price. The balls clanking together make it wayy to noisy to even hear the music. To top it off the things stopped spinning. I would recommend not getting this. Its not worth the money or time to put it together. But I contacted Fisher Price and they are sending a check."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise tree house...but nice balls...","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was 1 year old. I thought it would be a nice toy. However, as most of the parents said, the motors of this toy is very loud. you won't notice if there is any music at all. My son can put the balls in the right place, but he was more interested in stopping the spining discs. The balls are very interesting, my son still plays with the ball, but not the tree house anymore. I suggest to purchase the balls only which is way cheaper, and lot of different kinds to choose from. The tree house...it just turns into a junk toy that take up space in my apartment that my son is not interested in it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jungle Treehouse RollArounds","review":"My son absolutely loves any toy that contains balls. He loved this toy when he got it. I agree with others that the music cannot be heard when the balls are rolling around. We didn't even know it played music at first. Unfortunately the first week my son got this toy it stopped working. The music still plays, but the disks that spin the balls around stopped working. We were very disappointed with this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too loud and very different than picture!","review":"I agree with a past review that this toy is too loud. You can't even hear the music when the balls are bouncing around. But that is not my problem. The hole that you drop the balls in on the top of the treehouse is not on the top as it appears in all pictures on the web site, on this website, on the box, even in the instructions inside. The hole to put the balls in is in the front of the tree. It requires a completely different skill set to use this. It is not a 6 month toy. I called to complain and was treated terribly and told \\"we know about it. There is a disclaimer ont he box that contents can differ from picture.\\" THAT WAS THEIR ANSWER TO ME!!! I thought that was pretty crappy. My 13 month old son cannot even figure out how to get the balls in that hole.What poor poor cusomter service. I even talked to a manager and got that same poor and rude service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept... NOISY RACKET THOUGH !","review":"Fisher Price has a great concept, but needs to go back to the designing steps. Rubberized balls would be much quieter and much smoother rollers than plastic. I took our toy apart and lined the spinners with felt so they would not wobble which was creating a noise even without the balls on them. We use racket balls with the toy now and my 6 month old does enjoy the activity.Hope Fisher Price reads these reviews.apep@chartermi.net"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but too loud!!!","review":"Very cute toy and neat concept, but when you get all the balls going the noise gets so unbearable that even my 14 month old puts her hands to her ears! The toy plays a nice little jungle tune which ofcourse you can't hear over the racket. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor construction quality means no more spinning","review":"My son loved this toy. Too bad it wasn't made to Fisher Price standards. It didn't last. I guess it just wore out - no more spinning. My 18 month-old was a little rough with it holding down the spinning circles and trying to spin them himself. I didn't give it a second thought because you know, it's Fisher Price. It should be able to handle an 18 month-old! Sigh. He was getting frustrated it didn't spin anymore I had to get rid of it. What a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, but stops spinning after some time","review":"My son got this when he was six months old, and it really taught him a lot. The night he got it, he learned how to sit up on his own without support. It taught him how to push the button to make it spin, and really held his attention. Over a year later, he's still playing with it, although he uses it to put his zoo animals in. The only thing that I don't like is that it stopped spinning. It still makes the sounds, but the wheels just stopped turning. I took the whole thing apart, tried to make sure the bands were on properly, and still nothing. I replaced the batteries, everything. The spinning function is just dead. He still uses it, so overall it's a great toy, but don't expect it to last long enough to be passed down to a younger child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud and boring!","review":"If you or your baby are sensitive to noise, don't get this toy! When the balls are on the turntables, you can't even hear the music. It was so loud that it scared my 8 month old! Aside from the noise, it's very boring. My baby was bored after a couple of minutes. I usually like Fisher Price toys, but don't waste you money on this one! Try the \\"Laugh and Learn\\" learning table or the gym wall...both have lots of activities and have proven safe so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Noisy","review":"Santa brought this toy to our daughter. Immediately, we were completely turned off by how noisy the toy became when you added the balls. The roll a rounds drop hard and loudly onto the platforms and then clank so loudly that you can barely hear the music in the background. The balls do not need to drop this hard to activate the music, as simply rolling over the buttons works. It is a very poor design. We are very disappointed with this product. Our daughter does enjoy pushing the big red button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Toy","review":"This toy is so much fun for a little guy, mine was six months when we got it a month ago, and he just can't get enough of it. Each week he finds new things to do with it. At first having the balls on the spinning surface was just too noisy, it frightened him, so we left them off. But now he loves putting them on and taking them off and watching them spin. His latest is using it to stand up (using the trees to push up). It is very sturdy, but of course once he's up he can't get down without crashing, so that is my one caveat, keep a close eye if your little one is pulling up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Made - A waste of Money","review":"We bought this toy for my 10 month old daughter for Christmas and after 2 weeks of hardly any play, the wheels stopped spinning.

Her God-given talents combined with a passionate stage presence, handsome looks and magnetic warmth made her a unique artist--I heard once on a TV documentary that she was the most \\"decorated\\" (i.e. award-winning) musical artist of the century! This superb collection of Verdi arias include two from \\"Aida\\" which, most likely, will not ever be matched, an exquisite 'Willow Song' & 'Ave Maria' from \\"Otello\\" plus several familiar arias from \\"Ernani,\\" \\"Trovatore,\\" \\"Forza,\\" \\"Traviata\\" and the sleepwalking scene from \\"Macbeth.\\" The sound on this compilation RCA CD is fine, if not as good had it been recorded more recently than the 70's.

The majority of the book, Mr. Hayek presents a convincing case for individual liberty, and the price mechanism, (unfettered by government interference), being the best transmitter of dispersed knowledge. The last third of the book, however, Mr. Hayek seems to ally himself with the \\"collectivists\\" in promoting public housing, public education, etc., something he had railed against earlier in what he dismissively called \\"social justice\\". That doesn't seem consistent. For those looking for a more concise book, I'd recommend \\"The Road to Serfdom\\", which is a lot shorter, and competely consistent, across the board.

Throughout 400 odd pages Hayek slammed, among other things, organised labour, socialism, the abuse (politicisation) of words, the political spectrum, and the welfare state. What impressed more in this book than in some of his other works is that here Hayek actually suggested alternatives - some of which have since become economic, if not political, reality. Hayek's great talent was always to see through proposals to their underlying belief(s), and he showed his talent had not dimmed here. Even if one does not agree with anything he says, Hayek presented an awesome argument."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not as brilliant as claimed","review":"When I ordered this CD, I thought the coughing couldn't really be as bad as people claim here. It actually is. It sounds like the recording was made in an institution used to heal people with terrible colds. Unfortunately, the coughs quite seriously ruin the overall enjoyment one can get out of this recording.As for the raving of Mravinsky's interpretation, I'm not sure I'd agree with the verdict that this is the best ever. It's true, Mravinsky knew the symphony very well - it was actually dedicated to him if I remember correctly. But it falls somewhat short of Jansons' amazing interpretation with the Pittsburgh Symphony (and I'm really not writing this because I live in Pittsburgh right now - I couldn't care less about this boring city).So if you want one good recording of the 8th, get the Jansons one, that one also spares you pulling your hair out over the coughing.

There are exercise which use words that have not been learned and which are not in the dictionary. The vocabulary in each chapter is somewhat arranged by topic, but is incomplete and confusing. The book is designed to follow as a sort of episodic course, but it is a horrible reference book, and concepts like verb tenses are separated by pages and sometimes over several chapters.It is unfortunate that this seems to be the seminal textbook for Italian.

It follows the annoying trend in language books toward using words and grammatical concepts in exercises before they are introduced and explained.

The whole subject of accent marks is poorly addressed nor are the verbs (-rre verbs), that contradict the statement that only three endings are possible, ever explained.

The makers of the documentary gathered a terrific group of interviews which are well edited making the entire film very entertaining. (Filmmakers, authors, actors, critics) The variety of commentators provides a broad perspective on the history, context (historical and cultural), influence, and legacy of Film Noir. The filmmakers include opposing opinions from different commentators about the first film noir movie and whether film noir is a genre or a style. This adds to the seemingly unbiased approach. That the participants interviewed all seem to be genuinely interested and excited about Film Noir is infectious to the viewer, regardless of whether the viewer is familiar with the themes or is seeing this film as an introduction.

There is no organ description or stoplist (although a quick search on google will yield this). There is no essay on the performance or biographical information about the organist.

A glossary and a more extensive index would help, but importantly, the author needs to learn to give clear definition at the point at which he introduces a new concept. E.g. there are no references in the index to the different concepts of risk (performance risk, financial price risk, etc.), and where these various concepts are first used there tend to be no introductory and no later (post elaboration) essentializing explanation or definition of the pertinent concept. This is not a book for neophytes to this subject; since I am one, I found it very unwieldy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and with plenty of mistakes","review":"I had to buy this book as it was the text book for one of the subjects that I am studying.Dated: e.g. Many examples that deal with European currencies that were replaced by the Euro.Errors: In the illustrations, there are some calculations that take incorrect parameters to derive the results (obviously yielding wrong results). This is misleading and time consuming.Verbosity: The book explains in twenty pages something that can be explained in five.No good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Examples are enjoyable but plenty of obvious mistakes","review":"We are using it as our textbook for our Master course in Australia. Both the teacher and students found that the practical examples are very interesting. However, there are inconsistencies in the usage of exchange rate presentations. Some mathematical calculations and charts are obviously wrong. Mr Smithson, please spend more time to amend your book. Thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Back in high school","review":"Chingy is nice on the eyes, but this album is not nice on the ears. Back in high school, I may have bumped this, but listening to a grown man brag about wearing Girbaud, matching outfits, and partying just gets old after awhile. I would expect something like this from maybe Bow-wow, but Chingy is grown, and I wish he'd talk about more relevant issues. I was listening to lines that obviously were not meant to take on the poetic ability of true hip-hop (i.e. Dr. Seuss rhyming--pick the VERY first word that rhymes with the word before and make it a rap). The Chingy groupies will probably think this album is hot and PHYSICALLY he is, but not this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ever see someone throw up through their ears!?!?!?!?!?!?","review":"If you want to see the most amazing thing, listen to this album. The surprising event you will get is you will throw up from your ears. I thought we got rid of this clown with the last ridiculously wack album he put out. But just like a bad string of herpes he is back, polluting the airwaves with more immature, infantile, so called \\"music\\". Chingy is no lyricist and when the beat is actually decent he wastes it. This album is wack straight up and down. Chingy is not just a member of the beat waster club he is the president."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is The Kind Of Crap Wrong With Hip Hop Today","review":"If any of y'all think i'm a rap basher or what ever than check my profile because i'm anything but that. Its just hip hop today is really starting to [...]. None of its original in the least bit its just the same crap over and over. Basically all they talk about is guns, woman, sex, money, and drugs. Chingy is a perfect representation of whats wrong with the hip hop scene. He relys on image by posing on the front cover to get a wannabe look and his rapping is simply laughable. All these people like Ja Rule, Chingy, Lil Jon, Nelly, Fabulous, Young Jeezy and all the other terrible rappers deserve to be banned from rapping.

In fact I think this will hold the record for the FASTEST achieved 1-star average a cd has ever received! Hey at least Chingy accomplished something in his mundane life.

I'll admit that \\"Right Thurr\\" and \\"Holidae Inn\\" were catchy when they first came out but other than those two half-way decent club singles, Chingy has done nothing but bring us garbage and contribute to the downfall of hip hop. Forget hip hop this isn't even good club music. Juvenile makes good club music, Dip-Set makes good club music, Lil Wayne makes good club music, So does G-Unit, T.I, Young Dro and many other mainstream rappers. Chingy however just brings us more garbage with each album getting worse and worse. I pray for the sake of hip hop that he will put the mike down and go back to working at McDonalds.

There isn't a single cut on this CD that doesn't deliver the goods. There's no excess in this package. It's all go and no show.This one's diamond in the rough. If you're into music that rocks hard, e.g., Metallica, Creed, C.O.C. you owe it to your self to check out Throttle Junkies.You won't be disappointed.The singer's got a voice and he sings with power and emotion. He's backed up by a guitar duo that harkens back to the glory days of Aerosmith and Thin Lizzy with a rhythm section that crushes heads.If you're into Buck Cherry, New American Shame, etc. Throttle Junkies belongs in your collection.Don't believe me?

It definitely tingles on application for me which is uncomfortable. A little goes a long way. It seemed to sit on top of my skin without really sinking in. The package is wasteful on this and all the Definity products in terms of the huge hunk of plastic involved. It's an okay moisturiser but it does not hold a candle to the correcting protective lotion in the same line. That one goes on nicer, is in a more familiar form of a lotion pump, does not sting and has sun protection. Gives all the same glucosamine benefits too.Skip this one and get the Definity correcting protective lotion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I love this Olay Definity Foam Moisturizer. It's not that big of a bottle but it does go a long way. You don't need the much when putting it on. I am 28 and I have still have a little acne, not as much when I was a teenager, but I think it also helps for people who has acne on their skin, it's not greasy and if you have sensitive skin, and acne prone skin like me you'll love it. Doesn't bother or make you flare up at all... I wish I had known about this when I was a teenager maybe it could have helped me sooner. Great Product that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeh, Good!","review":"Product is wonderful. Goes on smoothly; you can feel it \\"plump\\" up your skin.

The product that I received does not, making it of no use to me on most days. In addition to that the product has a tan color and stings when applied to the skin.

It's definitely not for sensitive skin. My skin broke out and took a couple of weeks to clear up. Also, because it is a foam, it's really hard to control the amount you want. I don't know why anyone would make a foam moisturizer...doesn't make a lot of sense. I didn't find it all that moisturizing.

I don't really have wrinkles so I can't really say anything about its anti-aging ability but I do like the way it feels. I use it as a night moisturizer since I have oily skin and don't need something like this during the day. I do like the way it feels. It leaves my face soft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make in China","review":"My order is labeled made in China.

For the ballads I put Rubinstein and Ashkenazy in a special place. Ashkenazy has a better sound (thick and deep bass sound which is familiar in his recordings) and his playing he is exstremely powerfull. Rubinstein's sound is a bit flat but has no hiss or that kind of stuff. The playing is clean, every note is heard and the fantasy-feeling gets perfectly through. For the scherzos I put Rubinstein in the first place. In the 2nd I also like Argerich's powerfull approach and Kissin's playing in this schrezo is also superb. But for me no one gets the 3rd better than Rubinstein. Just listen to the \\"raindrops\\" in the right hand! I like the 4th very mush but find the Ashkenasy best. So after all I think that this must be the recording if you are looking for the ballads and the schrezos on one recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live show NOT to be missed!","review":"Rockapella shines in this performance feature. Not a complete \\"front to back\\" performance as it is obvious that the order of the songs has been changed so the show will flow better on video. The ONLY thing that is lacking in this presentation is a sound mix in 5.1 surround, which is the only reason for the 4 star rating. Still, it remains the \\"Blast!\\" of a capella.I had the pleasure of hosting Rockapella for a concert in 1997 and I have to say that these guys are as great off stage as they are on. Of course, they loved my fajitas so their taste is impecable as well! A live show anywhere near you has to be a MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And I usually dislike Heifitz...","review":"Most of the time I have heard Heifitz recordings, I dislike him. He always seems to me as if his playing is the unwinding of a spring that's overtightened; one doesn't feel that he's living each note.But this CD changed my mind.I'm a violinist, and I played this CD to a violinist friend asking him to identify it. He identified the Sibelius from the very first 2 notes. (It is so, so beloved). Within 10 notes he knew the violinist was 'old school'. Within 20 he guessed Heifitz.We both marvelled at the accuracy of his double stops and his spicatto is unmatched.This CD is one of my car's 'top 5'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I purchased this book for a graduate course at Southeastern, University in Washington, DC. This book was great because it was clear and to the point. Reading and learning from this book you get a understanding of the theories and goals of public budgeting.

You were able to follow the chapters all the way through. The concluding thought at the end of each chapter really help you understand more if there were something in the chapters you could not quite understand. Over all, this entire book was an excellent choice. It easy to read and understand and I really enjoyed learning from this book.Adrienne Washington(Washington, DC)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another notch in Jack's belt","review":"Supposedly the purpose of this book is to portray Jack Kennedy as a tender, affectionate young man-- different from the philandering JFK of the tabloids. Then proceeds to tell of a sexual conquest that most respectable women would be ashamed to admit that they fell for. Should have left well enough alone. Out of respect for Jackie, Gunilla waits until after her death, to write the book, however I find it hard to believe that Jack could have written so many love letters and long distance phone calls to her along with all the other women to which he has been linked without her being a little suspicious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time","review":"Absolutely terrible. That's the only way to describe this; terrible. If you're interested in the thinking of a loose woman, then sure, I'd recommend picking up this book (if you can call it that). This was the deliberate endeavor to sabotage a marriage, though in vain. If von Post had any sort of dignity or pride whatsoever, she would not taint the image of the late president by writing about her silly fling. The quintessential romantic may adore this work, quixotic as it may be. Thus, if you display the same idiosyncratic characteristics of this woman--if morose, desperate women don't abhor you--then you may even like this book. What amazes me is the stark contrast between the two women of this triangle. von Post's attack on matrimony is almost tangible via this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh! really?","review":"If Jack Kennedy would have married Gunilla Von Post, he would have cheated with Jackie probably. He was a born philanderer and we should take these letters with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even entitled to a 1 star","review":"As a collector of JFK books, I ran across this book a library book sale. And, frankly, I have a lot more respect for my library for getting rid of this trash. As one of the other reviewers said, I can't even believe that someone would publish this book and that the author would have enough nerve to tell her story. I'm not one to judge other people, but if she had an affair with the married JFK then she should have enough pride to keep it to herself. And then her parents! They were perfectly willing to have thier daughter openly be seen with a much married man - please. Don't bother with this one.

There's a bunch of gore, weird bitchy people, and child abuse. I thought the abuse of the little kid was sick and twisted, and that all the characters were boring and only there to be killed off. It just makes me think that the (cross-dressing) author of this book is a bit off in the head to even come up with this sort of disgusting thing.

Annoying style.","review":"5% of this book was interesting. The rest was a combination of the whining insecurity of a horribly boring human female, and boring observations of how the daily trivia of Neanderthal life differs from the daily trivia of our lives.And this book contained an annoying style I have never seen before. The author ends hundreds of sentences and paragraphs with:but--...And yet, there was--and then--and--...If you will...Over and over again, sometimes several times on a page, this leaving the thought hanging writing style is used. It got so annoying in places it almost made the book unreadable.

What a disappointment after Hominids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humans","review":"Sawyer does an admirable job picturing an alternate universe where Neanderthals and not humans became the dominant hominid--and what happens when contact becomes possible between them.

Apparently western thought is rubbish and socialism is where it is all at. In order to read this book I had to suspend everything I know about economic laws. In the idealized neanderthal society one doesn't even have to buy a house. When one is of age, simply go pick out an empty one.

Cool premise, abysmal execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Can't Hit A Home Run Every Time","review":"For Sawyer, this is probably just a double.

As far as I've ever seen, there's never been a mid-series novel that is very stand alone. Some people seem to think there are, but there just aren't. But as I said, pretty good for mid-series. We're at the point in the story arc, though, where the ideas presented in \\"Hominids\\" now get to be really poked at. For one, the Neanderthals non belief in a God. One thing that did surprise me, though, was Mary Vaughan's at least to me, sudden super-religiousness (is that a word? Oh well.) In the first one, she didn't seem as... close-minded about it. In this one, she was really like \\"There's a God, shut up Ponter.\\" Anyway, good for mid-series."},{"rating":"2","title":"species collide","review":"I found the first two volumes of the 'parallax' series to be quite a lot of fun. Sawyer put a good deal of effort into making his characters just alien enough, yet just endearing enough, for his well-crafted stories to hang together.I had a niggling question about one of his theories, specifically on how the Neanderthal society acted to weed out the potential for crime in the gene pool, and emailed him.

This is an overly familiar plot device now, but in 1965 it was all the rage (James Garner starred in a less sinister film called \\"Mr. Buddwing\\" the same year based on a very similar idea). Gregory Peck does a good job of looking suitably concerned and befuddled, and Walter Matthau provides needed comic relief. Black and white might've been a mistake; films built around crazy mysteries like this one just seem to cry out for color (\\"Charade,\\" \\"Arabesque\\"). A more interesting leading lady might've helped, as well, because Diane Baker isn't gonna make anyone forget Audrey Hepburn. Nonetheless, this is a fun and somewhat forgotten film that will definitely hold your interest while it's on, and the DVD print is excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD PLEASE!","review":"This Hitchcock like suspense masterpiece featuring great performances, stunning black & white cinematography, and a Quincy Jones score needs to be on DVD now!

Chapter two, entitled \\"Neocortical expnasion and elaboration during primate evolution: a view from neuroembryology\\" is worth the book alone, giving a detailed an much neglected view (compared to the rest of modern neuroscience) on how minicolumns and the neurons/connections within develop in humans and other primates.

Those globes are very dainty and light weight. I loved them. They water my plants for a good week or two depending on the plant and despite a little dirt getting in the bottom, they work just fine. My plants are saved!Because I loved them so much I ordered 2 sets from amazon. What arrived was a much larger, thicker, bulkier version of the aqua globes. When filled with water they almost tip my small house plants over (the others didn't).At first I was going to send them back but now I figure I will use them for some outdoor ferns I have in pots or for a large indoor tree I'd like to get.Just a warning, if you need to water a small or medium house plant, the ones that you get from Amazon might not work. The ones you can get at a store are the proper ones for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not effective","review":"I purchased these for a plant that I often forget to water. Unfortunately, they're not effective. When I checked the plant a week after inserting the globes, I found the soil to be dry, and the globes to still be full of water.

They look pretty, but didn't serve their purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute but no so useful","review":"The main problem is inconsistency in the diameter of the tube.

No glass was in the box but the stem of the globe was about 2\\" shorter than the other one and it was ragged at the end which indicated to me that it wasn't made that way. One of another pair, the stem is so narrow that it is almost impossible to get water into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aqua Globes are the best invention for house plants I have found","review":"I rely on Aqua Globes for my plants even when I am watering them regularly. At my house, a good soaking watering and a filled Aqua Globe holds most of my plants nicely for a full week. And, my plants grow well with the slow release of water from the globes. Use the real Aqua Globes - the knock-offs don't get the hole at the bottom of the stem right and it releases too much water. The globes also work great on porch plants in the heat of summer. I usually find dirt clogged in the stem of the globe when I remove it to fill it with water, so I use a bamboo spike, which you can buy in an inexpensive pack in the grocery store, to poke the dirt down into the globe itself, then rinse the dirt out before filling the globe. You can use a soup mug to hold the globe upright while you fill it from the faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't work very well","review":"I purchased these to water some window boxes.

The first thing I noticed that even without water, they are heavy. So once you add the water to them they weigh a lot more than you would think. I tried them in several average sized pots (just like they show in the commercial) and they were so heavy that the pots kept tipping over. Also the ends were constantly getting clogged. It's just much more efficient if I water my plants myself.

I have a plant that I water in my office and there are days when I'm not there. This helps ensure my plant doesn't die on me before I can water it. The only thing negative thing I can say about it is that its a pain to fill. You have to keep a paper clip handy to pull out any debris from the base of the neck or water won't go in. Then to fill it, the best way is to have a low trickle from the faucet. If the stream from the faucet is too fast or too much, the water will back-up and not go down the length of the neck. It requires a bit of patience but its not too bad. It's definitely worth the time if you have problems remebering to water your plants."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for my green thumb!","review":"For me, who never knows when or how much to water, these globes are lifesavers!

They were definitely empty after two weeks however, so multiples would be required for a longer absence. It is important to water the plants first before placing a full aqua globe in the pot, or the water will immediately drain out. It is also important to use a dowel or stick to make a hole in the soil approximating the long stem of the globe- BEFORE trying to insert the globe, otherwise the globe stem will get clogged up as you force it into the soil. These were two tips that I read on internet postings before I purchased them, and they were essential to success."},{"rating":"2","title":"Water anyone?","review":"These things do exactly what they are supposed to do and look great doing it.

If you can't stick it in deep enough it falls over. I had problems with it getting clogged with soil. Even for the one plant, I was able to use it in, I didn't notice that I had to water the plant less then I normally did. I also didn't like how it looked in the potted plant. I felt it detracted from the plant's appearance. My Aqua Globes are all under my bed now. I'll sell them at a yard sale someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mother's Day Gift","review":"My mother was going to be traveling on mother's day so I bought these for her tomato plant.

I have four of them, two for indoor plants and two for outdoor plants that are in an awkward, hard to water spot in my garden. They seem to keep the plants adequately watered, sometimes for up to two weeks depending on weather conditions. My one complaint is that it is really hard for me to trickle water in to fill them up. If the hose is on too heavy water just splashes and doesn't fill the bulb. I've also tried dunking them in a bucket of water to fill, but this is slow to fill also, I think just due to the narrow aperture of the stem. Overall I'm very happy with these and intend to get more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well, and they sent me random colors","review":"The bulb simply emptied out completely after about an hour, overflowing the water on my plants.

I have left these in for as much as a week to see if it unclogs itself when the soil is dry and no, it does not.

I didn't have the problem some people mentioned of the bulb getting plugged, that's fairly easy to take care of with a large unfolded paper clip. My problem is that these don't really do the trick. Unless you pre-water your plant every time, they are useless...so you can't use them to water your plants or trust them when you are gone. 2 weeks? That's a joke. Also one might not be enough for the plant, even a small one. A pot with a drain will lose all the water overnight. Pretty but useless unless the weather is cool enough to prevent evaporation."},{"rating":"1","title":"look nice but not practical","review":"I have a 7' banana tree in a pot and need two aqua globes. With the globes, I replenish the water about every 3 days. The slender tube is too narrow that dirt is lodged in the shaft. To loosen the dirt before I could refill it with water, I cut a section of wire from a metal hanger. This was alot of work so I switched to a watering spike (with clay casing) and use a 25 fl. oz. bottle and that works better. I can go about a week before filling the bottle but the best part is, I don't have to dislodge dirt... the clay casing remains in the soil and I just refill the bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice idea","review":"These bulbs work well to keep house plants perfectly watered and thriving.

All the lies that Sae said about Momo are finally seen by Toji( Momo's ex-boyfriend) and now Toji, realizing his mistake, wants to get back with Momo, but will Momo want to get back together? That's just some of the drama that goes on in this series. If your new to the series, you should get the first volume, otherwise your missing a great story, and secondly, you would be missing quite a bit of dialogue. The artwork is different, but still gorgeous, I would rank it up there with Sailor Moon. This series kind of reminds me of the older 90210 show(but a lot better, and not as mature). So if your kind of tired of all the magical Manga, and just want to read something a little more realistic. THIS IS THE SERIES TO GET!!!

The Publishing company however...","review":"I bought Peach girl 3 after getting completely addicted by the first two books. Boy was I surprised when I opened the box. While the story remains intact, and it is a wonderful story at that (I think I'm rooting for Kiley now.) Mixx (sometimes known as Tokyopop) has apparently become a very stingy publisher. The cover was extremely flimsy and the pages are printed on paper that I would venture to say is barely above newsprint quality. And they are still charging the same price as when they were using the high quality papers. Someone needs to remind Mixx that quality is just as important as quantity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality trance","review":"This single is a truly elegant and harmonic piece of work.

It just doesn't suit my needs well: 1) The belt is difficult to adjust and has no \\"give.\\" It's not stretchy, like the belt on competing devices. This means that if I go out one day with just a T-shirt, but need a sweatshirt the next day because it's cold out, I have to futz with the belt to make it fit. 2) The iPod goes in sideways and is a tight fit, so every time you want to adjust volume, skip to the next track, etc, it's a struggle to remove and replace it. 3) The earphone jack has to thread in through a small opening every time you want to use the belt. I guess if you permanently leave your earphones attached to this belt it would be OK, but if you sometimes use your iPod without this belt, it's a bother.I'm donating the CTA belt to Goodwill.

And the wait wasn't in vain. This is absolute and unpolluted musical bliss. The post electronic sound of Friedman and the mastery of tempo's and timbres by Atom Heart just make this record a complete trip through the paths of jazz, electronica and all the subgenders in between. The rendition of the great Miles Davis \\"So What\\" keeps the original flavour but with a distinct touch of freshness. Every track is flawless, and the only thing to regret, if any, is that the lenght of this record seems cut short.

Robin Tunney's performance is so good, i can't believe it didn't get more attention. While I loved all Robin's previous characters (especially Empire Records and The Craft), this really was a powerful performance that should have been noticed more. At least she won or was nominated for a couple film festival awards. Henry Thomas was good too in what was probably almost as hard a part. The story has obviously been done before, but the acting makes it worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portrayal of a person with TS.","review":"When I first saw this movie it gave me chills because I started having memories of how I was treated in High School by the teachers, not my the other students, when they found out I have Tourette Syndrome. I have even had problems with some of my college teachers due to my TS.Robin Tunney's portrayal of a person with Tourette Syndrome was truly magnificent. The end mad me angry but it was an accurate portrayal of how someone with TS could be misconstrued being violent. This movie really shed some light on the misconceptions people have about Tourette Syndrome. I'm just glad Niagara, Niagara wasn't outrageous like some of the movies made in Hollywood that poke fun at Tourette Syndrome. All in all I thought Niagara, Niagara was an accurate protrayal of the behaviors that a person with severe Tourette Syndrome has. I do have to admit I thought the plot was kind of cheesy. But I still recccommend this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's the way it is.....","review":"Some have said this film is too dark; I say that's the way life is. Way too many movies try to gloss over uncomfortable subject matter and try to leave us with the happy ending. This film richly displays these two disfunctional charactors with depth and unparalled suspension of disbelief. The film does give you a break from the dispair via numberous ironic misadventures which are hillarious and touching. If you really want a film that is dark and relentless try \\"Requiem for a dream\\", then you will really see dispair. This movie is a cheerful misadventure flick compared to that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreaking, beautiful, and timeless","review":"This is one of the very best modern movies.

This movie will help you understand a certain illness better than you ever have (or even possibly ever could), and it will break your heart with its frank portrayal of a doomed and short-lived love affair.

I currently order two cases for the month which is definitely not enough, because my husband drinks them like they are kool-aid, but eventually as I get my grocery bill down to something manageable I will add more to the list. At the middle of the month he begins looking for his order, which means that I am going to have to do a shipment twice a month to keep him happy, but I can't complain as long as he is using it and it healthy for you, no need to complain.

I had to throw the last shipment because the color was sickly dark yellow and the taste was extremely bad. The discount is not worth the subscription."},{"rating":"1","title":"This applies only to my last shipment.","review":"This last shipment did not last good. It had a very old taste.

About 15 years ago, I started visiting Brazil and when I left, this Coconut Water was one of the things I missed the most. Now I can buy it from Vita Coco, who has excellent customer service and their packaging is great! I would recommend this product 100 per cent to everybody. It is nutritious, tastes great and you can make all kind of drinks using this water as a mixer. Thank you Vita Coco"},{"rating":"2","title":"Real close to the original","review":"I haven't tasted other brands, so don't know how this compares with others.

NOT GOOD FOR WEIGHT LOSS","review":"it is coconut water, pretty much what you would expect. barely sweet... which is understandable as its pure. anyway, someone mentioned something about good for weightloss i believe... not true. this thing, although better in that respect than say... soda, is still loaded with carbs. 15g of carbs per serving. this drink isnt sweet enough to justify that many carbs (carbs drive insulin secretion and thus fat storage in our bodies). not to knock the drink so much, but not a good alternative to water, and not good for dieters, if this is your focus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"Every box tastes like I have a big fresh coconut with a bunch of sweet water in it.Except , it fits in my hand , and the refrigerator.I don't have to chop it just right and try to squeeze a straw in it.Everyone is as good as the last.All natural.Great price too with the auto shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vita Coco healthy and refreshing","review":"I originally ordered Vita Coco because I love coconut and need to increase potassium intake. Little did I know it would become such a staple in my diet. It's a delicious chilled beverage, naturally, lightly sweet without added sugar, and it mixes wonderfully with orange, pineapple and other juices.

I ordered this three times because I had surgery and needed something that did not contain preservatives and sugar or artificial sweeteners.The water is not supposed to be BROWN! It should not taste of the box!This is disgusting and I dread drinking it. Some of the boxes were quite good, but some ranged from dark brown to muddy water looking.This company has no idea of quality control.I will never purchase vita coco again! I know about coconut water having had the real thing in Mexico, Caribbean and South America!Forget this product. I think that three shipments make me an expert on the garbage they are passing off as coconut water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality control","review":"I first ordered this in June and was very pleased with the product. Nothing beats fresh coconut juice but this was a good substitute. It tasted good and it did a good job of quenching thirst. I ordered it again and the second time was bad. Liquid was a bit yellowish in color and it tasted a bit rancid. Amazon was nice enough to replace it. BUT ... the 3rd batch was worse. It wasn't yellowish, but it was a bit darker in color. And it did not taste like coconut water at all. I was hoping the 3rd batch would be better - as it had a best before date of April 2010. The second batch was January 2010. But I guess that doesn't really make a difference, as you may get unlucky (twice?!) and get a bad batch. I am not contacting Amazon for another replacement. Dissapointing.

Though you can taste some coconut, it tastes as though it has been thinned with apple juice. I checked the ingredient list and apple juice does not appear (as is so common with many juices), but the flavor is undeniably present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I completely agree with the reviewers that feel this stuff tastes artificial, almost chemical-like. Also agree with those who say it tastes nothing like coconut. I expected something richer with a strong coconut flavor. Instead it's an unidentifiable sweet unpleasant taste with an equally unpleasant after-taste. I have no fresh coconut water to compare this to, so it may or may not taste like fresh coconut water, but whatever the taste, it's completely unappealing. On top of this, the product is not cheap.Edit: When this stuff is ice cold it is much better tasting than it is at room temperature. I would upgrade my rating to two stars but Amazon will not allow that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Taste","review":"I never had actual coconut water before so I'm not sure if this actually tastes like the real thing but if it does then I never want to try the real thing.

I read the reviews and saw that some others have complained about the water being yellow and tasting sour, but I figured I'd give it a shot anyway. My order arrived today and I'm sad to say that the containers are all full of yellow, very sour disgusting water. What a disappointment.

Go with a diffetent brand.","review":"These used to be great but the inconsistent taste and a few rotten ones make this a TERRIBLE buy / risk. Look for coco water that's not heat treated as well, for a much healthier and natural organic product. TERRIBLE customer service from vita water as well, IGNORANT company.For an unbeatable taste in coconut water, but the pre cut baby coconuts in your local market. I understand most people don't want to crack into a coconut all the time, but if you're at home and want to enjoy the best possible tasting coconut water, give this a try. The taste is night and day. :)*Amazon is amazing as always"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes bad..","review":"I have been buying vita coco since few months form walmart and other stores.

It was getting kind of expensive (and annoying) to have to purchase them individually at the grocery store, so I decided to get this bulk option instead.

Vita Coco was on sale at the grocery store, so I picked up a few to try. While I have never had coconut water straight from the coconut, I would be surprised if it tasted like this. This has a rather strong sourish taste and aftertaste. O.N.E. is just refreshing and good, and has a much more natural taste, in my opinion. I doubt I ever would have developed my coconut water habit had Vita Coco been my first experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Flavor","review":"If you are looking for the best smooth tasting coconut water, this is not the brand for you. I have been drinking ZICO coconut water and decided to try this brand. It was a mistake. This VITA COCO brand has an off taste, like you can taste the container (cardboard) flavor in it.

Every time I go to any market I look for it and buy it and have a good idea of what's out there. Occasionally I even buy real coconuts. But on to the review. I bought this pack of 12 for a little less than $1.00 a unit. I've tasted it room temperature, chilled, with ice, and even frozen. It's barely sweet, in fact a sour taste stands out more than anything. If one knows what coconut taste like then one can find the coconut flavor some where in this juice, but it doesn't stand out. The juice is pretty clear with a SLIIIIIIGHT yellow color tint so there was no oddities with the coloration. I really did try to like this product, I've only 3 units left and still I'm just not seeing it. Perhaps a bad batch???... a really bad batch??? If this was someone's first experience with coconut juice, they would probably not be a big fan of it.

You can definitely taste the electrolyte cocktail and it's low in sugar, so only slightly sweet. It's kinda cloudy in appearance, but that's how it's supposed to be.

It is unfortunately so good that you will consume it a faster rate than expected. It is a bit steep on price. We are all spoiled by the availability of sugared, high fructose corn syrup laden soda products and Vita Coco with its higher price is a pricey switch. Like all good for you products though this one's cost is worth it.The emerging country of Brazil has a good product and I can see it increasing in price not going down.

I had high expectations for this product, but did not expect it to be anywhere near as delicious as it was when I sipped it for the very first time. The taste is unlike anything I've ever tried before and it goes well with all types of foods. It hydrates you with 100% natural coconut water, leaving you refreshed and delighted at the same time. The tetra packs are great on the go (perfect for taking to the gym, to work, on a run, on a walk, etc) and contain an adequate amount of coconut water. I'd highly recommend Vita Coco to anyone who is hesitant about trying coconut water for the first time.

I had my old batch from costco, I was able to taste them side by side. What amazon delivered was very bad, I am tasting some kind of chemical trace, not acceptable at all. looking for alternative. I love coconut water :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"GOT HYDRATION?","review":"This Vitacoco is killer rehydration with poquito sugar.

Until recently. Something has changed, which started around the time they began using their new blue-packaging. The coconut water just tastes off. Like sweet soap was added.

The date for a 12-pack expiring in 2/2010.I opened up first packet and it tasted sour, I poured it out and the coconut water was brown.I tried a second packet and it tasted bad, sour and it was also brown. The coconut water I believe it was left too long in the heat. I tried to return the product but Amazon says the \\"grocery\\" item is not returnable.Please beaware to receving a bad batch. In this case, I lost money and isn't any help from Amazon.comI gave Amazon.com is 0........ zero star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good product gone bad","review":"I love a good coconut water and I used to love getting goods deals on it from Amazon. Let me preface by saying I don't know if the problem is caused by the manufacturer or by Amazon's handling of this product. I have been drinking coconut water for years and there is nothing like it for hydration and re-mineralizing in a hurry.Here is the problem, the last (2) cases of VitaCoco that I received from Amazon were VERY off tasting. I don't know how to describe it exactly except to say it was a bit sour and not quite fresh. I could not drink it and I know that it is not supposed to taste like this. If I had to imagine the problem I might guess the product was allowed to experience large scale temperature changes, but who knows? I won't buy this product from Amazon anymore because I don't have time to deal with sending it back and ordering again. I have been Buying Amy&Brians; at the Organic Grocery down the street. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"I've had to throw all of the 12 out. It tasted horrible and I wondered if it was spoiled.

This is one of the replacement products suggested. It is awful! I love the ONE Coconut Water. It tastes just like the water from a fresh coconut, and chilled makes it even better. This product tastes like it has tomato juice added to it. All the product Nutrition Facts are comparable, identical in most cases, but the taste is not. I will be canceling this automatic shipment immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes ruined!","review":"Possibly it's because we've been having record heat here this summer when this was enroute, but I've opened one container, and it tasted sour and rotten.

I am sure there are some health benefits to drinking this stuff, but here are my qualms:Taste is not like it came right out of the shell. It has a boxed like taste.Sugar is too high. I can't have that amount of sugar on a regular basis. For hydrating nothing beats water. I workout every day and run as well as chop wood. My diet is varied and provides more than enough of these nutrients. Blood test was excellent. Nutritional content; I am sure it has some of the qualities that it boasts, but I am not willing to make the sugar compromise for the magnesium/potassium benefit. I will just take a supplement. It is cheaper. Plus I eat way to much cocoa and that has the highest amount of magnesium from a natural product. For potassium; plantains are good. They are just like bananas. A diverse diet is best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I found this to be the most bitter/least naturally sweet coconut water that I've had.

Unfortunately, for me, the taste wasn't. I have only had the pure coconut water version of this product; it was sweet to an extreme. I'm not a lover of sweet tasting things, so I had to practically gag this down.

It was on Amazon's Friday sale and the price was very attractive (compared to normal price) so I went for it. I normally purchase Young Thai Coconuts, but breaking them open can be a hassle sometimes, so I bought a case just for the convenience of it. I've tried Zico (back when it was still in Tetra Pak)before and was a fan so I assumed Vitacoco was similar. Boy was I wrong. Vitacoco taste nothing like fresh coconut water. To me, it just taste like sugar water, or non-fresh coconut water that has been left out too long and thus fermented. It was this tart aftertaste with a faint hint of coconut flavor. Does not warrant the price it cost.Lesson Learned: DO not buy in bulk if you have never tried it before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice and Refreshing","review":"I like this coconut water in the plain flavor and also the tangerine.

Secondly, I don't know what it is about these drinks but sometimes you will just get a bad case where some of them are bitter tasting. As if they have been left out in the sun or close to expiration or maybe left in the hot delivery truck too long? Try refrigerating it before your drink it.

I tried vitacoco in the store. I don't know if they've changed their formula, but what I had in the store tasted pretty good, so I ordered a case from amazon. Maybe amazon is carrying a different version, but what I got doesn't taste the same as what I had in the store. There is a weird grape-like taste, like canned grape juice. I'm pretty sure the version I had from the grocery had Vitamin C listed as an ingredient (which I didn't mind). This package lists no ingredients besides coconut water, which I don't think is true advertising. It's not listed as an ingredient, but the package says it contains 230% of the Daily Value of Vitamin C. Coconuts are not a natural source of vitamin C, so I find it suspicious that it has that much and Vitamin C/Ascorbic Acid is not listed as an ingredient. I would not order this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"If you need extra potassium and cringe at eating bananas - this may be the way to go.

I thought I had gotten a bad batch and literally poured all of them down the drain. Amazon was great and sent a replacement free of charge and I received it the very next day. But no luck, same nasty taste. After a little bit of researching found out that they decided for whatever reason to add new ingredients. Why?. Anyways, The taste with the NEW ingredients is nothing more than a mixture of water/sugar/vinegar, and it leaves a sour taste in your mouth. So dissapointed. I cancelled my subscription since it no longer tastes like coconut water, and threw the second shipment I received away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"coconut water","review":"I grew up drinking coconut water from fresh coconut straight from the trees and I must say i was amazed of the great taste from vita coco.

The taste is no where near coconut water, even though zico isn't perfect, it beats vitacoco's taste by miles. Now, i grew up in coconut country so i do know the true taste of coconut water. Zico feels alot like the real deal, but vitacoco is mostly sugary (how can it be so sweet, that means its artificial. WOW i wonder how people give vitacoco 4 or 5 stars, may be the boxes that i got were the only ones with horrible taste, but i highly doubt that. I haven't tried O.N.E so don't know about that.

I received two shipments and both were great!However the next shipment had a very bad taste! I am not sure how to describe it. I immediately got in touch with Amazon's Customer service and they sent me a replacement. (Amazon is the best!!!). The replacement had the same bad taste.

Slowly I felt like drinking a coconut water later eventhough the real coconut water taste is kind of missing. The taste was just okay. When I was expecting a similar taste on Vita coco, I wasn't disappointed as yesterday. This one certainly had much better taste and felt like drinking coconut water. I don't care about anything else but just the taste!!! Four stars is for not getting the exact fresh 100% coconut water.

I recently put 6 in my home fridge and 6 in my office fridge and they were sickening. I have ordered this product numerous times, but this batch was horrible. It must have been placed in a high temperature or something. It made me sick to my stomach, terrible, terrible taste. I opened all 12 to check the smell and take a small taste and they were all bad. I also ordered a 12 pack of the pineapple flavored at the same time and will test them. If the first taste is bad, don't drink any more. It will make you very sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"100% Pure is no longer","review":"I'm an Amazon Subscribe & Save Vita Coco buyer but will be switching brands. While fortunately for me the last shipment still states 100% pure, the Vita Coco website has changed that designation and now lists fruit sugar as one of the ingredients. Notice too that the picture on Amazon has also changed - it no longer has a container with \\"100% pure\\" listed on it. I was fortunate in that my last shipment was the 100% pure, but it looks like that won't be the case going forward. What a shame. Vita Coco may be slightly less expensive than some of the other brands, but if it's not 100% coconut water then it's a moot point. If I wanted sugar water, I'd buy soda."},{"rating":"1","title":"RANCID","review":"What more can I say? The WHOLE case was RANCID, and my husband and I, are NOT happy.

Sometime it would taste good the other times it would taste sour; like expired milk. I notice the ones from the gas stations / Walgreens would taste different from the ones from Amazon.com & Costco. I would most likely not purchase this brand from Amazon anymore due to a few bad batches, lucky Amazon refunded me the two cases. The coconut water that I am now currently subscribe to is Taste Nirvana Real Coconut Water. Its sweeter than the other three big brands, and I'm fine with that.

It had a not even remotely sweet, sour taste. Maybe that is because of the addition of Vitamin C, which the best brands don't add. Frankly, I would like my water to be as close to drinking it straight out of the coconut as possible. Harmless Harvest has THE BEST, freshest tasting coconut water I have ever had, but I can only find it at FreshDirect.com and Whole Foods, and it is expensive and perishable. Close behind that is Taste Nirvana--my go-to choice for shelf stable water. Since Amazon doesn't sell Harmless Harvest, Taste Nirvana is the brand I buy.

Fresh coconut water has a delicate flavor, but this product ends up tasting flat and old, like something that has been left out in the sun too long (or pasteurized too aggressively). It has a bit of an off and funky flavor, and is notably sour in an unnatural way. It also tastes *really* salty, probably from the 680mg of potassium.Coconut water doesn't have to be this way.

That may be, but come on...not many people have access to fresh coconuts let alone the mess and inconvience factor.The downside is the packaging.

For those who love coconut water this sounds like a fantastic deal. Our family and friends, however, can't down one of these, let alone think about two.

The one I bought from Whole Foods was so delicious - just like the water straight from a fresh coconut. However, when I received my Amazon order of the Vita Coco - it was sour and not very tasty. I won't return it as it will cost too much to ship back, but definitely buy this from a market, not online. The difference is night and day.

In their groundbreaking performance, Serkin, Kavafian, Sherry and Stoltzman mine this work for every ounce of its endless value--- coaxing a phrase to shimmer, dwelling within a movement's infinite sorrow, or opening a vein of evocative spirituality--- and at all times retain a shattering clarity of vision that both penetrates and humbles. As the ensemble known as Tashi, these superb musicians bring an otherworldly ambience to a chamber work aptly named, and with their devotion, exemplary craftsmanship, technique and concentration they persuade most powerfully. The sound given the artists is as truthful, lean, and haunting as their performance.[Running time: 47:25]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Messiaen","review":"This recording has been around for years. For about that length of time I'd wanted a recording of Quartet for the End of Time but didn't have guidance on which to buy. In Fanfare Magazine, a few issues back, I read a review of a new recording of the Quartet, in which the reviewer said that his reference recording remained that by the Tashi Quartet. So, I purchased this recording unheard, and I'm very glad I did. I feel I'm in good hands as I \\"learn\\" this music from the recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"End of Time should've ended Messiaen's career!","review":"I just heard this composition played live yesterday at a concert. HORRIBLE! I don't care who this composer was, where he wrote it, or why. It is garbage. Atonal, discordant, so bad I wanted to plug my ears. It sounded like a bunch of blind monkeys were tossed into a cell with pots, pans, lids, spoons, and maybe a xylophone for good measure. I finally succumbed to a fit of hysterical laughter - the music was simply SO embarrassingly pretentious and worthless, I was convulsed with laughter at my own bad fortune being stuck there at the concert till intermission - when I BOLTED.Intellectuals will rave about this piece, the composer, his sob story, how it premiered on a bitterly cold night in a concentration camp. But let's get real here: this ain't classical, and it ain't music. And folks who claim to love this piece are phonies and fakes. It doesn't even rate ONE star, but I put it there just so folks know I'm not kidding.'nuf said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice for the price","review":"I agree with the other reviewers about string buzz -- there is a lot unless you play very lightly. But the action is nice, the sound both amplified and acoustic is very good for the cost. This is a fun instrument that is surprisingly well made. I did have 2 chips in the finish right out of the box brand new. I contacted Dean to see if they had any \\"touch up\\" finish for it -- Dean did not reply to their email address for support so I called them and they informed me on the phone they suggested I go to Home Depot and purchase some stain/finish there to fix it. The finish had a lot of rough overspray in several spots, but again it was very low cost do I would expect that."},{"rating":"2","title":"The. Best. Candle.

Even when it's not burning I keep it close to my bed so that every time I get a whiff of it, the black currant and Bulgarian rose scent soothes me to sleep.

It's well-produced, and has some catchy hooks. The best CDs grow on you, getting better and better with every listen. This Eliza Carthy disc is not, unfortunately, one of those. By the third time through I was bored. There's nothing new nor original here. While the lyrics are interesting on the first listen, the music is repetative and totally expected. And that's really the problem with this disc. It sounds formulaic and pre-programmed. With so much original music out there, why bother?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This cd is incredible","review":"After reading a review of \\"Angels & Cigarettes\\" in a recent issue of Entertainment Weekly, my curiousity got the best of me since I just started getting into celtic-influenced music like The Corrs. I am just stunned by how gorgeous Eliza's vocals are. She kinda reminds me of my favorite folk artist Dar Williams, except Irish. I can hear elements of folk and trip hop in Eliza's music. Tracks such as \\"Whispers of Summer\\", \\"The Company of Men\\", \\"Perfect\\" and a cover of Paul Weller's \\"Wildwood\\" really stands out with me. I can't put into words why except for the melodies of these songs struck a chord with me and are just superb songs. Eliza has a real knack for melodies as I heard in \\"Angels & Cigarettes\\". Terrific album, terrific woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"I discovered this album without knowing about any of Eliza's previous music, so I don't have any preconceived notions of what this is \\"supposed\\" to be. All I know is this: I own a music store with thousands of CDs, and we play music all day long, 7 days a week, and this is the most beautiful album I've listened to this year, and it ranks up there among the best I've heard in the last five years. Who cares if it's not the same as what she's done in the past?

I only heard about it a couple of weeks ago and I try to keep up on the latest sf. It's astonishing to me that a novel this good took this long to even begin to catch on (because it's still hardly a household name). I hope it doesn't take another 10 years to get a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN ADVENTURE OF THE SPIRIT AS WELL AS A PHYSICAL ADVENTURE!","review":"In my opinion, LEGEND is an extraordinary tale. It's a quest, a test of the protagonists, and an inquisition into their characters all at once. Their perils are spiritual and psychic as well as physical, yet it's the sheer physical adventure that pulls the reader from page to page, at a can't-put-the-book-down pace.The book it most reminds me of is DELIVERANCE, in that it works out its themes in non-stop action. It says what it has to say through that action. But it has a great deal to say. And much of what it has to say you don't realize until you've finished the novel and you find yourself thinking back on it.It's not a book you will quickly forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty darn good book","review":"Not an all time great, but very entertaining and much better on the inside than on the outside, of course with an outside cover like this one anything would be better on the inside."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly presented survival guide","review":"@ The Entry Level: On Survival, Success, & Your Calling As A Young Professional by Michael Ball (Founder and CEO of Career Freshman Company, an organization dedicated to helping young professionals discover success, passion, and fulfillment in their work) is a superbly presented survival guide specifically for business students and recent graduates looking to further their career in the corporate world. Practical advice on everything from changing one's major; to the basics of branding; to surviving office politics; to balancing responsibilities, @ The Entry Level is a strongly recommended supplementary resource, especially for those who are just entering the turbulent hierarchy of business and coming to terms with corporate middle management."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one, finally.","review":"For the record, this is my very first Amazon review because I finally found a book that is worthy of a 5 star review. After reading several post-college graduate books, @ the Entry Level finally stops beating around the bush and tells you how it really is and how to succeed after college in the jungle known as 'the real world.' Anyone in my position (fresh out of college, has a job, has no idea how the real world works) should pick up this book immediately. Michael Ball relates to our position and generation very accurately and convincingly as well. Teaches you the politics of business and how to sell yourself for future promotions and growth. Much more than a post-college book, I recommend it for anyone trying to get a competitive edge and understanding for themselves in the workplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!","review":"This book is so unique in that the author takes a head-on view of the corporate world--he doesn't sugarcoat the reality of being in the trenches day-in and day-out.But time and again, he draws you back to the fact that you have to use your first couple of jobs to find your calling--to discover that work you're passionate about doing. Plus he shows you step-by-step how to go about doing that. So it's not negativity so much as it's reality and common sense. And it's written with such depth and humor...I (and all of my associates) strongly recommend this immensely enjoyable and exceedingly useful book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect fit","review":"These lights fit my 1994 shorelandr snowmobile trailer and the lights must measure exactly to fit and for this price are u kidding, this is half the normal price and the lights work great."},{"rating":"1","title":"would not work after one submersion in salt water","review":"Light bulb holder rusted outand would not work after one submerion in salt water.

A bit spazzy, but still quite tuneful and catchy. The singer does this weird dorky voice, like Professor Frink from The Simpsons or something, all the time, and it's awesome.

If e-mail messages have begun to grate, here is a book that will remind you how sweet letterwriting can be and how wonderful a thing it can accomplish...if one only takes the time. 84, Charing Cross, I've concluded, is also the perfect gift for friends with sensitive souls who already seem to have everything. It is also a fine thing to read before turning off the light next to your bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and charming little book","review":"This book is a charming little story post WWII consisting of letters between an American novelist and a London bookshop employee. Later, other staff members of the bookstore begin writing letters to the novelist as well, revealing little parts of their lives. All letters written wth humor and charm. This book reveals how the written word can serve to forge friendships more lasting than the many casual face-to-face contacts we now routinely substitute for true friendship and create a deeper understanding among people in very different life situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching story about friendship","review":"What I loved most about this story was how diametrically opposite Hanff and Doel are. Hanff is your stereotypical brash New Yorker, while Doel is a staid Englishman straight out of an 1800's novel. Despite this valley of differences, they are able to forge a friendship based on their love of books. The story as one can gather from the other reviews, is told through the letters exchanged between Hanff and Doel.Throughout the story, we also get a picture of postwar Britain and New York. We learn about the struggles and triumphs of Hanff and all the staff at Marks and Co. We see the main characters face the inevitabilities of growing older and taking on more responsibility, whether it be kids or a new home.The fact that Hanff is able to tell such a full and rich story through only correspondence is a feat indeed. I would encourage all to go and read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"84 Charing Cross Road","review":"Definitely a must read book and a must see movie!!!!I recommend first to read then to see.Sabina Horak"},{"rating":"2","title":"84 Charing Cross Road","review":"The book came quickly and in better shape than I thought it would.

One example was Helene Hanff and her marvelous story about her multi-decade correspondence with a bookshop in England, 84 Charing Cross Road (and there is a film version of it too!). Basically, this is a collection of letters that the author wrote to a bookshop in London ... over the course of several decades. The bookshop helped to feed her reading habit, and the unusual correspondence cemented a unique bond between the two parties. The book starts off a bit slow, but very quickly you'll become engrossed in this wonderful postal relationship.

A great read - not so much. The letters are short. Not like the wonderful letters of, say Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf and other authors. They were short \\"send me this book\\" with witty ways of wording thank-yous. I didn't get a feel for either person. Additionally, the blurb on the back states that this book is the collected 20 year correspondence. True, but its like 3 letters a year and most of them - like I stated earlier - orders and thank you responses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck","review":"I understand Mr. Belcher is coming out with a second book soon.

Second, That is actually a good thing because I have never read so much phooey. When it comes to symbolism Freud said, \\"A Cigar is sometimes just a cigar\\". Same with dreams. Sometimes a dream is just a dream. This author puts his own labels and biased opinions onto what he thinks certain dreams mean and he states it as though it's all fact. And he does it in a boring dogmatic fashion. I don't have to always agree with a book as long as the book is somewhat interesting or entertaining. This book is dull and tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"My two year old loves this book, simple concept that is well developed, one of the few books I originally took out from the library and then felt compelled to go on and buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story for a wet day","review":"This book tells the story of a small boy who goes out to play in a puddle on a rainy day. He follows his mother's instructions carefully, about not stepping in the puddle. But the animals who come to visit have no such limitations and their antics are quite entertaining.Although the story is fairly innocuous, small children who become anxious over breaking things may become uncomfortable when reading this story- -an alligator rescues the boy's boat from the puddle, and in the process cracks it with his mouth. In the final scene of the book, the boat is shown in the boy's bathtub, and several small readers lamented that the crack was still there. The book is quite short, with only about 200 words."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific activity and sticker book for preschool age and up","review":"Franklin is a great character for children.

Activities include sorting, a maze, word search, spot the difference, connect the dots, picture search, word scramble, coloring and a secret code. There's even a recipe for juice pops.

Particularly fascinating is his chapter on the Bingham Canyon copper pit mine, tracing its evolution from turn-of-the-century immigrant copper town to its current position as the world's largest man-made hole.Also of note is his exploration of American Flats mine and its present-day existance as a de-facto \\"autonomous zone\\" where all forms of \\"outlaw culture\\" is practiced.This book is a must for all persons interested in urban exploration and industrial processes, as well as those of us who are fascinated by the ways man changes the world around him."},{"rating":"2","title":"A TRUE 80S' FILM....AND CHEESY!","review":"If you like cheesy 80s' films, this is the one to watch! and it's one, if you are like me, that you can watch multiple times. It's the story of Louise Miller, a 15(about to be 16) year old girl who is a witch. She uses her power to become popular, and get the guy she wants, who bares a striking resemblence to Tom Cruise. Louise realizes later that she wants the guy to like her for herself and not the popularity part of the whole thing. IT's a great film for teenagers, kids, anyone! Even 30 year old women(like me) still enjoy it. I saw this movie a year or two after it as released. There is a lot of cheesy music, and a weird girl's gym scene where they dance around to a song called, \\"I LIKE BOYS!\\" it's ultimate cheese.but it's a cute story with a good moral. I also think that Robyn Lively is one of the best young actresses around. Watch this movie if u want to have fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this movie NEEDS to be re-released","review":"I know it is a cheesy 80s flick...but it brings back great memories from when I was growing up!

I was facinated by it the first time I watched it.Now, the acting isn't the best, but the story line is great. It's all about Louise who doesn't realize it but she's a Witch! She comes into her powers on her 16th Birthday! She wasn't really popular in school but when she comes into her powers everything she's wanted falls right into her hands. Unfortunately, she really wanted the guy of her dreams to love her for her. She wanted to be popular for who she is not how she dresses or who she knows. She learns this in the end, and some how ends up with one out of two wishes coming true.I love all the music in this movie. I really wish they'd come out with a soundtrack. I know I'd be the first one in line.When I saw it was on DVD, I rushed to get it. I never get tired of watching it.

But once I got the name of it I was off and racing to buy it. And it was a great watch. Every girls dream to be beautiful and popular and get the great guy. To get back at your annoying brother and those nasty girls at school. Classic story line, and with this movie you've got the added fun of the 'magic' factor. And of course the moral lessons come along for the ride. A great fun movie to watch and be entertained. Takes you back if u grew up with this movie and that's fun too. Very recommended as a classic 80's movie to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"So 80s","review":"Teen Witchis filled with memories of the 80s, from the dorky hairstyles and clothes to the short musical routines. If you didn't grow up in the 80s, this all will probably come as a shock to you. Nonetheless, this is a cute movie, sincere in its attempts to charm. The elderly witch, Serena, is adorably funny. My only problem with the movie is that the ending seemed rushed and anti-climactic. It doesn't even explicitly resolve some of the issues/plot lines in the film. However, I'd much rather my nieces watch this than any of the garbage being peddled for kids today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie Happy to finally own.

I'm so excited that I finally found this movie after all these years of looking. It's not the best in quality or content, however there is something about the movie that you fall in love with.

The first is still holding up well but it has a few bumps and bruises and is missing its rubber foot.It's rugged, it holds up well to the elements and the occasional dropsies and gets the job done. I have owned nothing but SLIK and see no reason to stray. Great value and dependability for the money. Seems like too many other brands have too many add ons and don't come as a unit.

The 4D version is brighter than either the 3 or 2 D in my opinion. The standard mag is dull, yellowish and fades quickly with fresh batteries. The LED upgrade is whiteish/blue in color, MUCH brighter, and lasts much longer than halogen (as expected.) The LED throws light very far, especially when focused- further than the standard mag. also, the color of the light seems to make it brighter overall. I now have replaced all 4 of my maglites with LED's- from my 2d-4d and used the nite-ize on my 2AA with excellent results for a cheap price. compared to other, more expensive LED lights, these are not the brightest or best, but for the price I am satisfied.

You should really check this book out, it will change your mind of the what your impresion is of science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a pity!","review":"I never actually finished this book (about 30 pages left), pure because it got so boring at one point (Chapter 3 onwards) that I couldn't even concentrate on the words anymore. The idea of a futuristic world with a new hallucinogenic drug is quite interesting; it's Noon's writing that spoils the story. Maybe a better writer could've turned the same idea into a page-turner, but Noon's selection of words is beyond boring and that is such a pity. By the way, I'm shocked to find that so many people actually liked this book. I expected the average number of stars to be 1 not 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"vurt..yawn","review":"I would really love to find some cool sci fi....I thought Vert might be that.....Having read half the book I don't get the hype. It seems to me to be a yet another tale of urban dacay set in some miserable city in Britain in the not very far away sometime, staring your regular crusties ,who have fights with bady crusties ,who need their drug fix, and who don't like cops. To make it sci fi, the drug fix of the minute is some alien thing that seems to make you trip(generally a bad trip it seems, which strangely is addictive) but except its more than tripping ,the experience is kind of a blurred virtual reality thing, ...er cause this is a science fiction book so must have the obligatry cyber reference I guess. Gee really original huh .amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure is poor","review":"Noon's debut in the cyberpunk scene is explosive with this surreal adventure into his mind. Noon takes alot of effort togive his characters a soul and then toys with it. This is one of THE BEST books I have ever read and recommend it for any scifi / cyberpunk fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"WARNING. YOU ARE NOW INSIDE A METAVURT.","review":"This is the single most excellent book I have read since the _Hitchhiker's Guide_. The book finds a hole between reality and fantasy and drives a rather large truck through it. Scribble is on an impossible mission to save his sister from Curious Yellow, a deadly Vurt feather. On the way, Noon introduces us to Scribble's friends and allies, along with a wide range of brutal, vicious enemies. Noon's inventiveness and ingenuity amazed me throughout this book, from the entire concept of the Vurt, to the painless end of a Mandel Bullet. If you read one sci-fi/fantasy/cyberpunk book this decade, read this one"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Book!!!!","review":"This book is a must read, for anyone. Albeit it touches on some shady subject matter but if you go in to it with an open mind and just let Noon's writing take you away you will glide right through this book and want to read it again as soon as you finish! I absolutly loved this book. Noon uses words so smoothly it is amazing! He is a great writter. There are two other books that go along with this one, NYMPHOMATION, which is the prequil to this and POLLEN which is the sequil to VURT. Both of them were good as well but VURT stands out and shines. I highly recomend this book and encouage all to read it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is a dazzling journey which plunges you into a psychedelic, grimy near-future ruled by anarchy. Jeff Noon possesses an incredible creativity that at times creeps you out with its perversity but never fails to stagger you with its power. It would be very interesting to get a cup of coffee with this guy and have a conversation with him. In a nutshell the book is about a man who loses his sister in another dimension of sorts (called a vurt) only accessible through use of a rare and highly dangerous feather drug. His quest to find her is an unusual and thoroughly exciting ride even if I'm not quite sure what deeper message it is trying to send. 'Vurt' is well worth reading for its truly unique nature and its ability to draw you in and hold you under its spell. It is that rare novel which cannot be adequately described - it must be experienced."},{"rating":"1","title":"(cyberpunk) + (beat) = conventional poo","review":"This book was recommended to me, heightening my disappointment. Yet further proof why I must trust no one. I guess even cyberpunk has its own set of cliches. Read this book and fly into every one of them. So Noon read Shampoo Planet et al,...Kool-Aid Acid Test, and digs Burroughs, etc. What you get is an unimaginative, recycled verbal montage of quirky characterizations, boring drug experiences, and an ill-conceived plot--all from someone who's never lived the dream. Yawn. For every Samuel Coolridge and William Gibson, there are approx. 3,582 Jeff Noons."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing read","review":"I bought this book on the strength of winning an Arthur C.

'Girl cast a heavy shadow.'). He takes out the articles and gets straight to the meat of the sentence. It's been years since I've read the book, yet Scribble (the main character) stays with me. His odd view on life and the situations he gets into fascinate me. Most interesting is the relationship between Suze and her boyfriend...so...completely inseparable are they that they cannot bear to be physically apart.Noon put much thought into creating this world of Uberdogs and psychedelic feathers and it shows. Curious Yellow eludes me to this day..."},{"rating":"2","title":"a young man puts a feather into his mouth","review":"You know when a book is great because you could be hit with a car five minutes after finishing the book and die without any regrets"},{"rating":"2","title":"No less than Black Voodoo","review":"I've read everything from funky to old fizz. Vurt lives and breathes in pure crystalline. My mind and my thought process was metamorphisized into a complete new twist of existence. If you haven't read Vurt, you haven't been reading. So get yourself a copy, put this life aside, and begin listening to the Gamecat."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the Vurt-U-Want","review":"Vurt is a wild ride across the dreamscape of the mind. Anexcellent first novel, that promises the reader both excitementfor this work and for future works by Mr. Noon.The characters are fairly well developed, and the landscapeboth visual and surreal. The storyline involves a futuristicdrug, a thing from outer space, a \\"gang\\" and a lost love.The drug causes the usual societal problems, crime, sex,violence, and lack of respect for police. But it also leadsthe protaganist on a journey of learning, longing andmetaphysical discovery. Not bad for a brightly coloredfeather and a bunch of Dog People, Robots, humans and variouscombinations of those.While I wouldn't want to call it, like the book jacket does,the \\"Clockwork Orange of the '90's,\\" it is a futuristic,rampaging youth, thriller that performs well.I look forward to reading more from Mr. Noon."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a fun book.","review":"First off, let me say that I love it when a bunch of failed authors write reviews to show how much they know about the writing that they themselves are unalbe to do. Is this Joyce or Dostoevski, No. Is it Dick, a little. Is it a bit rehased, yes. But here's the big point. Who cares. It's a fun book to read. Cool story, cool characters, fun little twists, that's all I really want in a book, especially a SF one. It's not like I'm looking for god in these pages, just a good read, that's all. And this book is a good read. So there."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal Opinion","review":"I am not one to enjoy science future fiction, but seeing that Jeff Noon is a well known British author I thought perhaps I might give it a try. \\"Vurt\\" is wonderfully written with a slow start but a fast pacing climax all the way throughout the book. I was very impressed with Jeff Noon's ability to capture jealousy, anger and fear within the characters. This is partly the reason that I staid with the book until it's end."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice looking but noisy","review":"i bought this item around 3 year ago for a bargain, I like the way it look, but the fan at high speed is pretty loud, it doesn't bother me any way, you won't find something better for that money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I wish I had read the reviews before I purchased.

Not only did she chew a hole in it in the first few minutes, but it thaws out very fast and is just a soggy dog toy. Because it doesn't stay frozen long in 80 degree weather, it is easier to chew and tear holes in. I am just glad I bought it at half price and didn't waste a ton of money on it.If you are looking for something cool for your pup you are better off giving it an Ice Cube"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the heavy chewer","review":"Though I wasn't expecting a lot from a soft toy, I was hoping that this would be able to provide a little more relief for my teething pup. While the bone is easy to use and freeze, the actual 'enjoyment' time is limited and not worth the time it takes to refreeze. After about 5 minutes, the bone was thawed to the point it was dripping and could easily have holes chewed in the fabric. When I went to refreeze it, my poor pup didn't understand why I was taking her toy and ended up becoming disinterested very quickly the next time I brought it out.Another issue I hadn't thought about until after freezing is how hard and heavy the bone becomes. If you have a puppy that likes to 'throw' their toys or pounce on them, this can become a flying projectile.Though it did seem to help with the soreness of teething, and provide a cool treat, the overall experience left a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"My puppy loved this product...for about 3 minutes. Thats how long it lasted before he had chewed a hole in it and pulled out the stuffing, rendering it useless. Way over priced for the quality. I wish I had come here and read reviews first, a $2 walmart towel soaked in water and frozen has been a way more durable option, which my puppy loves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This is a good but unremarkable toy for the very light chewer in your life. It's basically just a fabric bone that you soak in water. The bag you're supposed to store it in broke when we tried to take the bone out after freezing it. It doesn't have any vanilla smell as they claim. And after the first use our moderate, non-teething dog had ripped out most of the stuffing, rendering it useless.The idea of a frozen toy is a good one, but freezing some knotted up towels would be just as effective.

As another reviewer said, it's basically a fabric toy that you soak in water and freeze - but the plastic bag ripped after being frozen, it thawed quickly leaving a wet mess, and most significantly, neither of my dogs were the slightest bit interested in it.

It is just 18.5\\" long (folded) and 2 pounds (including head) and easily fits in my small backpack. The head locks down easily and securely with my Nikon D40 SLR with 18-200 lens. Unlike the Bogen travel tripod, the Slik head is removable if you want to use something else. There is no quick-release plate, allowing you to add any brand of quick-release (if you are using another brand on other tripods). The lowest leg sections are a little wobbly in the wind, so I fold those up in those conditions. I have a 8 pound luggable tripod when rock solid stability is important, but this 2 pound tripod is prefect for hiking or travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slick Little Tripod!","review":"What I like about this tripod is that it's easy to travel with - compact and lightweight yet sturdy and at an affordable price point. It's not as sturdy as a high-end Giottos or Manfrotto, but far better than the cheap lightweight aluminum models out there. The ball head is not large, but sufficient to lock down a DSLR with the kit lens or moderate telephoto. I discovered that it cannot lock down DSLR with a larger, heavier telephoto (such as Nikon 80-200mm f2.8), but with your hands assisting while composing a shot, it definitely helps to steady things. Again, sturdy for the size, nice finish, even allows you to lock the legs out wide for a low shot - overall an excellent price ratio/feature tradeoff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient little tripod","review":"For its size and weight, this is a nice little tripod. Great for backpacking. The included ball head is much easier to set than multi-axis style heads but you have to make sure it is securely tightened before you let go. I've got a bigger Slik tripod that is taller and sturdier for use at home, but this one is great for hikes.Slik (as well as Manfrotto, Bogen and Gitzo) is a true photographer quality tripod. It's in a completely different league than Velbon."},{"rating":"2","title":"A minimalists dream on a budget","review":"The newest addition to my ever growing photo equipment collection. I needed a very compact full featured lightweight tripod that would set up quick, have a 60\\" max height or better, stiff enough ballhead so that it could handle a mid sized DSLR and a decent sized lens without creep, stiff enough legs to hold still in breezes, be able to pan, and to get down low to the ground without a bunch of hassle, for less than 100.00.I thought I was asking way too much, but.. the Slik Sprint delivered all that for me and at less cost! It even comes with hidden spike feet (for snow etc..) that come out when you screw the rubber ones in, now thats handy!

The Keanes and their acquaintenances grope their way through ordinary lives, stumbling and failing more often than not. While you have to admire the honesty and reality of this episodic story of the family, there is little comfort on offer--more a reminder of what life is like for most people at its stripped down best/worst.

The author had enough writing skills to keep me interested in the characters, but they never developed any depth. They had experiences--even some major ones--but didn't really seem to grow from them.I was also disappointed in her oh-so-typical depiction of Catholic life; people who call themselves Catholic while doing everything BUT actually practicing their faith.I wish I could have my ten hours and nine minutes back; I'd surely use them better this time.

But the chapters are too loosely woven together, the events too slow moving and mundane. It reads more like a series of short stories, only afterward spliced together (a trend I am noticing with a lot of contemporary novels). And even so, I kept waiting for something, anything to happen. It's a little too much like real life, the rather dull aspects. Also, too much detail and introspection about everyday commonplace observations.

Not only does he render the challenging, often elliptical, Greek of Evagrius into approachable English, but he prefaces the two works with an invaluable introduction. This century has been one of enormous progress in the study of Evagrius, and any reader of the Chapters on Prayer and the Praktikos will appreciate why such effort has been expended. Evagrius still has much to teach us."},{"rating":"2","title":"A psychologist votes yes","review":"Evagrius Ponticus was among the most insightful observers and commentators on human psychology. As a clinical psychologist and amateur student of patristic literature, I found the Prakticos and the Chapters on Prayer totally on target.

The encores show the public the part of him that spoke of the older, Golden generation. Etincelles, by Moskowski was an encore he stole from Hofmann.

When their voices are blended together, the whole is even greater than the sum of the parts. They complement each other as few other duos in history, and certainly are the ultimate among the many other tenor/baritone albums that are available.The most notable selections, in my opinion, are the Pearlfishers and Don Carlos tracks. The Otello duet is painful to hear when you realize that Bjoerling's tragically early death prevented him from ever performing the role or recording any other extracts (as far as I know).This CD certainly belongs in any operatic collection and on any list of opera essentials."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pearl Fishers, this cd is not","review":"I must have misread the cd description, or maybe it was not stated that this is a 'potpourri of duets' with the Pearl Fishers duet as the lead.

My only complaint is that when you go to wah mode you need to adjust the volume on your amp first.

It should be able to handle just about any abuse thrown at it. The lighted LCD readout is very easy to see on-stage. I use it with an HD100 head and it works great.I have only had one time where the pedal didn't respond to my stepping on it, and even changed channels on it's own.That may have been the head, I'm not sure.

That said, there are probably a good many people who already do, as this has been released before. However, the previous releases for these twelve episodes were three episodes to a DVD for more per DVD than the cost of this set. Not exactly ideal. This set is good for anyone who is just getting into the series and doesn't want to spend very much or for the DVD addict who is running out of room on their shelves. And it's a good way to send a message to the people in charge of such things that customers are still interested in season sets for this cartoon.

I love the story lines and how the stories are created, woven around historical information and ancient beliefs all of which I feel we could use more of today.

A terrible war could destroy all alliances. I couldn't guess who the killer was until the very end, and the motives were so surprising and horrible for me as they were for the characters in the book. The characters Panther, Sun Conch and Nine Killer are too interesting and great to let them be. In my opinion, another book could be write about them alone. I will give anything to know how far will Sun Conch reach in her life. Anyway, the great North American Series go on with big steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"I figured out who the killer was right from the start.","review":"The Gears are among my favorate writers, their books are among the best of pre-historic North American fiction. The poem/vision of \\"Wolf\\" has set the stage for the rest of the books(until this one)and has kept us waiting to see where it will lead.That being said, this book was a wash! It is a complete takeoff from the rest and it is very poorly written. They just about gave away who the killer was while it was being done. I mean really, if you are about to run away with the love of your life to escape from an arranged marriage that your widowed mother has forced you into and you are discovered by the ONE person who could be described as \\"worst of your fears realized\\", WHO could the killer be?Did they use up all of their ideas for a mystery in \\"Silence\\", with it's plot twist that you could never guess, and \\"Earth\\" that kept you guessing till the end?This book is not worth your time to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I am a huge fan of the First North American series.

Kait and Weiss, (neither of which were 'lower level workers' in their respective companies, for what it's worth), have produced a well-written, insightful document of this slice of American business history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"Weiss and Kait have written the greatest book about Silicon Alley tycoons I have recently read. Kait and Weiss are truly the Woodward and Bernstein of the year. The book has many insights. For example, when TheGlobe.com started paying their workers with pizza, you really got the feeling like maybe, even though pizza is good, it isn't as good as actual money. And Josh Harris really went a little overboard with that three-month party. Two months would have been enough! Was that why the Nasdaq crashed on April 17--a day that will live in infamy? Weiss and Kait think it might have been a factor. I recommend this book to anyone who lives in Manhattan and used to work for an Internet company that is now out of business and is under 25 and is unemployed and doesn't think it would be fun to be paid with pizza!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissappointed","review":"It did not work in my machine!

I'd have to say that it is now one of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment -- the books are so fun","review":"Movies are rarely if ever as good as the book, but this movie seemed to take nothing from the book except the names of the characters and a \\"get in and out of trouble\\" theme.

It's cute and heart warming. A good traveling movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Definite favorite for Christmas morning. Promote reading by having children read the actual Beverly Cleary book prior to watching- worked great, my daughter is now reading the 3rd of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't follow the book Selena Gomez outshined by a 9 year old.","review":"I never grew up reading Beverly Clearly's books but I know some who have, but there's a lesson here. Selena Gomez has become such a star at only 19 years old that if you put her name or face on anything it will sell not matter how good or bad it is because she has become a heartthrob in her generation. Bottom line is this movie should not be tied to the books. And I watched parts of it. Couldn't finish it. 9 year old Joey King is the real star of this film as Gomez falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cute movie","review":"My daughter loves this movie.She had seen it in the theater and liked it so much I bought itfor Christmas.I watched it with her and it is a cute movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than Expected!!!","review":"I saw this earlier, and I thought it was decent and fun for the whole family. It has a solid storyline and a good message, along with tender moments. Joey King was cute and adorable as Ramona, but Beezus didn't really do too much. Ramona Quimby is a hyper 3rd grader with an overactive imagination. When her dad is hired, she bonds with him and tries to build up his confidence, while trying to save the house and deal with her aunt falling back in love with an old boyfriend. I would recommend RAMONA AND BEEZUS!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST FAMILY MOVIE IN A LONG TIME!","review":"I have seen tangled, despicable me, and a few others. (have not seen guardians of gga'hoole yet)Ramona and Beezus is the best family movie i have seen in a long time!!! We had from 9 years old to 68 years old watching this with TWO teenagers in between and EVERYONE loved it.It keeps you interested, entertained and is just a good movie. The story moves at a good pace, the laughs are everywhere, and it touches with just enough emotion to make you feel it. It is not overly sappy or \\"kiddified\\". Everyone can enjoy this movie.My only complaint is i think Ginnifer Goodwin was miscast in this movie. She did not fit to me, (she was the only one). Something about her was off. She didnt have \\"something\\" that made her blend with the cast. I LOVE LOVE John Corbett and Bridget Moynahan. Joey King (Ramona) is spot on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute family movie","review":"The little girl that plays Ramona is absolutely adorable.

I rented it with Amazon's Video On Demand. I didn't think to go see it when it was at the theater, because it didn't draw my interest enough. I guess I can say that it was worth watching from home as a rental. The best part in the movie for me was the artwork in the mural and the happy ending for everyone...the one dark moment wasn't my favorite, it could have been left out. I would recommend the film for family viewing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ramona and Beezus Movie","review":"This was a gift for my 3-year old granddaughter.

Very cute."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back childhood memories.","review":"I watched this with my niece and bought it for my daughter. I remember reading the old Henry Huggins books by Beverly Cleary and I remembered Ramona and Beezus too. It's been years since I read those books but this movie brought back all those great memories when kids actually read books instead of playing with their new electronic toys all the time. Made me want to make a trip to the library and check out some of those old books and read them to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great family flic!","review":"While I wouldn't put this on the same 4-star level as an adult film, this is a very watchable flic for the whole family. Kids are entertaining and situations are more or less realistic. Our two girls both related well to it. And for those of us with a Portland connection, it's always fun to see the familiar.

This approach brought the streets of Seattle, the level at which most Runners make their livelyhood, to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great book.","review":"The Lucifer Deck is a very good book!

The author should have used a different plot to highlight the racial undertones of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they call this Shadowrun?","review":"How FASA ever let Smedman write for Shadowrun is beyond my comprehension! This book was awful. Shadowrun is supposed to be about Shadowrunners not orc runaways who whine and cry and pretend to run the shadows. And what is this reporter stuff?

It seems that the author would have been better served to take some time out to go over the book again prior to releasing it. It reads like a disorganized combination of miscellaenous ideas. The result is a confused presentation that neither serves the practitioner nor the academic MBA student. The book also seem to rehash parts of a treatment of M&A that has been out for many years in other books such as Gaughan's Mergers Acquisitions and Corporate Restructurings. This book does not add to the field but merely repeats what is already out there in other books and does so in a poorly organized way."},{"rating":"2","title":"very thick potion","review":"highly concentrated.

As the previous reviewer noted, this is a fascinating one -- but more so for how absolutely wrong-headed it is. This is not the ideal repertory for a singer with as light (and that's a compliment), romantic and expressive a voice as Alagna. Or perhaps he just doesn't know what to do with it. He pretty much bellows each number, throwing the notes out to the 5th balcony -- unfortunately, not always hitting them correctly. In fact, Alagna is so often singing below the pitch here that when he actually nails a note dead-on it's a bit startling. If you don't know this singer's work, by all means start with his debut CD, his French arias CD, or perhaps the first CD he recorded with his wife Angela Gheorgieu. If you are a fan and must have this CD, don't say you weren't warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clue for Drama majors","review":"I always wanted to attend one of those murder mystery dinners like on the shows Just Shoot Me and 3rd Rock From the Sun.I got this a couple years ago for christmas and FINALLY got around to playing it. The thing was finding 8 people total to play it. My friends arent exactly the big game type, but I got everyone together and once we got the hang of it, the game was pretty cool. You're each a different character and know things, and must reveal facts. It's a longer game-not Monopoly long, but have some time to kill.

The photography is certainly the best thing about this disc.Way back then one hour shows were actually 50 minutes long, not the 45 or less minutes now days, so for one disc and two episodes it's akin to a full lenth movie. For a kids' show, the sets are cheap, but that's part of its charm.The Oz episode is the best of the two, for the obvious reason that Temple lost out to Garland in the movie version, though here she's playing a different role. And Arthur Treacher is in this episode too, after he and Temple were in a John Ford (!) movie together. Arthur Treacher, of his fish and chips fast food chain, and Merv Griffin's talk show sidekick.It's probably only worthwhile for a curio, Shirley Temple as an adult with some cleavage, and an nbc 1960 (?) show in peacock color, but I paid less than 25 cents for my copy, so, for that price you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the manual instead","review":"Frankly, this book isn't worth the paper it's printed on.

Also they cover some of the technical aspects like what cameras were used.Cool of the filmmaker to included both films on one DVD; the DVD is dual-layer, so they don't skimp on image quality (although the films were shot on video).Some reviews have called this a real-life \\"Spinal Tap\\" but that is really not accurate.

Anyone who appreciates solo piano works will enjoy this disc. Clementi was a contemporary of Beethoven (eighteen years his senior, actually), and while I wouldn't attempt a direct comparison between the two, his piano music is consistently excellent and very rewarding indeed. The playing time on this CD is a generous 72 minutes. Those looking for more piano music by Clementi would do well to explore Pietro Spada's complete set of Clementi piano works, an 18-disc set available either individually or as two 9-disc sets, on the Arts Music label.

He sees the effort to \\"recoup\\" these losses by emphasizing traditional and distinctive Catholic practices as \\"eminent good sense\\" (pp. 117-18).

SIx weeks later (when I can no longer return it) my son comes down with a fever so I get one out to use it but half of the dots have already changed color. This means that at some point the product was exposed to heat above body temperature. I look at the other 99 in the box and most of them are in the same condition. This is a single use product and essentially it has been \\"used\\" before it arrived so they had to be tossed."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOA","review":"First of all, they were ruined in shipping - the max storage temperature is 86 degrees F and it was a sunny day. All of the little dots were blue. Even if they had worked properly, they wouldn't have worked for us. An underarm temperature takes 3 minutes and an oral temperature takes 1 minute.

The individual pieces slide on fine, but when you try to snap them closed, it is too tight and does not snap, thus does not work. Also it should be note, the plastic is very cheap, while it is thick... it is also not very durable and can easily crack. TOTALLY NOT WORTH $30. Look for a different brand in ipod cases, there are others out there that I have had much success with in the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Close","review":"I have the same problem as the first reviewer. The 60 GB version will not latch shut with a 60 GB iPod in it. It seems closed, but the tabs do not engage to keep it secure. If you carry it on your belt, it may suddenly pop open and drop you iPod to the gound. The only positive is that you can see the iPod screen perfectly through the case. My advice is to avoid this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt clip causes the case to release!","review":"This would be a really great case--it fits snugly around your iPod and looks great. If you're looking for something to just slip in your pocket, and that lets you see your iPod through, it probably won't even be an issue. Attaching the belt clip to the case will actually cause it to pop open, and if you're not careful your iPod falling to the ground. The belt clip is in no way useful--it actually causes more problems than anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I almost lost my 60GB iPod using this case. As other reviewers have noted, the case does not close securely over the product it is advertised to fit! I had it on my belt while mowing. The iPod fell out onto the ground. If I had not slammed on the tractor brakes, I would have run over an iPod that cost me $399. In my opinion, the case is poorly designed and the hard plastic cannot stretch the way leather can. I'm going back to a leather case. BTW, I did run over half of the plastic case so the rest went into the trash can - $20 wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This was not at all what I expected.

Looking for something more masculine but not overpowering I took a chance on this, going by the description and the reviews, because I couldn't find it locally. Unfortunately I don't care for this cologne. To me it is a sweet, thick, syrupy smell and it doesn't last long (thank goodness). I tried it a few days hoping I'd change my mind but it always reminds me of an old ladies perfume. I have enjoyed Kenneth Cole's Black and will stick with it until I find something better. Let me interject one possible disclaimer: The bottle was warm when it arrived. It had been riding in a UPS truck all day and it was another 100 degree day. So maybe the heat ruined it and I should never order cologne in the summer! But a lot of products must experience this, whether delivered to the home or a merchant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"This instructional video actually has very little instruction. There's a lot of dead-time involving footage of riders just riding, without explanation of what they are doing and why they are doing it.

My biggest beef is a poor table of contents. It is not organized in any sort of way to quickly reference the hikes. It would nice to have a mention in the table of contents as to how many miles away, how long is the hike, and difficulty level. Otherwise you need to really flip through to find that info and mark it yourself. Also, a handful of hikes are well over 60 miles and pushing 2 hours of drive time each way like land between the lakes and nathan bedford forest park.

Sounds trite, I know, but I think that's the most accurate description.Despite the premise, I really didn't think it was a sad movie, and the scenery was simply gorgeous. Makes me want to visit Canada. It was really quite funny in spots. Maybe a little like The Graduate, it's about looking for the meaning of one's life, but despite that, the movie still doesn't take itself too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Week","review":"I and everyone that has seen this movie have enjoyed both the scenery, acting and the philosophy.

We should never let anything wait until it gets to that \\"what if...\\" stage. Do it now. Say it now. Well acted. Beautiful. Definitely makes you think without being dramatic or morbid."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Week","review":"I really enjoyed this movie. I am a senior, so perhaps the kinds of movies that I enjoy are not popular with young people. I relate to this movie because I have poor health and a couple of life thretening conditions. The motorcycle is something too that I really relate to because I had a similar motorcycle in the early to mid 1960's. If I weren't paraplegic, I would buy another motorcycle like the one featured in the movie. Anyway,the movie did make a big impression on me. Oh, and by the way, it was very well done; great scenery,cinamotography, and acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Story meets Motorcycle Diaries","review":"This movie right from the get-go is extremely hard to take seriously for the simple reason that nobody in the history of the human race acts like these people do. I would've liked a real discussion about alternative cancer therapies, many which seem to work. But instead the main character travels the length of Canada with apparently no monetary considerations at all, one time staying at a $300 a night hotel. Also on his travels he encounters the Stanley Cup, in which he kisses and a NHL player. Also he gets into a motorcycle accident and like the old T.V. Show \\"Miami Vice,\\" there wasn't even a scratch on him. That was kind of funny. In fact the movie is so bad that's its good in a certain way. Certainly the picture postcard view of Canada is a delight, although one tends to remember that not all of Canada is picturesque. I would rate this movie a 1 1/2 because I didn't walk out on it, but I thought about it many times."},{"rating":"1","title":"m-town","review":"I was really expecting to love this movie, but as hard as I tried to enjoy it, I simply couldn't. The main character is incredibly narcissistic and treats people (especially his girlfriend) so badly, it's hard to stomach as a viewer.

The reason I can't say better is because I was very specifically looking for Fermented CLO and this appears in the search results.

In the \\"Olde World\\" CLO was always fermented, so I assumed wrongly that was what they meant.I took the entire bottle as directed without noticing any positive results.

The silverwork and the garnet were both really nice. It was the Cinnabar Heart that ruined the piece for me. I was picturing a carved stone with at least a slight bit of visual texture. Cinnabar (the mineral) should be very refractive unless it is purposely dulled. This is very, very dull cinnabar. This looked like a very matte wax, something that would be decorative on a candle. It will be pretty enough as long as no one looks too closely at it, but overall, I'm far from thrilled with this piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!","review":"I read this book when I was 13 and the ending made me cry, I could really relate to willa, great characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"uggg!!","review":"THis book was not that interesting.

Having all of the animals discussed in one book is a great saver on money and shelf space, as I don't have to buy 7 books on animals we will probably never own, but my kids can dream of owning. I also greatly appreciate the breakdown of information as to the reason for keeping the animal, whether as a pet, or other purpose. For my children, all animals are pets, even cows and chickens. So having information for \\"pet\\" purposes, not just eggs/meat/fur/wool/milk production was great to see.

Plus it is only 70 issues but for 9 bucks thats awesome. I think they could have put another series on the disc like the complete X force or Exiles or something just to fill it out more.Oh and one more thing you can save the disc to your hard drive so you can save it at work and read at lunch without having to bring the disc with you. Highly recomended if you love comics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Uncanny","review":"I think I get it. I was surprised to find only 70+ comics on this disc (although still a great deal and with terrific artwork and story line). Then, I realized, this series is \\"Ultimate X-men\\" ... NOT a complete collection of (Uncanny) X-men comics from day one.Have to say ... STILL VERY HAPPY with the purchase. Just be aware, it isn't a disc with 600 comics like some other collections. Hope you enjoy as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good read","review":"I never really had these comics to read myself. I had a roommate who subscribed in college and I would occasionally read one here or there. So I decided to get this and get caught up. Enjoyed the stories and the resolution was fine. Navigation was adequate, could have been a little better.Biggest plus is that it's not Windows Only! I was able to easily use it on my Linux Desktop and my MacBook Pro. Not problems with either.My only recommendation is to read it on the biggest sharpest screen you have (20\\" LCD worked well, the 15.4\\" Laptop display was pushing it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Original Covers on early issues","review":"This is a great set of cool old Marvel Comics, which, I think, is somewhat associated with Marvel editor Ralph Machio.The problem I have is that, some of the covers are not from the original comics. They're from the Marvel Masterworks Reprints editions.Spider-Man and The Avengers seem to include all of the original covers... but... The X-Men #s 1 though 7 look like heck (Not Don). They are missing all the very nice half-tone blends and toned grays that were apparent on all the early Marvel comics.The insides look pretty good. They've been photoshopped to make the borders and gutters white - which is fine, I guess. But I like the look of the yellowed cheap newsprint (inside the panels), because that's what old comics were made from... If you spend a lot of time perusing these gems... I'll bet you can almost smell the old paper and mildew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I wanted","review":"It's exactly what I wanted to buy: Complete collection of Ultimate X-Men. I don't mind scrolling up and down on my laptop in order to see the whole picture. The ads were kind of annoying though. I just hope Marvel puts all the other X-Men series on cds like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, cheap product with some flaws","review":"The first 69 Ultimate X-men comics are here with the Annual for a very affordable price. Unfortunately it is on your computer, so it doesn't have the same feel as comic book. The program runs on Adobe Reader and you can view the picture, zoom, rotate, etc. There's no installation all you need is a CD-rom drive on your computer. The scans are crisp and clear. My biggest complaint is that the CD does not include Ultimate War, a cross-over between The Ultimates and the X-men. There are major plot gaps without these comics, and I am not getting the entire Ultimate X-men story."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can't beat a paper comic book in your hands","review":"I love X-men, but it's a bit of a struggle trying to read it on my computer or laptop.

Galway is a wonderful flautist, but, as with some orchestra conductors, some genres are fit into better than others. When Galway plays Irish music, he's unexcelled. If he plays European classical, he's among the top performers. Here, in a Japanese environment, he seems a bit lost. Perhaps the mists slipping through the forested mountains of Japan have a quality unmatched by the oceanic fogs of Galway or Normandy. Something is lacking in these performances, a quality that Galway seems to be seeking without quite achieving it. Perhaps those who've never heard the Rampal Sakura are justified in their praise of this CD, but my ears can't grant the full five stars for this. If you have the opportunity to make the comparison, do so, and judge for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely All-Occasion Music","review":"I discovered this at the library and, after about a dozen or so check-outs and renewals, finally bought my own copy.

Unfortunately, all but one of these didn't last the year. Long cracks appeared in each glass, usually beginning at the bottom. I don't have a dishwasher so all cleaning was done by hand with sponges and cloth. At the same time I purchased these, I picked up some similar size and shape glasses from a value big-box store. They were $1.00 each and I still have all of them. Save your money and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Van, thy name is Virtuoso","review":"This is one of my favorite CD's. I once had this in LP format (does that disclose my age)? The Preludes are correct and all that but the real focus is on the Sonatas and the REAL focus between those two is on the ferociously fiendish Rachmoninoff II.I have other recordings of this sonata but none come close to communicating the depth, the passion, the exultant pianism of this piece. Nobody - and I repeat - Nobody plays Rachmaninoff like van Cliburn and nobody has such a way with this sonata. He perfectly captures all the internal rhythms, the chugging drive and finally the lush release of pure Romanticism. This is a recording for the ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction to AJAY's review","review":"I haven't heard this (and am therefore echoing AJAY's 2 star review), but want to correct some misinformation.

Curtis Knight made his name in the 1960's and featured a guitarist by the name of Jimi Hendrix in his band. This album features a number of Jimi's songs and covers (including Little wing and All along the watchtower) and in keeping with the tradition of the blues this record is raw with some fierce blues playing from Akkerman and soulful vocals from Knight.As for previous comments about Jan Akkerman never being in a vocal band check out his early work with The Hunters and his pre-Focus hard rock band Brainbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Akkerman's guitar, but King's vocals are a bust.","review":"Jan Akkerman is an awesome guitarist, but the combination of he and King Curtis doesn't work (Just as his earlier attempt to include vocals on the, \\"FOCUS CON PROBY\\" album was also a disaster).

But your ear will adjust. Just listen to the pianism in the Tchaikovsky! Some of the tempi are on the fast side as was customary for Toscanini, but Horowitz is completely dazzling here. The Beethoven is also very good, with better sound(it was recorded much later) and with an alert and sympathetic Fritz Reiner conducting.

I ordered this album even though many music snobs stated that doing so is selling out to the punk roots of the Pretenders; I respectfully disagree. What this album does is serve as an exemplar of the many stages that this great band has gone through during their long and fruitful career. It creates a complete picture better than most one album sets and is cheaper than buying six different albums.

This is one of the most probing, mature renditions of this work ever recorded, and the competition is fierce. Only Pollini comes close and I have heard most of the great ones- Gilels and Richter come to mind in recordings from this period. The Brahms 2nd calls for more depth than almost any other concerto, and Van Cliburn delivered. There is poetry and elegance required in a performance of this work that only these artists gave in full measure. This is a glowing celebration of Brahms in a timeless artistic collaboration. Hear this one before you decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Tenor Collection","review":"If you're new to opera, and just want to dip your feet in the water, you're probably better off buying a cheaper collection.

However the new release without the famous disco scene danced to \\"I Love The Night Life\\" ruins the whole movie. In the original they danced to the music and it set a fast, exciting pace for the romance. The new unknown song has no zip,no excitement,does not sound or feel like an 80's disco tune, and I remember what it was like to dance to those in the discos, and worst of all the dance scene dancing does not match its beat!! Why did they not pop for the rights to the song?? Sorry to George Hamilton who really shines in it, for his sake I gave it 2 stars. I gave this to my trash can so no one else would get stuck with it and I will stick to my old VHS copy of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put it on DVD!","review":"What are you waitting for?

If I buy a dvd and the contents are SIGNIFICANTLY different than the version I saw in the theater, that information should be available on the package prior to purchase. I'm VERY thankful I got this from Netflix prior to buying it. Ain't gonna happen...unless they re-issue it with \\"I Love the Night Life\\" restored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the movie, but this edition BITES","review":"I was thrilled to see one of my favorite comedies released on DVD. I agree with the review by bobtec. The dance sequence number \\"I Love the Nightlife\\" is still missing in this home video version. To me, it was one of the best moments in the film. To see it replaced with another song just ruined it for me. VHS had the same problem. I ended up selling my DVD after one viewing. However, if the song means nothing to you it is a nice digital transfer. Funny, the trailer has the song in it. Bobtec got it right. Wait for a TV broadcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Don't Love the Night Life Anymore","review":"Ask anyone what scene they recall from this movie, and they will tell you the disco scene between Dracula and Cindy Suntime when they dance to \\"I Love the Nightlife\\". As far as this DVD release is concerned, it's just a memory- as they didn't even bother to secure the rights to this song. Although it is still mentioned in the credits, it has been replaced with a cheesy disco song no one ever heard of. This was a fan-favorite scene and this change personally ruined the movie for me. I now regret buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coming from UK","review":"This DVD took forever to get but I didn't know it was coming from the UK. The music isn't the same as the original.

Alas, I should have known better, and have only myself to blame. It's still a terrific movie, a real hoot, and the only thing that dampens enjoyment is that one horrible infraction, which evidently, can't be remedied.

If anything's getting burned by this inferior version, it's the consumer! Vote with your wallet. Tell MGM to spend the few extra bucks that it would have taken to include the original disco song by Alicia Bridges by NOT PURCHASING this DVD! If enough people feel this way, it will hopefully get back to MGM and then you'll see... eventually they will release another version with digitally enhanced video and audio, maybe on Blu-ray, but most importantly, hopefully WITH the ORIGINAL authentic soundtrack intact!

I wasn't thrilled aboutthe copyright protection issues or the extremely slow time to load, but I decided to try to work with it. In six months, this player often arbitrarily decides not to record sometimes, and it often stops recording regular TV programming (my wife's favorite soap) due to \\"copyright issues\\" - completely ridiculous!Now this unit will not output any audio signals at all.

I used to respect Sony quality - I will never buy from them again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Expect more from Sony","review":"When you buy a name like Sony, you expect to get decent stuff.

Unit malfunctioned within a year and is currently in getting warranty work done (who knows if I will get it back). I replaced it with a Lite-On DVD recorder (at less than half the price) and am very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only A Simpleton Would Spend the Extra Hundred","review":"I bought this player and had it for the afternoon before returning it. I got a great deal on a player missing only the remote thinking I would just order a new one from Sony. Well, it turned out that the remote is almost $60-which seems a little crazy. Then various online reviews were mostly terrible and I figured I better try something else. I usually do a little research but it was a great deal and I never thought Sony would put out something this bad.As for Eduardo from Houston-who is reviewing things he hasn't even bought-don't call someone a simpleton for not wanting to spend $100 to be able to record HBO when they can just buy a different DVD recorder for a similar price that can record HBO. In my opinion the guy that goes out and spends that extra hundred on his $200 DVD recorder is truly the simpleton."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is so easy","review":"After years of experience with vcr's, I am very well pleased and surprized with my new sony dvd recorder. It doe's everything very well and with ease of operation. The picture quality is excellent and the owner's manual is easy to understand.

Very happy after owning three sony products I am sold on this brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy Protection is a deal breaker","review":"The deal breaker for me was that this machine will not record copy protected programs. I have a satellite dish with HBO and the GX 315 will not record any HBO programing. HBO allows \\"one copy\\" to be made. This machine (and I understand ALL SONY DVD recorders) did not allow the recording. I called SONY and they offered a soulution that did not work. Beware of manufacturers that provide hardware AND content as SONY does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not record DVD-R and DVR+R","review":"I have always had good luck with Sony products in the past including my last DVD player, so I waited for the GX315 to come out instead of buying the GX300. Unfortunately despite using many DVD's, from different brands including Sony's own, I could never get the recorder to record on DVD-R or DVD+R, only DVD-RW. This little problem coupled with the 30+ second start up time while the disk \\"loads\\" and the slow response of the on-screen menu, I decided to return it. The return process at Amazon was remarkably easy and the support staff at Amazon was great. I only wish I could say as much for the DVD recorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems copying VHS tapes to DVD","review":"I'm not crazy about this unit. I bought it to replace a Philips player, which I loved until it died at the age of 5 months. As others have mentioned, the Sony feels sluggish when loading discs and responding to the remote. It also makes a lot more noise than the Philips player. Connecting a VCR to the composite video inputs on the DVD recorder for copying VHS tapes to DVD is unreliable. For some tapes it works fine. For others the resulting picture on the DVD jumps 1 to 2 times per second. Totally useless. This is not a copy-protect problem - these are homemade tapes. The problem does not occur if the VCR is connected to the DVD recorder with an RF connection instead of the composite video connection. I spent about 45 minutes on the phone with a Sony tech support person who was basically clueless and who provided no help at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not pleased at all","review":"I had a problem when I first used it. Sony support suggested buying different DVD's, but still no luck recording more than 20 seconds, finally got a Sony tech who knew it needed repairing or replacing. After much time and expense shipping and more phone calls, it was replaced. Worked okay for about a year One year later, after warranty is up, it doesn't work again. I would not recommend this unit. Software is slow and remote is lousy too. Only can do one hour of high quality at this point in technology.I would wait another year before investing in a DVD recorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will not buy again","review":"I have had nothing but trouble with this unit and I just bought it last year. We purchased a sony b/c it was compatible with our sony camcorder and now we cannot even burn our information on to a CD.I will preset the recorder for programs and it will not even record at all. It will only record when you press the record button for immediate recording. Even then it will sometimes only record a portion of the program.

I will not buy this Sony product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"I bought 2 bargain recorders that had to be returned for repairs within weeks. Both had frequent burn errors and were real particular about the brand of disk I used. Some disks were unviewable after finalizing. One recorder broke again right after the warranty expired (90 days) and the other had to be sent back again just before the warranty expired. While it was in transit I bought the Sony and put the \\"bargain\\" recorder in a closet when it came back. After 100's of recordings and nearly a year of constant use I have had 2 bargain off-brand disks that would not finalize properly . I have tried -R, +R, -RW and +RW of various brands with no problems. I only wish there was an easier way to name the titles. When it wears out I will get another just like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about recording to dual-layer discs . . .","review":"I bought this standalone DVD recorder for one reason--to transfer my old (yet to be released on DVD) VHS tapes and Laserdiscs to DVD. It had to be a recorder that would record to dual-layer discs, so I could get the highest possible quality for 2 (+ or -) hour movies (especially when copying from Laserdiscs). Looks like I chose the wrong one.I've made 9 attempts to produce a dual-layer disc copy that will play in other players. I've used 4 different brands of blank +DL discs, and tried all of them on 3 different players (besides this one), one of which is also a Sony. All 3 of these players play DL discs created by my computer with no problem, ever. But not one of them would play a single disc made with this Sony recorder. If you want to make high quality recordings which exceed one hour in length, forget this player. It's utterly useless. I'm sending it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coasters and more coasters","review":"In all the years I've been recording on DVD, I never had any coasters but upon getting my long awaited GX-315 I got 4 coasters out of 4 trials using only the best blank DVDs which work fine elsewhere.

It recorded a few hours worth of shows, then it would corrupt the disk, rendering it useles (abaout 2/3 of the time). I thought maybe it was the media, so I bought Sony media (this time it only corrupted the disk 1/3 of the time). I sent the product to Sony for repair and \\"they could not duplicate the issue\\" so they sent it back. The Sony repair service center is located in South Texas, where the labor is cheap and it shows. I got my unit back, and on the 2nd disk, it failed!!

Our kids (7 and 11) had fun mixing the baking powder and vinegar, and watching the car take off. On the other hand, it required lengthy assembly. In our opinion, it could use some re-designing. It is held together by tape, which eventually breaks loose after a few launches. Also, it could use higher quality rubber wheels, as opposed to the supplied plastic, non-gripping wheels. I think we'll try to beef up the Rocket Car eventually, using hot glue or rubber cememt. Also, shortening the entire car would allow a straighter launch, by limiting the length of the very bendy rear wheel axel.

Why is it not possible, in the interests of Diana's sons as much of anything, to accept, sad as it is, that this was a tragedy? It was.

While it's authors \\"grab\\" your attention in the beginning by alluding that there was an actual conspiracy theory, in the end, they conclude it was nothing more than an accident. Why did they continually present \\"compelling\\" evidence that her death was an actual conspiracy/cover up all through out this long drawn out book only to conclude in the end that it actually wasn't? Well, I suspect it's because they wanted us to finish reading it. In my opinion, they state MANY good reasons why it most probably WAS a conspiracy, but, again, in the end, they conclude it wasn't. I felt cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated look at Princess Diana's death","review":"This book contains many factual mistakes, but since it was written over 2 years ago, before many facts were uncovered by the French investigation, I am not really penalizing it much for that.About half of the book consists of background information on Dodi and Diana. This part could have been much shorter. I don't need to know, nor do I care about, Dodi's favorite pets as a child.The actual part related to the investigation was an evenhanded treatment of the facts as they were known in 1998. To the authors' credit, they investigate the most wild theories in a fair manner. When information was not known or available, they plainly state so. Unfortunately, they hint darkly a few times in the book that a source (which they can't name) tells them there is 'something big' not known about the case.

I highly recommend this tuning for best performance.When you get home the antenna knocks down to a convenient size for easy storage. It even comes with it's own vinyl storage pouch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seems to work","review":"This is the only antenna I've tried so I don't have much reference but it seems to work. I also don't have a meter so I can't calibrate it. I can say that it receives as well as expected and can be heard a short distance.I gave an extra star for construction quality because it hits the overhead beam on the parking garage every time I park and it hasn't broken, yet. Pretty impressive for it's price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked fine for 6 months then stopped.","review":"I used this antenna on a bi-weekly basis for about 6 months until it stopped working.Pros:-Cheap!

This story is very slow going for 4 year olds, and younger. They'll grow quickly bored, even though the illustrations are very good.The story centers around two young girls, Sarah and Susan who go to visit their Great-great-aunt Flossie. Aunt Flossie has a large collection of hats and has a mildly amusing, but forgetable story that goes with each hat. She retells a couple of stories to the girls, and they all go out for crab cakes.There are so many other childrens books that your children will enjoy more, that make this one worth skipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful door for children to enter the idea of the past.","review":"I read this book to my fourth grade class as an introduction to our study of history. It began a great discussion about the past, what people remember, and why. We also talked about families and how we are connected to each other. The book beautifully illustrates how a family history develops from the stories we tell each other. It's a book to be shared with the children you care about."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for serious U2 fans","review":"\\"Beautiful Day\\" is a good song, certainly destined to be a classic. This time, it appears that they have not taken a misstep with regard to choosing the first single (as they did with \\"Numb\\" and \\"Discotheque\\"). The b-sides are worth the buy for the serious U2 fans or those who end up really liking 'All That You Can't Leave Behind.'\\"Summer Rain\\" is an infectious tune that, with a tad bit more work on the lyrics, could have been more than a b-side.\\"Always\\" is an interesting b-side for the same reason that \\"Lady with a Spinning Head\\" (from the 'Achtung Baby' sessions) was. That is, as others have pointed out, this song sounds like an early (or later) manifestation of \\"Beautiful Day\\" with the similarities in the music. The chorus a la Mr. Roboto is kinda fun as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A happy arousing.....","review":"This song is indeed catchy, it has it's political views if you want it to, about losing it all and never feeling more happy. It of course, pertains to life and makes you feel like it actually is a beautiful day. It's not 100% POP and it's not 100% Joshua Tree, it's a blend along with a twist of something new they have to offer. Anticipate the best, U2 will never fail!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So much for progress...","review":"The world's premier rock band has unfortunately resorted to re-treading badly dated European pop songs from the mid-80's. Or I guess it could be just a coincidence that the chorus from Beautiful Day sounds remarkably similar to A-Ha's The Sun Always Shines On TV. I'm surprised there aren't any Duran Duran samples, or better yet, how about a Flock of Seagulls cover! Personally, I was hoping for something fresh, modern, and really hard-hitting. Instead I get Bono lost in some melodramatic fog of new wave nostalgia. It's essentially The Sweetest Thing with a heavier arrangement. U2 have always had major potential, but at this point in their career it seems unlikely that they will ever really break free from their depressing post-punk roots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every page worth reading!","review":"Dr. Holman was a much loved doctor in elloree. His memeory and good work is still kept alive by another really nice doctor, Dr. Richard Carpenter, who has continued his practice in the same location.

This is just a very old movie that is poorly photographed, poorly directed, poorly acted. Marlene just looks fat in it.

You learn about Jessica's accomplishments, weaknesses and challenges in the TV news reporting industry. If you're looking for the complete book on Jessica's life, this is it. The way Alanna Nash writes makes each page flow on to the next. This is easy reading.

LOLMY REVIEW: I've owned my SLIK for 2 years and it has been used for thousands of pictures. It's extremely sturdy and the locks and controls work perfectly still. I use the original head, a manfrotto head, and a custom head (very heavy) for 360 degree panoramic shots - and the tripod is still in perfect shape.Does everyone need a tripod of this quality?

Marginally better than the full length debut, the expedited, punkish instrumentals of Down South Ten Hours blend well with their meticulous crtique of youthful love.

Jeff Lynne and Roy Wood are a human jukebox, channeling everything from Beatles pop, pyschedelia, Elvis, sitars, Led Zep riffs, lush Brian Wilson harmonies, straight-on rock, Phil Spector -- you name it -- all tied up in a fantastic bow.The inclusion of several strong bonus tracks -- singles and b-sides released by the Move during this time frame, including the anthem \\"Do Ya\\"-- round out what is a spectacular re-release and one of the better records of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Sounding CD Version...","review":"I bought the EMI remaster of this album the day it came out. The only thing it did was upset me. The remaster is drowning in digital tape hiss removal (not to mention heavy handed digital EQ). This noise reduction (NR) caused the sound to gurgle and chirp in much the same way as low bit rate MP3s. It also makes the softer moments become very muffled sounding and the whole album sounds sterile, as if the atmosphere has been removed.I went back and listened to this CD release and found it to be quite an accurate representation of my UK vinyl. The tonality is nice and open (with respect to the original mixes anyway) and it didn't suffer from the heavy handed Abbey Road mastering process.Unless you have a Harry T. Moss mastered UK vinyl pressing this CD on One Way Records is the only way to hear this brilliant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"UN REGALO PARA ALGUIEN ESPECIAL","review":"Este es un autèntico regalo para cualquier criatura...mejor que un trenecito o un robot que lo divierte sin enseñarle nada, sin dejarlo participar activamente !Y los dibujos para colorear son magnìficos !"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a unique book for our children!","review":"The story is marvelous and teches the small one many values of life...It\`s iinteractive and kids write down their own names as they read the book!The drawings deserve a prize...

This tripod has been to the driving range on numerous occasions where I can video my golf swing. With all the activity going on at the range, I needed a tripod that was easy to setup and sturdy enough to withstand the occasional gust of wind.

I think I was hoping that by some miracle it was going to get better, but that was denial on my part. I like finding new film makers, but this is the second or third in this genre that totally sucked. I can't figure out who the real target audience is for this film. The script itself is just bad. The scenes that take place in a supposed bar are so laughable and look like they were done in someone's living room. Some of the nudity seems to be just put in to make up for the lack of substance, because it doesn't need to be there for any other reason. Its not even good soft porn.

So I contacted Dell support and they sent me another pair ASAP only to have them do the exact same thing. The plastic around the plug is very cheaply made and prone to cracking, which was the source of the problem. Then one day in the spring of 2006 I was walking on the tread mill listening to my DJ when it suddenly stopped playing.

There is no repair option through Dell and it took me an hour and a half on the phone and four transfers (and one disconnection) to find this out. They did supply me with one option that cost (with a discount!) $170, but I'm not foolish enough to invest more money in a product that just does not work properly.

The Ratifiers, the Founders whose views count on this score, cared about this idea even less. This is a lame book: the few men whose works West has combed are unrepresentative of their times (he ignores Clinton, Henry, R.H. Lee, _et al._), yet even their own lives don't verify his arguments. If you want to learn something about the origins of the U.S. constitution, start with Bernard Bailyn or Gordon Wood -- who don't get by on right-wing subventions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good read","review":"Dr. West has a very wishy-washy argument, arguing against the ideas that blacks, women, and the poor enjoyed life, liberty, and happiness at the founding. He argues the point that the Founding Fathers BELIEVED in TRUE EQUALITY for all, and he proves his point by using the writings of the founders. However, the simple proclamation of principles does no good for society when they are not carried out. He only goes on to explain WHY the Founders could not carry out their principles.This book is very heavy on the philosophical/principled side of politics, and very lacking in it's examination of the actions undertaken at the founding. I'm only reading the book because it's for my politics class (at the university where he teaches. . . I wonder why we had to buy it. . $$$)"},{"rating":"1","title":"freshman flop","review":"i really like julie doiron's music, but this album is pretty disappointing. since it's her first, it's not too surprising, but it really wasn't recorded too long before her other albums. her voice sounds like a chipmunk, and her songwriting is still very undeveloped. i recommend \\"heart + crime\\" instead, or if you prefer hearing her in french, \\"desormais\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doggone charming!","review":"I love this book, and so does my little boy.

But i was expecting this from reading others reviews. When charging my NIMH cells some of them reach temperatures of 130F which is hot but apparently normal. i did some research online and the max temp for a NIMH cell is 70c or 158F. The charger itself runs not hot but warm but then again i haven't seen a charger that didn't. i would rate the item 5* but i knocked off a star cause the batteries included are junk. also it can recharge NICD cells as well. i would recommend this charger to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got a lemon and junk batteries","review":"I like the idea of a LCD for feedback on the charge status of each cell.The charger was in a new package, but I suspect it was refurbished and done poorly too. The user manual was a \\"bad\\" photocopy.The battery charge appeared to work, but never really put a full charge into my AA Eneloops. My Planet Blaze 2W would only run for 30 minutes. Normally a full charge yields over 10 hours runtime on high setting.During the discharge function, the charger continuously rebooted itself.The included batteries would not charge for more than a few minutes and thus held almost no charge.Paying $7 for return postage was just like putting salt on a fresh wound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and works","review":"Recharges batteries fast, you always know when they are charged, and they seem to last a while to boot.

That led me to acquire this recording and I'm glad I did. One of the great voices of the twentieth century. In this wonderful recording, she sings everything from Bach to German Lieder to opera to spirituals and does them all brilliantly.Her dark throaty contralto voice conveys profound emotion. I could hardly listen to \\"They crucified my Lord...\\" without tears flowing. A wide range of selections are presented on this CD, dating from the 1920s to the 1950s near the end of her singing career. All are excellent. The jacket liner warned of hissing from these old records, but I found the sound to be technically superb.Marian Anderson's voice deserves to be remembered and heard again. I recommend this musical delight heartily. Reviewed by Louis N. Gruber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price","review":"The only thing bad was it was missing two parts, was able to use it anyway.

The \\"Pleasures of the Harbor\\" album is an item that can really change your life or, better, change the way you look at things or the music.

If \\"Harbor\\" doesn't go right into the Billboard, nothin' could.Terryfic (I read in Michael Schumacher's book that the Phil's voice was short to perform songs like \\"Flower Lady\\": What an absurdity!

I purchased these headlights for use with a HID light system (Pilot HID light kit for lowbeams) on a 2002 Chevy Tahoe. The lights fit horribly and did not allow for full adjustment of the headlight beam, even after modification of the lamps. Additionally, when used with my HID lamps, the light emitted through the headlamps came out in color similar to a dirty yellow and was less bright than HID bulbs used in my traditional headlights. I ended up staying with my current headlight configuration and eating the cost of the headlights."},{"rating":"1","title":"shoe review","review":"I bought these because I was looking for a dress boot in a 13 Wide, and almost noone carries them in my size.

Ric Flair vs. Eddie Gurrero for the US belt was a great match. The Stieners vs. Harlem Heat was well done. Benoit vs. Malenko is a classic.

The Battle of the Bikers match between Madusa & Bull Nakano was not great but good. The Chris Beniot-Dean Malenko match was awesome even with the time limit draws. The World Tag Team title match between Harlem Heat & The Steiner Brothers while pretty good,the crowd hated the ending. The United States title match between Ric Flair & Eddie Guerrero was also...The Miz:AAAAAAWWWWWEEESSSSSOOOOMMME!

It is easy to read and interspersed with anecdotes about his travels on Sakhalin island. The book includes some excellent photography. Grant's main thesis centers around the idea that the Nivkhi tribe of Sakhalin island experienced the Soviet era as a \\"roller coaster\\" of policy shifts culminating in a sense of \\"culturelessness.\\" The book covers pre-Revolutionary times a little bit, and then documents the treatment of Nivkhi throughout the Soviet era. A recommended read for anyone studying Siberia during Stalinism or Soviet times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get into it","review":"As my title states, I just couldn't get into this book, even though I work with kids.

This book brought up many intellectual and emotional feelings and connections as to what Mr. Gurdjieff was up against in his vow to bring and establish the teaching in the West.
