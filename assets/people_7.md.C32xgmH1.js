When time came to replace it, I naturally wanted the same level of cleaning. What I got less than 9 months ago is not what I expected. The cleaning aspect is awesome. The problem is two fold. I followed the instructions, and after the 2nd use, leaking. Then after the 3rd use, no suction, so I was left with a wet dirty carpet. Would not waste your time or money with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic carpet cleaner. Paid for itself with one use.","review":"I thought my 15-year-old carpets were beyond redemption, but the Hoover SteamVac brought them back to life. Where the professional cleaners I hired couldn't get the mud stains out, this machine got the job done. I couldn't be happier with the end result.As other reviewers have said, take the time to read the manual. The Hoover SteamVac is easy to assemble and use, but you need to follow the instructions precisely. I also found the tips provided by other Amazon reviewers to be amazingly helpful (especially Lissie's #1 rated 5-star review). Believe me, there is nothing complicated about this machine. Once you learn the ropes, you'll have the cleanest carpets ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Product was easy to put together and even easier to operate.

The problem is that it's prone to breaking -- most recently, the brushes stopped spinning. I took it in for repair under warranty and just got it back today. No sooner had we started using it than it immediately stopped working again: this time the brushes have stopped spinning and the soap isn't dispensed unless you hit the clean surge button. I have done all the things recommended by the manual, cleaning the little screen, the brushes, etc., and nothing gets the brushes going again. This thing is just shoddily made, and I wouldn't recommend taking a chance on it. I don't have any faith that it will last beyond the warranty, so unfortunately I have to say that it's just a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoove Steam Vac carpet cleaner","review":"I have used Bissell for the last 25 years, and I wonder why I never bought a Hoover.

But when I opened and was putting it together I realised a few parts or attachments were missing, but could work around that problem or thought. There were cracks in the tanks and bottom we didn't notice till it was on and water was coming out everywhere then the nice burning smell was all it took for me to fear the worse. I think someone ordered this it got sent back to factory in worse condition then they intial got it in and didn't send all the parts back. so I had to have professional come and clean the water the towels didn't soak up on xmas eve and my kids were afraid to turn on or touch anything afraid it would smell of fire n smoke later too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1 use before water started leaking out the bottom","review":"After seeing the good reviews for this product, I bought this steamer to replace a similar Hoover model that lasted 15-20 years. This product lasted for one cleaning. It did not do a very good job cleaning. My old steamer was much better at removing dirt. The second time I tried to use it, water started pouring out of the bottom. I ended up throwing it in the trash. Then I noticed similar reviews for this product from many people that had the same problem. Apparently, it is a roll of the dice with this steamer. Some people seem to have gotten a good product.

The main paths were looking bad. I wanted to clean them more often than I would bother to rent a steam cleaner. I was quite impressed with the outcome from this machine.

It looked complicated at first but was actually quite easy to set up and operate."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked well","review":"Worked pretty well the first time I have used it. I was a little disappointed that it didn't seem to get spots up the first swipe, but seemed to get them up after passing over them a few times. Mine didn't leak and the rugs dried very fast which was a pleasant surprise. So far happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on carpets, wish it would heat the water","review":"This vacuum works as well on our carpets as the rented professional one, and it much much lighter and easier to manage. I can't believe how much dirt our dog brings in, it's amazing to see it all sucked out! And most importantly I was very impressed by how well it dries the carpet, it sucks the water out very well, and the carpet was dry about 5 hours later.The hardwood floor cleaning also works well, but for really dirty spots where something is really stuck to the floor, you'll have to pretreat it.My only complaint is that this unit does not heat the water, so there is no actual steam. So fill the tank with the hottest water you can, and then use it right away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I owned an earlier Hoover model and it was good but this one is a lot better. It seems to have more suction and it spreads the water more evenly. We have 4 dogs and use it all the time. I would highly recommend this machine. Our old one lasted about 8 yrs of constant use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Machine!","review":"I just, today, used this shampooer for the very first time and I am thrilled, to say the least, about what an incredible machine this is. My previous shampooer was an Oreck and there is absolutely no comparison. This one far outshines the Oreck, feature for feature. The tanks are very easy to access and can be quickly and easily cleaned after use. The trigger in the handle is easy to use, besides being comfortable in your hand, and the finished carpet is far cleaner than anytime that I ever used the Oreck. I do not hesitate to recommend this product. If I could give it 25 stars I would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I've used the hoover now on approx 9 carpets and have been very pleased with the results. it's easy to manuver and not too heavy. We own a campground and as you can guess the carpets get filthy. Although I have to go over areas two to five times it's not back breaking. I'm very happy with the suction. I do not use the recommended carpet cleaner though. For those interested I use woolite w/ frebreeze carpet cleaner, and a little Downy with frebreeze and oxy 10. This really tackles the dirt and odor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Our carpet looks new","review":"I did a lot of researching but knew I couldnt afford the very high priced shampoorers but wanted one with good suction. This one does a super job of taking the wetness out of the carper and it was dry in no time. The suction is so good I was ashamed when my husband dumped the water.

Well, because of the great reviews that I had read that highly recommended this product I just stuck with it and I was able to put it together the same night. I am writing this after having it in my home for several weeks only because I just did not want to clean the carpet. Now that I have had the experience with this carpet cleaner I am sold on it. It was just like vacuuming, it was light to push and I even tried the hose and tools for my steps. I would recommend this Hoover SteamVac to anyone who needs the help and wants to do it themselves. My carpet looks better than it has in years. Thanks for such high recommendations that led me to purchase it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great machine!","review":"I was in the market for a steam cleaner after I decided that I was sick of my carpet looking so nasty. I don't think it had ever been cleaned...and I know it hadn't been done in the two years we have lived in the house. I did quite a bit of research before deciding on this model and I must say that I'm pleased with the results so far. It was really pretty easy to assemble and easy to maneuver. I first used it in front of the door to remove all the high-traffic stains and an old pet stain. My carpet looks almost new...I had no idea how bad it had been! I hadn't even used as much of the cleaning solution as the company recommended and it picked up tons of dirt. As with other reviews, I agree that both of the water basins (clean and dirty) have to frequently be attended to, but it's really not bad for the price and the machine so far has done a great job on my carpet."},{"rating":"2","title":"just used for the first time","review":"Amazing. We have been researching this product for awhile. Decided on this model, for the price and reviews. Just used it on a 20x20 carpet that the cat and dog seemed to compete for...yuck. It took up stains that the rental could not get. You could see the piss and poop sucked up into the vac. We cleaned and are allowing it to air dry. As long as it does that everytime, this item is perfect"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product poor instructions","review":"Works extremely well on both carpets and furniture. The plastic components appear a bit flimsy at first and I was concerned that I might break them when first assembling - no problems so far. However, the instructions are abysmal and the illustrations are too small to see any detail. It took me over an hour to assemble due primarily to not understanding the instructions. Once it was all assembled it was obvious. A good example of Companies employing Engineers to write manuals instead of a typical user."},{"rating":"1","title":"LEAKS...just like everyone says","review":"I read lots of reviews of this product and purchased it despite several reviewers saying it leaked. I assumed that they were not properly following the assembly instructions and that caused the leak. I was wrong. I very carefully read and followed the instructions (heard the loud \\"CLICK\\" everyone was talking about). In fact, I was so concerned that I did it properly the assembly took a lot longer than anticipated.Upon my first use, the clean solution tank leaked onto the carpet. I figured it was a fluke. The next use (for stairs with the attachment ... and again carefully following the assembly instructions), it leaked again. This time the clean solution tank leaked and was empty (all over the floor) within 1-2 minutes. It created a huge puddle and mess.What a horrible steam cleaner. Shame on Hoover for not \\"getting a clue\\" from all the bad reviews and returns and fixing this serious design flaw.I WOULD NEVER RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT TO ANYONE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost suction within months","review":"I might as well have thrown my money in the wind!

The Clean Surge is great for high traffic areas--the dirt was ground in and it cleaned it up no problem.

I really don't have anything negative to say. I am very happy with the carpet cleaner. It is VERY easy to operate and clean.

The 2nd time that same week I went to go clean a larger area, and it stopped working. It would still dispense the cleaning solution, but the recovery tank remained empty, which bascially left my carpets soaked! I had to use a wet vaccuum to clean up the excess liquid.

The only drawback is the size of the tanks, as they are too small to allow cleaning of even a small room without emptying the used solution tank, and refilling the cleaner tank several times. The small size of the tanks does, however, make it easy to fill and empty them. The strong suction does a very good job of picking up the solution, allowing the carpets to dry completely in just a few hours. Only a commercial carpet cleaner could do a better job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice","review":"Having two elderly dogs can make carpet maintenance a challenge. After years of renting bulky \\"commercial\\" style cleaners, I decided to buy this Hoover. It works better than I could've imagined. It's easy to use once you learn how, and it cleans impressively. The vigorous agitation makes quick work of stains and the suction power is amazing - an impressive fraction of the water is reclaimed. The Hoover cleaning solution works quite well compared to others I've used. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"hoover carpet cleaner","review":"This is my second Hoover but the first one with the steam surge that I really like.

We carefully put the machine together according to the directions, though it was a no brainer, but on first use it leaked all over the floor. Rather than return the cleaner we took it to an authorized repair shop where they determined that something had been put together wrong on the assembly line. Of course warranty covered the cost of repairs and we now have an excellent rug cleaner. We'd adopted a couple rescue dogs and this rug cleaner has proved to be easy to use for keeping our beige carpet looking new. Fortunately we now seldom need to use it for that, but even using cold water gets those pet spots up every time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why didn't I buy a steam cleaner years ago?","review":"I've had the steam cleaner for 6 months and have used it several times. We have 2 puppies so I am cleaning carpets quite often. I've had no problems with it leaking. In my opinion, I feel I get more dirt of the carpet if I boil the water on the stove and then pour into the water tank.My husband told me to get a steam cleaner years ago but instead I would rent the rug doctor and/or have my carpets professionally cleaned. My husband was right (I have told him this several times and he just smiles). I've saved a ton of money and have found I actually like cleaning the carpets. It does a great job and I like clean carpets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have a 2 year old and dog - great cleaner!","review":"Did A LOT of research before I chose this cleaner for my carpets.

Of course a new machine works when you go to clean your carpet. When it fails completely after only a few uses is when you should finally publish your review.Hoovers do not suck, which is a big problem because they dump the cleaning fluid into your carpet, but then you need to rely on evaporation to clean up the mess you just made with your barely used steam cleaner.What is wrong with this company that two different models of steamvacs made by this company both failed the same way, and neither saw heavy usage?AVOID THIS PURCHASE, YOU WILL THANK ME LATER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What The...","review":"I received the Hoover within a reasonable time frame. So far so good.The problems then became evident.The machine leaves stripes on the rug as it only cleans in narrow stripes. It sucked all of the detergent out of the nozzle before I could finish a small area. To clean an area of any dimension would take enough detergent to fill a number of 55 gallon drums.The device arrived missing the hose, hose holder and nozzle clean-out tool. The Hoover bunch said the only thing I could do is return the whole thing. Sure, let's think about how much that would cost not to mention the time and effort involved.

It was easy enough to put together, but I worry about all those plastic parts over time. It did a nice job cleaning the carpet of the dirt, but didn't do so great on stains. I plan on experimenting with some different cleaning solutions to see if I can improve upon that. The upholstery tool works well, and I like that it has a rotating brush attachment. The tool has to be inserted into the dirty water tank each time you want to use it, which is a pain. Also, when not in use, it is nearly impossible to store the hose on the machine. I have taken to simply hanging it in a closet. Also, with the hose, remember to run clean water through it after each use...you will be surprised at how much gunk is left in the hose. Overall, this seems to be a nice machine. I have used it 3-4 times in the last 3 months, and it has paid for itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine","review":"Machine is new.

I think this unit was a return that was just shipped out again without fixing whatever reason it was returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Owned less than 2 years, used 4 times and it's dead.","review":"Worked great the first 3 times I used it. Started to use it tonight, turned it off to refill, plugged it back in and now it won't suck. All suction is GONE. Went through all of the troubleshooting to no avail. I bought it in July 2010 and not even 2 years later, it's dead and out of warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"only one time used","review":"I purchased it at 10/2010 and only used one time after received.

The water pick up is good. It uses less water. It seems to clean OK. The furniture nozzle water cools too fast in the hose.. and sprays cold water just like a hose. So I dumped the hose several times for warmer water.. pick up nozel works good. Furniture looks better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked on 2nd use","review":"Worked great the first time. However the 2nd time I pulled it out, the clean water tank leaked all over the floor. Th problem is not the valve in the clean water tank as it does not leak until it is put into the cleaner. I will take to a service center for repair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Steamvac Carpet Cleaner","review":"Love it. It does a marvelous job. Have cleaned two really dirty beige carpets with it.

Only complaint whatsoever is the length of the power cord, wish it was a little longer, but really a minor problem- definitely wouldn't stop me from recommending it to friends/family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Stream Vac.","review":"Great product, this carpet cleaner will pay for itself in no time..It is easy to use,stores in a small space. The small attachment is good for small spaces and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak parts","review":"Steam Vac was nice for about three uses then the brushes stopped working. I took apart the turbine assembly and discovered that the turbine blade itself doesn't have any bearings and had rubbed a grove in the top of the turbine assembly housing causing the turbine blade itself to crack in half. This is a part that spins very fast and is in use whenever you use the spin brushes it should have at least some form of bearing to keep it from failing. Funny thing is the gears in the turbine have bearings just not the fan at the top. Now I am forced to spend another $40 to replace a poorly made part.Other than this the Steam Vac worked great and made my heavily worn carpets look much better. The hand held attachment worked great for cleaning the upholstery in my car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product, fast shipping","review":"I have 2 dogs, one being a 4-month old puppy. I cleaned my carpets as soon as I received the product and I love it! The dual water compartments are great. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It was very complicated to assemble it and to get it working. It is a heavy machine but, cleans pretty good. A piece of the staircase part came a part before I start using it. If I had to do this all over again, I would have not buy this item from Amazon, but from a local store so that I could have return it. I am disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Machine","review":"This product was so easy to use. It works wonderful.Had no trouble with leaking water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one \\"watch out for\\"","review":"This product does the job intended very well. Its easy to use and to clean up.Only thing to watch out for is when intending to use on bare floors.The $7.98 attachment required is not included. This is not stated in the literature on the product. You only find out when you go to assemble the unit.It's a small plastic part that press fits on the front.The local Hoover dealer told me, after I found this out, that delivery of this part was 6 weeks.After finding someone that would get it for me in a short period of time, for $17, I was amazed that the part is a flimsy piece of plastic that I don't believe is really even necessary. It also falls off the unit frequently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfaction","review":"Product works as advertised. It is easy to fill and empty, and does a good job of making the water dirty. Nice long cord, and not too difficult to push back and forth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it all the time","review":"I live in Georgia - Red clay. I have 3 dogs and 2 cats and a grandson.

My carpets look like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"Was worried at first since the box arrived crumpled on top with an obvious repair job on the outside and when I opened it, cleaning solution had leaked all over the cardboard inside.Went ahead and assembled it hoping it hadn't been broken in some way. Read the directions carefully as advised in the other reviews for the product. And it works great!Perfect for the owner of a very old dog. I was tired of lugging the rental carpet machines in and out of the car and house. However, I didn't have much money to spend. This machine cleans very well and is easy to use once you get the knack of it. If you do the extra \\"dry\\" stokes, the carpet dries very quickly. Only complaint would be that the dirty water tank does fill up fairly fast.Definitely very happy with it, would buy it again in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Pretty Good","review":"The cleaner performs very well. Drying time is very quick. I was surprised to be able to move furniture back in the room within a few hours. The only cons so far after using the product twice are the water temperature and switching to the attachments. I noticed that the water temp was not maintained and was quite a bit cooler by the end of cleaning my living room. The other con is switching between normal floor cleaning and the attachments is a little frustrating. Flipping the water tank connection down feels like your going to break it right off. All in all a solid purchase compared to renting a rug doctor every year."},{"rating":"1","title":"plastic broke...","review":"The machine itself works great. I do not have an issue. it cleaned most of the floor stains and dries fast. However this thing is made from cheap plastic or just plain bad engineering...I accidently pulled back on the handle before i stepped on the lever and it just snapped. It will not stand up straight anymore. Also after 10 uses the rotary scrubbing thing fell off. It looks like the plastic inside was glued together and kinda as i mentioned just fell off... i'm semi-handy so it's all glued back together and works fine... but it feels like crap quality to me. I am still looking for a sturdy long lasting one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"I couldnt be happier dose a great job easy to use I realy like the 2 tank system my old one was a one tank and it was hard to clean after using it this Hoover is much easier to clean up after I am done using it"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow!!!!","review":"This is so worth the purchase. Ever since we bought this we have never had our floors steam cleaned again. It made our carpets look like new.

I love every thing about this Hoover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the best!","review":"I've had this carpet cleaner for 1.5 years and used it three times, including the carpeted stairs. Of all the carpet shampooers I've tried over the years, this product works the best -- better than the Rug Doctor and better than the Kirby shampooer. It even does better job than the professionals I hired to come in and clean my carpet in the past for a whole lot of money.The directions are clear and it's easy to use. I love this product. I just hope it lasts for years."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent rug cleaner","review":"Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner proved to be an excellent appliance and just the thing for our tired carpets.

The price was excellent and was covered with just one professional cleaning we did not have to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Customers never wrong","review":"I spend few hours to search review on a number of deep cleaner brands, and found this one is the one choosen by so many customer as the best one in a very good price.Customers never wrong.

It quit working one day after the one year warrenty ran out, and I couldn't get any satisfaction from the manufactorer. After repeated emails I just gave up. Will definately not buy this item again, and would recommend that no one else buy it either. There's too many out there to choose from and maybe those companies will back their products better"},{"rating":"2","title":"slightly improved over old model","review":"We've had another Hoover Steam Vac in the past. This model is slightly improved, mainly in the apolstery attachment, which we use for spot cleaning. It has an agitator now and has a place to stow it now. Overall a pretty good cleaner for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"No fear..this works!","review":"We pay $150 to have our carpet cleaned. Why not spend $150 on a Hoover SteamVac? My plan was that it would pay for itself in no time. I feel that was correct. Cleaned 5 rooms no problem and will clean many more hopefully. Yes, I do believe that it will pay for itself, except for the labor. It is a bit of work running this machine, dumping and refilling tanks and preparing the room.PROS: you can clean anytime you want and only one room at a time.CONS: moving furniture, vacuuming and running the SteamVac is work.BY the way there is no steam, only the heat from the motor which helps to dry the carpet.This item really works if you folow directions and be sure to have plenty detergent because it goes fast!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased customer","review":"I am very pleased with my F5914-900 SteamVac. I had read a lot of the reviews before deciding to buy this cleaner. It is easy to use, fill and empty. I have a canister rug cleaner and it is much harder to use and when you dump the dirty water, the clean water is dumped, too. I had a spot on my living room rug where a planter had overflowed and left an ugly dark stain, but The Hoover SteamVac took it right up. Amazon also had the best price that I could find anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"hoover steam cleaner","review":"recieved hoover F5914-900 in good condition,easy assembly,tried it out with vinigar and water 10 to 1,water came out filthy.

It was constantly leaking the second we put in the water tank. Looking up on the internet this is a VERY COMMON PROBLEM!. We did everything exactly as instructed and even took it to a local repair hoping they might be able to fix it. Their response was that a \\"part is missing\\". Do not buy this model.

I will never by a hoover again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for us","review":"This is our third Hoover SteamVac, all of which were purchased from Amazon and one of which we had to replace after just about two years of actual use. Still, we feel we got our money's worth when compared to the cost of hiring a commercial service. Since Hoover is the only carpet steamer we have ever owned, it's impossible to compare with other makes or models. However, it also attests to our satisfaction with the product. So much so that we purchased one for our home in Colorado and one for our condo in Florida. Each seems to perform wellin these two disparate climates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never had sooooo bad experience","review":"this item was obviously previously returned by another customer.

I am so pleased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hood broke after four uses","review":"While this product performs well when it works, the front hood screw mounts broke after only four uses; rendering the unit without suction.

Now I get to see how good their service is."},{"rating":"2","title":"The cheapest could be the best!","review":"I am one of those folks that looks at the lower priced item -- assuming that it's not as good. I often assume that the additional cost makes it that much better. In this case, this cheapest model is perfect!I live out in the woods and I've got a dog. Dirt is always coming in, wet paws are pretty common and dirty shoes too. This model does a great job of handling all of that.It's powerful. It does the job on the first try. Capacity is reasonable. I really cannot complain about it.I seriously doubt that the model which cost nearly twice as much as this one -- is actually twice as good.Stick with this model. You won't be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very easy to use","review":"I dreaded putting this cleaner together, but once I got started, it was really easy.

Our carpet had old pet stains and all kinds of spots from the previous owners and guessing they never tried to scrub any of it out. To our very pleasant surprise, the vacuum sucked it all up. The carpet looks new and virtually all the spots are gone. Just be sure to pretreat the spots first. The process is a bit long, but with some patience, you will see and get clean carpet. I'm so glad we got this instead of spending money on a rental or getting it professionally cleaned. This is the best [...] bucks we spent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Wow!","review":"This thing is great. Easy to put together. Super easy to use. I was surprised that I only cleaned a portion of the room and had to refill the tank, but otherwise it was truly amazing. I have 2 dogs, and our off-white carpet was costing me a fortune to have professionally cleaned, so I bought this thing and it paid for itself in ONE using. The carpet looked as good as when the dude came and did my carpets. I shopped on line for extra cleaning solution, so I'll always have enough at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"A-FRIGGEN-MAZING!","review":"What can I say that hasn't already been said in the other 1,500 5 star reviews?

I am the most pessimistic and skeptical person on the planet, but this machine is the greatest. I followed the instruction manual to the letter and it does NOT leak. It's easy to load, easy to empty the tanks , easy to clean, simple to use, and cleans like crazy. I am so happy that I overcame my skepticism and bought this cleaner, and it was delivered in only 36 hours. If everything in life worked this well life would be so much easier."},{"rating":"1","title":"READ THE 1 STAR REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!","review":"It was just about 6 months old with a low to moderate amount of use when it began to leak water all over the floor. It buckled up our newly refinished wood floors while sitting there before we realized what happened. Then plastic parts began to break off of it. I brought it to a friend of ours who is a repairman for vacuums and shampooers. He looked at what was broken and said it wasn't worth repairing. It did do a good job of cleaning the carpet. BUT it is ridiculously difficult to set it up for the hand/spot attachment. I think they took it to the dump or I would attempt to return it. Amazon is good about that. Leaking is a serious problem for a machine and all the plastic breaking on critical parts is cheap, un-fixable materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not waste your money on this piece of crap","review":"I followed the instructions to a T, and this thing NEVER WORKED. It seemed to work at first, but the second time I hauled it out (less than a week after I ordered it), the dirty water tank stopped filling up and and I realized that after I had a dirty-water soaked carpet. I took off the (empty) dirty water tank and noticed a metal part just hanging around on the inside. Where the hell did that come from? Who knows!I have a four month old who wants to lie around on the carpet and he can't now that it's soaked with dirty water. I don't even have anything to suck up the dirty water with.I hardly ever write bad reviews but I am so pissed about this I could scream. How the hell does one return a vacuum?! I already threw away the box! Ugh.It's Saturday night at 6:30 PM and I'm going to have to run to Target or somewhere else that sells vacs and shell out a buttload of cash just to get this dirty water up! DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a Steam Vac","review":"Definitely false advertising. There is nothing \\"steam\\" about this machine. If you have pets, don't waste your money. All it did was dilute and spread out the dirt. The \\"surge\\" feature just squirts more water over an area. You would think if there are steam irons why can't we have a real steam vac? Also, after getting the water as hot as possible it only laste about 10 minutes and then you have to refill the tank."},{"rating":"2","title":"as expected","review":"We had an older version of this cleaner that lasted us over 10 years.

Easy to run. I was stuck paying big carpet cleaning bills with the leading companies not going within 3ft. of anything electical in my home. Also would not move my furniture. Read the reviews and tried this vac. At the low price I figured I had literally nothing to lose. It worked easily, cleaned well and I have 2 dogs, but most of all my carpeting dried really quickly. No residue from the Hoover cleaning soap. I bought a large bottle at time of purchase per another reviewers suggestion. Took a day but in the end a 2 story home was clean in Cleveland!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for carpets!

It works, but obviously we want something new and unbroken. The package includes a note about \\"please don't return to the store you purchased it\\" which is reasonable since it was just one replaceable part and it still works as it is.What isn't reasonable is Hoover's customer service giving us the runaround about forwarding an Amazon invoice, then sending a PDF, and then just not responding to emails. All I want is a five dollar piece of plastic before the warranty expires. I can only assume that Hoover's strategy is to just hope I give up and accept the broken product they sent to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks After A Few Uses","review":"Just rent a machine.

Short story short: believe me and just rent a unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"This will be short and sweet. Assembly was easy, build quality poor.

I hate this machine and want to hammer it to death. Now it is too late for me to return it, and there is nowhere near me to have it repaired.

I recommend this as a good bargain."},{"rating":"2","title":"New purchase","review":"I just got my SteamVac, and have only used it once, but it performed very well. I used it on old carpeting that has not been cleaned for years, and it really spiffed it up...looks great. My only concern is that you have to refill the tank a lot. I'll deal with that, tho, because this machine really did the job.p.s. I don't know why \\"this review is from...\\" says \\"kitchen\\"...I did not get it to use in the kitchen....although I think you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"This carpet cleaner was a great purchase! For less than the price of one professional cleaning, I did my house and my sons house and the carpets turned out great. I was most impressed by how well the machine sucked the water out of the carpet. Our carpets were dry in about 3 hours. I did put more water in my carpet and made more passes to extract the water than the instructions directed. I also used only half the professional strength soap they recommended and followed it up by \\"rinsing\\" the carpet with only hot water after extracting as much soap water as I could. SO, essentially I cleaned my carpets twice - once with soap and once with hot water, but it was well worth it. My son had just bought his house and the off-white carpets were filthy. While I was cleaning you could actually see a line where I had cleaned and where I hadn't cleaned. Even my skeptically husband was impressed by how well this machine worked. I highly recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works okay","review":"Got mine on nov 18 2011. Used it 3 times, ten it broke. It stopped spinning today on Dec 5 2011.

I do recommend this Hoover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - leaks","review":"Ordered this based upon our positive experience with Hoover products. This Steam Vac was a disappointment.

Caution, do not place on carpet or other surface until you are sure it does not leak."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have had bad luck","review":"I have had 2 Hoover Carpet cleaners in the past 2 years. The first one I bought at Home Depot and after just a few uses, it broke. I called the Hoover company and they suggested I take it to a certified repair shop in my area. I did take the unit to the repair shop, they fixed it but charged me anyway, even though it was still under warranty. So I called Hoover back and they refunded the repair costs. I used it again a month or so later and it broke again. They would not honor the warranty since I had already had it repaired once. So we went back to Home Depot and bought another one. Same model. I have had this new one for about 9 months. Today I had to use it to do a little spot cleaning on a carpet, and all of a sudden black oily liquid started surging into the dirty water container. I called Hoover and they said go take it to a repair shop but we would be responsible for the repair costs. So, needless to say, I will not buy another Hoover Carpet cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"This replaced the Hoover all-terrain that broke on me. Even though it has a smaller water tank and doesn't seem as heavy duty and aesthetically pleasing...this steamvac works much better! I noticed that it sucks up the water much better than the all terrain and the other bissell brand that I had in the past. It's also a hundred dollars cheaper than the other models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the money","review":"I'm not in the carpet cleaning business, just wanted something to do my home a few times a year. I originally had a bissel and it was frankly nothing but trouble. My local vacuum store talked me into this one and I am very pleased. Suction is excellent, and pretty much all the water you spray into the rug gets pulled back out. You do have to be careful to properly seat the little plastic piece that attaches the hose or the suction will drop to zero, but it really isn't a big issue. Very pleased. Too bad they don't make these in the USA any more though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get me once, shame on you. Get me twice, shame on me.","review":"Unfortunately,I bit on this twice. Bought one in 2009 and it lasted 16 months. 4 months out of warranty. Bought another one in April of 2011 and it lasted until June 26th 2012; two months out of warranty. Same issue, brush drive shot. I will not try for third time's the charm. I would stay away from this unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE PLEASE Dont waste your time or money","review":"I can not explain how bad this product is. It took so long to get the brushes to spin. I Had to go online to find a group discussion on how to get them to spin. When and if you can get that to work, well good for you because the next issue you have is to figure out why there is no suction. The whole water tank will distribute water all over your carpet and never suck it up! So now I have a wet dirty carpet and am running to the local Lowes/Home Depot to rent their carpet cleaner. You should not have to pay ANY amount of money to figure out how to get a product to work properly. It needs to work correctly from the start.If I find a product and like it then I try to be be faithful to that brand. Because I wanted to save a little cash I was swayed to change. Now there is more of an expense to fix this problem. Had a Kenmore cleaner for many years that was really good, same with a Kenmore vacuum. I will NEVER cheat again. Kenmore why did I leave you!!??"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth every penny","review":"This is by far the best carpet cleaner EVER.

I would definately reccomend this particular Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaner works very well, company packing is another story.","review":"The carpet cleaner works very well. I was a little worried when I received it and it was not packed well at all. It was like they threw everything in a box and put a very small amount of tape on it and sent it on its way. All the parts were loose and no cushioning at all. That being said, the cleaner seems to be working fine and does a very good job on the carpet, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT machine!! Recommend for anyone","review":"At the first, I was feeling like I shouldn't have bought it.It was a little hard to assemble but later I figured that I could go to Hoover website and they have great video instruction how to assemble and how to use.After I figured how to use from the video, I cleaned the whole office and house.And the carpet felt so clean and amazing.I recommend for anyone how has carpeted floor. I was so amazed how dirty it was even though I moved in the place only 8 months ago.The carpet was professionally cleaned when I was moving in.The house is mostly used as office and no kids but still the water was so dirty after cleaning with the machine.I was just so shocked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Steam Vac Carpet Cleaner Does the Job!","review":"Great purchase! I have two large dogs and my nice wool rugs can get very smelly. I have been sending them out about once a month and finally decided to try this steamer cleaner that had received many good reviews. I am extremely pleased. One of my concerns was that it might wet my rugs too much, as they are on hardwood floors. That did not happen; it works great! What a difference and what a cost savings to be able to do it myself!! On Amazon, this steam vac cost less than one month's cleaning!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F5914-900 Review","review":"Well worth the money - paid for itself the first time I used it.

I used it in my Living Room, worked great, moved onto my bedroom, brushes stopped spinning. I did everything the manual said to do, no results. I called Hoover, they said I need to take it to a Hoover Distributor, which is 61 miles from my home. I asked if I could take it to a local repair shop, they said No. If I did do this they may reimburse but the 2 shops I called, they have gone through this with Hoover, and they have never been paid, so they will not deal with the situation. By the way, I spent almost an hour on the phone with Hoover with no results. I sat on the phone waiting for a live person for 28 min.

So far the urine smell has diminished a small amount.I am very impressed how well it sucks up excess water so as not to leave the carpet soaked. The intake does get really dirty and since you can't really clean it with anything or take it off to clean I take it to a small area on our bare floors pushing it back and forth like I am cleaning the carpet, give the nozzle a couple pushes and it seems to clean it up pretty well.

Immediately noticed it was a return but had not been used. Decided to assemble anyway. I was ready to send it back right away when I saw how the plastic was so thin and looked as if it would snap in just a few uses. Continued on until saw how the hose attachment would need to be hooked up. Very likely that panel would snap with first attachment. Stopped and packed the machine up for a return. I did not run the machine so I cannot attest to its performance. Definitely too cheap for me to risk.

The only \\"cleaning\\" is provided by a fixed straight (plastic) brush on the bottom of the unit. There is no rotary action or powered brush at all - YOU provide the only mechanical cleaning action by pushing the unit back and forth over the carpet. The \\"wet vacuum\\" feature then sucks up the excess liquid and whatever dirt you've managed to loosen.Will it remove loose dirt and soil? Yes. Will it \\"deep clean\\"? No. Will it \\"steam clean\\"? No. Does it effectively remove stains? Definitely not.The construction is cheap molded plastic held together with a few screws and brackets. There are better products available in the same price range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously used. But sold as \\"NEW\\"","review":"Took it out of the box and it has some obvious usage to it.

I called the Hoover 1-800 number on the machine and gave up after being on hold for over an hour. I also left a call back number with Hoover and nobody called back.

The thing doesn't heat water up so you have to put boiling water in it every time. Then it just sort of gets things wet and doesn't really suck anything up. Also, it is really complicated to assemble and figure out how to use. We just decided to return it and either call a steam cleaning company or rent a steam cleaner next time.

When it gave out I replaced it with a similar steam vac, the Hoover SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with clean surge F5914-900.

I have always been able to leave the clean unused solution in the tank and the tank on my steamvac but when I did this with the SteamVac Carpet Cleaner with clean surge F5914-900 it ran down thru and out the bottom of the cleaner and all over by floor and there it sat for 24 hours before I found it. When I called the company all they could say was not to store the water on it but to take the tank and store it separately. WHAT A CROCK....if you are going to make a product that you want good reviews on trying making a GOOD PRODUCT. Seems to me the Hoover no longer cares about standards and has joined the long line of CHEAPLY MADE PRODUCTS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"Seems to have enough suction but there are a few major drawbacks.

Considering this I still went ahead as the photos were the deciding factor.It is brilliant and cleans exceptionally well. Stains that had been on the carpet when we moved in, are now gone and that convinced me that I bought the right machine. Yes the construction is made of plastic and yes it is a pain that you need to empty/fill the containers fairly frequently, but the most important thing, is that it cleans the carpets!I would highly recommend this cleaner to those of you wanting one that works!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good until brushes broke","review":"I am also in the camp of loving this cleaner for about 1 year until the internal mechanism which allows the brushes to spin broke.

The New box had been opened and the packing cardboard was missing and one plasic piece was loose in the box. I think there is a piece missing.

When the bolts fall out the water tank spills. Most of the items I have purchased that are made in China have pieces that do not fit and I have to go to the hardware store to get the right item. The performance was great for the first few times but after a couple of months the machine no longer took water in. I expect the fact I have a Tibetan Mastiff is the reason. It cannot handle pet fur. I dont recommend this steam cleaner if you have a long haired dog. I now am going out and buying a different steam cleaner for pets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective item","review":"The Hoover SteamVac was defective. It could not be assembled properly.

I did not order another SteamVac."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not intuitive for these oldsters","review":"We have had our machine since 2005 but before others used it to clean our rugs. I finally decided to brave using it - and first room after much reading and checking on how to use it worked great! Then we had to empty dirty container, well, apparently container wasn't closed properly & this time it leaked (of course) water all over & so on. My thoughts are that it is a bit fussy to get both of these containers on properly. The top one (clean water) is not easy for me to make work. The instructions say to press handle down, well, no, actually once it's in place you press handle up to lock it into place...sigh I think it could be more user friendly but when it does work properly, it's great! We have 5 house animals, a very dirty carpet, and it did a wonderful job in the room where it was all hooked up properly. Wish it came with little tool to clean out debris under clear plastic cover in front on bottom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Hoover Syeam Vac!","review":"We just were give a beautiful 1 year old white(oy!) sofa. It had some stains due to pets and a recent roof leak. Dry cleaning didn't take out the stains, and since it was a micro fiber fabric- washing the slip covers in the washing machine was not recommended. After calling Stanley Steamer and finding out it would cost us (over $200) to have the sofa steam cleaned- I decided to purchase this highly recommended upholstery and rug cleaning machine. It worked wonderfully and we saved so much money. Now we can clean whenever we want without hiring someone. This machine is easy to assemble and use. The cleaning detergent is very expensive however- so we are going to experiment with less expensive detergents like mixing Oxyclean and other more natural products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good steamer","review":"I can't judge other steamers as this is my first one, I think this steamer is excellent, I read a lot of reviews before I buy it and I think i took the right decision to buy this one. The only negative thing is that you have to use hot water and I think this is minor as the other steamers that have built in heating would never give you more than a warm water if you use cold water to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT WORK ON BERBER CARPET!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this cleaner new from Amazon, and it works good on regular carpet, but does not work at all on BERBER...So if you have BERBER style carpet, do NOT buy this carpet cleaner...

You can put pressure down on the nozzle, and remove the water, but you cannot put pressure on the Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover delight!","review":"Overall I am very happy with this carpet cleaner. Feels pretty solid and I love the rotating brushes that help give you that deep cleaning power. Water extraction is superb, which helps drying time. Wish the water tanks were a little larger - this would eliminate frequent filling and emptying of the tanks. This was not a big deal because of the great cleaning power of the Hoover steamVac.You will be very happy with your purchase. Oh Yes, make sure you read the instructions, this will speed up assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I was amazed at how well this vacuum cleaned our carpets. I purchased it mainly to clean up a high-traffic section of carpet that had become very dirty. Two passes and the carpet looks entirely different (in a good way). I should mention that I used the Hoover Platinum Collection Professional Strength detergent which seemed to work much better than the sample detergent which comes with the vacuum. The handheld tool even did a remarkably good job on the carpeted stairs. I have also used this vacuum on pet stains; after a couple passes, I can't even tell there was previously a stain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just do the job","review":"Huge, heavy, but do the job. The small tool is not so useful because of the inconvenience caused by the heaviness of the vacuum.

The first time it worked fine, but this time it will not vacuum the water back out of the carpet. I have messed and messed with it, and my husband thought he had it fixed by getting the dirty-water tank properly seated. Even then, it didn't take anywhere near close to all the water out that it had sprayed in. But now I am doing a second part of the carpte, and once again, it will not remove the water, AT ALL!. I have had two Bissels (NEVER buy that machine, either!). I thought I had a much better steamvac in the Hoover. I have company coming tomorrow and don't know what I am going to do with my wet carpet. The local vacuum repair guy refuses to repair steamvacs. What a hassle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great steam cleaner","review":"Finally a steam cleaner that picks up the deep dirt without spending a fortune. I steam clean at least twice a month and this thing has allowed me to cut back to one time a month. My last cleaner took me 4-5 hours to clean the whole carpet and I had to do it 2-3 times. This cleaner takes me about 1-2 hours and one time! So why the 4? The attachment is weak. Does not work that well and sprays water/cleaning solution unevenly. In addition, their is a small cord that is used for attachments,when not in use their is a spot to hold it in place which is awful. Whenever I am cleaning the carpets, the dang attachment cord falls off and gets under cleaner. I decided to add velcro to keep it in place since I do not use attachments frequently. I know to get a true cleaning a professional cleaner is the best but this gets the job done for me. Easy clean up and fits nicely in my cleaning closet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Clean Carpets","review":"I am very happy with the Hoover carpet cleaner. I did my research and have tried a friends Bissell Pro Heat II which made me interested in making a purchase for a carpet cleaner. What I like about this Hoover is that it scored very good on the Consumer Reports. Even when they pointed out that the coverage of this model is smaller, felt that the suction may increase with the smaller coverage. I really like the price and the only negative thing I can think about this model is that it is noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I bought this steamer after carefully researching reviews by both Consumers Report and by other people who have purchased it. The one review that repeatedly came up regarding this steamer was: \\"the machine's suction stopped...\\" Well, I assumed that this was due to the buyer's inability to know how to use the machine as the reason.....NOT! This cleaner's suction stopped working 3 hours after I used it to clean my carpet. The suction just stopped!I'm not sure if this is a common problem or it needs to be in a recall status, however, I will say that when it was working, it did do a good job of cleaning my carpet and getting out embedded dirt. But, if I can only get a one time use out of it, what good is it to me? I'm on my way now to take it back to Home Depot! Will I get another one......the jury is still out on that decision!Do your research and still, don't think that the more you pay for one of these cleaners, the better it works. This one works but not for long!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Parts","review":"Came to me missing a part; the bottom holder for the power cord. Called the 1 800 number and they sent the part.

It took a little more effort to assemble out of the box than I expected, but it's really user-friendly and gets the job done. Its tank holds enough water to clean a fairly large room without having to stop, but the cord is a little too short for large areas. I had to stop fairly often to move to a closer electrical outlet, but it wasn't enough of a negative to rate the machine less than 5-stars. I had already thoroughly cleaned the carpets with my new Dyson DC28, and this product still managed to pull out deep-down dust and debris to leave the carpet better than I imagined. I'm really glad I purchased this product and would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great!","review":"Have only used with hot water- no cleaner yet and even with water it still gets the carpet clean!!! Didn't think my new carpet would produce such dirty water this soon. Can't wait to see what it does when we add a bit of cleaner. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 was if you let the machine sit with clean water in the tank it leaks, so when you are done I reccommend taking the resevior off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing at this price","review":"Works very well.

If I have a small spill in the living room, for example, I can do a quick area in no time. I am so happy with my purchase.

Now don't get me wrong, the old Hoover did a nice job and I saved a ton of money on carpet cleaning over the years. I was just surprised that I bought my old Hoover--again.

With water leaking heavily from the tank, I couldn't even put it in the machine and attempt a use. I called the local Hoover \\"authorized dealer\\" and he said I'd be better off returning it to Amazon. He explained that if I wanted a replacement tank, he'd fill out the warranty paperwork, but it would take at least 3 weeks for Hoover to even process the paperwork, much less send a new tank, etc. So we returned it to Amazon, which is always realiable. I cannot believe that a \\"reliable brand\\" like Hoover is now making such total junk. Thank you, Amazon, for having an easy and painless return policy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"i assembled the vac fine, on the 2nd use the suction stoped, i am a licensed contractor, so i am handy, trust me this steam vac stinks"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped sucking after 2 uses","review":"Worked fine 2 times, but then stopped sucking the water.

And I am very glad I did. This is a great machine. In one weekend I cleaned all the carpets in my house and was completely amazed at how much stuff it pulled out of my two-year old carpet. I think it took a total of 30 minutes to set up the cleaner out of the box. From there, using it is as simple as vacuuming your carpet. It doesn't get the carpet soaking wet- which is a good thing! And I was shocked at how much pet hair and sand it pulled out of my carpet. I highly recommend buying this to do carpet cleaning- it's really like the iPod of carpet cleaners.

Well, I recently read an article by Mary Hunt, entitled \\"The Best Thing I Ever Bought\\". As she is a financial guru and has learned the hard way not to foolishly part with even one penny of her hard earned money, I thought I'd give it a try. Mary suggests that she does not even use detergent. Instead, she spot treats where needed and fills her machine with extremely hot water. She says It works like a dream. Was she ever right. My beige carpet has returned to it's rightful color. The best part is that now I can keep the teens and pets ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the old one","review":"The suction part doesn't work.

So far the Hoover has lived up to it's reputation as the best carpet shampooer on the market for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"finally a cleaner that works!","review":"I have tried many(more expensive) carpet cleaners over the years than this little Hoover but since I have dogs the carpets need to be cleaned pretty frequently, so a reliable machine is paramount. The most expensive Bissel machine I bought didn't last a year. Why? Because it couldn't handle the dog hair, apparently, and you have to completely take it apart to unclog it - no easy task and the way it is designed you cannot clean some parts that need to be cleaned. I have used this Hoover three times already and it is fantastic - actually taking out the dirt and stains - but most importantly it can handle the dog hair it encounters! (And yes, I always vacuum first but I have real shedders). The bonus is that it is easy to clean and unclog and it's much more lightweight than those more expensive ones. I'd say Hoover has a winner with this cleaner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be amazed!","review":"You will be so amazed if you purchase this product, begin using it on your carpet and watch the dirt, hair and you name it coming up! I had a small space so I vacuumed frequently, sometimes everyday, and this thing still brought up enough junk that it looked like I had never vacuumed! It's pretty easy to use once you get down how all the pieces go together. The only thing I'm not that fond of is the way the cleaning solution comes out of the upholstery attachment (when you press the handle to push out solution it comes out significantly below the brush - hard to explain), but once I got the hang of it, it seems fine.

With the Bissel I felt I had to press down for better suction but not with this Hoover. It doesn't make a water spot if it is sitting idle for a minute. Bissel had one water tank, but this has separate tanks which is better, trust me! If your machine leaks it's because you didn't set it up correctly. Read the instructions again. It's important to lock that bar down by pushing the surge button. It's lighter, easier to move around and carry. Better, better, better. But if you need some serious stains removed, spray with cleaner, scrub with a hand scrub brush then use machine with hot water to rinse and suck. NOTE: In the instructions, this says that after you clean the floor you should rinse the whole thing using hot water. That's a lot of work to do it all again, but...maybe all cleaners recommend that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam Vac","review":"My new Hoover F5914-900 Steam Vac did an excellent job on my carpet.

Quick to set up and quick to use. It has done a better job on stains, perhaps because of the design of the scrubbing brushes. The switches are in good locations and comfortable during operation.If I found a drawback it would be I think that it could leave the carpet a little dryer. I have had it turn out great, near dry and then the next time damper than I would like. I am not sure if it was something I did or not.

We used 3 bottles of stain remover and a bottle of hydrogen peroxide as well as carpet cleaning solution. The results were amazing. Although the heavy traffic areas still showed wear, the rest of the carpet revived quite well.We took our time cleaning, letting the brush heads rotate on stained spots.

Consequently, some of his favorite marking areas were stinking up my house. After the first cleaning, I could visibly see a difference in my carpet, after the second cleaning I could smell a difference. This is definitely a good product for the price.

The only reason why I didnt give it five stars is because the was that the dirty water tank is shaped makes it a little hard to rinse out. Outside of that it does a really good job of not only cleaning the carpet, it also doesnt leave it extremely wet so the drying time is very fast.

After two years the motor burned out on the first one. I had certainly gotten my moneys worth out of the first carpet cleaner so all money has been well spent.I would recommend that you don't buy this unit soley for use on stairs because I feel this is one of the units drawbacks.Also, Hoover has shortened the cord on this item about 4' (funny how you notice these things) which could have been the problem with the motor on the first unit.

I check the tank, the suction, everything...it just does not have suction consistently. I'm just DONE with this company. I just finished soaking up the water with a towel.

I think it does a great job of cleaning. Improvements that need to be made: 1. I use boiling water for cleaning as instructed at another third party web site. The seperate attachment cleaning device has a small rubber hose that is simply locked into a nipple by friction. I think the super hot boiling water expands the tubing enough that the tube slips off the nipple and causes a huge (and very HOT) leak. I wish they would build this part with a hose clamp to hold the tubing in place. It spoiled my otherwise very pleasant cleaning experience. 2. The clean water tank and the dirty water tanks need to be larger to cut down on frequency of refilling/dumping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it!","review":"Our carpets and oriental rugs needed a good cleaning (dusty climate, pets, and time). I compared the price of professional cleaning, renting a rug doctor, and buying my own. I made the right choice. The unit is powerful and aggressive. We boil water prior to filling the reservoir. A quick one-two with a spot cleaner then the steam vac. It was amazing what the SteamVac pulled out of the rugs and carpet using hot water only. The oriental rugs, which we had always professionally cleaned were put on the deck to clean so as not to damage the wood floor. They dried quickly, colors did not run or fade. Cleaning just one rug paid for the unit! The wall to wall carpeting came out looking like new. They feel amazing with bare feet. Another bonus - my allergies are better. Biggest drawback - the very powerful motor is also rather loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Steamvac for the price","review":"As with other reviews the dirty tank does feel up faster than the clean tank empties so this means more trips back and forth to the sink.

This is an amazing machine does not leave a whole bunch of water on your carpet and it dries in no time, the cleaning capability is outstanding too! Highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ - small areas at a time","review":"There's no doubt that this is an effective carpet cleaner. I used it in a room which had previously been cleaned with my Kirby carpet-cleaning attachment, and the Hoover won hands down. The only problem with it is the tank has to be emptied very frequently (especially if you follow the directions and do one forward pass and one backward pass with the trigger squeezed). I've found that for most areas I can get by with one forward pass with the trigger squeezed and that seems to help. Of course, dirtier areas do require more than one pass. I haven't used the hand attachment yet, so I can't speak to that. And I was surprised that the unit didn't come with the bare floor tool, but I was able to pick one up at a vac supply shop for $10. All in all, a great purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great on other surfaces","review":"I have a black stove top that I always have a hard time keeping it streak-free after cleaning it; no matter what I do I always end up with a thin layer of grease film. The problem is when I use a towel, or a sponge, I need to press down to \\"squeegee\\" the liquid, but by doing so, I essentially press down the grease that was suspended by the detergent back down to the surface of the stove. With this machine (using the hand-held attachment), I can clean the stove like I normally do (with de-greaser), but instead of wiping the detergent off, I use the sprayer on the hand-held attachment to rinse off the detergent and vacuum it all up in one swoop. The result is mirror finish with no grease film whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked like a waterfall","review":"I got a defective unit and had to return it for a new one.

What I did was put hot boiled water into the fill tank.This machine cleaned my Kerman Irovy Iranian pre Komeni( sic) wool rug which cost me $6800 in 1987.I did the whole house with this machine and it pulled all the dog urine out of my carpets and sides of my tapestry chairs.All one has to do is READ the Directions and take your time.I had sent my Kerman to a professional cleaner years ago and they did not get out the stains and it cost me more then this machine. It even took 10 year old BBQ stains out of the carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of crap that works once or twice","review":"Hoover steam vacuums are junk. I bought one and it worked once. I took it for service. The service center said the company failed to attach a part that permits me to vacuum my wood floors. I took the steam vacuum home and it still does not work.This is sad because when I put too much water on my hardwood floors I ruin my floors--which I did by useing Hoover's steam vacuum. Avoid this product and the Hoover company products. Theirfloor polisher also is no good---worked 5-6 times and plastic gears inside already no good. PLASTIC GEARS! That is called planned destructions. Any company that makes the key parts out of plastic is working-over the buyer. I strongly advise people to avoid Hoover products.

I honestly can't tell a difference in quality besides the fact that the water bucket is smaller(which I actually like). For the price this cleaner pays for itself after 4 times of use. Having a baby that spits up everywhere definitely makes it hard to clean up after him but with this around at my disposal I have no issues. Great product and easy to assemble!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Far So Good!","review":"This product has really impressed me. I am not easily impressed with cleaning products but this one has done it. I read other reviews before purchasing and agree with most of the pros and cons. The steam cleaner is heavy and loud (but quite frankly, they all are). As long you work slowly with this steam cleaner I think you will get acceptable results.It seemed to pull a sandbox of dirt out of my carpets. I am hoping that this product will have a long life in this disposable society that we live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Vacuum","review":"Purchased this product after looking around and reading reviews here and elsewhere. I have to say this vacuum is a great buy. I have 3 dogs and the carpets in my home had not been steam cleaned in years so there were stains I was sure wouldn't come out. I was wrong. This machine took them out with very little effort and it looks almost like new carpet. Putting the unit together was very easy and so was changing the water and cleaning after use. Went through about 64 oz of the pet carpet cleaning solution but tha was for about 1500 sq ft of carpet. Took me a couple of hourse and there was no leakage at all. If your looking for a carpet cleaner that is affordable and does the job, I can recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Value (and some decade old irritants)","review":"This is my second basic Hoover Steamvac. The first broke after nine years. I once owned a home in which all the rooms were carpeted, I now have about 40% of the living space carpeted, and I clean my home carpets (and car carpets) two or three times a year. So I am probably a medium duty household user. I bought the second unit because I was satisfied with the first and the new model is about 25% less expensive than when I originally bought.The Good - Easy to assemble, intuitive to use, cleans well, drys well, tool to remove hair from vacuum portion is very handy.The Bad - A little heavy (but I can live with that) AND after a DECADE Hoover still has not figured out to handle the attachment hose - it is still a PITA as it can be counted on to fall off of the handle every 10 or 15 minutes when the hose is not in use.The Ugly - Same basic look after a DECADE has not aged well (but who really cares)All in all a good basic unit with some minor irritants."},{"rating":"2","title":"You don't always get what you pay for.","review":"I purchased Hoover's newer and more expensive cleaner two years ago after the one that I had just like this one died after eight years of hard use.

I used it yesterday and I am so happy to have clean rugs again. I highly recommend this cleaner.

I think it was due to the soap, although I rinsed the carpet with plain water 4 times after I used the rug doctor soap. I was searching for a good cleaner and purchased this because of the information in the customer reveiews because I was really not interested in renting the rug doctor again. This machine is easy to use. I had absolutely no problems with leaking. I did not use the soap that came with the cleaner yet. I used two scoops of Oxyclean and a cup of fabrese with the water and rinsed a couple of times and put vinager in one of the rinses. No problems whatsover. My carpets got so very clean. It extracts very well also my rugs dried fast. I am so happy that I purchased this cleaner and got such a great deal at Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright when it works.","review":"I bought mine last week, use it once and will return it this week. The problem with the machine is that it leaks so much; with or without the motor running. I called Hoover service dept and they said that I have a broken unit, told me to send it back for repair. The leaked solution thoroughly soaked my carpet and it's still damp after 2 days. I noticed that I'm not the only person with this problem.Update:Amazon promptly sent me another machine that doesn't leak. When the machine does not leak, it does a decent job of cleaning the carpet and the sofa. If I could change the star rating, I would give it a 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean Surge","review":"I normally rent a machine and clean my carpets about twice a year.I had just done so about two weeks ago.But with one senior dog and one puppy in the house accidents have become rather commonplace.So I purchased this machine for spot cleaning and \\"touch-ups\\".The build quality is fairly good.I was not expecting anything close to a rental machine.I must say after using it twice I was pleasantly surprised.It cleans very well for a machine under 200 dollars.The Tanks are rather small and if you were to use it on large areas I would be prepared to empty the tanks alot.The machine does not leave the carpet excessivly wet.Make sure the \\"Clean Surge\\" button is depressed and locked down before using the machine the first time.If you dont the solution will leak out and youll think the machine is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"no, no, no","review":"The price was great, the delivery was fast, but the cleaner was not worth it. As far as actual carpet cleaning goes it was fine, but it took me one hour to figure out how to attach the upholstery tool correctly, even after reading the instructions over and over, and when trying to put it back to carpet cleaning mode, the plastic panel that is involved, broke. The machine is made very cheaply. Too many plastic parts. The older Hoover carpet cleaner I had 8 years ago was far sturdier and made of much better materials. I think that this is a case of \\"you get what you pay for.\\" I would rather pay more money and get something solid. However, compliments to amazon.com for their truly wonderful customer service. I got back online, told them I wanted to return it, they emailed me a return address label, I packed it up, brought it to UPS, and voila! My account will be credited for the full amount and I didn't have to pay return shipping. The cleaner was not good but Amazon is terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"First use","review":"Received the carpet cleaner on the estimated delivery date, so off to a good start. Fairly easy to assemble. Then cleaned some carpet. This went well and was well satisfied with the operation. Cleaned the carpet quite well and did not leave it too wet. The unit is a little awkward to move around when the clean tank is full but not enough to detract from the positives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"We were looking for an inexpensive, easy-to-use carpet cleaner, and stumbled across this one. We are so glad we ordered it! This SteamVac does an amazing job, especially considering the price. It's been a while since our carpets were professionally cleaned, and this thing has pulled up a huge (and disgusting) amount of dirt and assorted nastiness. Even though the onboard tanks are somewhat small, and need to be dumped/refilled often, I am still giving this cleaner 5 stars because it does such a great job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This cleaner was better than I expected.

Sadly I was disappointed. On bare floor a mop works better than this product. However, on carpet- it rocks. It's much easier to use when compared to the units you rent to clean carpet- its like using a vacuum. It pulled so much dirt and dog hair out of my carpet. A great product for carpet, but skip it if you're looking for it to work on bare floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Steam Vac F5914-900","review":"First time I have ordered anything on line...I was worried. I did not need to be. I read all comments on this product before I brought it. It came in a strong box with no damage. I read the instructions very carefully. It did a beautiful job..I have two large dogs...have not cleaned carpets in a year...they look brand new. I saved $50.00 over the lowest price I found in retail. Shipping was free.

You need to pre treat the spots to remove them. The carpet dries very fast and suction is very strong.

I told them I didn't want to deal with the type of business that is going to scam by selling something full price and then sending a used product. He assured me it wouldn't happen again. So I got a different one in the mail 2 days later. Got it out and put it together only to find out it was used as well. When I called them back again there were no appologies, I just got an \\"okay just return it\\". I got a refund and will never deal with Amazon again.

I have a 17-year old basset hound who is having some 'bladder issues' and I really thought that once again Hoover would come through for me. Unfortunately, I was surprised at the quality of this Hoover product. The vacuum is very heavy. So heavy that my wife cannot carry it up the stairs. I was also very disappointed that it takes at least 2 tanks of water and formula, and at least 2 emptying of the waste tanks per room! Way too much time.I guess I got what I paid for, as the product does indeed clean the carpets. But I would strongly recommend something else if you plan on cleaning entire rooms at a regular rate. Too heavy, too much water, too many empties to get the job done. Again, as a brand loyalist, I was very surprised to find that this had the Hoover logo on it. I will choose my more carefully next time. Skip it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST THING I HAVE EVER USED!!!","review":"This cleaner is both extremely difficult to setup and to use. First you have to put it together which is extremely hard because the directions make no sense. Next when you are trying to use it the directions are also extremely hard to follow. It is by far the worst thing I have ever used. Do not buy this product, you will regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Deal Ever!!","review":"I replaced my five year old (heavily used) Hoover SteamVac that died with this model. I thought the old one was great...but, this one is even better. PLUS...I got a heck of a deal on it (like 109.00) on Amazon. With two dogs in the house, no matter how often I vacuum with my British made vacuum cleaner, a cleaning is necessary every 6 weeks or so. Although I am appalled at the disgustingness of the filthy water....there is some sort of satisfaction in doing this yourself and not paying huge amounts for the professionals to come in and do this job. Set up was easy...this model does have an additional attachment for upholstery that my previous cleaner did not have. As other reviewers have stated, on a couple of areas that were pretty dirty, I did use the shampoo, then went over it again with vinegar in the water. Best money you'll spend on cleaniing supplies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Carpet Cleaner","review":"Purchased this product 2+ years ago & have used it a handful of times since.

Great on oriental rugs.","review":"This product is very well engineered and easy to use. Our carpet was cleaner than when we had professionals clean it. Moreover, it was dryer than when the professional cleaned it. We even used it on room size and smaller oriental rugs that we have been afraid to clean. It uncovered the long lost vibrant colors. Now, getting these results takes time and patients. Go slowly and be prepared to refill the solution and empty the recovery tank often. Also buy plenty of solution.

I'm a technical writer and have written numerous instruction manuals for really complicated things but this instruction manual is the worst I've ever come across.I don't know why Hoover would design something so complicated. Really disappointed. And yes, the quality is pretty bad - cheap plastic. I'd bought a Bissell few months ago - it was great. The only reason I returned it was it didn't come with a staircase tool. I'm going back to Bissell. It was well made, I could use it right away and it cleaned very well.

After about 30 minutes of waiting, they brought me the broken shampooer and informed me that Sears is not repairing Hoovers anymore, even if I purchased this unit in Sears and it was still under warranty. I took it to local vacuum cleaner store and told them my dilemma.

It took over 45 minutes to put together and worked for all of 10 minutes before the handle release mechanism cracked off in the mody of the machine. There are almost no metal parts to this except the bolts that hold the handle on. It was poorly packaged by the manufacturer and then shipped in the original box by Amazon allowing for damage. I suspect the housing of the machine was cracked before I ever started using it. The handle wouldn't stay up very tightly and if the handle doesn't stay in place the machine doesn't work right.

I explained I will nto buy their product again and instead buy Bissel and the supervisor was OK with that.This is not a company I will do business with in the future. I was extremely polite and professional in dealing with them and they clearly do not care about retaining a Customer. I will spend my money elsewhere.

I'm sure this is a good product if you actually get one that works, but unfortunately it was nothing but a waste of time and money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"good machine at a good price","review":"Bought this after we got a second puppy. Cleaned up the stains better than the rental unit we rented a month earlier. Amazing how dirty the water is when you dump it. The hand brush attachment is great for stairs and spot stains. Assembly was reasonably simple. Name is a little mis-leading as it does not produce steam but hot water mixed with the solution plus the brushes cleans very well. $135.00 price on amazon is cost of 2 rentals and less hiring pros. It is actually kind of fun to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design","review":"Terrible!!! My wife and I spent an entire morning trying to get the handle trigger mechanism to work. This is a major design flaw. When we finally though we had it right and put water in the machine, it poured out all over the floor which we then had to mop up. The only good thing we can say is that Amazon was very efficient in their return process. We would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not fabulous","review":"It cleans fine, and leaves carpets relatively dry afterwards which speeds up drying time. On the negative side, it didn't do as great a job on high traffic areas or \\"fluff\\" up imprints left by sofa legs and other heavy items as well as I would have liked. Overall I like the steam cleaner but it is not the answer to all rug stains. Also, unlike other machines, it mixes the soap directly in the chamber with the water so that you can never \\"wash\\" then \\"rinse\\" an area without first dumping out the soapy water and going over the rug with clean water in the chamber for a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good customer service from Hoover","review":"Recieved product and end of hose was cracked.

The once so easy to use stair/upholstery assembly tool, replaced with a multi-step, time consuming set up.

I was impressed by the quickness of delivery. When putting it together, I followed the instructions/suggestions of a reviewer and had no problems at all. It's not a professional machine so I didn't expect professional cleaning results but I was amazed at how well it did. The best thing about owning a steam cleaner is I don't have to block out a day to rent one so I can clean all my rooms on the same day. I just pull it out, clean one room each week. When all the rooms have been cleaned, I start over. That is so great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"This is a very good machine, standard stains come right up, the heavy duty stuff, you may have to do it a few times, the only inconvenience with it would be that the dirty water tank is more small than the clean water/solution tank, but for the performance and price, you can not beat it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many plastic parts","review":"This rug cleaner broke in assembly.

Once I got it together, it was actually fun to use...because it really works! My Manhattan apartment is fully carpeted, and the rugs were looking tired and dull. When I used the SteamVac, I found out why...the water in the discharge was BLACK. All that dirt was in my carpet! I paid about $145 and I'm not sorry. I went back and forth several times after cleaning to pull out as much moisture from the carpet as possible, and it dried in about three hours. Now if only appliance manufacturers could concentrate on reducing the decibels."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great Hoover Steam cleaner.","review":"The Hoover SteamVac with cleansurge is the best steam cleaner I have ever used. I owned another brand, and when I went over the rugs with the Hoover it was amazing how much better the rugs looked and how clean they were, even sections that had been cleaned with the other cleaner. The simplicity of the machine is also wonderful, the other machine was so complicated that when something went wrong with it there was no way that we could fix it ourselves. I love this Hoover F5814-900 and just couldn't do without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Carpet Cleaner EVER!","review":"I originally used this when my mother-in-law loaned hers to me, and I was so impressed I had to buy one of my own. It gets it all--even ground-in dirt and pet stains. The best part is, after two uses it pays for itself! Now we don't have to replace our carpet. I will never call another carpet cleaning service again. I use a little oxyclean dissolved in hot water in a spray bottle on the really bad stains and let that soak in for about 5 minutes before using the SteamVac on them--works like a dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the money","review":"Before we bought this cleaner we were going to have our carpets professionally done. After weighing the amount of money, the convienience of having our own cleaner, and reading the reviews, we decided to go with a Hoover and this one was hands down the best deal. We have used it clean to large rooms and a set of stairs and have been pleased so far. Some old stains came up very easily, while others did not, but we weren't expecting a miracle. Overall we have been happy with our purchase, I gave it 4 stars because it still is just not quite as good as professional, but it is still definitely worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steam Vac","review":"The Carpet cleaner works great but even more immpresive was the sevice from Amazon.

We've used it several times so far and no problems. It is a workable size and easy cleanup. We are extremely happy with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase","review":"After reading many reviews on this product, I can report that it performed as expected, and much better than the previous steam-vac that I owned. Although I don't seem to see the point of the Clean Surge feature, the brushes do a great job of getting the carpet clean and the powerful motor does leave the carpet nearly dry, if you go over it 2 or 3 times. It removed several stains that the old steam-vac could not remove. I did read the directions for assembly and did consult the trouble shooting guide to solve a function problem. The downside of this item is that the reservoir is a bit small and has to be emptied more frequently than my old machine. Further, if you don't get this tank seated just right, with all pieces in place, it will not operate. Overall, a good purchase for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover SteamVac","review":"I recently purchased the SteamVac and used it once and was very pleased with the result.

It's a bit of a hassle to use, clean and store, and I landed up giving it away after only having used it a few times (although I've actually had it since 2005). If you're going to use it a lot, then it may be a good buy for you, but for someone who had the best intentions when buying this cleaner, it landed up being a bit of a waste of money for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't praise enough!!!","review":"PROS: If you are a pet owner, this product is a must!!!

Hoover SteamVac was easy to assemble and use. Price was not too bad, so took a chance on this model. Unit was not too heavy, about 25lbs (more or less) moved over the carpet easy enough. Nice to see the water coming up and into the holding tank so you could see where it was wet and where you needed to vacuum. Did a nice job cleaning.Could just be a physiological thing, but it does feel like the carpets are cleaner and looks new. Did a two step process of using the cleaning solution, then going back over it an hour later (once it dried) with just a water solution. So yes, it can be a timely process, but I put the whole day aside to do the cleaning so I was prepared. I can't really compare this unit to others being that this is my first one I've ever had and used.All in all very happy with it and hope it will last for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover F5914-900","review":"Great machine, cleans well.

I think it did a very good job cleaning my carpet....they were filthy and they are beautiful now. It does take a little time to get some spots out. If you just keep going over the spot very slow it will come out. The only reason I'm not giving this a 5 star is because the water tank fills up very very quick. I had to stop literally every 5-10 minutes to empty the dirty tank and refill the clean tank. That makes it quite annoying when trying to get through your entire house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I've had this for about a month.

The whole machine is cheaply made and it isn't hard to see that it will not last beyond a few uses.

I have a very active home with two large dogs and two boys running constantly and so when my Bissel bit the dust so to speak, I had to have a replacement. So far I have used this on 3 rooms and so far I have been very pleased. The number one reason I would recommend the Hoover over a Bissel is the fact that it has two separate water chambers. If for no other reason, use the Hoover as this makes discarding the dirty water and filling the clean water so much easier and less messy because of the two separate chambers. The only reason I gave it a 4 star review is because it does not have a rince option because you mix the detergent directly into the clean water resevour. You still can preform a rinse by adding only clean water and leaving out your detergent, but it is not an option while you are cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly great.","review":"This SteamVac carpet cleaner from Hoover was a great investment.

So when I needed to replace the Bissell (I gave it to a relative), I replaced it with this Hoover. I haven't had any leaking problems and it was easy to put together. I wish it included a place to hook the cord to the handle while you're using it; that way you wouldn't have to hold it to keep it out of the way of the wheels. Still I'm happy with my purchase so far.Update 9/17/2012: The Hoover is still going strong and is used regularly. Would still highly recommend.Update 11/16/12: Well...we just had to bring the Hoover in for service. The brushes stopped spinning.

Cleaning carpet is a nightmare and even if you think they are clean, think again.I read several online reviews about carpet cleaners and zeroed in upon the Hoover Steamvac. This machine has the required power suction and does a excellent job. It is even easy to handle the machine (you might take few sessions to learn the trick though). But there are some imp cons, small water tank, loud motor noise and low qlty plastic body. But for the price of $150 you cant get the best of both worlds.

It took the maintenance shop 3 MONTHS to get a new tank from Hoover. I used it right after I got it back from the repair shop. Once again, it stopped working! It stopped sucking up the water in the carpet. So here I was once again with soaked carpet. I went to my local hardware store and rented a Rug Doctor. It did a fine job. It's built to last.

We chose to replace it with a Hoover SteamVac F5914-900. Item arrived in good order and wasn't too complicated to assemble. I'd planned on cleaning all the carpeting but quickly noticed that the water suction was a bit disappointing and therefore could only finish half, continuing the next day after the first half had dried . The carpet was being left, even after several passes, considerably damper than I was used to with my old Bissell. Today I cleaned a couch and chairs, same problem. What a shame because I otherwise like the cleaning power. Fortunately we live in a dry and mostly warm/hot part of the country so this drawback isn't major but for someone in a more humid area it could be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says it does!","review":"Purchased this along with the hoover platinum pet plus solution to steam our carpets. We have Jack Russell Terriers that occasionally have accidents in the house, & this steam cleaner works great to clean up their pee. One comment I do have, unrelated to the steamer itself, is that the hoover platinum pet plus cleaning solution does not work as well as a homemade mixture of hydrogen peroxide, baking soda & hand soap (a recipe can be found with a simple Google search). The homemade mixture leaves absolutely no smell whatsoever & spots tend to resurface less than with the hoover platinum pet plus solution.

Bissell does a better job on the outside, but does not clean as deep as Hoover and rotates same water over and over again. Hoover stops working after it runs out of clean hot water.

The local dealer was horrible since he said it must have been dropped or something like that for it to break. He said he does not think that it is a manufacturing defect. I said \\"seriously, can you try lifting this thing up, it is so damn heavy, how can I drop it?\\". I spoke with Hoover customer service they conveniently hid behind the service guy and said they will have to go by what he says.

I have used it twice, cleaning a light-colored carpet in five rooms. It performed well, leaving the carpet noticeably cleaner. Although it won't remove old stains, it does remove most spots and the dirt from normal foot traffic. It also does a good job of removing most of the water, so that the carpet can dry in just a few hours. But don't rush it - this is a much slower process than using a vacuum cleaner. Also, don't overuse the \\"surge\\" feature - it really uses up the cleaning water solution quickly!

It was easy to put together and use. It is a little heavy but at least it is sturdy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cleaner","review":"I just love this cleaner .

I think you will love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"Very easy to use and change water. Would have liked to know that it does not come with the bare floor attachment nor is there any steam. But if you use very hot water, the carpets do come out nice and clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blowed Away!","review":"I would recommend this product to everyone.

My carpet was I'm ashamed to say quite dirty and it did the job effortlessly. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is essentially a \\"Me, too!\\" review to all the others that rated this item 5 stars. Enough has been said already.

I used Kenmore Pet formula with Natures Miracle added."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, Works Great","review":"This is a wonderful value and really cleans up a storm! Plus I got free shipping!!! With six dogs I needed something that really deep cleans. This one does the trick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Hoover Toy","review":"Short cord, very small soap and collector tanks. Constant emptying and filling. You can clean only one portion of a standard room. Good for miniature apartments. Flimsy plastic. Will it last another year? But it wasn't defective. And it didn't break upon the first use. That's good but quite a statement about today's products. More toy-like than commercial-like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover SteamVac","review":"Well it is very cheaply made, not sure how long it will last. The main thing I don't like is that the soap is mixed in with the water. So you have to empty the tank and put clean water in go over the area to rinse out the cleaning mixture.This just makes the carpet wetter."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Steam!","review":"Don't be fooled by the name. This cleaner does NOT produce any steam. In addition, if you want to clean bare floors you must buy a blare floor attachment that you can only find out about by reading the manual. Difficult to put together, noisy and heavy. I hate it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Can you carry a gallon of milk ???","review":"I can't believe how many people say that to fill or empty the reservoir it is too heavy. Come on, can you carry a gallon of milk ? If not maybe you aught to think of working out a little. NOT HEAVY AT ALL. Only reason not rated as 5 is I think the bristles are not stiff enough to give a good scrubbing."},{"rating":"2","title":"deep cleaning!","review":"I have rented carpet steam cleaners in the past and was always delighted & disgusted in equal measure. Disgusted by the dirtiness of the water & delighted to think I was getting my carpets so clean. I hesitated to buy a consumer model, but the Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac's results made me happy I made the leap.The assembly was not difficult & I know I will be saving money soon as I will now steam clean quarterly. The water was just as black (gross!) and my whole house smelled better. I have wool area rugs and give the Hoover 5 stars for my results. For any pet owners, this is a must-have!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've been using this basic model for years","review":"Got this basic model years ago. It finally broke, the plastic breaks eventually. I got another which finally broke. So I searched Amazon for the cheapest highest rated Carpet cleaner. This was #2 and 1/4 the price of #1. Its the same cleaner. There have been a couple updates over the years, but this same model has been around for at least 10 years, probably more like 15. Amazing. It still works, it's the right price. I got free 2nd day shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked Great for me. Good Price","review":"This machine works great for me. I only plan on using it a few times a year, so I didn't want to spend a ton of money on a machine. I am sure there are better machines out there, but for quite a bit more money.I felt like it did a really good job getting the carpets clean and fresh in our house. I did use the recommend Hoover brand soap with it.I really like the fact that there are two seperate tanks for clean and dirty water. It makes it really easy to clean the dirt and grime out of the dirty section. I have used the machine a few times already and have not had any problems with clogging.I recommend setting the machine on a hard floor or a towel when you are first finished with it. It tends to drip out a bit of water when sitting for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Steam Cleaner","review":"I love this cleaner. It works as well as the units I've rented in the past but is smaller and lighter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paid for itself the first time","review":"This product cleaned as well as the last company that cleaned my carpets. I haven't used the attachments yet, but was quite pleased with the cleaning capability on carpet. It performed amazingly well with some set in stains (cat vomit) that were several months old. The machine removes water quite well which makes the carpet dry quickly. I used the recommended Hoover cleaning solution and do not detect any residue in the carpet. I followed the instructions for rinsing the carpet as well. The little tool used for pulling lint out of the suction device isn't particularly helpful, but the scrub brushes come out nicely for cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"great purchase","review":"I purchased this from reading other customer reviews and the good pricing. I have 2 dogs, one of which has stomach issues which left many stains on my beige carpeting. I always spot clean but some stains would not come out. This machine removed the stains and left the carpeting in great condition. My son put it together for me but he had no trouble and there was no leaking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth money","review":"This is the first product i have bought from Amazon that i am dissatisfied with. You constantly have to stop to empty the dirty water and the clean water and solution that you do the cleaning runs out entirely to fast, literally after a couple minutes. After a few empties, my machine failed to dispense the solution so i could continue. Terrible"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't live up to expectations.","review":"Unfortunately, this was not the product I hoped for. The assembly was more complicated than I anticipated. Small pictures made it difficult for me to interpret the instructions. Larger, clearer pictures would have been a huge help and saved me a lot of trial and error.Once assembled, the unit did not work correctly. No water was going into the lower tank. Could I have made a mistake in the assembly? Sure. But I sure couldn't figure out what I did wrong.I was really looking forward to using this product. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brushes don't spin, right out of box.","review":"Right out of the box the brushes didn't spin, possibly due to a broken turbine, which according to customer service could be due to something happening during shipping. Apparently the turbines are 'very fragile'. Because we messed around trying new things rather than immediatly returning it, we missed the 30 day replacement window and so can not return it to amazon. Now the only thing to do is send it to a service center which will take ~4-6 weeks just for 'evaluation' before they even go about fixing it. I should have trusted the unfavorable reviews from folks with similar issues. I read them but hoped i wouldn't be one of the unlucky ones. booo. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"Bought this after our old dirt devil was broken by someone else. Works good. Only issue is cleaning front part. We have a large dog and the hair gets stuck in there pretty good. It would be nice if they had a spot on the machine to store the cleaning tool also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cleaner","review":"Very easy to use and quick. I had borrowed one of these steam cleaners before but since the price was less than $150 I decided it was easier just to buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all around product","review":"no complaints so far. I have used the item about a dozen or so times in the last 6 months without issue.Like anything, read the instructions, understand them and have patience when you are exploring your new item.I have had zero issue with the item so far.

Looked into replacing brush unit, or belt, but is non-serviceable (can easily pop brushes out but the part that causes brushes to spin is no longer turning).All else worked like a champ.

I was doubtful that a vacuum at this price could actually provide quality cleaning. I was wrong. I haven't had it too long, but it picks up just about anything on both thick carpet and tile floor. My husband is allergic to dust-mites, which is the reason we bought this vacuum. It actually seems to be helping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as expected","review":"I have only used this once, but it worked as expected. My husband put it together with ease. The only comment I will make is that you must have the lid on the dirty water container correctly or it will not suck up water. It simply must be latched appropriately. The cleaner is not terribly heavy, so I had no problem pushing/pulling it, even though I have a bad shoulder. I am happy with the quality of clean it provides and the ease of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great dog muddy footprint cleaner","review":"Hoover F5914-900 SteamVac with Clean SurgeI just bought this the other week and I Love it! I have a 10 month old husky puppy who gets mud stuck between his nails and tracks it all over. This machine does a great job of cleaning the carpet. I was very pleased with it. It also dries far quicker than using the rug doctor rental. This is definitely a worthwhile purchase. I bought at a retail store, wished I would have checked Amazon first, I would have saved some money.If when you first use it, you don't see water being sucked up from the carpet, take the two tanks out and put them back in, you may have put it together wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will never buy another hoover","review":"Bought a steam cleaner and a vacuum cleaner (both hoover) about 10 months ago. Steam cleaner Worked well until now and then broke; given that i've used it for just about 4 times in the past 10 months, i would say hoover makes some of the most un-reliable machines around.And the Vacuum cleaner never had any pressure to begin with; i just got lazy to return it.. would have returned both if i knew the steam cleaner would also fail in just a few months."},{"rating":"1","title":"Steam?????","review":"The name of this product is very misleading. The only way that I get water even close to warm is to microwave my water before putting it in the canister. Unfortunately I looked only at the graph showing the review stars and did not read the reviews. Also, the machine is touted as doing hard floor services as well as carpets. I bought the \\"steam\\" vac in order to steam clean my tiled floors and find that I have to purchase a hard floor attachment in order to do this. I'm searching Amazon right now for that attachment, but have given up and am writing this review since I cannot find the attachment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT! All the reviews I have read seem to agree with my experiences. When it works, it really cleans the carpets. Unfortunately this design is horribly flawed and poorly constructed that it will not last. The hand-tool is an absolute disaster unless you enjoy spraying a yard-sale of soapy water and then watching your scrub brushes (driven by an air motor) chug at 5 rpm over the area. The vac itself was difficult to clean and maintain, and the air motor driving the scrub brushes conked out on mine at the 2 year mark. The nearest service center is about 5 light-years away and I can only imagine what it will cost to insert another shoddy part into the machine to give me another 2 years out of it. Use a rental next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I have owned numerous predecesors of the Hoover SteamVac and have always been pleased. The last one lived a ripe old age but finally gave up the ghost. I immediately purchased the new model from Amazon. While putting it together I noticed the plastic ridges on the handle were very, very sharp. Well, what the heck, I'll take a file and file it down so I can hold onto it. I did file it but still it has sharp edges. Finally, two days ago, I decided to actually use it and clean my carpet. I have never said so many nasty words in one day in my life. The dirty water receiver is EXACTLY like in my former machine BUT on the new machine it is soooo difficult to get it to latch correctly so you can pick up the dirty water. I thought I had it latched correctly, would put it back on, try to pick up water and have to start all over again. Usually cleaning my carpet takes an hour. This machine doubled my time by the time I spent fighting with the dirty water receiver. I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money on this machine!","review":"I bought this machine about a month ago and actually liked it a lot at the time. Then this past week I took it out to clean a spot up and the machine was leaking all over the place while using it and the hose attachment wouldn't work at all and just poured water out of the bottom of the machine all over the floor, so I returned it back to Amazon. So then just figuring it was a fluke defect with that machine I ordered another one of the same machine and got it yesterday and it is broken out of the box and have to send it back again. I am extremely disappointed and will not be ordering another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"G-R-E-A-T Carpet Cleaner!","review":"After reading Consumer Reports' recommendation of this brand and model, we purchased this unit to use on a home with carpets that looked like they needed replacement.

We bought the cleaner to help with our pet stains. Will need to spot clean pop and food stains from my family. My 15 year-old high traffic carpeting looked like new after we used the cleaner.

Looks new!! Also have cleaned my kitchen/family room which was almost as dirty as the office. Loved how the carpet was almost immediately dry. Didn't have to use fans to hurry the drying process. When I used a professional service the floor was still damp the next day. I would recommend this machine to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"Pieces are made cheaply!! I used this product one time and center spinning brush on the 5 brush block broke. All of these brushes must work properly for any of them to work, and this is the main scrubbing piece of the upright machine.BRUSHES ARE NOT COVERED BY WARRANTY!!!It's about $30 to replace that piece alone.More cons.. I don't like how the hose attachment connects. There's a lot of leaking, it's a mess to switch over, and it's just not a good system for switching between upright and hose.The pros in my case.. I do like how the carpet felt pretty dry after cleaning, the stair cleaning brush attachment/hose works pretty well.And Hoover does have really great customer service.All in all, I would have chosen a different product for the price. And I would have purchased at a local store where returns would have been easier with such a quick break on a main piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving my new appliance...

I have cleaned every room in my house and it did a great job- lots of black water which is so gross. There were tough statins that I sprayed with a water/vinegar solution and that helped.

What I did not expect was to find out the weight of the machine relies on a very small piece of plastic to disengage the foot locking peddle. The second time that I used mySteamVac the weight of the machine snapped off the plastic stop that is part of the body of the unit. Hoover asked for a photograph which was provided and they said they would not honor that broken part as part of the warranty. They gave me a phone number to contact an outside repair facility to purchase a new main body for the cleaner. The part is not available on the Hoover web site. The weight of the machine when it is loaded with the liquid cleaner is considerably more than the part that locks the handle in the upright position. Bottom line be VERY carful when you use the cleaner so as not to put pressure on that small part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Pretty Well","review":"Don't expect miracles from this machine but do expect your carpets to look a LOT better than they did before you used this machine. Fairly easy to assemble and definitely easy to use. Carpets hadn't been cleaned (except for the normal vacuuming) in a little over two years...very pleasantly surprised with the outcome.On another note, there are quite a few reviews about Amazon selling obviously used and returned machines...my machine was definitely a returned item. It still worked perfectly but I wasn't very happy that I paid for a new machine and received a returned one...so beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Steam Cleaner","review":"Exceeded my expectations!

But mine was not related to priming the surge button, installation or anything simple like that.Mine had a crack in the reservoir regulator and that had to be replaced.Beyond that being an unreasonable hassle on a brand new machine, the closest Hoover Service Center is 45 miles away so instead of making two trips there I had to choose to pay my local repair shop to diagnose the problem and repair it. So that cost me an extra $28 AND I did not have my steam cleaner for 2-3 weeks right after I bought it.Hoover needs better quality control and more service centers.A new machine should not have a crack in it, and a new machine should not leak profusely the first time you use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"misnamed","review":"it does not use steam so i sent it back. should be illegal to give something a name that it doesn't do. probably a good carpet cleaner but we already have one. i would also like to commend amazon for the ease of sending the item back and subsequent credit on my credit card. thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Bought this to clean off-white carpeting.

It was easy to assemble and works like a charm. It cleans much better than the old Thermax I had for 18 years. The only draw back (and there are always pros and cons) is the small tank which requires dumping and re-filling of the solution tank. But if you do them at the same time it is less trips to the tub. I was pleased with the hose attachment for the stairs as well. This is a good product and I hope it lasts me as long as my other one.

You can use less cleaning detergent if the water is very very hot."},{"rating":"2","title":"950 Sq Ft apartment; 2 people; Light Carpet; 1 dog","review":"Cleaner works very well. I was skeptical because of the cost, but it has proven to be one of the better household purchases I've made in the last year. The size is just about right, not enormous but not dainty, and I've had no trouble with the weight or maneuvering it around. I did experience the same suction problem other people have mentioned in reviews, but like those were as a result of not securing the used water tank properly and is always a simple fix. Not a big fan of the hose extension (there is too far of a gap between the water dispenser and suction to effortlessly do stairs), but the actual machine and results are pretty amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pays for itself","review":"Unfortunately, I got a lot of light rugs where I live so the rugs really show a lot of dirt.I used to pay someone to come in and do it and some cleaning companies get themselves in the door at a competiitve price and then try to upcharge you saying that it is too dirty for the advertised price.I got sick of dealing with that and bought this cleaner.It works almost as well as the pro's but takes a bit longer but that is okay, I still am happy to save the money and it will pay for itself over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased!","review":"We've done two rooms now with this steam cleaner.

My unit does not leak at all. It took about 10 mins to assemble, then off I went. Pre-treat obvious stains and spots first, cleaners like this one do a \\"general\\" cleansing and are not designed to remove spots. The ability to clean is obvious when you empty the waste water tank ... yuch, mine was brown and dirty, and i am a clean person. I did it a second time a few days later and the water was a light brown, not near as dirty. The unit also pulls most of the water out of the rug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I owned this product for 6 months when it stopped working.

After calling Hoover, I sent it in to be fixed and they ended up giving me a brand new machine!

Then I bought this model because Hoover is so highly rated and my experience with the more expensive model. This one lasted 8 months and suddenly the suction stopped and it is leaking every where. I cannot figure out what is wrong to fix it and I am not driving 50 plus miles to have it looked at. I am throwing it out. I have researched this model since and it has tons of high ratings but the low ratings are almost all the same problem - the suction suddenly stops and it leaks.I have no idea what I am going to do - buy another Hoover or switch to Bissel. I am very disappointed with this shampooer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cleaning power","review":"I bought this carpet cleaner to replace and older one. I really like the \\"scrubbing\\" feature.

Cleans very well and satisfied with its performance. The rotating brush works very well. However, this is a SteamVac, right? No steam comes out of the cleaner. That's weird.... but it cleans just the same. Add hot water to the reservoir. The cleaning solution works well too, buy Hoover cleaning solution only because it seems to clean better than other leading or generic brands. I'd put 1 part of the cleaning solution to 3 parts of hot water to clean heavy traffic areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!","review":"I have two big indoor/outdoor dogs and a house full off-white carpet.

It works great!!! Better than I ever thought possible for a home unit.

Does the same thing as a Rug Doctor, but a hundred times more pleasant to use! Lighter weight. Goes under tables the Rug Doctor was too big for. Cleans without leaving the carpet too soggy. You have to dump the dirty water and add more solution rather frequently (but this is true with every shampooer I considered), but removing the tanks and replacing them is a cinch. There are two indicators that the bottom tank is full: motor gets noticeably higher pitched and the big yellow button is supposed to pop up. I have never seen it pop up, because I immediately turn it off when I hear the motor change. So maybe I just don't wait long enough for it to pop up? Definitely not a problem, just an issue. Our old carpet looks the best it has in years. Did a great job on all the barf stains from one of our three indoor cats.

To me, this is an album lovers album. The sum of the parts seem stronger than the individual pieces until you have listened to each song a million times. \\"Cry Little Sister\\" is a classic, even though I have no idea who sings it.

This makes it extremely confusing to figure out where to find the monument, museum, etc. that you're trying to visit.Also, the index at the back is completely useless. Some places are entered in French alphabetical order and some in English. A lot of places don't even appear in the index at all.

I was happy with it for a little while, but then it lost most of it's suction. It worked properly for less than a year.I can still use it, but the posture necessary to make it work is very uncomfortable. It seems the suction is being lost through the area around the handle for the collection bucket. If I bend to hold my hand over this area while vacuuming, then it still works ok.At the time I bought this, it was a new item and had several great reviews. Now I see that the low rating reviews here are complaining of similar issues as the problems I've had.I eventually got a very old used dirt devil that works much better than this item. I suggest that you don't waste your money on this machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase, keep shopping...","review":"I bought this vacuum almost 2 years ago, when we moved into a new house. It seemed to work great and did, at first. I borrowed my in-laws vacuum to see how theirs did and was disgusted by what my vacuum had left behind.

Then it stopped sucking anything up. Am currently in the process of trying to get it repaired but there are very few repair places around.If I had known what this vacuum was like I would not have purchased it. Buy a nicer vacuum; I am regretting not paying a little bit more for a much better quality vacuum. I used to be a big Hoover fan but I will never buy another Hoover vacuum again."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"When it arrived, I took it out of the box, pulled up the handle, plugged it in, and it loves to vacuum. It is not a noisy machine. What I appreciate about it, is the fact it is bagless. It has the filter, and just a nice machine. The only little draw back is, the placement of the hose into the body. There is a cap that swings in, than you place the hose into its cavity. If that is the only draw back, that is very very minor. The price is right, and just perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Noisy!!!!","review":"We bought this unit to replace a twenty year old Eureka that had finally said enough. The fold down handle and 15\\" wide sweep sold us.When we got it home it turned out to be the wrong one for us. The vacuum as a whole works great. Plenty of suction, sturdy construction, and a large enough canister for the small area we have. But does it scream? You bet. Very, very loud. I have a 16g shop vac that is half as loud.We returned the unit the next day and tested 5 other units in the store. We ended up settling on the EMPower unit. Essentially the same unit but with some motor controls that reduces the volume of the unit by about 1/2. I also noticed the housing was insulated and the previous unit was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover is Horrible","review":"My recent letter to Hoover~I am trying to find out why my warranty repairs are taking so long. The motor on my Fold-Away Upright burned out after only 8 mos. I took it to the hoover service center 3 weeks ago. They say they ordered the parts the next day and have still not receied them. Has there been a rash of burned out motors and you just cant produce them as quickly as they go bad? The motor should have lasted signifacantly longer to begin with and now you are failing to honor your warranty in a timely manner. When this second motor burns out 8 mos. from now I dont believe I'll be purchasing another Hoover to replace it. However I still woul like to have my original vacuum back before the warranty expires, so hopefully somebody down there could wrap up a motor and put a stamp on it in the not too distant future.The motor burned up after 8 months of normal household cleaning, I hardly even used the hose and I only have 3 rooms that have carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the vacuum I hoped for","review":"I recently purchased this vacuum cleaner since it was fold away. I also liked the idea that it was bagless. I noticed the first time I used it that I was vacuuming the same spot over and over to get it clean. It wasn't picking up the minor stuff (i.e. lent), much less anything else. I tried cleaning the filter and everything else the manual recommends to improve suction. Nothing worked! I am now shopping for a new vacuum since this one is terrible. If you want a vacuum that sucks in a good way, this isn't the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST VACUUM EVER - DOESN'T EVEN DESERVE 1 STAR!","review":"DON'T BUY IT.The only good feature about this \\"thing\\" is the fold down handle ...

It clogs, whatever it vacuums is spit out through the back of it, the hose nozzle constantly slips off and it just does not do a good job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor vacuum","review":"I purchased this vacuum based on some reviews I had read here. My experience after owning this about a year is that it's a very poor vacuum.

I think this one'll head to the Goodwill Store before too long."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I asked for this vacuum on our wedding registry almost 2 years ago and I really regret it. I loved the idea of a bagless vacuum with a fold down handle, but don't let appearances fool you! I have 2 cats and an average amount of dust and dirt. I have to go over the same area several times and often have to resort to picking up the hair and lint. I empty the canister and shake out the filter after each use (this process is very messy, by the way). However, even with this constant upkeep, it's still not a great vacuum. The most irritating thing is that the hose comes off constantly when you vacuum. I vacuum often because I just don't feel that it cleans well. I have a baby coming and I am considering investing in something better. My old cheaper vacuum was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, Weak, Cheaply Made","review":"My work replaced a commercial vacuum with this junker. Pickup has always been weak (even when it was new). Emptying is an inconvenient mess. (Removing the dust cup usually gets dust all over.)

Stay far away from this bagless junk, unless you enjoy choking on dust when it comes time to empty it.UPDATE: Even though this unit was only about 3 years old and was only used once a week to clean an area that is not real big, it just completely died. No power at all. There was a burning smell coming from the power switch, as well as noises that sounded like sparks arcing. What a piece of crap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Widepath Fold-Away Bagless Vacuum","review":"Excellent product. Really picks up from carpets and floors. The bagless container is easy to empty.

So I tried the Conair Massager and another brand. This massager has no power and is no comparison to the Wahl-7-in-1.

The massager that we had previously was very similar in appearance to this Conair, but as it turns out, significantly more powerful. Unfortunately the old one was thrown out without verifying the brand name or model number, so we were replacing it without that information. This Conair massager is very inadequate for my wife and doesn't get the job done, even on the higher setting. She is fairly sensitive and hasn't been able to tolerate stronger settings on some toys we have tried over the years. It's a good thing this was inexpensive, because it was a complete waste of money. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly get any benefit from it for sore muscles or other therapeutic uses when it can't even provide adequate sensations in the most sensitive of spots!

The lights lit up for about one second when I plugged it in, and then they were dead for good. Note that the lights have no switch -- the only way to turn the lighted mirror on and off is to unplug it, and that's if it actually works. Which it doesn't. The include replacement bulbs, but as ALL of the lights were dead, that was not the problem. Furthermore, there weren't nearly enough bulbs to replace the entire thing. Moreover, if you try to remove the case to change a bulb, using a coin as the directions tell you, you basically destroy the case, which is made of soft plastic that scratches and bends immediately.

Although it is very wordy and repetitive there is very little substance to the book.Has sold well over the years because of its title which is the hook, the promise of a supremely abundant life, which is another way of expressing greed at any cost.

Once I moved the power switch on the back it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"I purchased the Cyber Acoustics Docking Speakers based on the reviews by others. I just received it (within 2 days of ordering), plugged it in and popped in the Ipod Classic. It works great. It actually has a nice sound for what it is. I'm very impressed. Don't expect to crank this and blow out your neighbors, but if you want to listen music in a room or two or three, then this is exactly what you want. For the money, it is an excellent deal. I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for an office","review":"Speakers are compact and provide quality sound in an office or large room. Very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but Powerful","review":"Unit comes in small size compared to those with 6 inch speaker panels, but if you aren't trying to fill up your whole house, this unit does just great.It's straight forward and simple to operate--just the way things ought to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Boom for such a small thing...","review":"I knew I wanted a iPod sycn for a charger that would act like a boom box. When I first got this I thought it would be kind of quiet. So happens it has a loud hit to it, and charges great! Faster than hooking it up to my laptop that I have. I use it as my alarm clock also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"Awesome sound and convenience, especially for $36! My only complaint is that I kinda have to jimmy around my iPod (Touch) to get it to connect properly. I installed the correct insert - guess it just takes a bit of a special touch to make sure the connection is right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this....","review":"but after sending back the first one for a buzz in the speaker, my second one has the same thing!!! Unusable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I was looking for an inexpensive stereo dock so I could listen to my iPod Nano at work. I took a chance on this model and I'm really pleased. When I first docked my iPod and played some music through the speakers, I couldn't believe that full sound was coming from such a small stereo. The mid-range is clear, the highs are crisp and the low-end is surprisingly rich and detailed (you can hear the bass line and kick drum of a rock song perfectly, and it even has a little punch to it.)I did notice some minor distortion in the bass frequencies at medium to high volumes, but only in certain parts of a few songs. I reduced the bass slightly in the EQ section of the iPod and now it sounds great even at higher volume. This would be my one complaint, but it's minor and was easy enough to work around, so the unit still gets five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect in every way!!!!","review":"You have to love getting something that is perfect in every way, especially when you didn't pay much for it!As soon as I opened the box I noticed the excellent quality of the unit. It's finish ( Not afraid to let people see it), its sound (Very rich and room filling, especially for it's size), ease of use ( couldn't be any simpler) it is way nicer than you would expect for the price. Also, I rarely fill these surveys out but this product is over-the-top perfect - so I had to say something. Hope you love yours like I love mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"no pause/play button - off/on button does not control iPod","review":"It never occurred to me that anyone would make and iPod player without a pause/play button, or one where the off/on switch controls the amplifier but not the iPod. This player is unsatisfactory for listening to audiobooks because you can't stop to answer the phone without losing your place in the book. In my opinion, it's unsatisfactory for music because the bass is pumped up too much and can't be adjusted."},{"rating":"1","title":"short life","review":"It was an excellent docking speaker. After a month, it started to add some static and then quit. Cheap but unreliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work Right Out of the Box","review":"Was quite excited to have a speaker dock for my iPod. Opened up the box, plugged it in, plugged in the iPod. Music started playing...filled the room...sounded great. 5 minutes later all I could hear was an intermittent buzz/beep. Unplugged everything, took the iPod off. Plugged it back in and even without the iPod in the dock it was making the same noise. Don't get me wrong, I understand that sometimes things are just defective but I'm reviewing my experience with the product and it was bad. I sent it back and dug out my old computer speakers which work great as iPod speakers, and they didn't cost me anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat cheap and meager...","review":"Bought them because they were cheap, and had a lot of positive feedback, but haven't been overly impressed. Within two weeks of buying them, they stopped charging my IPod, and I have to continually fiddle with the Ipod to get it to play out of both speakers. The sound quality is alright -- about what you'd expect for a fifty dollar speaker system. The whole thing is made out of fairly cheap plastic, and it has an overall cheap feel to it. Can't comment on the customer service, because I haven't had time to call them and complain/get a replacement. I definitely wouldn't buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this for use in my office cubicle, so the volume would have to be low. I first tried it out at home at louder levels and it seems to work fine. But when I brought it to work I noticed a ton of speaker feedback. \\"Bubba-dub, bubba-dub\\" even when the ipod was turned off. I moved it everywhere and it didn't help. I guess it doesn't like to be used at lower volumes. I ended up returning this dock. If you want something inexpensive to play at medium to loud levels, this is a good choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was initially impressed with the sound quality, but after a couple of days, it started making static noises. It would do it almost constantly when my ipod was in it, but it would also occasionally make the noises even without the ipod. Sometimes it would be a constant static noise, and others it would be occasional, but that occasional static noise was very loud. I had the correct adapter in it, so I know that wasn't the issue. A few weeks later, it would every now and then not play my music. I could hear it through my ipod, but not through the speakers. Now, a couple of months after my purchase, all it will do is charge my ipod. I cannot get any sound (except for the static) to come out of it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Proven yet!","review":"This item is compact and portable and for the first 3 times that I used it, it worked great. It charged my iPod Touch and the sound was nice for speakers this small. Has adjustments for various iPods. About the fourth time that I put my iPod on the dock to use it, the speakers didn't work. Even with troubleshooting, I could not come up with a reson why the speakers just would not work. Hopefully this one particular item was just defective so I returned it in excahnge for another one. Once I receive the new one I will post another review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returning it","review":"I find that I get better sound quality from the speaker on my iPod touch than I do through these speakers! The speakers have the sound quality of a cheap clock radio, including the static and tinny sound. It's not worth keeping this item just to charge my iPod and it has no value as a speaker, as I get better quality just setting the iPod down and listening through the built in speaker. I don't often return items, but will be returning this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electrical Connector Issues","review":"We received the product and put in the correct adapter for our Ipod. On the very first undocking the electrical connector pulled away from the unit and after that we could not reattach. The product is useless without it. For the price the product is attractive, but it needs some redesign to make it a unit that will last more than a few weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I played music once using these speakers, and they produced a static sound that pretty much overpowered the music at every volume. After the one time, they never turned on again. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I ordered this to replace a set of iHome speakers at my office that had started acting funny. I was looking for something inexpensive that wouldn't sound like garbage. I wouldn't use this for music for a party or anything but for my office it's perfect and doesn't sound half bad! And despite what their specs say it actually does charge the Nano 3G iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product failed","review":"This docking station just quit working after a couple of days; the sound stopped functioning. It was almost like something shorted out; I was disappointed, as was my 8-yr old daughter."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money...","review":"We hoped this would be a decent speaker and good charging dock...it was... for about 3 weeks!! Then the iPod no longer would connect or register so it can't be charged or played...totally useless now...and when I went on tonight to see how to return it it says the return window expired on April 28...so we are out of $36. Don't waste your time or money on this cheap product."},{"rating":"2","title":"cheap and good docking speakers","review":"Bought this for my son and it does work well and the sound quality is pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked...","review":"I was very shocked when I connected my iphone to this. It has very deep bass and sounds really good. My husband is a DJ, so I have to keep a close eye on this. It's a little pricey for me, but it's worth it because I wanted something for the backyard and this will do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is such a wonderful device.It works so much better than I expected. I have owned it for a year already and I am totally satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little machine","review":"I bought this to have at work on my desk. It is the perfect size. Puts out good sound. Keeps my iPod charged. It is just what I was looking for to have at work."},{"rating":"2","title":"remarkably good buy","review":"I agree with other reviewers. This unit has a nice bass, warm sound, sounds \\"bigger\\" than you would expect for this size & price. Bought it for 13 yr old's room, fills the room nicely with clear crisp sound. A remote would be nice, but I wouldn't expect that for this price! Very pleased with the value I got for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the office","review":"This is a great product that allows for directional sound. It fits on the desk or credenza and allows music without bothering coworkers."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound suddenly stopped","review":"It was wonderful when I first received it. Nice little size and pretty decent sound and quality. Unfortunately, a few months later, when I tried to use the speakers again, it made a small popping sound and it no longer works. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The adapter for the ipod nano was defective. It would not charge while the ipod was in the dock. When turned up to the higher volume it sounded tinny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty happy","review":"Solid purchase. The speakers are not as loud as some of the docks, but for the money you can't beat it. Works with my touch and nano."},{"rating":"2","title":"PERFECT","review":"Ordered this for my son-in-law for christmas. Perfect size and perfect for what he needed it for. They do a lot of camping so it's compact in size and has good sound. He was happy and so am I then!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyber Acoustics Docking Speaker","review":"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas because the docking speaker she had didn't work too well. Both her & her brother were amazed at how clear & loud the sound is on the Cyber Acoustics! She can turn the volume way up (too loud for me to listen too & I wear hearing aids!) & the clarity is awesome! For the price, this is excellent! She hasn't tried it outdoors yet but I'm sure it will be fine. I recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speakers!","review":"I tried out lots of other ipod speakers before getting these. The sound is rich and full for their size. They won't fill a stadium, but for the living room, bedroom or the backyard, they do a great job. There is only minimal distortion at the highest volume and I would expect that. They also charge my ipod while it's in the docking station. What more could you ask??"},{"rating":"1","title":"You can do better for the price","review":"This dock is the perfect size, looks good, and is simple in its design. But that's the problem. The buttons are not well designed. It's either blaring or nothing. I can't comment on the sound quality because I can hardly hear it. Not good for an office, bedside, kitchen. Shop around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a penny!","review":"I was gifted this for use of iPod at our local pool. After having it plugged into the wall, so it could charge the iPod, I went to unplug it and take it with me. When I unplugged it the machine went into this very loud, feedback sound and completely blew the speakers. It is a total waste of money. Unfortunately the item was a gift and purchased/gifted after 30 days, beyond the return policy. Spend your money more wisely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disposable Speakers??","review":"The sound quality offered by the speakers, is scarcely decent, but I recommend you not to acquire them, without apparent reason, they stopped working in less than 2 months, I import them, and I'm not feeling like claiming for a \\"guarantee\\"..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely sound at a good price","review":"You can't beat this for the price. It's durable, powerful, and doesn't take up much room. I've had mine for a year and it's still perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it at first","review":"I loved these speakers at first - they were perfect for listening to music in my apartment without bugging the others. But after a while, it started to make odd noises, \\"freezing\\" up and making a buzzing noise until I shut the whole thing off, and eventually it would just stop playing my music on my ipod touch (second generation). Now, it crackles and I can't turn up the music more than \\"low\\" or else it sounds horrible and one of the speakers stops working. Honestly, if this would've kept working I would've given it an excellent review. I wish it would've had a warranty, considering I just purchased it at the end of January. Now I'm left without speakers for my ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in just over a month","review":"I got this docking station for my birthday and loved it at first, but it broke!! It has been about 5 weeks and now the connection between my ipod and the machine is all wonky. If I push down really hard it will connect for a second and then pause my ipod. So annoying. Not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parts Missing - Horrible Customer Service","review":"I bought this unit for Christmas for my son's 1st gen ipod nano. Adapters are required to help dock the unit and the item description says that the adapters are included. While it is true that a few adapters are included, many are not. Instead, the manufacturer includes an instruction sheet explaining which adapter is needed for each ipod and a TOLL number to call to order the correct adapter. Furthermore, they WILL NOT HONOR THE WARRANTY WITHOUT PROPER ADAPTER INSTALLED. Of course, no one answered the phone. I left a message which was eventually returned with a message explaining that they did not have the adapter needed, and I would NEED TO ORDER IT FROM APPLE! Unbelievable.Bottom line...buy a brand name docking station and RUN from these imitation, regardless of price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty disappointed...","review":"I was looking for a decent, cheap set of speakers to listen to my iPod Touch at work. After seeing the stellar reviews here, I thought this was a \\"can't-miss.\\"Well, it may have to do with the low volume levels at which I use the speakers, or with the iPod Touch itself (which I hear does not have great sound), but I get significant bass distortion with these, to the point where some songs become unlistenable. I've tried adjusting the iPod's Equalizer with some improvement, but the distortion is still pronounced. Again, I'm not saying it's necessarily the fault of the speakers, but my listening experience has not been what I anticipated when I purchased them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after a year","review":"I used this system at work for a little less than a year. The distortion sound kept occuring more and more frequently the last 6 months. I was initially impressed with the sound quality for its size, but more and more the music would \\"break up\\". Originally I blamed a cell phone reception as being the culprit, but then it started happening when there was not a cell phone in my office. Then this summer it broke! Where the ipod connects into (the little prongs) - it broke. I know I could have kept it and used the other ports, but with the sounds breaking up and now no way to charge my i-touch at work, I just threw it out. Very sad - only 1 year I got to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with iPod nano 5G","review":"Received the product and was surprised that it does not have the adaptor for iPod nano 5G. Called the manufacture and they told me to purchase an adaptor from Apple. I ended up spending another $14 for the adaptor. (I am not sure if the adaptor will eventually work.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product!","review":"Love it! It's exactly what I wanted at the price I wanted to pay. Portable and convenient. Has really good sound. The \\"Xtreme Bass\\" feature does exactly what it says, so the sound quality is great. MUCH better than the little portable speakers I was using. It's an easy way to take my ipod music to any room or place I want. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glitches after 2 uses!","review":"This speaker dock is basically a piece of crap. The 2nd time I used with batteries a loud buzzing sound comes from the speaker. The only time this does not happen is when the unit is plugged in. I bought this particular dock because it has the option to be wireless and now I can only use it if its plugged in. Look for another unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound","review":"Gave as a gift, she really loves it! Sound is very good. It's a bit smaller than I realized. The ipod touch 4 gen fits in it, but we had to take the cover off the ipod to get it to stay in the dock. Love that it charges even when in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great company","review":"we bought one of these to take on trips with us and its really a great product so we bought two more one for each of us at work . mine stoped working after about 2 months. i e-mailed the company and they sent me a new one prepaid shipping .

I suggested it after reading the reviews and thought it was a good purchase for the price. Well we just plugged it in and the sound is very 'tinny' like a transistor radio. I just called Amazon for a return shipping lable and store credit. Boo. The search continues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Portable speaker, not charger","review":"I bought this for my wife, who wanted a portable speaker system to go with her iPod. Great, as far as portable speakers go. The connector on the dock broke loose within a week (not dropped, just broken). The speakers still work, but she has to jiggle the connector, which cuts out easily, and it will not recharge her iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound","review":"Good: it works easily, and the refund process worked wellBad: the sound is tinny, like a 1970s transistor radio.

Sound quality is quite good for the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"My poor 11 year old daughter was disappointed not once, but twice, with this product. I bought her one for her birthday; it worked for one day. She liked it for the few hours it was working, though, so I exchanged it for her. Amazon was wonderful and shipped a replacement the next day. This one we were even more gentle with; it worked for 2 hours! She is very disappointed. This item has to have the worst quality control ever. i have been purchasing electronics from Amazon for over 10 years and have never had such lemons! BUYER BEWARE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality","review":"I bought this for my 13 year old son and it lasted for a little over a month, he went to remove it off the dock and the piece that fits in to the Ipod broke off. He is not a 2 year old that does not take ease when using his electronics and for it to break off so easily I feel was not properly made for the price that is being asked. I thought if I spent more money, better quality, this is not the case with this product. I would not suggest it for a teenager or anyone else for that matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the price I have no complaints","review":"I purchased this for one of my wife's birthday presents after looking around at other products, reading some reviews here and there, finally settling on this one. While she hasn't used it yet, I was kinda curious so I got it out of the box and popped my ipod on the dock and for something so small, it sounded fine.If you're looking for something to put on a bedstand, desk at work, etc. this should suit your purposes fine. The iPods used on it are the 5th Gen 120gb HD versions, should you wonder which ipod(s)was used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Speakers!","review":"Impressed! I am not an audiophile, but I do know good sound (and bad sounds!). I have been searching for a decent set of portable speakers that I can carry with me on my travels. Music is important to me on vacation, and I want decent sounding music. I own a set of Bose Sound Docks ($299) and they are great sounding, but they are kind of heavy. So, I got these for $35 and they are decent sounding. Just testing them out before I leave on a 10 day Caribbean vacation, and so far, I am impressed. Of course, they have limited bass, and they are only so loud, but at the highest volume, they are not distorting (much). I didn't buy them to DJ a party or even use for a back yard get together, but they are good for a bedroom or background music for a living room. They fill my needs wonderfully, and don't cost a mint, so if something happens to them, it is not a great loss, I will just get some more."},{"rating":"2","title":"iPod Portable Docking Speaker","review":"This is our 2nd purchase of this product.

On my return, I purchased this little item with the idea of taking it with me next time I travel. Had I seen and heard this first, I'd have bought it and dispensed with the larger system. It's terrific. Great sound from very small speakers. Very light and easy to use and set up. It even has a little travel bag. I took it with me to work the first day I got it. It fits in my brief case, assembles in under a minute, and I can adjust the tone so it is just at the edge of my consciousness, or blast me out of my chair if I want to. I couldn't be happier with this charger/speaker system. The only thing it's lacking is a remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Surprisingly good sound quality for such a small unit. Battery operation a big plus on portability.

It will work great in our small RV and not take up tons of space. I especially like that it is small and it charges my Nano as well as plays it.

Will work for me and what I'm needing it for, and I'm ordering 2 more for my grandsons' Nanos as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound","review":"I have only had this a few weeks but I love it. It's small/compact and what I needed as I use it on my desk at work. I had a different one but when I bought my new ipod, the old one would no longer charge it.

Previous purchases included a iLive IBCD2817 (thin sound) and a Klipsch iGroove SXT (too bulky, especially with the power brick).The Cyber Acoustics appeared at first to be the answer. Very compact and with an amazingly rich sound, which was initially great for both music, podcasts and wifi radio.But then the buzzing, crackling and static started and it didn't matter which outlet it was plugged into (I tried it both at work and home).I thought it may have been a defect in the one unit, but after returning it and receiving a replacement the same problem occurred again. So frustrating!Amazon has been great about the returns and sadly the second unit will be shipped back tomorrow for credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I was extremely hopeful when I ordered this proudct, due to the many 5 star ratings it has received. I was a bit taken back at how tiny and low-end this device was when it arrived (I currently own 2 iHome docking stations). The problem that ultimately ended in me returning the device for a refund was the static noise coming from the speakers -whether the iPod was on it or not. It sounded as though there was an electrical short in the wiring and it made me a bit nervous. I thought about getting it replaced, but after reading some of the other 1 star reviews I elected to ask for a refund. I'll be purchasing something from another company all together. Do yourself a favor, and keep looking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is JUNK JUNK JUNK","review":"I went through three of these, and ALL of them spewed static - the third one before I'd even attached an iPod.

Its really a simple setup, there's about 3 buttons and two speakers so if you're looking for a very simple setup for a small space, I would totally recommend these.

I had to forcibly jam them together to make them fit. Removing the iPod also took quite a bit of force.I was concerned that repeatedly forcing my iPod into the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker would damage the iPod. So I returned the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker to Amazon.If a docking speaker is designed correctly, an iPod should fit into it quite smoothly. I have previously fit my iPod into other types of docking speakers, and the fit was always smooth.The problem here was not with the plastic adaptor (for the iPod Touch) supplied with the Cyber Acoustics docking speaker. My iPod Touch fit easily into that adaptor.

My kit contained two docks for the iPod classic and one port for a iPod Nano 4th generation. However, my iPod Nano 6th generation (it's the smallest one that's a square with a touch screen) fits and plays while simultaneously charging it. It was a little confusing that it contained an auxiliary cable, which you don't need. It has a nice compact size so it fits nicely anywhere (I use mine in the bathroom) and is easy to travel with.As far as sound quality is concerned, yes it has adequate bass. But the sound is not balanced properly and often the melody and sometimes the singers voice gets lost or hard to heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped working after six months","review":"It still charges my iPod, but the speakers stopped working after six months.Cyber Acoustics 30-Pin iPod Speaker Dock (CA-461)Really disappointing since I purchased it primarily for the alarm and music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible sound!!","review":"Took this docking station on a trip to visit friends.

I love the size and portability, the fact that it charges my iPod, and the sound quality. I've used a 4th generation Nano and a Classic iPod with the dock, and both have worked as advertised. I've also used the auxiliary input cord to connect the speakers to my laptop for better sound when watching a movie on it. It worked very well!I was about to purchase a second one for a friend, but after reading multiple current reviews stating that their dock stopped working within days or months, I might just get a gift card and let my friend decide for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality for the money","review":"I bought this on the advice of a friend.

If you enter the room with any device that has wireless, the dock will emit a horrible static and beeping sound. If your mobile device is in the hall, same will happen.The operation lights are blue and red. Which is on and which is off? I have to keep checking the manual.Most of the time, you have to jiggle your ipod in the dock to make the connection so that the device plays.We've had this dock for 8 months before it broke.Bad technology! I'm sure there's better out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for one year","review":"Bought this because of the price. You get what you pay for.

Next time, I will pay a little more and get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality - Returned Item","review":"Although a good price, there was static and buzzing noises.

If you are looking for something that plays close to you, like while you cook, sit at your desk, lying in bed, etc. But if uwanted something to sit on a ledge while your swimming or gardening, the sound just doesn't do it. So, since I wanted this item for the latter, for my desires and purposes, it just wasn't worth it for $40. I'd rather have spent $30 morre to get what I want and needed. It's a decent player and it does charge your iPod while hooked up and it comes w/ several hookup deals for different kinds of iPods... It just wasn't worth $40 to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"cyber acoustics portable speakers","review":"Bought this for my bedroom, to charge at night and occasionally play music..... well, I'm very disappointed, you cant keep it turned on at night because of the bright blue light(actually lights up the room) and it interferes with other devices, so it makes a buzzing sound.

Cyber Acoustic's Digital Docking Speaker is as advertised. Simple, easy to use, and fits virtually any I-pod.

It didn't need to be high powered.It seems like it has plenty of power. Sound is good for what it is. The problem is with an iPhone in it, whether it is on of off, it periodically takes off making a bunch of noise, sounds like morse-code, for about 5 seconds. Truely an annoying noise. It does it at a rather high volume also. Volume setting doesn't effect it. It happens randomly, sometimes never, sometimes many times in an hour. usually always daily.I think it has something to do with the cell interaction. Might work fine for just an iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"Whether it is plugged into the A/C adapter or run off of battery power this device produces consistent distortion, static and feedback regardless of volume level.

I didn't even attach an iPod to it yet. The buzzing is loud and annoying and gets more high pitched when you do plug the iPod in. Sending this back to Amazon for a refund. I can only imagine that if some units do this right away out of the box then the construction of these things is flimsy and I wouldn't trust a replacement to last long even if it worked at first! Frustrating, as I really like the size and look of these speakers and the sound minus the whining/buzzing sound seemed pretty decent for my purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"ac adapter is missing","review":"I love the product but the ac adapter is missing.

The set was, as others had mentioned, smaller than I had imagined, but did not put out the sound as some were raving about. I purchased these to use on a patio boat for 4th of July so I needed some volume and since I am quite picky about the tone and the sound, I wanted something with a little bass. Every time I turned it up to get any sort of volume the speakers went into cardiac arrest and made this horrible growling sound. I thought maybe I did something wrong, so I check all the connections and tried it again twice with the same results. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful sound","review":"This product sounds extremely tinny and crackling. Truly a poor product even at lower volumes.

This is not a good docking station for IPODS. Once you put your Ipod in there is a lot of play and you will break the stations IPOD hock up. With it being flimsy you will have a hard time adjusting your screen or thumb dial since the mount will wiggle and break. Very Bad design by CA Cyber Acoustics. Don't buy and if you do you will need a new one soon so start looking for a replacement one now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well til it broke!","review":"Well, it worked very well and I was pleased with the speakers until about a month later, when first it stopped playing music on the nano, and then it stopped charging my old school ipod. Now I have to put a small bottle behind the ipod in order to get the wires/electronics to work so that it'll play. So, for 40 bucks, Im pretty disappointed, but *shrug* c'est la vie.

Ordered this from Amazon (decided to pay $12 for overnight shipping). Couldn't be happier - for $36 you can't beat the sound.

Battery life is hard to estimate - still on original set after about 40 hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound","review":"Much better than expected. Great sound from such a small device. Arrived on time and would purchase again. It has much better volume than the Ipod alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"A really great iPod charger and port. It plays with impressive quality. Although it can't handle too much bass in songs that feature a louder bassline (i.e. most all rap music), most all music sounds great on it. Really light and small, packs the needed punch for a 1 or 2 bedroom apartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not have an adaptor for the 5th generation ipod nano","review":"We bought this to use with the newest ipod nano (5th generation). It doesn't have an adapter for the 5th generation. It will work without an adapter, but it puts pressure on the pins when you try and change a song. Plus, the warranty is void if you use it without an adapter. So, it is being returned.It sounded good for the two seconds we tried it with the nano, but wasn't worth the risk of breaking it or the ipod."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed","review":"I wanted to like this little docking speaker for its size and price and ordered it because of all the great reviews. But honestly, I really can't say anything good about the sound quality and wonder how anyone could be satisfied with the sound of this unit. (Yes, I have tried adjusting the equalizer) Tinny, shallow, raspy sound - it doesn't even sound as good as my Phillips kitchen radio! I am a classical musician, but hardly an audiophile. I definitely would not recommend this product. I gave it two stars to be fair - it was low priced and maybe you just get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking.","review":"This just didn't have the minimal volume power I was hoping for, and I wasn't hoping for much. I wanted something I could have outside with me, right next to me, on the deck. The sound just gets lost in the air with the sound of the outdoors. I was going to give it to one of my kids, and then last week when we plugged it in, it made a funny \\"pop!\\" and then we smelled a little electrical smoke smell and then it didn't work anymore. So, I would recommend you keep looking - perhaps spend a little more money. I may have got what I paid for but still, it should have lasted longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"I received this speaker in mid January 2012. At first I thought it was great. I am not an audiophile but the sound was fine for me to listen to music or podcasts from my iphone at home and from my research there were no comparable options at this price point. I only wish I had paid more attention to the 65 (now 66) 1 star reviews. A couple of months later I turned on my speakers to find that the volume was going at full blast but the volume control was unresponsive. Now I have speakers that work (sort of) but are useless due to the volume issue. And of course I missed to return window. :-(I recommend the JBL On Stage IIIP Portable Speaker Dock for iPod and iPhone - which I also own. It costs more but you get quality that saves you money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for something else","review":"I was thoroughly disappointed after receiving this product. Sound quality was very poor. The speakers rumbled and whined at very low volumes. It is easy to use and portable, but that doesn't make up for the poor sound. Was this a lemon? I don't know, but I had to return it and I am looking at some other options. The volume reduction switch was also sticky and difficult to work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I expected","review":"This small player has surprisingly good sound to be used in a small room. I'm pleased with it and would certainly recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great portable IPOD speaker which is dual voltage","review":"The speaker sounds great, of course so do my computer speakers also made by cyber acoustics! It's perfect for my office. It not only plays music, but charges your IPOD at the same time. The included adaptors work well in helping to keep my IPOD touch 4th generation secure. I had forgotten that it also can be used with AA batteries! One other thing, not in the product description is that the AC plug is multi 100-240 volts capable which is great for those who move often, to other countries, like myself. Very good price point too. I'm so glad I didn't need to spend more to get great sound in a portable package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value - Worth the Money","review":"I needed a speaker docking station for my iPod and stumbled across this particular model. After reading through the Amazon reviews, I went ahead and bought it. It's exactly as the reviews describe. Does what it needs to do at a great price. My only complaint is that sometimes the iPods need some jiggling to get to work properly. Even with that said, totally worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Dock for Home","review":"I bought this dock for my kitchen. It's easy to use and the sound is very good.

Although it worked well and met our needs (iPhone/iPod docking in the kitchen) for six or seven months, it now doesn't work at all. For a while we had to wedge a piece of folded paper between device and docking station, close to the pins, to get a connection but that only worked briefly. Now it won't connect at all. The sound quality wasn't great but was fine for a small room. Its a shame that the pins just wore out. I suppose this is the age of disposable electronics but I expect a fifty dollar item to last longer than ten months...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice, but cheap...","review":"Bought this speaker for my daughter's iPod because it was a nice blend of size and price. The connector lasted ONE week, and of course, it's the one component not covered in the \\"limited\\" warranty. It's a bad design-- docking puts too much torque on the weakly supported base even with the proper adapter in place. We can still use the cable for the speakers and the sound is fine for its size. However, if you can't charge the device, it's not worth much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this item ...","review":"This item worked great for 2 months ... then right after the time to return it stops working.The place to plug your iPod in has a flimsy connector piece.

The sound is good, not great, but for the price I didn't expect it to sound like a high end model. The bass tones aren't the best and the trebles do tend to be a bit bright, but overall, it certainly delivers better sound than other comparably priced models I have heard.Very small and portable, I found it easy to move around. But, I got tired of that. So, I decided to buy a second one. I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"The sound on this is terrible! You could get better sound from a transistor radio! Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"compact and good sound but not ideal for an ipod touch","review":"I bought this set of speakers on the strength of the reviews here and elsewhere. Unfortunately it has a major flaw in that using an ipod touch (2nd gen, in my case) with the Wifi enabled causes audible interference. CA tech support hasn't been helpful saying they're not the only manufacturer with the problem. Gee, that makes me feel better! A Belkin dock attached to a home stereo has no such issues. I was also underwhelmed by the inclusion of a docking insert for the 1st gen ipod touch rather than for the 2nd or 3rd gen - the 2nd gen has been on the market for over a year. CA's response was to tell me to buy the correct insert from Apple!So it's a good product with a flaw that limits its use with the ipod touch and has less than impressive customer service.

The sound quality is nothing to write home about. It turns out that there are no miracles, and you get what you pay for. If you're looking for an inexpensive dock that sounds better than a clock radio, but not by much, then get this.

I would have given it 5 stars but it does not have a remote - however it was a great price. The audio sounds good, given the size of the speakers, and it is compatible with all of my Apple iPods and iPhones (iPhone 4S or older). It does not work with the new iPhone 5 because Apple changed the connection.I may buy a second one so I can play baby music in my infant son's room on an old iPod Nano 2nd gen. I still have. The Cyber Acoustics does not take up much space on top of a night stand or dresser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality","review":"The engineering on the product is abysmal. After purchasing this for my daughter for the holidays, It stopped working less than two months later. The iPod connector was loose, so I popped the thing open thinking maybe it's a loose cable connection. No! The connector (which has many very, very, small pins) was soldered directly to the board. This means every time you plug on unplug your iPod you are pulling directly on the super tiny soldered joints. Whoever engineered this needs to rethink their career choice. DO NOT purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I loved this when I got it and have only used it about 20 times and the charging function has stopped working. Not very happy.

Their are only three buttons along the top: Volume Down, Mute, and Volume Up (from left to right), so there is no learning curve. A on/off swich on the back helps preserve battery life.

This is it.This unit definitely has better bass than my Altec Lansing im3. The mid- and high-range response was similar to the im3.It does not contain an adapter for my iPod (the fourth generation 60GB iPod Photo). Included instructions remind you that a universal adapter should have been included in the original iPod packaging, or you can buy it online from Apple. I think I can work around this by cutting some felt pads for support, but it's annoying. I called Amazon customer service for removal of the claim that this product works with all iPods, as well as compensation for my partially functional product. I was given credit for half the price of the device and told that the misleading info would be modified. Nice.The adapter is 5V 1200mA if anyone else cares. (I was hoping to use the adapter to power another device whose 9V adapter had broken.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece for better price","review":"I bought this to extend the sound to external speakers for my newly bought ipod. The construction quality is good, affordable price, and it even has a charger to charge the ipod. The sound quality is not the best for ipod, but I would say, very good. Best part is, it can be powered by batteries too, when away from power outlet. It is a very good alternative for expensive ipod dockers. Value for money and I recommend this for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money","review":"I found this item for under $30 bucks delivered to my home. It came with numerous attachments for all of the different generations of Ipods. The sound quality is perfect. I was very happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound. Very pleased.","review":"Just got it today. Very pleased so far. The sound is better than I expected. This our first docking station so I knocked off one star since I don't have anything to compare it to. It meets the requirements I had, play music with a good sound and charge the Ipod.It came with an AC adapter, Ipod charges when you use the AC adapter, does not charge when powered with 4 AA batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good! Great sound!","review":"The speaker provides quality sound, especially considering the low price! Much richer sound/bass than I had expected. I like that it runs on batteries & AC so I'm able to use it indoors and out. Very satisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not working after 4 months","review":"I bought this Docking speaker for my daughter. After 3 to 4 month, Her iPod could not be charged with the product any more. Very poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very expensive for the short time it actually worked","review":"Speaker system worked fine for a month, used infrequently at most dozen times or so, and then it just quit. No music regardless the volume setting. Lights all lit but no sound. Tried using only batteries, only car plug, and tried using house converter. Nothing. iPod works great in other systems so it is not the iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT recommend this item","review":"I purchased this for my son for Valentine's Day in just a matter of weeks it was broken. Not very well made. You definitely get what you pay for- I didn't get a deal I got screwed! My advice is to spend more money on a better IPOD dock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfied","review":"This product was working great until the part where I dock my ipod broke. Now it is useless and I can't charge my ipod or play music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Looking product, but it was NOT compatible with my iPod Touch","review":"This product looks great. Great shipping too. However, after trying my iPod Touch on the dock it would not charge or play music. The aux cable played the music just fine, so the speakers and device themselves work just fine. The item is just not compatible with certain iPods I suppose. Either that, or mine was defective in some way. I also used my buddy's iPod Touch to see if it was just my device, but to no avail. This simply would not work with my iPod Touch. It may be due to the version. I hope you can include this warning in the product description for future buyers so they are not discouraged once they get something that will not work with their device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Speakers, Wi-Fi Issues","review":"These speakers largely work, although if I try to listen with wi-fi enabled on my iPod Touch, the speakers send a ton of static. Even if I'm not listening to music and the speakers are \\"off\\" there is static. Even having my phone with wi-fi enabled in close proximity (within a foot or so) will create some static. If you are using this with a nano or classic, this should be great. If you are planning on streaming Pandora through an iPod Touch or iPhone, I'd recommend getting a different set of speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compact sound","review":"These were exactly what I wanted. They are easily portable and have nice sound quality for such a compact design."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product","review":"Nice product for the money....I have now bought 2. The sound is adequate for a small room. Only glitch is the I pod sometimes takes a second to hook up with integral connector to power through the speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"ipod speaker","review":"I have been very happy with the sound quality and ease of use of this product. For a small inexpensive speaker system for my ipod, it has very good sound quality. It is small enough to make it very portable too. I was afraid that for the price the sound would be poor, but have been pleasantly surpised. I would recommend purchasing this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"buy an i-home one instead","review":"When this product actually worked for me, the sound was sometimes staticky, and I had to adjust the ipod back and forth to get rid off the static, which only lasted for a few minutes until the static came back. I should have been happy with that, however, because after three weeks the silver dock at the bottom became too loose and wiggly and the ipod was unable to produce any sound. So, pay more attention to the one-star reviews on here, because this machine is very poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have listened to the bad reviews","review":"I read numerous reviews that spoke of static sound and the speakers just stop working one day. Should have listened better. I thought maybe it was just a few that were bad ... mine was one of them. I heard the static in the speakers the first day, but tried to pretend it wasn't there. After about 3 months it would not charge the ipod when it was docked, and then a few weeks later it just stopped working. The power light was on, with and without the battery/charging cord and still no sound. Should have listened!!! Junk! And I thought, \\"It's only $30 dollars, if it doesn't work, at least I'm not losing that much money.\\" Well, there goes $30 dollars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for ipod touch 3rd generation","review":"When I plugged my ipod touch 3rd generation into the Cyber Acoustics Portable Digital Docking Speaker, no sound came out of the speakers, so I returned it (which Amazon makes relatively easy to do)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk fried my ipod","review":"Do not buy this piece of junk. The moment I plugged my new Ipod into this docking station the speakers hummed loadly then popped. My Ipod, which worked perfectly prior to plugging into this machine, never turned on again and when I removed the Ipod from this docking station (after unplugging it from the wall and within seconds of the pop) the Ipod was HOT! It completely fried my Ipod and it has not worked since. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Questionable quality","review":"This is a great price, but if the speakers don't work, what good is it? (No, the speakers don't work after 2 hrs of play...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gift","review":"Bought this for my hubby for Christmas and he LOVES it! The only question I had was how to use the different docking tools for various types of i-pods. I was unable to figure out how to add that to his i-pod Touch, but plugged it in directly and it seems to work just fine without it. I was surprised there were no instructions, but still a great gift and it puts out a good and loud sound!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds awful!","review":"***Very*** disappointed in this product. I had it on my wishlist after reviewing several other types of players and thought it would be great for the price. Wrong. Songs with any kind of bass are totally distorted on these speakers. These will be returned! We'll spend the money on something that is hopefully better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound, Great Product, Great Price!","review":"I bought the Cyber Acoustics Portable iPod Docking Speakers for my acupuncture practice, and I am very happy with this purchase. The unit is very small and easily fits onto the book shelf, and the sound is really quite amazing for a product that size. I read the previous reviews, and even though some weren't happy with the speaker dock, this unit seemed to have the overall best reviews for docks that were under $30.The delivery was, as usual with Amazon, right on time and very fast. It only takes a minute to set the unit up for use, and it comes with all necessary adapters to make it work for every type of iPod. I have tried it with an iPod touch 8 GB, and the old 160 GB iPod Classic, and both work flawlessly. The sound is good enough that I can hear it clearly even in the next room on only medium volume. For the price, this is an excellent product, and I can highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of sound for a little price!","review":"I must admit: the first day I attempted to use this with my iPod Touch, I was ready to return it! But, I quickly learned it was operator error...I had not removed the iPod's skin before seating it in the dock. Let's just say after I figured that out, I couldn't be happier with the performance of this product! : )I am currently using it in a 300-400 square feet office setting. I don't have to have the volume at maximum level for everyone in the office to enjoy the music.I'm not sure if it was mentioned in the product description, but several adapters come with the dock; this makes it compatible with many different iPod generations.This was a great find for me at a spectacular price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with connector","review":"I had trouble to get good contact between the unit and two different iPod Touch devices. It required wiggling around the units at random time. This eventually caused the connector to break, less than a month after I started using the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, while it lasted.","review":"I received this as a Christmas present. It was exactly what I needed for my iPod Nano (6th Gen) for my desk at work. I even took it on vacation with me to use in the hotel room. Its the perfect size to fill a \\"standard\\" sized room at a decent volume level...I don't think its made for parties or outdoor use. Bad news is it stopped working after 6 months. No warnings, static, crackles or anything like that...just no more sound. It still functions as a charger, but you can get one of those cheaper than than this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"two months, it's in the trash.","review":"Update, the speakers started to get a loud buzz when the phone was in the docking station. At first, wiggling it would cure the buzz, then later, the buzz was constant. Used the patch cord and it worked, for a week, and started to buzz. Became unusable. It's a shame, the sound was so good. It's in the trash. Too bad it can't be rated zero.Look for something else, don't waste your money like I did.Recieved the player a few days ago and was suprised by how good it sounds for a compact player. I've seen the bad reviews about it breaking down. It will be traveling with me on a regular basis, so it's not going to have an easy life. If it breaks down, I will update the review. But so far, it's a great player, easy to use, (even my wife can run it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"Nice sound for the price, not super powerful but works well with Ipod on the beach or out in the garden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 2 months","review":"I got excited about these speakers from reading other reviews, but these speakers are junk. The piece that connects to the ipod came loose after 2 months and will not charge or play my ipod touch. All the money we saved from buying these cheapo speakers is wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money.","review":"This unit broke on me within 2 hours of use. The receiver for the Ipod port became loose and wouldnt accept the music signal from the ipod without bending the receiver. I have had Bose speakers in the past that did this, and all you had to do was open the unit (understanding that you were breaking the warranty!) and reconnect the cable to the receiver port. But with this unit you cant even open the case.For the 2 hours it was running sound quality was good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad sound quality","review":"The speakers are not of good quality and nothing like the advertisement for them. They have really bad quality on any volume over half. I guess it is ok for audio books and stuff but not for music. Not worth the money since all anyone would want it for is music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Little Thing","review":"I ordered this little device for Christmas to go along with my new Ipod. It works great, even took it on a crusie. The sound is super and keeps my Ipod charged and ready to use whenever I want to take it with me somplace, just pop it off and go. I just ordered another one for my spouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound for small price","review":"I got this for my son's room and the sound is pretty good for a small devise at this price range. However, when I recently purchased the JBL on State Micro III for the kitchen, my son promptly traded this one for the JBL. He's right the JBL has a much better sound and the size is very small. But this is still a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not much volume","review":"I have the Cyber Acoustics Subwoofer Satellite System (CA-3602) which is a phenomenal system for the price. I wanted something portable and battery operated so I went with another CA product. I like the unit, the sound is good but it has very little volume. It will work as a small travel speaker, but not for home use for me. I'll be using this where size and weight matters like traveling or camping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - and a great price, too!","review":"I bought this little number so I could listen to holiday music in the kitchen. It works perfectly and the sound is great (esp for the money). It is small enough to be out of the way but big enough to give great sound. It is easy to take and move it around the house if you need to - love electronics that don't require all of my patience and/or a degree in engineering to use. Terrific buy. I would sooo purchase again and would if I had a larger apartment. As it is...I think we're fine over here :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kickyerbuttastic!","review":"I got one of these for my husband for Christmas because we have no stereo system at all. Since all of our music is digital I decided to get a docking station for our iPod/iPhone. This one had great reviews, so I bought one. NOW I WISH I'D BOUGHT 27 OF THEM!! Seriously, I want one in both bathrooms, every bedroom, one in the living room and one in the kitchen. The sound is incredible for how affordable the unit is. The ONLY way to improve it would be for it to come with a remote (or maybe it did and I missed seeing him open that part and it's since been put away somewhere). I haven't been able to test how long the system will run on batteries, but it takes AAs and we have rechargeable ones.

It doesn't have amazing sound quality and it isn't very durable. The bass is terrible, it just vibrates and after about 2 and a half months the charger in the front broke.

They seem relatively compact, which is great since he is headed to a dorm room soon. We are happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I got this speaker as a gift a couple of years ago and it was very rarely used, but worked fine when I did use it. Recently I started using it often and it's been making this horrible static sound - very jarring and unpleasant. So I bought a new one to replace it and the new one just doesn't work at all. It worked for one day, then the next day it just wouldn't recognize the ipod. It's going back and I'm replacing it with something else. Also, it has tiny but very bright blue light that glows when it's on, which is really annoying in a dark room. The light is in a spot that makes it hard to cover too. I really don't recommend this speaker."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have left zero stars if I could","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my daughter.

Sometimes it would charge her iPod but about 30-40% of the time, it did not. four months after purchase, it stopped working completely, No charging, no sound playing.

In the picture, it looked bigger, but it is really quite \\"petit\\"; perfect for my office desk which is why I bought it. I have a much more expensive Bose portable speaker system at my home for playing my ipod classic, ipod nano and my iphone, but with a $299 price tag, I couldn't afford one for work. Then I saw this in the Amazon Warehouse Deals. What a little gem. (you can not beat Amazon Warehouse deals...got it for nearly 50% off!)It is compact, well-made, easy to use, charges your ipod as you play it, sound quality is excellent (really, and I am pretty picky).

We use re-chargable AA batteries (4) and it runs forever. I've had this for a month and don't know how we lived without music anywhere and everywhere whatever the mood.

I think that these reviews miss the point of the book: These reviewers seem to think that Klinghoffer was seeks to provide a comprehensive refutation of Christianity, while (in my opinion) Klinghoffer was merely trying to briefly summarize the Jewish view and to explain to Christians: \\"This is what your Jewish neighbors are thinking.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Must reading for every Jew, and eye-opening for Christians","review":"An outstanding book, likely to be very controversial, and very beautifully and thoghtfully written.

But I am not convinced about the \\"original theory\\" put forward by David Klinghoffer that Jewish rejection of Jesus allowed Christianity to separate from Judaism and become a multi-ethnic religion and that Christianity was thus able to achieve a dominance in gentile Europe that would have been impossible for Judaism to attain. Given the interest of St.Paul in the gentiles, Paul himself being of Roman origin as the author claims, there was nothing to stop him from his missionary activities among the gentiles no matter if the Jews accepted Jesus or not. More over the author himself admit St.Paul's methods were finally condoned by Peter and James, the Church leaders of Jesus, themselves later. So the Jewish rejection here doesnt play any historical role as the author purports.

Need You Tonight, New Sensation, Devil Inside and Never Tears us Apart. A collection of four singles that are indeed classics. The range from Rock anthem, guitar riff Devil Inside through to the ballad of Never Tear Us Apart which was fittingly played at Michael's funeral. These tracks are supported by the rejuvenated Australian classic \\"The Loved One\\", first heard on INXS'S INXSIVE back in 1981.

With this release, INXS was a band at the pinnacle of fame, playing for sold-out crowds in arenas all over the world. I had the privilege of seeing Michael and the guys when they came to my hometown, and they put on an excellent show. Demonstrating genuine talent, this band was better live than recorded.INXS wasn't able to sustain the commercial success of Kick (if they had, the band would have been on par with many of the greatest rock bands of all time), but you will still find some stellar tracks on subsequent releases.

I was looking for tales about the monkey god Hanuman, not depictions of Rama, Sita and Ravana.This is important: I also thought there was more to Hanuman than the Ramayana (Rama and Sita's exploits). I was wrong, at least according to this minibook. I was left languishing for more knowledge about Hanuman. This minibook did not do me justice.Yes, the publisher indicates this is a minibook. However, the book being downright mini and certainly under 100 pages, perhaps it suits a young child or tween, as they are known these days. The minibook is tiny with a hard cover--perfect for gift giving to a youngster.So, since this book does not go into length about Hanuman, specifically, and since the book is decisively titled Hanuman without discussing the monkey god in all his glory, I give the minibook two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice adaptation with gorgeous art work!","review":"This is a children's rendition of the later portion of the Ramayana, pertaining specifically to Hanuman's role in freeing Sita from Ravana, her abductor. It has great moral lessons while still being an adventure. There is some violence that a very small child might find scary (we see soneone with a spear through him) and it's definitely a military motif, but given that Rama's identity is as a warrior that is appropriate. A great adventure with attractive illustrations!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, exciting artwork and a bold tale","review":"This telling of the Hanuman myth is fascinating for kids and adults alike. The tale of a monkey who battles the ultimate evil is vividly illustrated, and unlike many children's versions of myths, doesn't pull any punches.

Most importantly she includes the examples found in God's Word to back up what she shares from these life experiences.This book contains chapters on such things as Facing Stress, The Gift of Meekness, Facing the Pain, Peace Amid the Pain, A Call to Courage, and A Message of Hope.

I just took it off as soon as I put it on. It was a cheap product from a good-known quality manufacturer, so I think that it applies to \\"you get what you pay for\\".Quality-wise it just looks and feels cheap, no common from the previous protucts I've gotten from Moroso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moroso Wire Separators","review":"I recieved these wire separators and they are as they appear. Something I don't like about them is that they're not very flexible. I also don't like that they aren't a round fitting where the wire slides in, they have bumps/dimples I guess to keep the wire in once there? I didn't like it. They also seem to be somewhat bulky compared to my factory wire separators... I didn't even bother to keep them on, I just replaced my worn out factory separators with some from a donor car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bratz Campfire Phoebe","review":"This doll isn't realistic at all. People do not go camping in mini skirts and high heeled boots. And they definitley do not sleep in almost sleevless shirts when they go camping.This is just stupid. She is wearing a super short mini skirt, a short shirt, and high heeled boots to go camping. The only realistic thing is the jacket, and even that isn't that realistic.Phoebe also has slanty, mean looking eyes and bright red lipstick. All the Bratz dolls wear way too much makeup in bright colors. (One of the babies has red lipstick, and there is a Fianna doll with dark green eyeshadow.)This doll, and the entire Campfire Bratz collection, teaches girls to wear short, inappropriate clothing and high heels to go camping in - in the winter!!! Don't buy these Bratz Campfire dolls for children or teenagers! They will start wearing short clothes and bright colored makeup!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LGP3LNC","review":"I would rate this 5 stars because I love these dolls so much.But um,I seriusly would weae tennis shoes or hiking boots.Not heels.But, still, this is a nice doll."},{"rating":"2","title":"So pretty","review":"This is the prettist Pheobe I have ever seen.

I love Bratz . #1 Bratz fan #1 My Scene hater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet another great way to teach your child to be impractical.","review":"Once again, the Bratz prove to be just as outdoorsy as any other doll. Just as long as they have their designer canteens on hand, not to mention their oh so useful-in-the-wilderness stilleto boots. At least when Barbie goes camping she does it practically. Do you see Barbie prancing around the campfire in a mini skirt and bare midriff? And then acting surprised when she finds out that the mosquitoes have bitten her all to hell? I think not.That's all I have to say. Once they release the Bratz Camp Fire Woodsy Vanity and the Plush Bratz Camp Fire Tent complete with manicure station, shoe rack and deluxe bathroom, then you can expect more reviews from me. I think what the Bratz really need is the Bratz Camp Fire Burn Ward and Intensive Care for Insect Bites Center. Now that's something that would come in useful AND teach your kid to not be the skanky extra in one of those bad forest horror movies.The Raven (strikes again!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Um...Okay","review":"I like Bratz. My favorite are Fiana, Jade, and Phoebe. I liked Phoebe because I thought she dressed like me and that her personality was like mine. I was stunned by Bratz Treasures and Bratz Wild Wild West. Bratz camp Fire made me think otherwise. If they are wearing such large jackets and the name is camp fire, then I'm guessing it's really cold. Yet just like in wintertime wonderland, they are wearing skirts. I think this collection doesn't have good colors. They either have dark and ugly colors on or many different bright colors on. I don't like Phoebe's new hair color at all. I think this collection of dolls and the dolls cartoon pictures are bad. Buy a different kind of Bratz, but not this one. There are way better ones out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Phoebe","review":"I love this Phoebe. Her outfit is awsome, and she's super pretty. I can't wait till tommorow morning when the Bratz go camping on their TV show, it looks great. I asked for her for Christmas, but if they find Felicia, then get her instead because I want a new girl, but I would like to get her too, it's just that there are too many cool stuff that I want this year, so I have to pick carefully.

It is so sad that Testament did not get the recognition they did. This album quickly became one of my favorites. The intesity does not let up through out the whole album.

Standout tracks include Into The Pit, Disciples Of The Watch , Eerie Inhabitants...Must Have For True Metal Fans"},{"rating":"1","title":"Second strike isn't deadly...","review":"Relative late-comers to the Thrash Metal elite, Testament dropped a vicious, thundering classic of a debut before gradually spiralling into a vortex of mediocrity over their next few records. Objectively, 'The New Order' is a pretty decent follow-up. The production is clearer and crunchier and the song-writing and performances are almost as strong. Nevertheless, this record has none of the intensity and youthful enthusiasm that makes 'The Legacy' special.'Disciples of the Watch' is the only truly classic moment here - a Thrash masterpiece and one of the band's finest ever moments. Most of the rest of the album sounds self-conscious and contrived, the only time the band sound like they're having any fun is on the decent Aerosmith cover. If you judge this type of music on riffs and solos then it is probably worth purchasing, look elsewhere if you crave urgency and spark. Either way, get 'The Legacy' first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't remember a thing from it","review":"Better than Metallica? Please.There's nothing essentially bad about Testament, it's just that nothing they do sticks out in any way.

So my book is worn, has water spots on it and the binding is almost coming lose. But it still works!I have also bought this book numerous times for friends and baby showers.One of the most encouraging parts of the book is the scripture prayers at the end of each chapter with fill in the blanks for your child's name. The book is divided into sections - how to pray for your kids' teachers, how to pray for your child in crisis, safety, and how to pray for your child's faith and character. Great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"This book has become my number 1 Bible resource. The fact the I can pick a topic by chapter, turn to the end of that chapter and just pop names into the blanks in the verses makes it so easy to pray God's word for my children.

It is a truly incredible book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Prayer tool","review":"I love the guidance this book gives me.

Next chance I get, I will definitely go back and read the beginning of this series.

Although all of the books have a great blend of fantacy and fact, the \\"Night of the New Magicians\\" has perfected this formula in an even more magical and memorable way. I can't think of a more exciting way of helping my son learn about the early inventors than to liken them to \\"magicians,\\" nor can I think of a better way of helping him learn about geography and famous landmarks than to create an spectacular mental image of the characters flying over the city of Paris with a breathtaking view of the Eiffel tower.

We also have the matching crib. This was easy to assemble and we didn't have any problems with missing parts. I agree with other reviews that said that the changing pad that comes with it is flimsy. We bought an extra contoured one to put on top of it instead and have been happier with that. It is true, also, that this is not particularly sturdy, but I wasn't looking for a family heirloom. Generally speaking, I expect any furniture that you have to put together yourself with an allen wrench is just not going to be super high quality. It's sturdy enough to hold a baby and all kinds of stuff, though, and we're happy with it.

The writing lack depth, dimension, and offered zero emotional skill, and after struggling through the first 100 pages, I threw the book away. So much for Stephen King's opinion - although he's written so really good things, he's also put out a lot of mediorce work too. If you want some juicy romance as well as good storytelling, read Susan Carroll's \\"The Dark Queen\\", The Courtesan\\" and \\"The Silver Rose\\"Trilogy. Once I read these I went back and purchased Carroll's earlier works, all with underserved tacky covers I might add, but the writing is fun and her heroes are \\"broad shouldered with powerful thighs and sensuous mouths\\" etc. Diane Galbaldon (could be incorrect spelling) writes well with very interesting characters and story lines but too sexually violent for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"hopless romantics will love it.","review":"If you are a hopeless romantic, like stories about princes and princesses and love a classic ending.

I have read other of her series, but none have the magic that I found in the Royal Cordina Family. I loved each character: Bennett, Camilla, Alex, Eve, Gabriella, Hannah and Reeves. Somehow this series stirs the fairy tale mystery that exists in all of us. I really wish Ms. Roberts would continue with the Cordina family series.

Once again there was a lot of things happen but it felt like they were trying to destract you from the charactors. I didn't like Bennett at all. Starting with his name and it went down from there. His treatment of Hannah after learning her true idenity comented my hate. I wished Hannah would have stabbed him with a knife. I did however enjoy Hannah thoroughly all of her working with the terrorities in order to bring them down was very exciting. It would have been fun to see series on Hannah's work. Now on to Camilla. Camilla was not a very exciting charactor she was very dull. Her beau Delaney was all right until he got all hung up on her lying about being a princess when he was lying about his own title. Its calling the kettle black and makes me lose all respect and like for the charactor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performance and durability! 5 years +","review":"I have had this razor for over five years and it still works great!

I found Scarlett's mistrust of Logan, in fact her entire man-phobia, to be irritating. Most of the townsfolk labeled her a crackpot, and I tended to agree. Why would someone as intelligent, handsome and decent as Logan fall for such a wacko? Surely not on the basis of a belly button ring and freckles, yet that is what we must believe to make this absurd plot work. Which makes one question Logan's IQ for pursuing her. When he becomes angry with Scarlett and walks off, I was praying he'd keep going and not come back! Not a good thing for a romance novel. Scarlett wasn't quirky, she was obnoxious and aggravating. Truly the first romance I've read where I wanted the hero to dump the heroine and tell her to get a life - without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and delightful to read","review":"Exactly what you expect from an author who is regarded as expert on the field.

I like them all for different reasons, even having never heard \\"Only You Know And I Know\\" before. The advantage here is that the studio versions of \\"Who Said I Would\\" and \\"Don't Lose My Number\\" are here, which both \\"Serious Hits...Live!\\" and \\"...Hits\\" do not have.

I switched out the band with an old goggle and it is a little more comfortable but the foam that JT uses around the goggle is not comfortable and will irritate your face.

I was a little disappointed at tghe theater's version too; as funny as everyone seems to think this is, gutter humor WITHOUT ANYTHING ELSE just gets tiresome. There is little to no intelligence behind this movie's humor, as opposed to a Will F. movie such as Weatherman which had some insightful comedy that was not ALL based on body parts. But if you liked the movie in the theaters, get the regular DVD version, don't pay extra for this widescreen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"A lot of hype surrounded this movie. Movie critics and audience exit interviews praised Will Ferrell for getting back on track after a couple of less then stellar showings (Anchor Man, Bewitched). I'd rate this film a lot closer to the lousy Anchor Man than the outrageously funny Old School or endearing Elf.I would have rated it one star, but an intriguing performance by Gary Cole saved the movie from being a complete waste of time - not by much, but just enough to get me to watch the whole thing.Someone who actually found this movie funny or even mildly entertaining will have to explain to me what they saw because I sure missed it.

I want my 5 buck rental back. This movie was about 40 minutes too long, and even then I'm being generous.There were some funny scenes; I thought them saying grace was great, but that's about 4 minutes out of 120 (for the uncut, unrated). But other than that, the stupid scenes in this movie are boundless.It had great potential too. Explore the innards of Nascar. But why go over the top? Guys like Christopher Guest can do satires without moving into the \\"stupid\\" category and his movies are brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse Will Ferrell Movie Every","review":"The Trailer for this movie was very promising and funny. Will Ferrell has proven he can make a good movie. Two examples are \\"Elf\\" and \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\". However, this is a prime example of how a bad 2 hour movie can seem like a bad 3 hour Movie. Some scenes just went on and on. And of course we have to see two men kissing in the mouth because for some reason that's suppose to be very funny. Thank God for \\"Fast Forward\\" buttons and \\"Rentals\\". I am sadden to think of all the small children which have been exposed to this movie, especially due to the NASCAR tie-in. I think Will Ferrell gets some kind of sick perverse high from making these kind of movies.

I'm not a big Will Ferrell fan, but I did like him in \\"Old School\\", and \\"Anchorman\\" was at least mildly amusing. After watching this, I think Will needs to go back to comedy college and take some courses over, because he is NOT nearly as funny as he is trying to be!. He took the film's premise, which wasn't bad, and wrecked it with his forced, badly timed, and overdone \\"comedy\\".

This movie had so much more potential than was ultimately realized. I remember first hearing of the movie's concept...Will Farrell playing a NASCAR driver. I laughed at the mere idea. When I found out that it was the same guy that directed \\"Anchorman\\", my anticipation only rose. I guess that's a part of the problem with anticipation: you can't help but be let down the majority of the time.Don't get me wrong, it's a funny movie with some very funny moments. However, being a PG-13 movie, the target audience is somewhat broad and I believe the humor (and it's subject matter) was toned down to have more appeal. Had this been an \\"R\\" rated movie in it's theatrical version, I imagine it would have been much more entertaining. I don't know if I can really recommend buying this movie. \\"Anchorman\\" was one of those comedies that you can watch over and over, catching new subtleties each time. \\"Talladega Nights\\"...not so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Will Ferrell Fodder","review":"Another movie where Will Ferrell runs around in his underwear. The \\"humor\\" is directed at 13 year olds and they'll probably sit there stone face. It's simply not a funny movie.

I expected a laugh or two for my money, Will Farrell's generally good for that, and was prepared to suffer through a lot to get them but this truly, deeply, achingly bad movie was one of the most egregious misfires to come down the pike since the Dumb & Dumber prequel. I'm not a comedy snob, I'll take laughs where I can get them, gags about bodily fluids, farts and amorous overweight old ladies not excluded, but this film oozed a stench that effectively covered anything resembling humor. This was one Blu-ray that went straight to the nearest Goodwill once I was done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A must see - One Time","review":"This movie is funny and entertaining.

I would definitely recommend seeing it once, but would only own it to loan out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncut yet still rated PG-13","review":"I like the movie, don't get me wrong- rented the uncut. Actually scenes were cut out of the version i remember seeing in the theater. Example.. When rickey is a small child and drives his mothers car. Not in the uncut.I noticed 2 scenes which were possibly additional. Rickey bobby delivering pizzas on a bus and talking to another passanger. Secondly before his nascar says \\"ME\\" on it, its advertising for male thongs. Thats it- Just buy the regular version. The deleted/extended scenes are 60% of the outtakes during the credits (various spinoffs of when Rickey was in the hospital) and an extended scene of when Rickey comes home and Cal married his wife.Just don't expect anything great on the uncut version... i do not think the uncut-ness would even make the movie approach an R rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"not my type","review":"I was told it was a great movie and when I got it was sorely dissappointed in it.

Not only was I laughing throughout the entirety of this movie, but at work the next day, all my co-workers could not stop talking about the movie. It's sure to be a classic for years to come.

The basic premise is that nascar is composed of a bunch of rednecks...but they fail to translate that into anything funny. Our main debate was whether this is the dumbest movie we've seen.

It was more insulting on many different levels. I wonder if the screen writer is Jewish, because they have a thing for making fun of everything Christian.

Some things that absolutely made no sense whatsoever. First, Ricky Bobby is kicked out of his own house by his ex-wife and best friend with their two sons. Imagine a divorce court that gives all the wealth, houses, cars, etc. and absolutely no child support for the parent who has custody.

Beyond the trailer, there was very little to laugh about. This seems to be a trend for Ferrell, with Anchorman and Kicking & Screaming turning out similarly. Talladega Nights seemed like a SNL skit that dragged on a little too long, with no logical conclusion. The concept is great, who doesn't want to laugh at NASCAR. The sport practically makes fun of itself, and Ferrell's Ricky Bobby is just the type of character we can laugh at. All is needed is a few more jokes and a solid story to tie it all together...that's where Talladega falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Talladega Nights","review":"Funny funny film.

His chemistry here with John C. Reilly is in full swing, as they feed off the energy of one another, belting out one ridiculous line after the other. Also magnificent is Sasha Cohen, who perfectly emulates the \\"uppity, sophisticated European\\", embodying the irrational fears of stubborn, backward rednecks everywhere. His antics are intentionally over the top, and it's a wonderful satire. Even minor roles, such as that of Ricky Bobby's father (played by the guy best known as \\"Lumbergh\\" in \\"Office Space\\") are outstanding, as he engages in such bizarre training methods as tying a kilo of cocaine to the underside of his son's car and calling the police about it (in order to encourage fast driving). For those who are a fan of \\"hard R\\", slapstick comedy, this is a MUST SEE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Southern Comfort","review":"Talladega Nights is a comedy with southern flavor. I loved it.

I have to say it is a very funny satire on the NASCAR/ Southern Culture. You have to have a light heart and open mind when watching this movie due to the digs on the uncultured, redneck lifestyle of the characters. It is really a funny movie in which I laughed so hard tears were streaming down my face. Pop some popcorn, get a cold one in a NASCAR koozie (I have a Daytona 500 one!)put in the movie and get ready to laugh. Will Ferrell is not one of my favorite people; but he does a fantastic job along with Leslie Bibb, and his best friend in the movie, John C. Reilly.

I'd give this no stars if I could. It was unrealistic and really not funny at all.I guess if you're the kind of person who likes lame slapstick comedies, you'll like this.

This movie is for the new-driver teen who thinks painting racing stripes on the car really makes it go faster. And comedies should be funny, right?Sad to think that there hasn't been good racing cinema (racing as central theme of a dramatic film, not documentary) since LeMans and Grand Prix -- 40-some years ago.

Yes, he was funny on SNL given the very limited playing time of sketch comedy. But this is feature film land here and he just isn't very funny over a 2-hour feature length film. My favorite part of the film was Gary Cole as Ricky Bobby's daddy. I don't think this man gets enough credit. He has given surprisingly daring, unpredictable performances in film as well as television for like the last 20 years. And I LOVE Sacha Baron Cohen, but disagree that he was so good in this film.

The scene with Ricky Bobby as a young boy driving his mother's car and the scene with Ricky Bobby's pitcrew working at a car wash was no where to be seen. Unfortunately as well the \\"additional scenes\\" added were the ones that show Will Ferrell dragging out jokes and pushing over the point of not being funny.

The notebook slides into the case fairly easily, but once it's in, the case grips the notebook so tightly that it is very difficult to remove it. The case is designed so that the zipper opening is a \\"clamshell\\" arrangement and the notebook is held in a thin elastic pocket in one of the case halves rather than more in the middle. You need to maneuver the notebook past the stiff material in the top of the case half and the zipper itself to remove it from the case.

I like to use the fine, gum tips and it worked nicely with good pressure.But within the first week the flow control button on the pic handle fell out. Cheap plastic design could not be repaired and reassembled. So I just put it back together and taped around the handle (black plastic tape-- not great for duct tape!!).Then it worked fine, though without flow shutoff control, for about 4 weeks until it started leaking water from where the hose enters the handle- spray pressure near zero. Not an easy patch for that one so I'm tossing the unit. Has some other design flaws that can be worked around but is just too poorly designed and constructed to last very long.Not worth buying. Try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help, I Can't Make It Stop","review":"This Water Jet has a button on the handle just like the WaterPic. You push it to temporarily stop the flow of water.

If you lack ordinary strength in your fingers stay away from this machine. I don't have a finger strength problem yet several times I've squirted water all over the bathroom because somehow I hadn't pushed hard enough on the stop button.I had purchased a WaterPik, but had trouble with it leaking, and so purchased this Conair.

In this case, it took a supreme level of dedication by the authors to produce this volume. Many other reviewers have given it 5 stars, so I'll avoid repeating them.The main virtue to me is the meticulous search for historical truth. Not easy, when facing incomplete official records that also were subject to shifts in method. The authors chose to go after ORIGINAL sources. While this limits their being complete (a bit much to expect in any ace study), what you do get has withstood their rigorous methodology: Brief ace profiles; an overview of Italian fighter operations; fresh photo illustrations; high quality a/c profiles -- that you can trust.There isn't much in English on Italian air ops, nor aces. So this entry not only breaks new ground for English-speakers, it is as authoritative as the best of any in the Osprey series."},{"rating":"1","title":"i don't like this","review":"This book is a wrong book for regia aeronautica.

We have since taped up the area around the clip to prevent the second hamster from doing the same. The other hamster seems to be enjoying the cage, but she misses her sister!

By this I mean the title track (don't look for it by either of the other \\"titles\\" I mentioned). The spectacle of Neil boppin' to a Supremes-style beat has only curiosity value, which lasts for only one playing. Then, who cares? Everything in here by Neil is nothing in comparison to what he gives us on his own albums. All of CSN(Y?)'s '90s albums reveal a band afraid of becoming '70s dinosaurs. The problem is, that's what they're best at. They ain't worth diddly as honorary gen-X'ers. I miss the REAL CSN, dammit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This album is, by and large, a useless mess. Neil Young had refused to reunite with CSN until David Crosby got his act together. Clearly this album is evidence that Neil never would have given that condition had he thought Crosby would get clean and sober, and even Mr. Young indulges in his worst tendencies here.

Back when this album was released, I didn't know who the hell Bill Clinton was. I thought the song to be loosedly aimed at Gary Hart. But what a difference a few years makes. Plus, the arrangement isn't exactly what we expect of CSN except for the vocal harmonies. Or of Neil Young, with his guitar-driven sound. Instead, what we get is a catchy flute or synth-flute riff over top of a bouncy Motown bass hook borrowed straight from \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\". After I bought the disc, I was going around whistling the flute part or scat-singing the bass part. And I'm a liberal, no less!"},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring and relevant","review":"While I largely agree with the Publisher's Weekly review, I did not find Chernin's writings loosley structured. This book moved logically through the author's journey to find the missing links that connect women to the diety in whose image they are created. She kept her explorations balanced with the solid theories of Freud and Jung while delving into areas many traditionalists might shudder to think of. (And as a long-time frowner upon p...-envy theories, I am happy to see a legitimate alternative appear.) If nothing else, this book inspires the reader to question the traditional creation stories and lays the foundation for women to reclaim their power in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just data binding","review":"This book is about so much more than data binding.

I have been doing this type of software development for 15 years and have read many similar books and rate this among the best I've encountered. My only word of warning would be that it is not for the faint of heart when it comes to object oriented concepts.

She took the manners tips from this book and turned it into a tongue-in-cheek book. The problem is that the tips are written in the 1802 form so that a young reader will read things like \\"Sit not down till thou art bidden by thy parents or superiors\\". The child is supposed to read this old style English and then notice that the accompanying illustration shows the host breaking the rule. Frankly, it was not easy to determine who were the hosts and who the guests, nor is it that obvious as to who is doing what, including pets who are somehow included in the illustration also involved in the breaking of the rules.

I have only used it once because she woke up in the middle of the night when she rolled out of the bed. After that it was back to the pack and play. It does have 4\\" high sides but they are rounded. So they are easy to roll over - not like a straight wall. Easy to pump up and deflate... great size. But don't rely on those walls.. pretty useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but close...","review":"After I read the reviews, I was expecting perfection. It is a great bed for toddlers when you travel, however, it squeaked every time my daughter moved. She is a light sleeper and tends to move around a lot, so this woke her up often. It does have a great soft cover though that helps somewhat. It will def. serve the purpose that we need it for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aero Bed for Kids","review":"Great product and can hold more weight than advertised. It says 150 pounds max but I fell asleep with my little one and I am over 200 pounds and it did fine. We purchased a memory foam and cut it to the inner bed size to fill in the gaps from the individual air chambers and it was dreamy! The little one seems to think this is a trampoline also and it does fine. The air attachment is awesome and makes it very easy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Travel Bed!","review":"We purchased this toddler travel bed because our 2 1/2 year old son couldn't fit into his Pack N Play anymore. I didn't know what to use but then I found this wonderful Aerobed on Amazon. This was a fanastic purchase! Our son loved his \\"big boy bed\\" and the fleece cover that goes with it is so soft. It blows up in about 30 seconds and deflates very easily. And we love the travel bag it comes in. Takes up very little room in the car. I give this product 5++++ stars. And look forward to using it on our many upcoming trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little bed!!","review":"We purchased these beds for \\"sleepovers\\" for our oldest grandsons (ages 3 and 4). They love their beds and, with the higher sides, we have no problems with them rolling off (like we did with previous air-type beds). Plus, they're easy to set up, fold up and store. We will, no doubt, be purchasing two more when the other two grandsons are out of their cribs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Choice for Toddlers","review":"My son and I visit my Mother in North Carolina frequently. Over Christmas, she had a house full of family, so we decided to order the Aerobed for Kids for my almost 3 year old son. He LOVED it! It was very easy to inflate. The mattress pad that was included is thick and soft, so after washing, we just used that as the sheet. We just added a pillow for him and a blanket and he was snuggled in for night and also for naps during the day. I highly recommend this for anyone with a toddler that travels, or needs extra beds!DebbieMassachusetts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now he won't go in his regular bed!","review":"We bought this for use for sleepovers at his Oma's as she doesn't like keeping our son (almost 2.5) 's crib up and it's a pain to put it up everytime, and now that we've converted his home crib to a toddler bed he hate's being contained....Got the package, opened it up to try it out- Son was very afraid of the pump as it sounds like a vacuum cleaner...Easy quick assembly- threw on the cover (a really soft and plush fleece cover, with straps that go all the way around for comfort and safety-and a really cheerful and cute pattern-definitely gender neutral) and he got right on and then gave us a big fight when we wanted him to sleep in his regular bed and had a fit when we deflated it, rolled it up, put it in it's bag, and put it away...So I'm saying this is an A+++++++++++++product! With quick and reliable delivery by Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The LOUDEST bed ever!","review":"I bought this travel bed for my 4 year old daughter after researching and reading all the reviews. I thought I made a good choice but the first night we used it, I realized it was a mistake. It was so LOUD! Every time my daughter turned, it would squeak so loudly it woke every one up, including my daughter. She refused to sleep on it the next night because it was so loud. I finally convinced her to go back on it by putting 2 extra comforters under the fitted. It made it a little better but still, it was loud.

Even though the girls are quite passive, all the other beds failed the longievity test.

We were able to patch the hole, but I was a bit upset that it happened. Once we returned home, I went to Amazon's return site and was able to exchange the defective bed for a new one. I was very impressed with how quickly I received the new bed. I have not had any problems with the new bed thus far, and we travel quite abit. I would definately recommend this to any of my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the Toddler on the Go","review":"My 2.5 year old daughter loves this bed; I love it, too.1) It is inflatable, so I can make it as firm as I like for her.2) The motor attaches and detaches, so nothing electrical remains on my little girl's bed.3) The sides are raised, preventing roll-outs. This makes it feel more like her toddler bed.4) The whole thing fits into a duffel-bag, which comes with the unit. Self-contained!5) At around $50, this bed is a great deal! I even bought a second, 6-months later, for her cousin to use.I highly recommend this bed.

When we went to my mom's, he liked the excitement of the new bed. However, he quickly mastered the rolling over edges part.

It was wonderful. It keeps her and her dolly from falling off in the middle of the night and it is not too big for the room. In the morning I can deflate it, or stand it up on its side.

It's just awful and impossible for my grandson (who is 2) or anyone else in the room, to sleep. The loud screeching noise every time there was movement was unbearable. I put a rug under it - I put a mattress pad inbetween the cover and plastic - nothing worked! The \\"5 star\\" rating that everyone gave it was the reason I purchased it. I'd send it back but the box was thrown away before the bed was used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bed is fantastic for kids!","review":"We like to travel and decided to purchased this product for our son. He is just under 3 years old and he loved it. As soon as we filled it with air, which was simple and quick, he laid down on it asking for his pillow, blanket and his stuffed animal.

We are thrilled with it...and as usual amazon.com had the best price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed!!!!","review":"Awesome bed and perfect size for vacation. Some reviewers have complained about the noise this bed makes and mentioned that it doesn't have the soft/suede top that other airbeds have. First of all the noise really isn't that loud. Secondly, I personally am glad this bed doesn't have the soft/suede top in case either of my children have an accident in their sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comfy travel bed","review":"We ordered two of these beds for our 2 year old twins for traveling. The bed is portable, inflates and deflates quickly and is a perfect size-- there is room to grow and I'm sure we'll get a few more years out of them. The raised edge is not as high as we expected, but after using the bed, I've concluded that it's high enough to keep a toddler in once asleep. (If your tot is like my twins, they like to jump on the bed and the slight raised edge is no match here! Luckily,the bed seems to be durable enough to withstand their bed flops) The soft fabric cover it comes with is a really nice touch. And we found these beds did not have that overpowering \\"plastic\\" smell that some inflatable beds have. The best part is that the beds inflate using a removable power source- it disconnects so that you don't have to worry about your tot playing with the controls, or worse, the plug, during the night. Overall a great bed that we have already used a number of times while visiting relatives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bigger than expected","review":"Great little bed!

The kids like it - however if you have a restless sleeper and they are in the same room as you with this bed don't plan on getting much sleep. Every move they make is very loud. We listened to our daughter move around on it for 2 hours before we moved her off the mattress and onto the floor. Would be fine if the bed was in a different room where you couldn't hear noise from movements."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful option for toddlers!","review":"I purchased this bed for a week long vacation with my toddler and she slept like a baby the entire trip!

She has grown out of her pack-n-play but not big enough for an adult bed without rails when we travel. We love it. It is easy to use and inflates in less than a minute. She feels special and loves to use it.Overall, it is well built and sturdy. It is a little heavy and awkward for packing. However, after two years of toting around a pack-n-play this is nothing. Worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as described.","review":"Giving it only 4 stars as it does make quite a bit of noise as my granddaughter moves around on it. Sounds like any other air mattress! But she does sleep on it and it is easy to set up and take down and it is easy to move from room to room. It appears to be quality made and should hold up for many years. Don't really think the raised edges have much benefit as she tries to sleep on top of them. Knowing what I know now, would probably purchase an Aerobed twin size as one of us would like to lay down with her sometimes and the weight limit on the toddler bed is only 150 lbs. and we can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love its size and quality!","review":"I bought this bed to travel with my 2-yr-old who is growing taller and taller each day. The pack and play doesn't cut it any longer. It is soooo fast to inflate (under a minute) and has its own carrying bag and fleece cover which is fabulous as well. So simple to deflate and repack, that takes less than a minute, too! It is a little larger than I expected but with the way he moves at night, it is perfect in size after all. Wouldn't trade it for anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing little bed","review":"This little bed is amazing. We needed more sleeping room after my grandson outgrew the porta crib.

I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AeroBed for Kids","review":"I ordered bed for my two year old grandchild. Set up was very easy; cover which came with bed was nice and a twin sheet fit perfect. The only draw back was she was still able to roll out of bed during the night, the sides are very low. Since the bed is not very high and I have deep pile carpet no harm was done. One might want to put additional barriers or padding around bed if placed on tile or hardwood floor.My grand daughter did love the bed and insisted on taking it home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bed!","review":"We love this bed. We have two and they are happily used by boys, age 2 1/2 and 4 1/2.

My son loves it, so it makes bedtime away from home a lot easier. Definitely a worthwhile purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"KIDS JUST LOVE THIS!","review":"I bought this mattress for the grandchildren to sleep on when they visit. My daughter's two little girls (age 3 and 2) loved this mattress so much that my daughter took it home and the girls insist on taking turns sleeping on it at every night rather then in their very nice beds. Surprisingly, it could easily hold anyone under about 60 inches. Can't recommend it highly enough - it is a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept but VERY NOISY!","review":"We bought this for when our 2-year-old granddaughter visits. It fits nicely between the regular bed and dresser in the guest bedroom, it's super easy to inflate and deflate, and comes with a cozy fleece cover in a fun print. But I have to agree with a previous reviewer, the slightest move results in a LOUD rubbing-plastic noise, I mean loud enough to wake not only my granddaughter but her parents sleeping in the regular bed beside her. And young children tend to move around lot during the night! We have already discarded the box and packaging so I'm not sure we can even return it after all this time. Next visit we plan to give it one more try by varying the amount of inflation, but right now it's 'thumbs down' by everyone in the family, especially when it wakes the toddler up at 5 AM and she doesn't want to go back to sleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This bed never held air very well","review":"I purchased this bed for my daughter's first Brownie overnight.

Yeah, there were some noise when he moved around (what others have been complaining about) but not as bad as they are making it seem...plus I have been on other inflatable beds that make the same amount of noise.

Not only is it a great bed but the bumpers around the edge are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two thumbs up!","review":"This is a great Aerobed. My 3 year old loves this thing and insists we bring it everywhere which requires a sleepover. It inflates very quickly, easily deflates because of the large mouth, has a nice, soft and fitted sheet that doesn't come off easily and has a raised border which prevents the little ones from rolling off of it.I've fallen asleep on this (while putting my daughter to sleep) and even I find it comfy. When I lent this to my sister in law however, her only grievance was that the power supply was not dual-voltage, meaning she had to borrow a power adapter when she used it in Asia, as most Asian countries use 220V instead of 110V.I wouldn't encourage kids to jump on this (the instructions implicitly say not to) but mine has on many occasions and it's still puncture-free, which tells me this is made tough.Great product, well-thought out and definitely something every home with toddlers should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it so far!","review":"My 2 and a half year old was not in a bed yet but the pack and play didn't give her enough room to move around so I wasn't sure what we were going to do for vacation. This was perfect for us. Even my 6 year old could sleep on it. We have another aerobed mattress that has held up wonderfully for the last 4 years (knock on wood)so we are hoping for the same experience with this one as well. I definitely recommend this product. The cover is very soft and washed up very nicely. The bag won't hold up very long but it'll fit into something else I'm sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for 18 month old","review":"We bought this for our 18 month old since she is too long for her Pack n' Play. We love it. We've used it on 3 vacations now and she has slept great. She only rolled out once and it didn't even wake her up. It's actaully not as far off of the ground as it appears in the picture. The mattress is extremely easy to use and inflates and deflates in seconds. It does make a little bit of a squeaking sound against the sheet and I was worried this would wake up our semi-light sleeper. But if you inflate it really full and put a mattress pad inbetween the sheet and the bed, then the squeaking is minimal. Also, it says the weight limit is 150 pounds, but I've slept in it very comfortably with my daughter and together we are 170 pounds. Definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerobed for Kids","review":"This is a great bed and my child felt comfortable in it right away.

The only negative is that it is a bit bulky inside our suitcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Travel!!","review":"I purchased this for my 2 1/2 yr old daughter to use on a trip to Grandma & Grandpa's house. She loved the soft fitted sheet (it's very soft fleece like material), and she loved the moon/star design too. It was EASY to pump up (and fast - 1 minutes!), and EASY to deflate. The bed was comfortable for her, and she slept through the night on it just as good as she does on her toddler bed at home! I love it, and it's very convenient to take on trips. The bag to carry it in was too flimsy to check as is on the plane, so we put the entire bed/bag into another luggage type bag to be safe. I didn't want to damage the product before I had even used it. We plan on taking it for her on every trip we go on until she outgrows it! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really like it!","review":"This little bed is great! I bought it for my two-and-a-half year old daughter to use at our friend's house when my husband and I went away for our anniversary. She stayed in the bed and slept great in it. We plan on taking it with us on a trip back east in May for her to sleep on while at relatives. It's not too heavy, rolls up really easy, pumps up really fast, and is very sturdy. I didn't give it four stars because the cover is made of heavy weight fleece, although this doesn't affect the function of the bed at all. It will be fine in our high desert winters, but in the 105 degree heat of summer, it's going to be WAY too hot for her to sleep on when she needs too. I really wish Aerobed would have provided a traditional cotton sheet to go with this bed. I'm going to try to make a slip cover for it out of a fitted twin sheet. We'll see how that goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Travel Bed!","review":"We travel a lot and our toddler was getting too big for the pack n play so this was the best price and purchase for her (and us :) to get a good night's sleep!

Unfortunatly there were only 2 beds in the kids room at the vacation house. It was so easy to use. I attached the pump to the valve, plugged it in and in less than 30 seconds it was inflated.

We used this on a trip we took and the raised edges work wonders to keep him on the mattress!

All in all, I'd definatly buy this mattress again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Traveling","review":"I purchased this bed for my 4 yr old daughter to spend the night at the grandparents. It's very light and easy to travel with plus is simple to set up. My daughter loves the bed and it makes her feel special to have her own place to sleep when away from home and Mom & Dad. The bed is very comfortable and just the right size for the little ones. It seems very durable and has survived several jumping sessions when I am not looking. I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"Took the bed out of the box, attached the pump as directed within 2 minutes stopped inflating and the pump began to smoke. Called Aero customer service to get a new pump since I had ordered the bed for my granddaughter to sleep in that night. Took 20 minutes on hold to get some one to answer on June 28. Their customer service could not even tell me who might carry a pump to buy locally- I am in Chicago! Everyone he mentioned was online only! Not much help for that day. Finally sent me a pump overnight! But it was not of the same quality - I had to buy rechargeable batteries and charge up. This bed is going back to Amazon and will not buy another Aero bed that does not have a pump built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazed mom","review":"This product I feel is excellent.

Keeps him from following of. Very cool feature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beware-Box says for 3 year olds and up","review":"I bought this bed because I thought it would be an alternative to the portable play yard that my 2 year old son HATES. I read the information on Amazon about this bed and read some of the reviews. There was not one word about this bed being for kids 3 and older. So, I ordered the bed and the first thing I notice on the box is \\"For ages 3+\\". I feel that this information should be in bold letters right next to the name of the bed. All that being said, I am trying it out right now with him for his naps. He fell asleep pretty quickly and is sleeping pretty sound. I am happy so far.So, now we are a few months down the road and he is doing okay with it. He sleeps really well, but because we use it a grandma's house and when we travel he has trouble sleeping through the night. I don't think it is because of the bed. I think it is because he is scared of where he is sleeping, not what he is sleeping on."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome bed!","review":"This bed worked exactly how I hoped it would. My daughter (3 yrs.old) and I are staying at my grandparents house and I really needed a decent but portable bed for her. I tried a few other blow up beds but my daughter is very restless and actually rolled off of them. Having her sleep in bed with me was hard because of her restlessness. So I searched online and convinced my husband to let me buy this one and boy am I glad he did. The raised sides have stopped her from rolling off and she loves the bed. I love that it came with it's own sheet too so that I didn't have to find one. Blowing it up is extremely easy and so is taking it down. I could have it completely blown up and then completely taken down and rolled up in almost a minute.It was a little bit bigger then I expected but I'm not complaining anymore. My daughter will be able to use it for our next few visits here and then my son will be able to use it too. It also came with a 2 or 3 patches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick Inflation","review":"The pump inflates this thing in well under a minute. Great for travel.

As soon as it was received I inflated for my 3 yr. old Granddaughter to sleep on. It was not up for more than 20 minutes before it started deflating.It does not hold air and I cannot find any leaks. The worse part is it can not be returned to Amazon beacause of sanitary reasons. I got in touch with areobed but it turned into a hassel, so now I am stuck with a deflating, defective areobed and a disappointed Grandchild."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this for my son who's 4 1/2 years old to use on our trip. The pump makes a very loud and annoying sound when it thinks the mattress is full. Ours never fully inflated. I tried unplugging the pump and plugging it back in but it wouldn't inflate any further. He slept on it inflated to about 90% and said it was just \\"OK\\" but when he wanted to take a nap he stated he wanted to \\"lay in the big bed to be more comfortable\\". Now we're home and I wanted to set it up to use in my bedroom since he sometimes comes in during the middle of the night. Now it won't inflate at all. I turn it on and it immediately starts making the sound it makes when it's full and it doesn't have a drop of air in it. I'm really disappointed. And I can't return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells terrible!","review":"We've had other aero beds we had no problem with, and the design and comfort of this bed are great. BUT, the PVC off-gassing is just horrendous. We've had it for a year. We left it outside to air for months last summer. We just tried to use it last night and finally packed it back into the bag and asked the hotel for a cot instead because we all had headaches from the terrible smell. I certainly can't breathe easily with my little one's face pressed into off-gassing PVC like that. I'm getting rid of mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so happy","review":"Although I bought this bed for my dog, as she is getting old and has arthritis, I was hoping it would of lasted longer than it has. She didn't abuse it any more than a child would under normal circumstances, probably even less since all she does is get in and out of it. One of the center seams popped out and it is unusable now. I've only had it since September. I do own other Aerobeds and they have been fabulous and lasted a long long time. I'm very disappointed in this one. For the money that I spent on it, it should have lasted longer than 5 months. They should put that felt stuff on the one side, like they do with the bigger beds. It seems to be much sturdier. I will know not to buy something like this at Amazon so that I could have returned it after 30 days."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of trash","review":"I've owned two of these mattresses over the last five years. The first one started leaking. Being a bit lazy (and a bit rich), I didn't bother to return it; I just bought a new one. It also began leaking after a short while. Aerobed makes a crappy product, pure and simple. It's way too flimsy to expect it to hold up under normal wear and tear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pump","review":"Product was shipped without the air pump. Basically useless without it.

Great product, I'd buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much NOISE!","review":"We have two of these mattress, but I cannot recommend them to anyone who wants to actually sleep! For some reason they make all kinds of noise - it doesn't matter if its on hard wood flooring or carpet with heavy padding, each time your child moves it will make so much noise everyone in the room will hear it.We've used all kinds of air mattresses - even larger AeroBeds and have never experienced this before - but for some reason these make so much noise I just can't recommend them! I mentioned this to a friend who has one also and she concurred so I don't think I received a bad batch - just a bad design!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for any purpose you can think of","review":"I have been an owner of two of these beds for over two years now. We have used them in every kind of situation you can think of, in hotels, at grandmas, camping, etc. They are well worth the money, and have held up to both of my kids use.

Even my very tall daughter, who is the size of a 9 year old, still fits on hers!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just perfect","review":"This travel bed is just what I was looking for - good quality, stores compactly, easy to inflate and deflate and most of all, comfortable for my son.

We are very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful little AeroBed","review":"This little AeroBed is perfect for a toddler. Our five year old fits perfectly and the bed has a raised edge that keeps her from rolling on the floor. Unlike many other AeroBeds, this one doesn't have the pump integrated into the bed. It attaches and turns on, but works the same as the full size models. That cover included is very nice and my daughter loves it. She prefers this bed to sleeping on the hotel bed when we travel! Only caution I have is that the plastic does make some noise at night when your child shifts around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had a hole in it when it came out of the box!","review":"We owned one of these and had it for a couple of years before it developed a hole. This one, however, had a hole in it when we took it out of the box! And because we didn't use it as soon as we bought it we are stuck with it. The hole is where a patch just will not fix it so total waste of $$. If you buy one test the mattress as soon as you get it!

These warnings were not given either in the product description or in other reviews. I will keep the bed to use in the future, but now I will have to purchase something to use for the next two years.

A standard crib sheet will not fit on this mattress. It does inflate in about one minute, and is very sturdy for an air mattress. The sheet it comes with is super cute and very soft. Be sure you have enough time to wash the sheet before using, because it has a strong newly-manufactured vinyl smell to it right out of the box. We actually aired the mattress and sheet outside before using it and before washing it. My son(almost three)likes to sleep on it, but still would rather sleep with Grandma and Papa when they visit."},{"rating":"2","title":"great spare bed","review":"This bed takes up little room when you don't need it, but is perfect when you have an extra guest.

They LOVE it. It's very comfortable, the perfect size for kids up to 7, maybe older if they're short, and my daughter wants to sleep on it at home, too.

The sheet has straps that keep it in place as well - I thought that was a nice touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Purchase of Beds- Disappointed","review":"This is the second time I have purchased these beds and they are just not the same as the first set. Unfortunately we mistakenly left our first two beds behind on a camping trip. Our original set was great. We used them many times without a problem. I cannot say the same for our recent purchase. As others have stated, they are incredibly loud. If you are a light sleeper, you will not be able to sleep in the same room with your child in these beds. Every time they shift or roll-over they make a horribly loud noise. I have tried piling on additional blankets and comforters on top, which hasn't worked. Additionally, after only 2 or 3 uses one of them will not hold air. These beds are going in the trash and will be replaced by something less expensive and quieter. I have always had good luck with Aero beds, but these beds have made me think twice about buying the Aero brand again due to inconsistent quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect alt to Pack-n-play during travel","review":"This bed is perfect for kids too big for a pack-n-play but not ready for a \\"big\\" bed while traveling.

Good price on Amazon as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A life saver!","review":"Traveling with a 6 year old and a 2 year old, I have to say that this thing helped out so much. It was comfy and the fitted fleece cover was cute and soft.. the raised edges kept my 2 year old from rolling off. My in-laws have all-tile floors so even making a pallet of blankets on the floor wasn't really a good option. This was perfect. It did take up a chunk of a suitcase but it is light and easy and SO WORTH IT. Highly recommend this for travelers with small children. Oh, and my 6 1/2 year old boy really wanted to sleep on it instead of the sofa bed. He's small for his age but he would have had no problem making this his bed. We will get years of use out of this with all family living out of town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine for my sons who toss & turn","review":"I like these Aerobeds. My mother purchased 2 of them and they have seen a lot of use. My sons (2 & 4) toss and turn and the raised walls help to keep them in. Yeah, if you have a crazy sleeper then they will probably get out. (We have a Thomas inflatable bed that they can't even use because they roll right off). I would save the pack & play for the infants though. It makes a little noise- like ANY inflatable bed does! I think they are a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerobed for kids","review":"Like every Aerobed product I have used, it was easy to fill & it stays filled.

However this book on child rearing is awful. Let me explain why.... The book is loaded with psycho babble and politically correct themes that mean nothing. If you read chapter 1 and Chapter 2 and then ask yourself, what did I learn? You will have to say, uh.. nothing. Chapter 3 is where it should start getting interesting, and although the topic \\"unconscious parenting\\" is a good one, there is too darn much fluff.Getting the Love You Want was short and to the point. I think this book, Giving the Love that Heals, could have been 1/3 the length of what it is. We are a busy people, and shouldn't have to put up with writing that says nothing.

While some parts of the book were counter-intuitive (when you're angry, look at the child's side) they really do work.

However, I was disappointed with the deck after I got it home. The author's interpretations for some cards leave much to be desired, having a paragraph's worth of rendering for some cards, and a single sentence for others. Also, on some of the Minor cards like Swords and Coins, you have only a picture of the element itself -- no \\"scene\\" to spark your imagination or intuition. Just a picture of some swords and some coins. What gives? You get the feeling that the author got tired of his otherwise creative process. I took this deck back to the store the next day for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Accomplishment","review":"This deck is truly inspired and will be especially appreciated by Christian Mystics. The illustrations are beautiful and appealing in both realistic and symbolic meaning. The companion book is well written and clearly shows how early Christianity played a major role in tarot symbology.While we know that the Trumps are meant to form a progression with each one triumphing over its predeccessor, we find in the Tarot of the Saints that each saint also represents a triumph in him-or herself; sometimes this struggle was with evil, and sometimes the struggle was with the saint's own inner nature and the victory was the spiritual transformation of the self. This in itself adds another unique dimension to these cards.I also found the readings to be very accurate. I HIGHLY recommend this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the paperback......at your library book sale","review":"I will give this author two stars - one for finding a publisher willing to print this material and one for some interesting military science fiction.

Too much cost-cutting by Sony.","review":"I totally concur with the previous reviewer. For me the consequence of the hard-wired speakers and the fact that the speaker wire is the smallest guage possible was that one of the wires tore out of the back of the speaker. No way to fix or splice it. Well, I didn't like the speakers anyway and thought getting a receiver for under $200 wasn't bad but, yep, I ran out of inputs (I agree, this receiver has the fewest I've ever seen). So I threw out the speakers almost immediately and I sold the receiver out of my garage for $25 4 months later.

The guitar craft style and its practitioners have some nice stuff and good technique within the realm that they explore, but they are really far from being complete guitarists. Any great classical musician and/or teacher likes to use this kind of playing as an example of something to avoid falling into. My teacher did. Hardly a shred of passion or personality to be found in even the best guitar craft musicians... and their technique is actually not that amazing. I've played with players that can play far better in every respect. Sometimes we would sit around and imitate the Fripp technique just to illustrate how far from elegant that kind of playing actually is..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well presented and easy to understand","review":"This book is excellent!!.

The first day I used it, it developed teeny holes in the fabric--and the lightest breeze (not even a wind and I live in Chicago and know from wind), would flip it inside out. Well, I thought, maybe that was then. The second day, was more of the same. The manufacturer 'gave' me a new one--which I will use and see, if it was a one time problem--or systemic.

Not really any good pictures either. Basically it's just way too fluffy. I'm completely fascinated by the subject but this really only gives you names, dates and locations not much detail and absolutely no analysis. And its choice of storys is really odd. It's a sort of greatest hits that you already know about and obscure stories you don't care about, with everything inbetween left out. Where's Robert Smithson's plane crash or Bas Jan Ader's ill fated attempt to cross the Atlantic in a row boat? As for the serial killer art and motion picture deaths.

Emerson suffers from the basic malady found in both his series of murder mysteries featuring the male characters Mac Fontana and Thomas Black (as well as the insipid female, Kathy). Enjoyment of these works is greatly impared by a pervasive macho stupidity. All of the stories convey \\"...a false sense of charisma\\" (Morons and Madmen. Earl Emerson. 1993:156) embodied in the male protaganists. An obsession with female breasts and sexual conquests bring a derisive burden to an otherwise interesting story. Insensitive, sexist commentary from a supposed studly point of view mars otherwise accomplished writing skills. The conflict always seems to revolve around men \\"...whose macho territory has been invaded by women\\" (ibid, page 175)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Records","review":"This is a delightful book, especially for folks from and fond of the Midwest. I have to say, being from the East Coast, the book lacked the frantic energy I experience in daily life.

Ben Sherwood, though, not only made this plot work, he made it soar. \\"The Man Who Ate the 747\\" is one of the most romantic, funniest, wittiest books that I've read in quite some time. Sherwood infuses more honest romance into an egg tossing scene than most writers can do wth a bedroom filled with candles. The writer also has a great command not only of language but of voice and an enviable eye for detail. Unless I miss my guess, we are seeing the first effort here from a major talent who will one day take his place among John Irving and Christopher Buckley as writers who have not only mastered the slightly offbeat plots but people them with larger than life characters that make them downright magical."},{"rating":"1","title":"It takes off smoothly, hits turbulence, and crashes","review":"I enjoyed the first two thirds of this novel. Ben Sherwood is clever and humorous and his prose is quite readable.I found the last part of the book, though, to be an emotional roller coaster, breaking the record for the longest roller coaster (the \\"Steel Dragon 2000\\" in Japan, 8133 feet).

Willa Wyatt, the focus of affection, is worried that J.J. and the subsequent hoard of media will spoil the serene life of Superior, Nebraska.

I grew up 15 miles from the real Superior, Nebraska, and although Sherwood got the geography right, he completely missed the mark with his characters. Guess what? Those of us who live in the Heartland are not caricatures. We don't have ridiculous-sounding names, don't wear new overalls as our \\"Sunday Best\\" and don't host parades every time a \\"New Yorker\\" comes to town.The details about agriculture were way off...obviously just thrown in to make the story seem as if it were authentic. A five-minute check could have saved those simple mistakes, but nothing will change the stereotypes that abound. It's too bad, because the premise of the story is unique and the humor is well-done.

I myself am a vampirologist and bonded very quickly with the main character, an expert in the field of mythology who has been re-assigned to a black ops team that is going to capture a den of vampires to see if they can be trained and used for military purposes. He and I had many of the same questions and concerns.This was a very brilliant and original story line. His vampires are his own, not a rehash of what everyone else is writing. It gave me a definite feel of how the military works and how a person survives in it.

All the voice actors came back to do their characters from Beast Wars!2. The animation was excellent!3. The action was hardcore!4. The new technorganic bodies were cool!What I didn't like are mostly questions:1. Why does Optimus Primal and the Maximals NEED to restore the organic life toCybertron?2. Why does Megatron all of a sudden hate indavidual minds and organic life?3. How did Waspinator actually get back to Cybertron?4. Most of the first season's action sequences were chases!The concepts were fun to follow, but not enough insight info on the plots!Overall: Beast Machines was memorable, for the most part!My grade: B or three-and-a-half stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great, but still buyable","review":"The Release date for this item has been officially pushed back to 02/28/06. Although Rhino has been good about getting other TF series out, unfortunately since they are a relatively small distributor, their products suffer from major delays (its been a year since their last relase which was part 1 of Armada).Although this series was mired in philosophical drivel, and the re-writing of the TF universe (presenting an \\"organic\\" Cybertron which never really existed) I'll still be adding it to my collection as I am a TF animated completist. To be fair, although the series as a whole as a major letdown, there were a couple of individual stories and plot devices which were admiable mentions, since of course they were all taken from the Original TF series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run!

The evil Megatron seeks to destroy the Maximals because... um, I think because their animation and robot-forms suddenly look like crap. He's also really angry and wants to take over all of Cybertron because any sense of continuity the planet or series once had got really messed up by bad writers that couldn't live up to Larry DiTillio and Bob Forward. That's right, jettison the guys who helped make Babylon 5 memorable, get some cheap hacks, and stretch a 3-episode story stretch over two seasons. THERE's a recipe for success.

If you take the series for what it is, instead of looking at what came before it (come on, Generation 1, despite it's classic status, was poorly animated and the plots were horrid.)

When the show ended there was much closure and it felt complete. Then came along this show, which effectively ruins the ending of Beast Wars and makes everything depressing.

It seemed there could have been so much more yet all we got was surface descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimately disappointing","review":"As a tap dancer and as someone who loves both New York and New Orleans, I really wanted to like this book. It just left me cold. Maybe it was that her obsessive search for an orgasm was such a lame metaphor. Maybe it was her complete self-absorption. Maybe it was the fact that her father seemed to be a much, much more interesting character than she was, and yet he wasn't given nearly as much play. While it definitely has its moments, this book is ultimately a disappointment. And when she finally HAS an orgasm, my guess is most readers will say \\"so what?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Story and Life","review":"Her name isn't even Alice and although the title implies a life of fantasy this is anything but! From an oddly close relationship with her estranged father to her search for an orgasm, this book stops along the road of life to examine street performers in both New York and New Orleans.The poverty is abject, the obsession to tap dance compulsive yet there is a charm and adventure to this memoir that would entice anyone to go along for the ride. The colorful cast of characters are real people with personalities that often fit classic stereotypes. This book makes one realize how one can become trapped in a lifestyle joined as a lark by lack of money to get out. I look forward to a sequel to find out when Alice became Mandy and how her life changed dramatically."},{"rating":"1","title":"a major problem","review":"I needed a new atomic travel clock this one looked good at a good price. it worked as soon as I put in the battery, found what zone I was in, has a very good display and as i am visually impaired that is a very important plus.

There is no button on this - the little spot on top which says \\"press\\" does absolutely nothing. so here I was with a clock and no easy back light.

When the DVD's on, the volume is ten times louder. Also, the DVD player's \\"display\\" does not show you how much time is left on whatever you're watching. If you want to know how much time is left on a movie, you'd have to use a little math as it only shows you how much time has elapsed. Especially annoying when you're watching a DVD extra with no idea how long it is.

Most of the book is conjecture, and opinion. There is very little evidence of any research going into this title. Not a single outside source, article or book is cited. I think you can learn more about contemporary American furniture design from browsing eBay furniture auctions or reading furniture store catalogs than reading this book.The only good content is the occasional biography of current designers, and these are few and far between. The books places emphasis on upcoming \\"third generation\\" designers, but really fails to discuss where they will come from or what is in store for American design.I felt like the editors just wanted to put together a fantasy catalog of items they would like to have in their homes, and the book lacks an altogether purpose.And to top it all off, the design and layout is sub-standard for such a remarkable subject.

There is abased and opinionated imagination which truly leads nowhere and in general the book does not act as a helper in the Christians walk. I see this book as a blatant work of opinion that has no grounding to bring us edification. As a practicing Christain it is difficult for me to assign a bad book review, I won't even reiterate what others have said, this book does not even properly inform.

This book does neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart, compelling fiction","review":"I was familiar with some of D'Erasmo's writing in the Voice, and so I looked forward to reading Tea. Simply put, this is a terrific novel; it was compulsively readable and struck a perfect balance between detached third-person narration and the at times overwhelming emotions of Isabel, its protagonist. There wasn't an overabundance of attention on the establishment of Isabel's sexual identity, and I liked that D'Erasmo focused instead on other aspects of character development. The book's sharp humor appealed to me, and overall, this was a relatively quick but still satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rather overworked theme; nothing spectacluar","review":"I bought this book based on the back blurb, but I think that whoever wrote that description didn't read much more than 2 chapters in. Character development was rather weak (especially for Isabel's mother, on whom the plot should seemingly hinge, vis a vis her daughter), and the timeline of events is somewhat chopped up because of the great jumps in time between each section of the book. Basically, there are other stories of this ilk that have been written better, and you wouldn't miss much by passing up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"dilute","review":"written well enough, but a pretty exhausted theme and flat, undeveloped characters. not really worth the bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This \\"Tea\\" is too weak for for me!","review":"While this book has gotten some strong regonition and kudos in the community it did nothing for me. The book is more character than plot driven, and the characters are not that interesting! I really thought this book would focus more on Isabel and her relationship whith her mother as she relects back on her time spent with her as she grows up. And how that relationship shapes her adult life as a lesbian. Her mother's death should be a catlyst but is a rather flat, useless side note. I kept expecting this book to take off like a rocket but it keeps plodding along like a farm tractor on a empty field.

I found myself wanting to toss it after a chapter or two, but kept on because I was on vacation and too lazy to pick another book. I kept hoping Isabel would grow up and redeem herself or at least grow up, but she remained a shallow, unpleasant character in a shallow, boring book with a weak, unsatisfying ending.

It only shows 1 small picture of each car from one angle (so you're always missing some part of the car like the front or back).

I would really recommend looking elsewhere for a good book on exotic cars and supercars or anything else. What I would really recommend though now that we're on the subject is buying an exotic car.

The suspense the film creates is top notch.For those of us who grew up in the 70's and early 80's, nuclear power as well as the threat of nuclear war were a big part of our social conscience and fears. The China Syndrome does an admirable job of representing that widespread uneasiness with nuclear power through it's dialogue-rich storyline. Three Mile Island and Chernobyl were incrediby scary things to be exposed to as a child, and The China Syndrome succeeds in never letting those of us who remember...forget, what that can feel like.I picked this DVD up for a fair price...and it's an excellent addition to my growing collection of film classics.

Douglas and Fonda are as good as they once were and the movie itself is fairly tense and extremely involving. Wilford Brimley is always a joy to watch and listen to and while its portrayals of good and evil are fairly black and white, they sucker you in and you don't feel bad about it...Plus, it's in widescreen.

Wrong choice.My hair usually curls so tight with my old hot rollers that I thought that these bigger ones would give my hair more body than curl.

I owned a set before and loved them, but maybe I just got a set that didn't work very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"mediocre","review":"These rollers work pretty well. Not as well as I hoped, but my hair is extremely thick. If you have thinner hair then you'll love these. They even come with the nice white clips not the metal pins."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"I like these rollers quite a bit, although it seems that the set should consist of 6 rollers rather than five, as most women would use two for the top of the head and two on each side. Perhaps this is to get you to buy a second set, which is actually not a bad idea.When I read the instructions to set them up, I thought the red light that comes on when the unit is plugged in should turn white, which it didn't of course. There is a red dot on the roller which turns white when hot. Admittedly, I'm not great with instructions, but it could have simply said: When the red dot on the ROLLER turns white the rollers are ready. What the instructions say is \\"when the red ready dots turns white\\".The red dot turns white pretty fast, but the rollers are definitely not hot enough to use, so you have to wait5 minutes more before they are hot enough. That being said, they work great, producing soft, shiny curls."},{"rating":"1","title":"not thrilled","review":"I bought these to replace my hot rollers from 1994, which were still working, but took up too much room on my bathroom vanity. I expected an improved product considering the age of my previous rollers, and I truly believe my previous rollers (circa 1994) work better. It seems like I need to leave these in longer, maybe because of the spongy material on the roller (my previous ones were plastic). the butterfly clips don't work. I still had metal pins from my previous set so I can use those. The only thing I like about these is the size. I will likely look for others...."},{"rating":"1","title":"They could be \\"heating\\" forever and still not get hot.","review":"I used to own a newer version of these curlers, and those were fantastic. When mine broke, I bought these. What a mistake! These do NOT get hot no matter how long you leave them plugged, and they still come with the terrible clips instead of normal metal holders. The clips leave marks on your hair, hold the curlers poorly, and were replaced by Conair in later models of this product. Do NOT buy these! Oh, and they're also terrible for travel. The size is good for a sink, not a suitcase."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother - these suck","review":"Why they suck:-they barely got lukewarm, and after leaving in my hair for half an hour there was NO curl (and my hair curls easily)-it's a travel set, but the clips that come with it don't fit in the travel case, and don't come with any kind of carry bag -- how is that fit for travel?

I had been using a set of Clairol rollers which worked well; however I wanted a set with larger rods. These seemed to be the perfect set since I travel quite a bit. Even though I overheat the rollers, they won't hold curl the way my other set would. I have tried leaving the rollers in much longer than I should and I still can't get the curls to last.

However, there is one thing you need to know before you purchase this product: it is completely useless on long and thick hair. I have tried heating them for over an hour and leaving them on my hair for over 2 hours. Still, when I take them off, there wouldn't be a slightest hint of a curl in my hair. My hair is naturally wavy, but after using these curlers, it would actually get straighter.I have tried using them on dry hair, slightly wet hair, right after washing my hair, two days after washing my hair, with or without product - all to no avail. I have tried using them on only half of my hair, as some readers have recommended but the result is still a slightly straighter hair and no trace of a curl.So if your hair is long and thick, this is definitely not a product for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"broke, gave it 0 \\"stars\\"","review":"stopped working after two uses in less than a week. it wasn't dropped or mishandled. 3rd time i was going to use it, i plugged it in and turned the switch to on; never came back on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I've been using these rollers for about a year.

This is the first thing I have ever sent back to Amazon. The rollers get so hot you can't touch them anywhere. The clips to hold them in place are really weak. I have medium-thick hair. Perhaps people with thinner hair would have less trouble. The plastic top broke off the second time I tried to use them. This is the second Conair hair appliance I have owned. They don't impress me much. I can't imagine I would ever buy a Conair product again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome set of dryers and great for traveling overseas","review":"I already had a set of these at home but recently went on a trip to China where the electricity is 220V. I noticed this newer set of curlers has dual voltage so I purchased them. Curlers get very hot both here in the U.S. and in China. What's nice is that I just had to move a small switch on the bottom of the heating unit to change the voltage. These curlers give great long-lasting curls and I love the more secure clips that come with the set. Only negative is that you have to be careful with the lid since I've had many of their lids break on me. That is why I usually bring them in my carry-on. They are small so don't take up much room in your luggage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend this product","review":"Rollers don't get hot enough so curls don't last. Clips that come with product aren't easy to travel with, big, bulky and feel like they would break easily. Product should include smaller clips instead. Ones that you can stow inside the unit. Only good thing is rollers heat up fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"this is the latest version of a product i have used for years. travel curlers used to be more compact, lined up in a row. that changed into a much bulkier oval case i suspect to accommodate flocked rollers that are heated more safely and MUCH less likly to burn. the rollers are also slightly smaller and big clips are used which can not be carried in the roller case,a hassle for storage and travel. i've saved the old roller pins to use instead and i think they can be ordered separately. this is a good product, heats fast and the flocked rollers are safe for your fingers and easier on your hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Jumbo Clips included","review":"I ordered a 10 set of jumbo clips seperate, cuz i dind't know they were included in the package.But you can't really complain for getting more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clips leave creases","review":"These rollers are 1.5\\" thick and are too large for my thin, straight, long hair. They don't curl my hair enough. They do add volume and make my ends curly but I wanted a bit more curl. The deal-breaker is the clips though. They hold the hair well, but the creases look horrible. I end up throwing my hair up into a ponytail just to hide the creases...what is the point of that!? I will be returning these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Big Hot rollers","review":"This are the best large hot rollers I've ever bought. They heat up super fast.

The issue is - this is NOT travel size - case is way too large and delicate plastic. There is no storage for the clips. To call this a Travel Hairsetter is a joke. If you want to use this for normal everyday home use, should not be a problem. If you want this for travel (as advertised), forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Certainly Not Instant Heat and not Really Much Heat At All","review":"I bought this set to replace a set of jumbo rollers by BabyBliss. The case looks identical and the rollers are exactly the same. However, these rollers take about 10 minutes to fully heat and never really get hot enough. The plastic clips don't hold my hair very well and are too bulky to pack in a suitcase. If I had it to do over again, I wouldn't purcahse these rollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Won't Easily Fit in Hardcase Luggage","review":"I think these will be great jumbo heated rollers with dual voltage to use in Europe. BUT, I use a hard sided spinner suitcase that opens into two compartments, instead of one large compartment. This travel hairsetter has a small stand on it, which looks pretty sitting in the bathroom, but will take up needed height space making the double sided suitcase difficult to close. I will look for another smaller travel friendly set. This set came with claw type clips that hold the roller in place to support a curly set. This was not written in the Amazon description. I wish I had known because I spent more money to get clips which I didn't think came with the set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snags your hair","review":"This product is terrible if you have long hair. There is a huge slat in the middle of the curler on the bottom side where the heating unit goes through that snags your hair. I almost had to cut part of my hair to remove the curler. I've requested a refund. The 2 minute heating time is more like 10 minutes, as others have said. They're lukewarm in 2, but useless. They might work if you have shorter hair, but this is NOT for anyone with more than 4 or 5 inches of hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clips are included!","review":"I didn't read or see in the photo that clips came with the rollers, so ordered the pop-up suggestion.

What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"burned out!","review":"I bought these rollers in June, and I have used them roughly two or three times a month since then. Today I put switched them on - and the rollers burned out, melting the surrounding plastic and singeing the lid. They were on for no more than 5 minutes. Three of the rollers were literally molten - and I have now chucked the set away. One of the reasons I used them so infrequently was that the curlers got so hot that I found it hard to handle them without burning myself. I am hoping these were just duds, because I have just bought the larger Conair jumbo roller set."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"This is terrible. I didn't like the out come at all. It does not heat up enough. Noting special. The roller is only 5 so i ordered more 5 roller. But the problem is it's not good result."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice compact size","review":"These are great for traveling, however they didn't curl my hair as much as I'd hoped. This is likely just because of my hair and not the product! I did buy the clips to go with them, and that was a big help. It heats up really quickly and is easy to take with you on a trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for my hair type","review":"I followed the directions and it just doesn't keep my hair curled. I have thicker hair but I tried only a small section and that didn't stay either. :( I would love to use hot rollers instead of a curling iron but they don't ever seem to work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compact set....but not for travel...","review":"I love these rollers. In fact, I'm on my third set. If you close the lid they do get very very hot, and they don't take up much room on the bathroom counter. My only complaint is that they take up a huge amount of room in a suitcase. And, the plastic lid cracks. In fact, that's why I'm on my third set. After about a year of business trips, the lid will be cracked beyond use. So, I'm going to buy another set of these for the bathroom counter, and try another brand for the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Measure Up","review":"I have the full size version of these rollers, and I can tell you - they are FAR superior to these travel curlers. The box advertises instant heat, but in reality my curlers take about 5 - 10 minutes to heat up fully. (I have pretty thick hair, so this means I have to put all five curlers in my hair 2 times, thus having as much as 20 minutes heat up time to do my whole head!) Even at full heat, these curlers don't make the cut. They are barely warm (especially compared to my full size ones) so they barely curl my hair. After about 30 minutes, all curl is gone completely. I don't know if I got a defective set, but these definitely weren't worth the money or the space savings. I should have tried them before I left for my trip, becaue they don't work at all on my hair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for that extra volume!!","review":"I love these curlers. My set is about 7 yrs old! The top is broken off and I've lost 2 pins, but I just use a couple jumbo sized hair clips and it stays in. It does take a little practice, but I'm done rolling in 5 minutes.I have fine, longer (4-5\\" pass shoulders)hair. When I know I'm going to use the rollers I add some moose/gel before blow-drying. I section off my hair and spray aerosol hairspray on it. My hair clings to the roller and stays in better, plus it gives great volume. I also give a good spray all over after I'm done. I usually put on make-up while the curlers are in. I take them out and have \\"Super Model\\" hair, according to my hubby! I let the curls cool and relax then run my fingers through and I'm done.Another tip: Try rolling them in different directions....as in roll one under and the other up.Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jumbo Travel Rollers","review":"I did not like the \\"velvet\\" covering on the roller.

The originals are still working but the velvet is wearing thin and I was afraid they wouldn't still be available when I finally did need them. The one thing I don't like about them is the bulkiness of the clips when traveling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice hairsetter, but not small enough for some travel.","review":"Nice hairsetter, works well. As for travel, it could be more compact. It is fine for travel where suitcase space is not at a premium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I should have listened to the reviews. Clips too flimsy, can't keep the rollers in place and the rollers tend to overheat. I thought I could make 5 rollers work with my hair, I was wrong.

It heats up in (literally) 3 seconds and the steam is great, reliable and even. I have only ever used it on cotton, I would be a bit nervous to use it on something expensive and delicate, not because the quality is bad, just because it was the least expensive iron on the site. If you don't need to do a lot of ironing, or don't iron anything too delicate very often and you're on a budget, you can not go wrong with this iron!EDIT NOTE: I don't use this iron anymore.

Katz needs to re-read the 7 Story Mountain, then take a look at Augustine's Confessions and Dorothy Day's Long Lonelines, and see what was really at stake for these great seekers. A vague \\"quest for the spiritual\\" is doomed to self-absorbed circularity which may be fascinating to the subject but is dull to the outsider. The spiritual seeker looks for truth, not mere peace of mind, because he or she realizes that the essential question being asked is \\"why am I here and what am I supposed to do with this life?\\" and the answers to that are not found in the self, but in the One who brought the Self into being. The reviewer below is right. You can't divorce spirituality from theology.

While the book is entertaining, the idea of it having anything to do with Merton's quest for solitude, contemplation and a soul jouney is misleading. Had Katz ever [even for a week], turned off the computer, telephone, CD, TV, etc. he might have had a chance at interior change. His reasoning that, unlike Merton, he had found inner peace.....was self-serving.

Approaching fifty, he now finds a house in \\"a small corner of upstate New York,\\" where he retreats to write and cogitate for several months. Accompanying him are a dead monk and two dogs, as he says. The monk is Thomas Merton, whose presence begins to seem real as Katz carves out a contemporary version of a hermitage.I found some of the soul-searching a little embarrassing to read. This author, a product of years of psychoanalysis, has no qualms about sharing his thoughts. However, the reflections on midlife are right on. Katz's doubts (yet another comeback?) are real and realistic. Read his thoughts on the \\"lonely generation:\\" with no guidance from parents or ancestors, we have to face change.Worth a read as a role model for those who feel the call of the mountains."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run away to the mountain...What?

A week later after my book arrived and had been read I was let down. This was not a sabitical or a spiritual retreat this was running away from responsibility. After some time in his mountain cabin he didn't miss his family as much as he missed his computer, email, internet and cable TV. I think this was a writer just trying to write a book on a given subject with a deadline, not someone who is compassionate for the inner truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disapointment","review":"The prologue was so appealing that with every page of the book, I expected to find some meat, some wisdom, some significant observations. But the entire book was shallow popcorn. It's a story of a middle-aged man who goes off to a cottage in remote - Alaska? (no, upstate New York) to abandon civilization for a taste of near-monastic life (complete with his Apple Powerbook, internet connection, Primestar satellite and pay-per view movies). One high point is when he learns to trap - bears?, no, field mice! A sample-in the last chapter we learn the author wakes early, write for a while, has a tuna sandwich, drives to a Vermont bookstore, visits a public forest, goes to another bookstore.

Although it was installed properly and tightened completely, the camera kept turning off while I was shooting unless I squeezed the grip onto the body with my hands. Obviously this is not going to work in the long haul and I will have to return it. I re-installed the grip twice more, but still had the same problem. It's too bad because otherwise I like the grip and it's a good value if it works correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great grip but poor batteries","review":"This review is aimed at the power 2000 batteries that come with the grip. The batteries failed after only two charges. The grip is fantastic (5 stars) and continues to work with Canon batteries. Buy the grip without batteries and add the saving toward Canon or other higher rated batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries lose charge quickly - Grip causes issues as well.","review":"First and foremost, the batteries are junk. Original OEM Canon batteries will let me shot 5x to 10x longer than these. Even with a full charge. At one point, I had them charged in my bag, went to use them the next day, and got about 5 shots off before the battery died. Unacceptable. I ended up just throwing them away.Second, the grip itself. I have only had one chance to use it on a photoshoot, and after a few dozen shots, I was getting a low battery reading. I was using original Canon batteries. I pulled out one of the batteries, put it directly in the camera, and shot for the rest of the day on it.All and all, I am not the least be impressed with Opteka.Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but pretty good.","review":"I like these battery grips. This is the second one that I've ordered. The first one died when my tripod fell over in soft soil. The camera hit the ground, but it broke off at the vertical grip, so the camera was fine. I ordered a replacement as soon as I got home.The grip is fine. The shutter release on the second is a bit fidgety; it needs to be pressed at a certain angle to get the \\"half-way down\\" thing for focus and exposure lock. I guess this speaks of less than stellar QC.I wouldn't use my Rebel without it, though. It makes the camera look \\"pro,\\" and gives my hands the room they need to be comfortable on that tiny thing. The batteries work great; I can take several hundred shots with just one pair (I use an external flash).For the price, and the added ergonomic value, I highly recommend this thing. By all means, get the Canon model, if you can afford it, but, if not, this has done me very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good alternative to the Canon BGE3","review":"I've holded off my own review because I wanted to test it out first.After testing it for 3 weeks, I would have to say its a pretty good product for its price.- The battery that comes with it are 2x900mAh making it a total of 1800mAh.- Using just 1 battery to power the camera and grip is similar to the original battery. 300-400 shots. It's not the flimsy battery unlike the first one that's included.- The Grip feels nice. There was a small part of the rubber in the grip that was not sticking properly but it was easily fixed.- The Dial and the shutter button does feel different than the one in the camera BUT it hasn't stopped me from taking pictures. There is still a distinct feel when you have focus locked.- The delivery was good enough it arrived on the monday after july 4. It was supposed to arrive in july 4 but that's a holiday.Overall - If you're in a tight budget this is a good deal for hobbyists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the price","review":"I bought this several weeks ago and only got to use it for about an hour. My buddy, Tiny, who is a professional photographer, borrowed it to check it out. I have not seen it since. Today he asked if he could keep it and could I get another one for myself. He did several photo shoots with it including a day-long photo shoot and absolutely loves it. He is known for turning the camera sideways so I know the trigger buttons got a workout. I am a bargain shopper and for the price and performance, this can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent grip, especially for the price!","review":"I was a bit concerned seeing the price of this grip so far below the Canon one, but after reading the positive reviews, I figured the price differential made it well worth a try. I'm very glad I did. The battery grip fits perfectly, the two batteries included with it have an excellent charge life, and it makes the camera a very nice shape, as originally it felt too small and the lens tended to overbalance it. I would highly recommend anyone considering the Canon grip (and its price tag) to give this a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good price, lousy performance","review":"I bought this product a couple weeks ago and at first it seemed fine, but then I noticed that when it was turned on, the control wheel becomes uni-directional. What I mean by this is no matter which way you turn the wheel, the control only scrolls in one direction. This is OK, but frustrating, for some things like ISO and white balance, but it makes the exposure compensation wheel useless. It only moves in the negative direction and once it reaches -2, it is stuck there and will not come back up. This is true whether using the control wheel on the camera or the one on the grip. I am hoping I can return it and if so, will spend the extra $$ to get a Canon grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"Ive been using this battery pack for 2 years and it is excellent. I also bought a total of 4 batteries. It will last a whole day of shooting. And if it doesn't there is always the 2 spare batteries or AA batteries that can be used as well. The grip makes the camera (black Rebel XTi) feel more comfortable as well as make the camera look more \\"manly\\". The grip matches my camera colour which makes it look seamless. It also gives the camera a good feel and \\"weight\\". No more arm twisting with the vertical shutter release. It's a well and solidly built grip that still looks brand new after 2 years. And best yet is is a lot cheaper than the Canon equivalent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flawed and hazardous","review":"I tested these batteries after buying two of them and the Thermistor that should be giving the charger the battery temperature for safety has been replaced with a ~10k resistor.(Check your packs yourself, touch a multimeter set to measure ohms to the - and the T terminals, it should be 15k if the battery is freezing and down to 5k if the battery is hot)I consider this hazardous. I do not recommend these to anyone.(The grip however is probably fine, this review is simply about the batteries)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly functional to my canon rebel xt","review":"The battery grip doesn't work at all for my camera which I have a canon rebel xt.

I'll have to admit that I wasn't really impressed with the grip for the EOS-20D. Although it appeared well made, it just didn't attach like I thought it should. On the other hand, the battery grip for the Rebel XTi looks, attaches, and feels like a winner. Not only does it look and feel good, but it also enlarges the camera's footprint for those people with bigger hands, moves controls to make them easier to use when you're shooting the camera vertically, and prolongs your shooting with two batteries. I would definitely purchase this product again and recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff, perfect fit.","review":"This grip is fantastic. Makes my XTi easier to manage in terms of taking portrait shots and the fact that there are TWO higher-capacity batteries is great. We keep the stock battery charged up as a spare. You can use this grip with one or both battery compartments taken up - which is great for when you fall back to a spare battery - you don't need two of them. My only complaint (and hence, 4 stars) is that the wrapped, textured material didn't stick well to the plastic, some superglue cleared this right up, but what do you expect for something that's a fraction of the price of a canon-branded device."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power!","review":"The best product I have bought for my camera. It makes my xti look like a large pro camera. and I love the ability to turn the camera 90 degrees and shoot.I have lots of battery life. I mean lots! the camera sits in my case ready to go for days and I never have to worry about running out of batteries or recharging. I charge it once a month, and I am good to go.I also like the AA battery insert, instead of the rechargeable, I could go into any store and buy AA batteries and be ready to go.I had no problem securing the grip to my camera. I was just careful to install it the first time. I will never take it off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"battery grip","review":"I'd highly recommend this product for anyone taking sports pictures.

These are 900mAh not the 720mAh that come with the XTi. I bought the XTi with the extra battery which adds up to 1440mAh. With this kit I get 1800mAh. Just do the math a Canon battery costs 50 dollars and you get two of those with 25% more power in them with this pack.BTW unlike another comment here I can notice when the button is half down (focus-meter) and all the way down (shoot). So there is no missed shootings. All works well. The AA battery kit looks as made of lower grade plastic though. Not a deal breaker as you probably won't use it all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome accessory","review":"Can't compare it to the Canon brand, as I've never handled one. This fits my camera well, makes it easier to hold and provides an easier reach to the shutter release in portrait mode.

I'd definitely recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"piece of garbage","review":"The grip is comfortable but is horrible when using the camera at an vertical angle. when shooting vertical the battery grip loses connection and the camera loses power. i had to finally resort to taping the the battery shelf in. it just isn't built well and the locking mechanism doesn't hold tight. i also have had issues where the grip would cause my camera to freeze up and i would have to remove the grip to get my camera to reset. pay the extra and get a canon battery grip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too bad!","review":"I was leery at first, but thanks to a lot of positive reviews, I decided to get it!

Perfect fit and the batteries all work with each other. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completes XTi","review":"XTi's are light and somewhat small. I didn't realize how awkward XTi's are ergonomically, but this battery pack grip improves the ergonomics and the feel of my XTi. I have the bettery pack and grip on all of the time now. For this price, opteka includes two batteries and an insert for using AA batteries. So, the battery power I have is seemingly endless. On my recent trip to Russia, I didn't have easy access to recharge the batteries. However, armed with the battery that came with the camera, battery pack grip (2 batteries), and a battery pack grip insert (for rechargeable AA batteries), I shot on average 400-500 shots for many, many days (so long I can't even remember).My XTi feels so much better with this battery pack grip attached, and I know I have enough fire power to shoot for days without recharge, if I have to. At about half of the cost of the Canon brand battery pack grip, I am even happier with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"I mainly buy good stuff . . .","review":"Yet another positive review from me.The device works as designed. It comes with two spare batteries - battery life is fantastic. When they're dead it can function just fine with just the single original battery that came with the cam.Someone commented about a rubber panel coming unglued and they just restuck it - good job man (or Ma'am - I can't remember). A small consideration for a utilitarian.Good buy - cheaper than the \\"Branded\\" product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor internal connections?","review":"I had pretty good luck for a month or two with this, the look and feel is no doubt similar to the authentic Canon product. Others have gone so far as to say the had \\"friends\\" who claimed it was made in the same factory and sold under an unknown name...However, I had the same issues others have had, I would start to compose a shot, and as I depressed the shutter button, nothing would happen. Power went off. Kind of frustrating. Batteries were fine, so I came to the conclusion that the internal contacts and connections must be where the \\"value\\" is.I have nobody else to blame but myself, I thought I was getting a good deal. I'll be buying the Canon grip soon, I did like the feel of the grip on my XT. If you buy this and it lasts, congratulations.

It was about 10 months of use. I received a warranty replacement, and paid shipping. Then 2 weeks after the one year warranty was up it does not function in the vertical position. When I turn it to take portrait shots the grip somehow prevents the camera from shooting. I removed the grip and the Rebel XTi functioned fine, put the grip back on and it malfunctioned again. Maybe the Canon brand would have been better...maybe not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product. Battery cartridge loses contact when camera rotated to the left.","review":"Upon receiving my Opteka grip today, the quality seemed fine and consistent with the build of my camera, which is the only reason it got two stars. I immediately installed it following the directions and it fit firmly and securely. After I inserted the battery tray cartridge, I started the unit up per the instructions. It seemed to be working flawlessly...until I tilted the camera to the left. There is a very small amount of play in the cartridge once it is closed, and the small amount of movement causes it to lose contact and therefore power. For the unit to properly work, I have to hold my hand up against the side of the cartridge to keep it from losing power. I've contacted the seller to determine if I just have a defective unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"easily one of the best options available for the Digital Rebel line","review":"As an airshow photographer, I cannot express the value of having two batteries working at once for you (so you don't have to swap batteries at a potentially critical moment). I've had my grip for a little while now, and it's served me very well. It fit very securely to my camera, the buttons work fine, and the added grip area/battery power are wonderful to have. It's the same mold as the canon-label grip at less than half the price... what's not to love?"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Canon's","review":"I've been using the Opteka battery grip for the XTi for about a month now and it feels and works great. I can't imagine the Canon grip being any better. The batteries that were included with the grip work find, maybe not as many shots per charge as Canon batteries, but for the price who can complain? Do your wallet a favor-buy this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product at half the price","review":"I have had this battery pack for 2 months now. It makes my Digital Rebel XTi feel chunkier. This helps get a steady grip for vertical portrait shots.It looks and feels like the original canon pack.

They work for a few weeks, then it starts taking longer for the signal to be found. I get the message Acquiring Signal for anywhere from 10 to 40 minutes. Customer service first told me this was not a common problem. An obvious lie since this is the second unit it has happened to. Plus there is an earlier positing here that sounds like the same problem. The first time, they agreed pretty quickly to replace the unit. That took about 3 months after originally saying it would be 3 weeks. Now, it has been about a month waiting for a third unit. I am locked in with the annual contract or would definitely get a different model if not go to XM. The other annoying feature is storing songs. It allows 20 songs to be put in memory.

This keyboard is not the same as the original. Everything works fine except the space bar. On the original keyboard the space bar registered no matter where it was depressed - right, left or center. On the new keyboard the space bar only registers if pushed directly in the center - only when hit in the center can you feel the key \\"click\\" and register when depressed. Pushing on the right or left side of the space bar does nothing - the space bar just leans right or left, it does not \\"click\\". This makes the keyboard a little aggravating to use.

When I reinstalled the original keyboard and rebooted, there was no beep sound. So the system was normal again. I also noticed that the model number on both keyboards were different.

I went ahead and installed it myself - it was surprisingly easy - and now I'm writing this review on it. Initially I was worried if it would even fit (other reviewers mentioned the corners of the keyboard not lining up exactly with the contours of the laptop), but as far as I can tell, this keyboard is identical to the one my 9400 originally had.

I made a quick, weird move, the water bottle shifted, water came out, right onto the keyboard. I turned everything off. Next day, tried it again. It turned on but found that my typing didn't match the letters on the screen. Seems I killed the keyboard.Ordered this one. In a couple of days it arrived, well packaged. Took me about five minutes.

I'm pretty sure the keyboard is not OEM. I couldn't find the Dell trademark anywhere on the item. That's OK with me as long as it works and it doesn't cost me an arm and a leg. I used my keyboard for the E1405. The old keyboard would not work, ie. the Shift, R, T buttons would not work. If in doubt about changing the keyboard, first make sure your drivers are working. If they are, then change the keyboard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great replacement for our Dell","review":"Our aging Dell has been relegated to the kids. Since I'd used it for blogging/online content writing, the keyboard saw an excessive amount of use and I'd worn off several letters. Fine for someone who can touch type, but not so good for the kids as they hunted and pecked at the keyboard.At $15, we felt that it was worth a try and we were very pleased. My husband was able to replace it fairly easily, after searching up instructions online. He did need to take out several screws, far more than he had for his Gateway. The key is to pay attention to the clipping mechanism and make sure you don't pull it out and instead unclip it so you don't break the clip.The keyboard has worked fine with no problems since installation. It came in frustration free packaging, so it was loose in a larger box with a battery I had ordered as well. I wasn't too keen on that, but it was just fine. To be safe, though, I'd order the item on its own and not the same time as other things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Key popped off 2 days in","review":"This keyboard seemed like it was very close to the quality of the OEM board... until the H key popped off two days into typing on it.

Well, compare it to Nikkor's 55-200, list price is only $50 less and it doesn't have VR and doesn't have Nikkor's quality level.Autofocus on this lens is obnoxious, it sounds like there are little gnomes inside, cranking 100 year old gears.Sorry Tamron, I'll stick with Nikkor next time unless you can win me over with another one. I will probably end up just taking these apart to play with the elements and come up with a science project."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AUTOFOCUS","review":"Tamron makes great lenses. Most ads are clear about their features. However, Keh never makes clear, in fact quite the contrary with the D40 through D90 series bodies, that THIS lens is NOT supplied with the autofocus motor!! It took me several hours after purchasing it to find other people who had discovered the same thing. NO auto focus motor in the lens for Nikon which take the DX series of lenses.BE AWARE of this when you look at the specs.

As for Todd, he has been over Elizabeth for a very long time, so his arguing with Tom doesn't make much sense to me. Interesting enough, they are arguing over Elizabeth, the girl neither has been with. But not over Dana, the girl they have both slept with. I guess Laurie John wants us to believe that no guy can get over Elizabeth, and truly fall in love with another girl. I see Todd and Dana's breakup already, because she has done a complete 180 and become clingy too fast. And that's too bad, because I actually like Dana. I'm sick of Elizabeth.

William White, Mike McAllery, Ryan the lifeguard, etc. She gravitates toward jerks, not unlike her sister does. We read the books, we remember the trends. Also, I think Tom is abusive to Elizabeth.

Viewsonic has not responded with assistance or a warrantly replacement despite my submitting 3 requests with them.When it works, it looks nice for the price, but since it isunviewable about 50% of the time (the flicker sets in after 2-6 hours of uptime), that's not so great.

This is a film that has soul.Sidney is a new teacher who is assigned to an inner city school. Of course the kids try to take advantage to the \\"new meat\\" but they go one step far. But instead of going off the deep end, he decides to make a difference in their lives.What happens is a beautiful transformation.

This film shows how one man (Poitier) made a difference in trying to tackle these problem at the time.My other reason for liking this film is that I am into the \\"Swingin 60s.\\", its music, its art and fashion, etc.If you like this film, you would enjoy the two British TV series also set in the 60s; Heartbeat and The Royal; although these are made in the 2000s."},{"rating":"2","title":"tfrau","review":"This video was recommended to me to help me see a way to educate underprivileged children.

It is the WIDESCREEN side that has the 'Godzilla vs. Space Godzilla.' on it instead of the widescreen version of 'To Sir With Love'.

I have a Kaz Soft Heat (with auto shut off) that gets nice and hot, but I was looking for a continuous heat pad. The Kaz also has a much softer plush cover. The cat and I fight over that one. She doesn't even get near this Sunbeam. I've never returned anything to Amazon, but this one is going back. My back (and neck) need more heat and relief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned holes","review":"We plugged in the Sunbeam Heating Pad and it immediately began burning holes in the blue cover and burned holes right through to the wires.

But my review is for people that want to use it for back pain relief, and that does not warrant a good review.The high heat setting is probably good enough, although it could be a tad hotter. The big problem here is that the heat does not stay on. It constantly \\"pulses\\" on and off every 5 minutes or so. So you don't get steady heat to your back.This pad is also a mess after you have used it. The \\"bag\\" that it is in is impossible to straighten out after it has been used. I try my best, and get it as flat as possible, but there are still many, many wrinkles in it. Very poor design.The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 is the price. It certainly is a good price. But you do get what you pay for. I would not recommend this for somebody looking for a heating pad for back pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whatever happened to the good old fashioned heating pads?","review":"What a disappointment -- this has lasted me through a dozen uses and now it barely heats at all.

After less than one month of use I began smelling an electrical burning smell when using the heating pad. I looked at the control switch and actually saw the control switch visibly smoking, and it was hot to the touch. I immediately unplugged the heating pad and unscrewed the controller unit, noting that the hot lead where it contacted the plastic inside the controller had been charred. This is very scary as I had been using the heating pad for the entire time and all night long while sleeping in bed--thank God that I noticed the smoking controller unit during the daytime as there is no doubt in my mind that this could have caused a life threatening fire had I had not caught it!!!

The writing is what kept pulling me through the book, despite the onset of major depression I was getting from reading it. The characters are well-formed, but they are so sad and ignorant, and they make such horrific decisions at every turn, that I felt psychologically slimed. The book is a great insight into the minds of uneducated, superstitious hillbillies, but who wants that? They are people who let things happen to them, who never (with one exception, and it's minor) stand up for themselves, and who have no insight into themselves and the world around them.

But it is short-term. The story then turns to examine the effects of grief. Christie and James become distant with one another and their large, supportive family. They set out on a lecture tour.

I have never read so much about eating, food, and breast-feeding.

After that the hymn Kingdom Come which is very moody. Track seven features a bonus track called Pleasure Slave which has some great guitars.And the comes Hail and Kill, a classic, probably one of the best songs of all time.

Calm, cool, and with a sense of humor. He has Spiderman's personality, but not as bouncy. Jokes, but has a purpose, and can be strong and radiate power. BUT..... This was not the Vash I was expecting in the Second volume, after seeing the first volume. This volume is much more serious. The first Volume sets him up to be skilled, but just totally loony with moments of continence skill in a crises. All, in all, I like this DVD. The stories actually run together to form one long story. Buy Volume 3 with this volume. So you can see what happens after the the 3rd episode on this Disk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have","review":"I didn't used to like the last half of this series.

Not to mention, just HOW old is he anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love and Peace!!","review":"The only thing that I even slightly have a problem with is that there are only three episodes on this DVD! Kind of makes me wonder why, especially since Vol. 1 had four.But this is a very small bone to pick with the second installment of-hands down--one of the best Anime series ever. Gotta love the wandering samouri looking for redemption--a redemption that, at this point in the series, is still a mystery.Usually slow frame-by-frame motion of a climatic scene really drives me nuts. However in the episode \\"Hard Puncher,\\" it's handled with a great finesse--the sheer beauty of the animation itself. It would have been very easy to mess this scene up, but they pulled it off. Good job!Since the series has very fine threads of information that are slowly woven together throughout the series, I highly recommend starting at Vol. 1 and going all the way in chronological order to enjoy Trigun at its finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Thoughts","review":"Trigun keeps on being a great series.

This collection was edited by Mabel Loomis Todd and T.W. Higginson. The poetry of Emily Dickinson is a joyful experience. Loneliness is elevated to a level of philosophical knowingness and her lines sing. Pantheism is circumscribed by her very real sense of the necessary straitjacket supplied by Christian belief.The arrangement of the poems is appropriate and thematic. In the preface to the second series the portfolios of poetry left by Emily Dickinson at her death are described. Variant forms and revisions were in evidence. The poems are as luminous as the pictures of Martin Johnson Heade. The artists' common use of humming birds suggests, among other things, this point.The language is succinct, never obvious. For example, Dickinson writes that remorse is memory awake. Elsewhere she wishes to be held firmly for eternity. The topics in both series are life, love, nature, and time and eternity."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is for the serious thinker who would normally disregard 99% of a magic-book's content.","review":"I bought a third edition, Ive heard all three are different in very small ways.

I've used it many times and every time I do the smell stays with me half the day. YUCK. Why they are adding perfume to this product?Furthermore, it behaves a lot like talcum powder, which means you end up with powder all over your shirt or counter after using, and it isn't especially easy to clean out of an electric razor. Since it's basically paraffin powder, it doesn't rinse out easily, you pretty much have to thoroughly brush out your razor periodically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"This thing is messy and does not seem to improve shaving comfort and clugs both cutters and screen.

I own all of their released albums. By far, their best is \\"kopfschuss\\", and I recommend you purchase it first. There style is consistent, but the intensity changes from album to album. Many reviews I have read regarding Megaherz relate them to Rammstein- which hurts my feelings. Just because the lyrics are in german does not mean these two bands have anything else in common. That would be like comparing STP to Ministry. Rammstein is heavily immersed in mixage and electronica, while Megaherz is more your traditional 4-piece rock band. they have a mellower sound, and lighter lyrics (rammstein has some truly evil themes). If you like german hardcore, I recommend a band called \\"Schweisser\\". as a devout rammstein fan, i find this a little more to my liking than Megaherz."},{"rating":"2","title":"*******Very well written and hard to put down!*******","review":"This book was very well written.

I initially expected this book to be fully devoted on Padre Pio's miracles (as Padre is well known for his miracle working), but I am glad to find that the book balances these with other 'non-miracle' aspects of his life; for instance, the close relationship he had with his mother, his time at the army during WW I, the persecutions he experienced under the Catholic 'jurisdiction' at the time etc.The only thing I wish this book would have are pictures of Padre Pio.

I took him to the vet and they said the injury is too severe to fix, that the best we can hope for is that it will heal enough to where he can just drag that leg around with him.

The ramps are too short and give way when he steps on them. Since the openings are positioned above each other, he fell from the very top to the very bottom.

The food containers are too small and hard to get in and out so I bought a ceramic bowl. I also bought a better water bottle. The wheel is too small and the raised areas to make it easier to run on are sharp. The ramps are too steep. We had to drill holes for the second level's ramp so hammie could get a good grip. The plastic removable level tabs are small and could easily snap off if you try to take the level out to clean (I don't know I just clean with a sponge inside). You cannot put a bigger wheel in unless you are extremely creative. We managed to get a bigger 8 1/2 wheel in there but seriously, buy a bigger, non-round cage. This one is awful.

The book is very easy to understand, matched with colorful photos and a reader friendly format. Johnson (another reviewer) is correct when he says Rhodes misses some information, however, I think in this case, it is a stregnth of Rhodes' book.Rhodes accuractly portrays the major teachings of churchs like the 'The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints'(Mormons), Jehovah Witnesses, and Unity School of Christianty, just to name a few. He also deals with other religions and their teachings, but here he is a little less effective.This text is written for the 'layman' and as such, it succeeds for those individuals who have not read any information about these unquie religions but need some basic information. For those of us who have studied many of these sects in-depth, the book is quite boring and one would be better off purchasing something with more theological depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Challenge of the Cults (and New Religions)","review":"This like most of Ron Rhodes book was an excellent book. It selects a few of the organizations that people attempt to pass off as religions and exposes them as cults. It gives the history and the doctrines that these organizations originated from and believe and then Rhodes who seems to be an expert in this area exposes them and not only does he expose them, he backs his exposition up with scripture.

As with all of these counter-cult evangelical gas bags (Ankerberg, Martin, Carlson, Decker, etc.) he sees no problem lying in order to trash people with whom he disagrees. It is doubtful if he has the intelligence or intellect to read the Bible let alone understand it.But it is his need to lie in a (failed) attempt to prove his point which exposes his claim to be a Christian as an outright fabrication. Ron Rhodes is no more of a Christian than Mohammad Atta but his intent is the same: To sow strife and hatred among people.He belongs to a tradition of Christianity which fosters and grows hatemongers, bigots, and worthless human refuse who walk through this world attacking people they do not understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some Integrity Please","review":"My objection to this type of book is does nothing but create divides. For example he lists one religion as a cult that currently is the fourth leading religion in the United States. The pace it is setting it will be a world religion within a 100 years. Not bad for a cult. Just to set the record straight the dictionary defines a cult as a 1.System of religious worship and ritual.2.Devoted attachment to a person or principle3. a sect.Under that definition every organized religion is a cult.

It succeeds in integrating the story of the building of Israel--from the kibbutz to Tel Aviv to development towns--within the context of urban and rural development in the modern western world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"The quality of this duvet insert is very cheap; the filler is very thin and the cover material is very rough.

I finished it over a weekend. Quite honestly, it was hard to put down. The plot involves a journalist's quest to uncover the truth of George Bush's (Senior) involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal. Those of us who remember it knew then that his claims about not knowing anything about it had to be a lie. The author resurrects the scandal in some detail and presents it as the background to an excellent story with a very compelling plot.I have to wonder if this story is entirely fictional. There are elements of it that make a lot of sense in terms of what occurred before and after the scandal broke. Frankly, some of it's scary if true.Overall, this is an excellent read with a very compelling plot. There's a twist at the end that no one could every predict, but which like parts of the story is very real.

Along the way, she finds unexpected love, and the truth about the people he trusted most. This is a scandalous novel filled with romance, revenge, and deceit. The author did a great job creating believable characters and events by incorporating realistic situations and experiences. She teaches her readers that being yourself is more important than fame and riches. This is demonstrated when the main character learns that people like her better when she isn't trying to please everyone and she speaks her true feelings. I recommend this book to those who enjoy reading about the Hollywood lifestyle and romance. However, this book is not suitable for young children due to its adult content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not cut my beard","review":"Would only cut to a stubble regardless of how long I worked at it, and the stubble was easily visible.

Always had great luck.Until they copped out on the latest design. They \\"narrowed\\" the cutters by a blade on each side so it now takes much longer to shave, also the plastic saddle the blades sit in is reduces, and instead of a curved metal blade design they're now tiny washers pressed onto a couple metal rods held by a tiny plastic piece.

It didn't shave nearly as closely as the old design, and now, after only three months, the redesigned blades have ripped a big flap off the screen, something I've never had happen before.

The series continues in \\"The Price of Power\\", \\"The Demon Hand\\", and \\"The Name of the Game\\". The series chronicles the adventures of the wolf nomad Mika-oba, who is the son the clan's shaman, and his wolf companion Tam-Tur. Mika is an extremely interesting character that kind of has the mentality of a sex-crazed hobbit. He wants to have the riches, women and glory, but doesn't like to work for it. His fate to takeover as the next shaman seems clear, even though he doesn't like the idea, but a raid on a passing caravan forever changes his life. The novel is fast paced and humorous and you'll love Mika's less than heroic attitude and his fun loving wolf. The ending is a strange one that will leave you wanting to know what will happen next.

Otherwise, this is another example of how low the bar has dropped for what is considered intelligent American filmmaking today. Yes, Billy Ray, I am mad at you."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting film with an impressive acting role","review":"This highly-praised film version of the story of star reporter Stephen Glass -- who faked dozens of stories in the late 1990s -- includes one really great performance. It's not, as many felt, that of the lead, Hayden Christensen, who perfectly mimics the mannerisms of the real-life Glass yet never gives his performance enough warmth to explain why the guy was such a good con man. Rather, it's Peter Sarsgaard, who plays Glass's editor at \\"The New Republic\\" magazine, who proves unflappable and resolute in the face of a manipulative, weasly -- yet wildly popular young reporter. It's a beautifully measured, deliciously nuanced performance, and well worth the price of admission alone. Provocative script as well, which can really make you think about the issues at hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really well done","review":"Hayden Christensen plays a man who has been making up news stories for New Republic Magazine and proves himself again to be a fine actor. There was a build-up of tension in the movie as we see his character, Stephen Glass, start to become anxious and stressed about all his lies and I couldn't take my eyes from the screen until of course the very end. Peter Saarsgard was really good too as Chuck Lane, the editor of the magazine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary?","review":"Want to learn why America's youth fail?

His downfall was inevitable, though the best part of the film doesn't make it seem that way too early.Hayden Christensen gives a solid performance as the deceptor, but the film really belongs to Peter Sarsgaard, his superior at the magazine. The tension created is well focused on Sarsgaard as well as its resolution. This is based on a true story and the film rings true, itself. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good movie","review":"This movie surprised me by being quite good. I agree with the reveiewer below when he says \\"Hayden Christensen can act,\\" as this movie testifies to. I hope to see more of him in future films.

What did he do to get quick success? He wrote several fictional articles and passed them off as fact. This went by un-noticed for awhile, but then oneday he found out by a competitor. He only had himself to blame, how stupid could he be? Not only did he destroy his own career, but he brought down the respected name of the journal he wrote for. They trusted him, and in return he 'promised' that his facts were checked at all times. Glass even preached fact checking to his fellow colleagues.'Shattered Glass' is an excellent film which effectively portrays the lengths that one man will go to get success. It's nail biting stuff, with great performances from all, in particular the Editor \\"Charles\\". The movie has many messages, and is worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener for future journalists!","review":"A movie people need to watch at least twice to truly grasp the rise and fall of Stephen Glass. At first, I felt Hayden was just a terrible actor portraying Glass, however, after doing some personal research on Glass himself, I found out he is a really dull individual...so Hayden nailed the part. The movie is quite riveting and I have watched it at least ten times since it was purchased last month. It's definitely worth every penny!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"...conned his way into the news world of journalism.","review":"The New Republic is a news publication located in Washington D.C. which is read by many significant individuals of the American society. The publication is written mostly by young aspiring writers that want to use the New Republic as a stepping stone in their career. One of these careerists is Stephen Glass who wants to become one of the most famous journalists of all times, and he does this by saying the right things at the right time. Stephen knows how to mingle and to make people feel welcome as he wins their trust. However, his charade is about to be discovered as one of his stories turns out to be pure fiction. Shattered Glass is based on an article about the same individual who conned his way into the news world of journalism.

While Ivy Pennington and Vincent D'Ambosino fight and then fall in love, the rapist becomes more and more fixated on Ivy, and will stop at nothing to be close to her. Vincent finds out, and tries to portect Ivy, but both do incredible stupid things, and it leads to a climax where the rapist and Ivy are alone in her apartment.

Like everything the great Mick Collins has done, it proves there are still a few great pure rock 'n' roll bands out there. The album is a series of covers (with the exception of \\"Your Love Belongs Under a Rock\\") that match and sometimes manage to be better than the originals. The thing that made the New York Dolls and the Ramones so great makes Mick Collins great - he knows his rock 'n' roll history. I would give anything to be able to go through the man's record collection. He covers well known artists, but chooses more obscure tunes as opposed to their hits. If most bands where to cover Thin Lizzy, they'd choose \\"The Boys Are Back In Town\\" or \\"Jailbreak\\". Collins picks \\"Ode to a Black Man\\" (coincedentally the greatest song on the album). An original mix of two bassists, two drummers, and the great Collins on guitar and vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"music with SOUL!","review":"Mick Collins is the MAN! This guy could sing the phone book and make it sound good. His latest with the Dirtbombs is a real, honst-to-goodness soul record made up of mainly covers from his early heros.

There are a lot of other bands doing the whole soul cover version thing, but none of them are this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST SOUL ALBUM OF THE DECADE","review":"Mick Collins is without a doubt the best Rn'B/soul vocalist alive. It's amazing to me that this guy isn't making millions doing slick modern Rn'B with a voice like his. Instead, Mick fronts a number of the raunchiest garage rock outfits around. This new album is, appearantly, a tribute to those who influenced him as there are cover versions of Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Sly Stone, George Clinton and others. All songs have been suitably pumped up in the energy department and drenched in fuzz guitar, but this still sounds like a soul record. For Mick Collins it's obvious that Rn'B still stands for rhythm and blues. A classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna be dirty","review":"This album by the Dirtbombs just plain kicks .... I tried to describe it to a friend thus: imagine if the Stooges had hooked up with Otis Redding as their singer instead of Iggy Pop. Now, Iggy is the man, but Mick Collins has that Soul Man thing going on, and when he's belting it out over these rockin' and raging tunes, you have a recipe for a classic.From the start, this album just comes blasting out of the stocks. I can't claim that every song is perfect, but enough of them are to justify the 5 stars. And man, if you think the Dirtbombs rock on cd or vinyl, wait til you see them live! They will blow your mind.

Ultraglide in Black is one of those albums that you play at a party and everyone ends up asking you \\"Who is this?\\" because of its soulful and unique sound. Mick Collins' voice will remind you of a decade from 20 years ago, but the pace and chord progression will remind you that this album is only 3 years old. If you have any passing interest in groups of old like The Spencer Davis Trio, The Animals, or even a little Stevie Wonder thrown in; this album is a safe bet. Ultraglide in Black is without a doubt stronger towards the beginning, but the latter part is still enjoyable enough. Check out the Mooney Suzuki too if this suits your fancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smokin'!","review":"Was introduced to this album by a friend who had a hunch I'd like it. I am very grateful that he did, it is an absolutely storming album, not particularly complex, but certainly not shallow.

If you're after intelligent angst, buy Coldplay, if you're looking for music to jump around to playing air guitar (not in an 80's hair rock way) then buy this.As for the person who criticises 'Ode to a Black Man', each to his own, but to balance out their opinion, I think it is one of the best tunes on there. Enjoy!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"The idea behind this album is a good one (revisiting Chambers Brothers psychedelic sould and giving it a Nuggets-style garage edge). Unfortunately, the execution is not as good as others seem to think: the singer is pretty obviously imitating other singers and really doesn't have a great voice and the songs are, well, boring and banal and surprisingly undanceable.

I got to read it over 7 months before it came out and the author (Mr. Deuker) read it to us (his class) ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"Shane Hunter, a Sophomore and star closer for Shorelake High School - a private school near Seattle - seems to have it all, that is until his father is arrested for money laundering and later commits suicide. His mother is forced to sell the house and move the family into public housing. Shane falls in with the wrong crowd and is arrested for shoplifting at a local convenience store. He is put on probation fixing up a baseball field at a Boys' and Girls' Club. There he meets Cornelius Grandison, the baseball coach at his high school Shane later discovers. Coach Grandison becomes a father figure to Shane.Carl Deuker has created another winner. You'll think you're sitting in the front row with a box of Crackerjacks and a Coke as Shane mows them down in the last inning, and you'll feel the emotions right along with Shane during the roller coaster ride his life takes. Good baseball books are in short supply for teens, so don't let this one slip past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Pichers book ever!!","review":"I have read many baseball books and many book about pichers but I have never come across anything like this one. Since I am a picher and a closer myself I admire the way he can capture the excitment and heartbreak of those two unique postions. The need to block out all noise and concentrate just on the next pich, the exsileration of blowing a heater by someone and the heartbreak when you don't concentrate and he hits it out of the park.It also does a very good job at making the main person belivable. Unlike in Mike Lupica's Heat the picher isn't 12 years old and throw 80 miles an hour but he is still very good, he's just human and he makes mistakes.This is not, however, a book for anyone under about 13 because Deuker does a very good job of creating real problems off the baseball dimond as well as on it.This was, by far, the best baseball book I have ever read, very highly recomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save money to rebuild your pet's toys","review":"Handy to buy to rebuild a squeaky toy that has been worn out by your pet.I also created a couple custom toys for my dog.Tip: take one or two squeakers wrap them in scrap fabric or old towel, insert into an old sock, tie or sew the end shut.

All the obvious cuts are here, like \\"Here Comes The Rain Again\\", \\"Would I Lie To You?\\", \\"Missionary Man\\", and of course \\"Sweet Dreams (are made of this)\\". Also favorites of mine like \\"Love Is A Stranger\\", \\"Thorn In My Side\\", and \\"There Must Be An Angel (playing with my heart)\\". Plus a couple from \\"Peace\\", and two new songs.

Other than that, no complaints about this compilation of fantastic, cutting-edge pop classics. The two new tracks \\"I've Got A Life\\" and \\"Was It Just Another Love Affair?\\" only show how time has strengthened Dave Stewart and Annie Lennox's somgwriting prowess.

I disagree with the reviewer who said Alexander tended to bragg about his accomplishments. If anything, I thought this book rather modest. However, Alexander is not shy about sharing his opinions, but this did not impress me as bragging. His vignettes of the leaders he had personnal dealings with are priceless and add a dimension to my impressions of men such as Lee and Longstreet. The book left me wanting to know about Alexander the man. No good biography of him exists to my knowledge. I read one account a number of years ago in 'Civil War Times Illustrated' that stated he had a rather nasty temper. I was unable to form a mental picture of the man from reading his book because the narrative is that of a good-natured fellow teling the openly honest story of his war service. I was left wanting to get to know this person a little better.

Its not. Its about sharks alright, but also other creatures of the sea. Glenn Ford is the narrator and does a valiant job, but the material here comes across as one of those films you were forced to watch in science class in high school. One of the nastier, and quite dated, aspects of this documentary is its utter nonsensical portrayal of great white sharks as demons of the sea. They aren't and the lengths at which the documentary goes to explain that is frankly rather disgusting. Want to see humans devoured by great white sharks? Don't look here. Actually what you spend the last half hour witnessing is the needless slaughter of these majestic animals in South Africa. It made my blood boil and made me ask \\"Who are the REAL monsters in this scenario?\\" The filmmakers don't decry this practice but rather belittle the wisdom of conservationists at the time, albeit 1981."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little cheesy, but enjoyable","review":"It may be a bit cheesy as it's a pretty old documentary, but I found it enjoyable nonetheless.

I've been shooting lots of flash pictures where the subjects face burned out when I got in close. With the Omni-Bounce it definitely softens the quality of the light and reduces the harsh highlights.

Although Victor Jory plays Cranston earnestly, the serial just barely takes itself seriously: when the hammy villain speaks his lines with an overdone sneer, or when Jory sneaks up on some gangsters DISGUISED AS A TREE, it's hard to accept the film as a legitimate drama. But there are some good moments, including very clever staging for the villain, who materializes as a vaporous beam of light. Serial fans will enjoy this most, and Jory's performance is the best part of the show (he's got The Shadow's trademark laugh down cold!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"VICTOR JORY had the voice and physical skills!","review":"Star JORY always delivered his lines with a quick response. Reminding me of Basil Rathbone who did the same in his movies. And JORY could play villian as he was that carpertbagger in \\"GONE WITH THE WIND\\". But here, he could use that voice, and his athletic skills to indeed BE the SHADOW in the movies. There were other leading actors in other Shadow features ,but JORY indeed WAS---- THE SHADOW in the Serial during the wonderful Saturday theatre afternoon days. Complete with the usual expected fist-fights,explosions,mystery voice,etc..and-\\" how will he ever get out of that situation?\\" episode ending...this whole serial looks good,sounds good and is fun to watch.And those tough fans of the SHADOW radio program were not dissapointed,even though Orson Wellse could not have played JORY's part!

Great villian, the black tiger.","review":"While not completely true to the pulps, this is a very entertaining serial. Victor Jory has the moves down and the laugh.

I taught my african grey parrot the shadow laugh in two days by playing the tape multiple times. Classic video.....jack welch"},{"rating":"1","title":"More serial tomfoolery from James Horne","review":"In this sillyass but amusing serial the Shadow does not have invisibility as he did in the radio series. This is given to the Black Tiger a peevish, prissy old fogey who fancies himself a leader of men. With numbskull underlings this fancy is not difficult to achieve and it is most amusing to hear these swaggering tough guys give out with a lot of sheepish \\"Yes sirs\\" to the Black Tiger's demands. As usual Horne gets a lot of comic mileage with the antics of the villains. Still one wonders why the Shadow was not made invisible so he could \\"cloud men's minds\\". Perhaps the producer did not want to spend the extra time and money on special effects or perhaps Horne himself felt that with his bad guys there wasn't any minds out there to cloud. 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"punctual delivery","review":"this is an introduction book on social philosophy and the seller deliver it on time"},{"rating":"1","title":"one star is too high","review":"This is the biggest waste of money and time reading I have ever experienced.

The author tries to make the women a \\"team\\" of sorts knitted together by their love of Annie and of wine, willingness to wear red sneakers, and their ability to leave home/family/jobs to go on this \\"girls trip\\".

There is no conflict in this book, no character development, no richly-told scenes, no humor. And why does Kris Radish hate men so much? Halfway through the book, I was praying for someone to say something nasty, get in a fight, fall in love, anything to break up the boredom.

The first was the concept. Who wouldn't prefer a grand adventure to remember a loved one instead of a traditional funeral. Sounded like fun. The second reason was all the glowing reviews posted everywhere. I consider myself in the demographics marketed for this book; however, I couldn't finish it. The writing style is way too dramatic for me; too many metaphors and symbolisms. I could barely stomach the simplistic and unrealistic situations. I finally threw in the towel when the women are stranded in an airport terminal and their conversation regarding funerals is picked up by the entire terminal and everyone in it shares a funeral story...and then they all dance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUNDS fun...","review":"... but it wasn't.

I managed to make it through the chapter about the bra (really?! that much about a BRA?) and through two of the agonizingly detailed phone calls after she opens the package, but then I had to give in.

The premise of the story is interesting, but I had trouble differentiating some of the characters, specifically Jill and Rebecca. Each segment of the funeral was overly described in a way that did not add meaning to the location nor to Annie. I didn't really like Annie very much - there wasn't enough about her to like or dislike. I skimmed over entire sections of the book where everyone writes in the journal and during the Psych 101 personal growth sections that seemed WAY too unrealistic. I hated the whole black bra problem at the beginning of the book. I really hated the addition of Belinda along the journey. The mystery man at the end and the super-rosy epilogue were just the capstone to a really bad read.

I was really looking forward to the book. After the first couple of pages, I felt like it would never end.The characters are flat, and the dialogue is unrealistic. The story is devoid of plot or character development. NOTHING actually happens throughout the entire \\"story\\". Ugh! My friends told me that the book made them laugh and cry. I didn't laugh once...didn't even come close: just read over and over again about a group of women laughing and laughing. WHAT were they laughing about?? The book didn't make me cry either, except to cry out, \\"Dear God, make it end!\\" (Does that qualify as a religious experience?) Ms. Radish confuses meaningful with maudlin, and insight with inane when it comes to writing.

The characters are all homogeneous, knee jerk liberals. The only way they can be told apart is that one says an expletive continously as a form of communication. But perhaps that's better than the author's florid and meaningless sentences. You start skipping them after awhile. But it's like a TV soap. No matter how much you miss, nothing much has happened. If you want to read a fantastic book with strong women characters that you can admire in the joy and adversity of their lives read \\"A Tree Grows in Brooklyn\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews fill my shriveled, black heart with redemption and affirmation...","review":"I am so glad to see that I am not the only one who thinks Radish is a tad melodramatic. Is she trying to write the Next Great Sentence?Katherine hasn't even finished her phone call to Laura and I want to chuck this book. And dude, just let the bra go.I am not against chick-lit. I am against really bad, poorly written, poorly edited, contrived, overwrought chick-lit. I am against this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure, unadulterated drivel","review":"I received this book as a gift, so I tried REALLY hard to find at least one redeeming feature. I failed.After reading the first few chapters, my sensibilities felt abused. By the end of the book, I was furious. How could anyone buy into such contrived characters? The never-ending bludgeoning of OVERSTATEDED emotional depth of all women was nauseating! Obviously, there was an agenda in this book and it had nothing to do with a fairly interesting plot idea.I found Kris Radish's unwillingness to let me have my own emotional reaction to her story insulting and demeaning. Evidently, she doesn't trust mere mortal women to be smart enough to catch any nuance or subtlety.If you like being told how you feel about every tiny little thing and are really good at the suspension of reality, this is the book for you. If you appreciate women for how they truly cope, survive adversity, and deal with life, don't bother bogging yourself down with this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so fabulous","review":"The reason I picked the book was the title. It sounded like a fun kind of story with a deep meaning intertwined. The backcover symopsis was intriguing also.I was bored after the first chapter. Too many 'flashbacks' and too much praising of Annie. She seemed unrealistic. I understand that she was a remarkable woman, we all know people like that but there was something that wasn't quite right.The notebook that the women write in was interesting twist but when they started to write from dead Annie's perspective, it was the last straw. Normally I would read a book within a few days but I just couldn't waste my time reading the end. It will speak to some women but I feel that you have to be a cancer survivor or know someone who has a terminal illness to 'get it.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feminist/mushy, but some of the travelogue was fun","review":"Picked this up on a whim, and almost didn't read the whole thing because I got bored with the ceaseless reflection on love between the various characters and the proclamations of how grand they all are individually. However, the accounts of the various geographic locations were fun to read - lush description of the NM desert, and the FL Keys. I also loved the hotel room in NY. I'm glad I finished it because the scene in the airport near the end was fantastic and rich, but had a hard time stomaching much of the rest of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral no fun","review":"I thought the premise behind this book was great; but it just didn't deliver. The writing is so cliche and repetitious that I found it very difficult to finish this book. I won't read any more of Radish's books after reading this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"great idea, but grating read","review":"I give credit to the author for an interesting concept, but too bad she couldn't develop the story. It became so ridiculous and repetitive right from the start. The long run on sentences were laborious. The flowery language seemed forced and overstated. A good editor should have caught things like: \\"we COULD have cared less.\\" I could go on and on, but since the author has already done that, I'll say no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read like an increbibly long, dull, detailed, book report on a good book","review":"I ploughed through the entire thing, though I don't know why. The characters were flat and you couldn't tell them apart, the dialog was trite and mostly nonexistant and the plot was completely unconvincing without being interesting or fantastic in any way. The only redeeming thing about this book was that it focused on female friendship, a topic I generally like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral","review":"This book was chosen by my monthly Book Club. It is light reading, not my fare, not much weight to storyline. I prefer non fiction, so if you prefer stronger stuff, make this book a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the title fool you.....","review":"...this is one of the most tedious books I've ever had the displeasure to read.Since finishing, I haven't been able to decide which is the best part of the book--the title or the cover. It's really a toss-up as this is some of the worst \\"agenda fiction\\" I've ever had the misfortune to pick up.The saddest part, is that interspersed between the feminist and political rants, speeches, lectures and \\"magical moments\\" lies an author who has a wonderful way with words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Tale","review":"What a great story of friendship, love and loss. The message is clear that you need to have FUN in this life as you only go around once. I didn't care for the reference towards the end of the Authors political views but overall a GREAT read."},{"rating":"1","title":"sentimental in the extreme","review":"I am reading this book for book club, and would not have chosen it myself otherwise. This concept is SENTIMENTAL in the EXTREME! Now, sentimental is not necessarily a bad thing. I cry at billboards. But I dislike the \\"we women own all of the emotions of the world\\" mentality of a novel like this. I find myself kind of ticked off at Annie for dragging us through one tediously overblown scenario after another. In the first third of the book I have already had to read about terminal cancer, suicide, single parenting, and stalking. What joys remain for me to enjoy? Oh, how about throwing cremated ashes around out of an old tennis shoe! The \\"sisterhood\\" makes it all worthwhile and do-able? Wine and conversation are a panacea? This COULD be funny, but instead it's just tragic and contrived."},{"rating":"1","title":"condition of book fine, substance light","review":"It took longer than I expected to receive this product, although within time estimates given. Condition of book was fine for a used book, although the substance was mush. I wouldn't recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"laugh,cry but most of all ENJOY","review":"This is about life,death and most importantly friendships.Women need their girlfriends like flowers need rain. The final tribute to Annie says it best.If you read no other book this year,please read this and remember to thank all your loved ones for creating who you are in life and death."},{"rating":"1","title":"Traveling Funeral a little too long","review":"After reading the first third of this book, I recommended it to a friend, but by the time I finished the book I was more than ready for Annie's journey to be over. The premise of the book is great and the life lessons important, but they are repeated so many times, the reader feels like she has to duck.The first half of the book is fun to read and a grand adventure, but I think I need to call my friend and modify my recommendtion."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad to see so many others agree","review":"i was intrigued by the premise, but had to fight my way to the end..i was so sick of the repetition & the characters' self-congratulatory \\"oh we're so wonderful, we're such fabulous women, let's toot our own horns for another hundred pages\\" routine that i really had a hard time even finishing it. i probably wouldn't have, if it hadn't been lent to me by someone i value & i wanted to give it a fair chance. i skimmed most of the last half & when i was done i said to my husband \\"FINALLY i'm done with this thing!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my hours back","review":"This book was very disappointing. I had to force myself to finish it. The repetition begins on the third page and then beats us over the head until the end. Why a book celebrating women and their friendships has to bash men is beyond me. In writing a book contemplating death, Radish never once considers faith. Her characters are all carbon copies of one another, and the story which is supposedly about great transformations teaches us nothing except that a vacation refreshes us. Duh! Don't spend your vacation, or any of your valuable time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most poorly written book I have ever read.","review":"The ideas are good and if you tell someone about the plot it does sound interesting. So just read the summary and save yourself from wasting your valuable reading time. I've read two Kris Radish books now; I give up. Her writing is embarrassingly bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Ride!","review":"I read this book a couple of years ago and still remember how it made me feel! Kris Radish weaves a wonderful, life-affirming story about the places and people that a 50-something cancer victim loved or impacted her while she was alive, and the journey that she leads this group of loosely-knit acquaintances on to celebrate her memories. It is during this poignant, funny, and thoughtful scavenger hunt across the country that allows everybody involved to discover or rediscover themselves and their personal directions in life. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has ever lost a loved one -- It's reassuring to know that we have all touched another person's life, whether we know it or not. Not a bad way to share your memories!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and poorly written","review":"I read this for book club, and found it unbearable. It was like reading an entire book written by my worst college freshman writing student who sailed through high school English with straight As then though she could win me over with excessive prose and contrived emotion. With few exceptions, the entire thing was drivel, though I confess I skipped a multitude of sentences and sometimes entire passages as the trial wore on. I like the premise and Radish falls upon some worthy insights, but she has no business being published. She does not possess the requisite skills."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!!","review":"The best word to describe the whole traveling funeral. It took a bit for me to really get engrossed in the book, but by the time they left Florida, I was hooked.Annie dies, and wants five of her best friends to have a traveling funeral for her. But is it really for her or for them? Are funerals for the living or dead? You decide. Anyway, so she has stops planned for them, where they are to throw a bit of her ashes.Along the way they meet new people, discover things about Annie they never knew, and discover things about themselves they didn't know or had forgotten.Good book, a bit tedious at times for me, but still a thumbs up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"This book was a choice of my book club because we were misinformed that the book was humorous and light. The cover gives this impression also. But the content proved otherwise. It was too sappy and unrealistic for my tastes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and Sassy Look at Friendship","review":"I almost didn't read this book after it was called overwrought. I don't like overwrought whether it's fashion or fiction. The book was fresh and funny. I enjoyed it. The concept of friends traveling to a funeral is enjoyable and unique--nothing \\"overwrought\\" in these pages. I can only question the person's judgement or agenda who wrote that. I'm glad I didn't let it stop me.Summary: A great \\"road\\" book that will make you howl with laughter. You'll want to pass it along to your friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uh Oh","review":"Uh oh ... this book is the next one up for my book club and after reading the reviews, I fear I will have to force myself to read it. I probably fall more in line with the folks who couldn't stand it. Oh, well, sometimes one has to make sacrifices...but, at least I won't buy it, but will get it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this book at Costco hoping for a great beach read. I kept hoping this book would get better and finally got so annoyed, I put it down for good about 2/3 of the way through (although I read the epilogue to make sure I didn't miss anything and it was all wrapped up way too neatly for me). It took so many turns and was so unrealistic with a bit too much liberalism thrown in. The idea of the book is fantastic but the writer tries way to hard to make this book memorable and symbolic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Annie Freeman's Fabulous Traveling Funeral","review":"Just started this book and because of other reads, I know I'm going to enjoy this one....Keep writing Kris Radish....You give us HOPE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Show me, don't tell me\\"","review":"I actually recommended this book to my book group after both my sister and cousin-in-law raved that it was a must read. I'm sorry girls. If I hadn't felt I should read the whole thing, I would have skimmed over all the repititions of too many tears, too much whine, as well as too much wine. The author never showed me how Annnie was \\"fabulous\\". Same old, same old Kris Radish; if you like her themes, you will enjoy this book, if not you will be bored enough to be planning your own funeral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely finished this one...","review":"I picked up this book with anticipation... it seemed like a great premise for a story...but I was disappointed to say the least. After the first few pages of reading - about the bra and the meeting with a (female, of course) UPS driver, I began to suspect that I would be disappointed. I managed to finish this novel, but barely...The characters just didn't seem real to me. Annie was just too good to be true (does anybody laugh that much?), and the fact that her \\"friends\\" didn't know about the obviously important aspects of her life that they \\"discovered\\" made me wonder just how good of friends they could have been.The fact that the women all got along so well (well enough to go swimming in the nude!) was too far fetched...I could not wait for the book to be over... in fact, I skimmed through the last few pages... don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patronizing","review":"This book is quite tedious and patronizing. Kris Radish apparently doesn't believe her audience is smart enough to understand/glean the emotions of the characters. She writes \\"dribbling\\" words of what they think instead of creating full characters whose nuances, actions, and unique dialogues speak for themselves. I can't relate to one single character, and think it's quite odd that all of them use the same language and seem to have no true individuality. And, on top of that, Marie's intuition and Laura's extra-sensory perception abilities seemed completely unbelievable and goofy in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radish Irks","review":"This may be the worst book I've ever tried to read. Hyperbolic, sentimental, and contrived. All characters speak with the same (unnatural) voice. I may divorce my Book Club for mental cruelty."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will laugh, cry, ponder and sigh","review":"Fabulous!!!

Great read - could not put it down and can't wait to begin the discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelmed","review":"Two minutes into the audio, I already disliked this title so much that I wanted to push the stop button. I stuck it out only because of a friend's high recommendation for the print version. And it was a struggle not to give up on the book. I just did not identify with, nor really like, any of the characters. Maybe too homespun for me, or too... what? I don't know; it was not the book for me.

Then I wondered if Amazon had something like this,they do, so I ordered 2 of this fork 1 of another like it and the Nor Pro granny type fork.. I like all three and use them for different foods. The Nor Pro is good for larger recipes especially pancakes, biscuits and cake mixes but this fork is just what you need for making salad dressings and mixing smaller recipes of things like coleslaw, tuna/egg/salmon salads.

It did nothing for my hair except pull it. Also, it took more than 30 MINUTES to heat up and even then it was NOT hot at all. Plus, when I used it, there was an awful and strong smell. Do not buy this product even to try it out. You will be disappointed. Instead, buy the Remington Wet to Dry for only $24 bucks from Target. Now thats an amazing product. Much better than this piece of crap!!>:("},{"rating":"1","title":"Does an OK job but there has got to be something better!","review":"I have been using this book for almost 2 months to teach myself Flash programming. I do think the book is very good at making things simple and easy to understand but sometimes it's \\"too easy.\\" I think those that are learning flash programming are already going to have some experience with using computers, so some of the stuff that this book explains is unnecessary. Also, there are no source files so sometimes I would like to follow the directions in the book to do something but I don't have any basic source files to do any of the things the book describes...so I think this book is only good for introducing the program. I need to get another book that actually has a more \\"recipe\\" like structure so that I can follow along and do as the book instructs but with source files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chilling and beautiful","review":"I, personally, love instrumental music. But it's beautiful, because you can feel each note in every song. And if you saw the movie then you understand what kind of vibe the music is giving off. It's rather lonely and depressing, but it makes you think. It seems kinda creepy, but all the notes go perfect together, creating a beautiful piece of work.By the way, does anyone know what any of the other songs are called? I found THE CHURCH and TEARS FOR FEARS, but what are the other ones in the movie? If yall could help, that'd be nice! Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great, only if you have an appreciation for the movie","review":"I really enjoyed this score, but if you are looking for the 80's music in the movie, then this is not what you want. But, if your like me and you saw the movie, then this soundtrack is perfect. This cd is for the people who *have* seen the movie. The only reason they didnt make a cd of the 80's music in the movie, is beacuase of a lack of funds. The movie was an independent film, even though the budget was 5 million. It would have cost much more to license all the 80's songs in the movie. But still, the scorse is just as good. As you listen to the songs, you can almost see the movie. The composition of the songs are great and they truly capture what is going on in this unique film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. Simply wow.","review":"Donnie Darko itself is the number one movie on my list....No no no I do not have short standards, it just appealed to me on a very high level. As for the score, one couldn't have asked for anything better. Michael Andrews has done a stunning job of incorporating exceptional 80's piece music with some modernized beats. Some of the most eerie and harrowing pieces of music I have heard in a long time. It is by far one of my most favorite scores out there. It's just too bad they ran short to also produce a soundtrack. The 80's element within the film really helped create the setting and time. Oh well, there's always a bootleg cut. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but get the import instead!","review":"An excellent score for an excellent film -but I prefer the UK import which includes the soundtrack as well as the score.

I love it. Its only forty minutes long, but its a treasure. Micheal Andrews is a great composer, and wrote the perfect score. Every track on this CD is awesome, although I wish they would've included the eighties songs that play throughout the movie. Its a great score album that should belong to everyone that loves the movie.BUY IT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the reviews before you buy","review":"I wish I'd have read some of the reviews of the \\"Donny Darko\\" score before purchasing the recording. The music that inspired me to buy the album simply isn't on the disc--a point many of the reviewers make clear. What's on the disc is a lot of short, repetitious mood tracks that work well as background music for the film but don't hold up in an audio-only format. Frankly, I was angered by this deceptive recording. Maybe someday the actual soundtrack will be made available. This sure isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"excuse me, several good songs are missing","review":"Some of the better songs from the movie are missing. Remember that scene where you first see the school and music plays in the background? That music is not on the album. It's called 'Head over Heals' by Tears for Fears. Remember that scene where Donnie's little sister performs on stage? That music is not on the album. It's called 'Notorious' by Duran Duran. There are other good songs that were played in the movie which also do not appear on the album. This album misleads the public. You will be disappointed if you expected to hear those songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"oof... horrible","review":"Apparently they were too cheap to actually pay for any of the MUSIC in the movie so this soundtrack is actually just a compilation of sounds and audio effects... completely useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"just wanted \\"mad world\\"","review":"loved the mad world track from the Gears of War video game. was hoping the rest of the album was as cool, but it is all instrumentals. a little disappointing, i must admit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Liked only one cut","review":"I bought this CD for the song \\"Mad World\\".

The only reason i would give this soundtrack less than five stars is the lack of the '80s songs that appear. It is a \\"score\\" soundtrack, but the other songs are a critical element, i.e., \\"Under the Milky Way Tonight\\" and \\"Head Over Heels\\" and \\"Love Will Tear Us Apart\\" and \\"The Killing Moon\\". But this is in no way an admonition for you not to purchase this .. it's sublime. Michael Andrews does an amazing job with the darkling emotions lurking in the film, and translates it to music compellingly. The only vocal track \\"Mad World\\" is worth the entire CD. It's just a shame that Gary Jules is so hard to find on CD... but this is definitely an essential to the film enthusiast or soundtrack lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting..","review":"The score from Donnie Darko is by far the best I've ever heard. Forget about the fact that it's low budjet and that the 80's music is absent and just concentrate on the wonderful stuff that is there! The fact that they included the superb cover of \\"Mad World\\" is also a brilliant bonus, although you may find yourself reminising to the part in the movie which makes everyone sad!Don't even think about it- order this score now and appreciate it for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theater song, \\"West End Girls\\"","review":"I've heard \\"West End Girls\\" was played in the movie, but when I listened to it I couldn't tell in what scene it was in.

Also, does anyone know what the song they played in the theater was called, or if it's on this soundtrack?The music on this score is pretty cool, but it's true that it would've been nice to have included all the 80s tunes. At least Mad World, a fantastic cover, was included."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all those disappointed...","review":"This is just a note for all those who are disappointed with the fact that this was simply a \\"score\\" and not a \\"soundtrack\\" as you all would have hoped. It's true that Richard Kelly's budget was not that of titanic porportions, but take his advice and download the songs you're missing.

It was truly one of the worst movies I have ever suffered through. We saw it in the theater, and we almost walked out about halfway through, but decided to stick it out to the bitter end.

I read the book long before this movie came out and fell in love with it. Anyone read Eragon then watch Eragon the movie? This is worse.The book is great, the storyline gets you hooked and the ending is an unexpected one but also great unlike the predictable storyline in the movie. Apart from the characters having the same name and the fact that it's about werewolves nothing in the book and the movie are the same. The setting, the ages of the characters, the appearances of the characters, there is no actual chocolate in the book it is just a metaphor not a place where she works like in the movie, the storyline everything in the book is different and 100 times better. I hate this movie out of pure spite, they shouldn't have even bothered. This makes me not want to see movies based on books. I don't recommend this movie. Read the book. Annette Curtis Klause wrote it."},{"rating":"1","title":"So off the mark","review":"Okay so I might be a little bias having read the book before seeing this movie but I just thought it was awful! So much of want made the book amazing was changed. It just didn't have the same feel to it. I didn't like the plot or how the characters were changed and although it had some great cinematography I just found it dull.Save your self the hassle and get the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"werewolf","review":"I think this rates up there as a really good werewolf & romance movie. There is a little room for improvement, but is overall a good and interesting movie. A definite add for your collection if you're into these kind of movies. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Movie","review":"After hearing about the book and the movie, I had decided to see the movie first. Even without knowing how it compared to the book, I thought the movie was terrible. It was jumpy, and it didn't focus on one thing. It was a bit confusing, and wasn't at all one certain genre. I wanted to see more romance than I did.And then I read the book.The book was great, of course. But the movie DESTROYED it. They changed EVERYTHING, including practically the whole plotline. I am sorry to say I am very disappointed in this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I think they were riding their wave from Underworld which I really enjoyed.

I haven't read the book, so I'm reviewing the movie on it's own merit, and all I can say, it, it doesn't have any. Have you read the 5-star reviews? They're obviously written by 13 year old girls who had to hug their Strawberry Shortcake dolls during the movie so they wouldn't be scared of the big hairy woman-eating sexy college boys. I would rather drive rusty nails into my left foot while being beaten with a two-by-four against my barbed-wire wrapped head than watch this \\"film\\" again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold up to the book","review":"I read the book when it came out years ago, but read it again for the sake of the movie. I had a feeling the movie wasn't going to live up to it just from the trailers, so I waited this long, til it was on TV, to watch it.This story was soo childish it was sad. The was the \\"rules\\" worked pretty much screwed them from the beginning. One man shouldn't be allowed to have all the power over soo many people. He especially shouldn't be allowed to \\"have\\" someone that doesn't even want him. What I kept waiting for was for Vivian to actually defy Gabriel, tell him she wouldn't lay with him even if he forced her to be his mate. But she stayed soo nervous, for no good reason. And why did all those werewolves follow him anyway? I mean if Gabriel wasn't soo intent on having things his way, none of the fighting would have happened.All in all, it felt like a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected.","review":"After watching this film, I realize that it was made for the 12-14 years old age group.

The playing in the rain, the watching him play with kids (aw, he'll be a great dad), the playing in the fountain... Yep not a hack \\"We're so in love\\" scene left out. The logical ending point wasn't actually the end. It just kept going. I'm not sure why either, not to improve it. Not a great movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Compared to the book, this movie is GARBAGE!!! It doesn't even follow the book, they just add the names of the characters. Viv doesn't work in some pastry shop, she goes to high school. Aiden doesn't choose her, she ends up with a member of the pack... this movie is so far from what it should have been I cannot believe that it was allowed to be released like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eli Writes Review","review":"Only reason this movie would ever get above 1 star rating is if you have never ever read the book or intend to.This is perfect example of how to butcher a good story and have someone make 'creative changes' that just don't work. This is the example I base all terrible versions of movies based on books on. Worse movie based on a book ever! Someone pretty much went \\"Oh hey that sounds cool, let's take the idea and change everything.\\"The setting (not even in the right country), the ages, the entire story to the point of ENDING differently. The ONLY thing the same is the characters names, the characters themselves are completely unrecognizable.Blood and Chocolate is one of my favourite books. I didn't see this movie until years after it came out and I'm so happy I didn't. This movie is bad, I mean it puts bad movies to shame. Down-right don't waste your time. If you're a fan of the book I'm sure you would have heard of it by now, and if you haven't: There is a reason for that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"i liked the movie and the book","review":"the movie is nothing like the book. only the character's names and roles are kept the same. but other than that ever their personalities were changed in the movie. if you like scary stories and thrilling movies then i suggest Blood and Chocolate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this movie but book better!","review":"If you haven't read the book I HIGHLY recommend it. So much better then the movie (always is) but I still like this movie and would recommend it if you're into werewolves and such.On a side note what the heck is up with Amazon and always lowering their prices after buying an item?! I went through an outside company because Amazon wanted $30+ now down to $21? I would have paid that price and not the $30+ just because I have prime and don't have to worry about sellers NOT shipping the items to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"filmed like eyecandy, but not the book","review":"having read and loved the book this was a complete and utter disappointment. The book being about a 16 year old girl coming of age and learning her feminine prowess, a process all girls go through if they are human or werewolf. This movie became the typical Hollywood girl meets boy story. finding myself so dismayed in the typical boring movie I have actually put it up for sale at amazon. I can say it was filmed with visual integrity, and my husband having not read the book was midily entertained."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Paranormal Flop","review":"I was really excited about seeing this movie when I heard what it was about. I was expecting something fantastic because the plot sounded really good and creative. However, when I finally got to see the movie I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the production. I think the only thing I really enjoyed was the detail displayed in the gothic like scenery and I didn't think they did that bad of a job turning humans into wolves. Although, with all of the technological advances of the day, I think they could have had something more impressive. Overall, I don't think this movie is worth owning and it disappointed me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book and Movie Don't Mesh","review":"Have you ever read a book that you LOVE and then they turn it into a movie that just doesn't seem to match? That's what they did with Blood and Chocolate.The movie ruined the book, and that's all there is to it.I LOVED the book, and I had read it more than one time before I had heard that it was being turned into a movie. I was really excited, but then tonight I actually saw the movie.At the end, for the last 5 minutes, my eyes were open REALLY wide and my mouth was wide open because I couldn't believe what was happening. The ending was almost the complete opposite of the ending in the book...which I happened to like.If you like the book, don't see the movie.If you've seen the movie, read the book and then yell at the movie for being so different."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as \\"based\\" on the book as the Eragon movie was...","review":"For those of you that have read the wonderful novel this movie was 'based' on, the only advice i can give you is dont see it. I couldnt even bring myself to watch the whole movie- halfway through i turned it off. The acting is really not up to par, the 'bad guy' seems about as menacing as a wet kitten, and worst of all the only thing the movie shares in common with the book are character names, and thats about it. Hollywood slaughtered the novel in every way shape and form. I havent been this disappointed in a book turned movie since the Eragon movie came out.For those of you that havent read the book, this might be a decent movie, albeit seriously corny (her working in a chocolate shop?? C'mon, there had to be SOMETHING more creative there for the blood and chocolate theme)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, and Well... Pathetic !!!","review":"Disgusting !! A freaking waste of time... I read the book before watching the movie.. and the book was amazing !! I can't believe they butchered the whole thing by making this movie !!! ******It was NOTHING like the book, and EVEN IF THERE NEVER WAS A BOOK.. THIS MOVIE WOULD STILL BE VERY BAD !!! ****** I can't believe I wasted approximately 1 hour and 38 minutes I will NEVER get back EVER!!! I don't know whether to laugh at the horrible plot, uninspired characters or cry because I made myself endure this piece of trash. I was so disgusted that I wanted all of them to die just to make myself feel better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Far Off","review":"This movie was very disappointing. I read the book before watching it and I was very excited to see how they but the story into film but this movie was a complete let down. Although it features the same characters, the movie entirely twisted the original story, killing off the wrong characters, taking place in the wrong locations, and even featuring the wrong conflicts. While in the book the title blood and chocolate reffers to the main character's internal conflict between being part of a pack and falling in love with a human, the movie uses it to refer to her job at a chocolate shop, hardly showing any of her interal struggle. And this is only one of the many key points of the story that was changed.I guess this would be an okay movie if you haven't read the book, but even then I feel it lacking an interesting plot, or even characters that have good chemistry.In my opinion, an overall disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the Book!","review":"I fell in love with the book when I was 12. The movie would have been good if I'd never read the book as this movie shouldn't even hold the same name. It is nothing like the book. I realized this before even seeing the movie from watching previews! The only thing that is the same are the names of the characters and that they are werewolves. Everything else, including where the events are happening, are completely different. If you've seen the book, don't watch it. If you haven't read the book, this movie is pretty good. I just can't stand it because its nothing like my beloved book. They ruined it."},{"rating":"1","title":"They werent really werewolves...","review":"just regular wolves, and very easily killed. And why, except for two characters, were all of them teenagers?

This movie was horrible!","review":"If you've read the novel, DO NOT watch this movie. If you haven't read the book, read the book and then DO NOT watch this movie! The big wigs in Hollywood pretty much threw out anything that resembled the book, kept the character names, then regurgitated a werewolf-centered 'Underworld' remake for movie-goers."},{"rating":"1","title":"not was i expected...","review":"i was soo excited for the movie after reading the book, but it wasn't good at all! i suggest you read the book instead of watching this move! it will save you a lot time n u will enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"guilty pleasure\\"","review":"This movie is one of my \\"guilty pleasures\\", of which I have few. Being a fan of the Uderworld series, and An American Werewolf in London. I found their treatment of the change from human to wolf a breath of fresh air, and quite a change from the normal ammount of gore presented in most Werewolf movies. The love story as a back story didnt hurt either, refreshing. This movie did not follow the book, but I do enjoy the movie for what it is, hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood and Chocolate the movie vs book","review":"I watched the movie, then read the book, then watched the movie again. There is so little in common between the book (excellent) and the movie (poor) that I will put that movie on the back shelf. The movie was good for what they did, but it was an injustice to call it Blood and Chocolate. If you have not read the book, then the movie is easier to watch and enjoy. The book was awesome, in the book, Gabriel is wanting a mate-Vivian, he does not seem to be replacing an existing one. Astrid is not at all the same as she is in the book. In the book Vivian accepts her duality and finally finds the love she craved within her pack. I too wanted to see the fight for dominance with both the male and female wolves. Too much taken from the book to make this movie. Age differences, location differences, social dilemma's lost, characters left out or completely changed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood & Chocolate","review":"Did not like this movie at all. The story did not make any sense. There was more blood than chocolate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I did not like the movie because I have the book and I think the movie was a total waste of time if they just placed the movie in a different country and changed all the characters and their purpose in the book.

I haven't read the book yet, but it doesn't matter.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book - want to see the movie?","review":"After reading the book (which by the way was quite good), discovered the movie version, while I was a bit unsure (the synopsis for the movie seemed that it was a bit of a departure from the book), I thought, why not give it a go, unfortunately except for the fact the female lead in both the book & movie have the same name & turn into a werewolf, and the other characters have the same names, it was so loosely based on the book, as to be almost non-existant. As werewolf movies go its a tad lame, but kinda OK, but if you liked the book & hope to see the movie expecting the same, basically don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting + Childish special effects + Slow pace = Boring","review":"This movie is not worth watching beccause of the bad acting, childish special effects and slow pace. It's very boring. It's obviously a below-par B movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BIG dissapointment","review":"I read the book and really liked it. However,the movie is compeltely different.

The song itself is about a 3, but the video & the remix earns an extra point =0)welcome back ladies, YOU HAVE BEEN MISSED... MUAH!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Undervalued Novel - I found it excellent","review":"This book touched me deeply and went not for the easy answers that I see presented in so much fiction that tries to capture the distinct relationships within a family and the community in which that family exists, but for a subtle exploration of the limits and the desires of the characters. The writing was both lyric and beautiful. I found Wolff's willingness to give grace and depth to a variety of perspectives here (there is no easy villian, no easy victim, NO SIMPLE ANSWERS) incredible. This is work to touch the soul but you have to let it. Wonderful work Mr. Wolff."},{"rating":"2","title":"an amazing world","review":"Wolff's novel succeeds largely due to its ability to create a world with acuity, vividness, magic. The Blackberry Mountain community he creates with bewildered adults who beget bewildered children is evoked in a way that is in turn terrifying and charming. Wolff's handling of sexuality, and the issue referenced in the title is interesting, thought-provoking. He's on no soapbox, interested instead in exploring behavior as it is in a way that seems perfectly right in regard to the characters. Doc Holliday is a villain-like character with tremendous wickedness and magnetism. But the real villains are Jinks and Ann, guilty of the most wretched offense of all, being flawed as humans. The novel isn't perfect--the ending is a bit jarring--but there's a quirkiness and freshness throughout, as well as the honest and courageous look at some ugly and touchy issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excessive in all aspects","review":"Perhaps the goal of this novel is too grandiose, and that is why Wolff fails so obviously. Wolff tries to present each unique reader with a character that they can relate to, and instead ends up with a gang of stereotypes. He tries to show a family grappling with its problems, but the situations are so ridiculous that the book becomes a soap-opera-like melodrama. To some extent, this novel seems to be a bildungsroman, chronicling the growth of a boy into manhood. However, the childhood protagonist is hardly reconcilable to the adult, and the reader has trouble sympathizing with either. To see a family in crisis dissected more accurately, see Judith Guest's ORDINARY PEOPLE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little of interest","review":"Geoffrey Wolff's newest novel contains as little of intrest as his earlier efforts. Attempting to achieve a sublte mix of humor and pathos, Wolff ultimately provides neither. Instead, his efforts to confront family secrets and expost sexual hypocrisy only suggests the limits to the author's imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent source for geographic information","review":"I am used the the pulp and paper atlases, but I decided to give this digital atlas a try, and I'm very happy with it.

I finished the book in one night. I've since read Eugenie Olson's other two books and out of the three, this is the best of the bunch.Iley is imperfect and continually makes mistakes before slowly wising up. With Olson's other two books, they both had that \\"Oh! And it was all right there in front of me and I'm just noticing it!\\" conveniently about 30 pages before the end of the book. Fortunately, \\"Taffeta\\" has less of that. The ending isn't a perfectly-tied bow. It seemed more realistic in how the character has to redeem herself to those she hurt during her careless fling.There are points in the book where you'll go, \\"How could she be so stupid?!?\\" But realistically, isn't that part of life?

It's not my favorite, but it gets enough time in my cd player. Testament would continue this sound into their next album, Souls Of BLOCK!!

I've always had respect for this band and in many ways believed they should have been bigger than they were. The simply fact is, once you start getting to fast and to furious you lose some of your audience. I'm not saying that's a bad thing of that thrash music isn't a great breed of metal, what I'm saying is the vast majority of people just don't understand it, which translates into limited exposure. Practice What You Preach is a fantastic effort from a great thrash band and that's really all that can be said about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is pure metal!!!","review":"This is what metal is all about.

If you like Thrash and don't have this cd you're missing out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten tracks of thrashy goodness!","review":"Right from the outset of the title track, \\"Practice What You Preach\\" is some roaringly infectious old school thrash. With lots of ripping riffs, Chuck Billy's unmistakable howl, and just enough use of melody to please the ear, this is doubtless one of the underappreciated gems of the thrash era. With the exception of the aptly titled \\"The Ballad,\\" the album never deviates from its formula of energetic, fist-pumping metal, with some top notch musicianship to boot; you especially have to love Alex Skolnick's blazing solos. I'm not going to bother citing specific songs, as they're all excellent and I don't care for song-by-song reviews anyway. In conclusion, BUY BUY BUY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament at their best","review":"This was among my favorite albums during my teen years. Alex Skolnick was one of the best guitarists in metal at the time - very underrated in my opinion. Great phrasing, passion, and technique that made not only his solos, but the most straight-forward rhythm work impressive. His riffs were quite an influence on my playing during that time period.But it doesn't end with great guitar. Every one in Testament brought something worthwhile to the table. It was a collective act that really knew how to jam. I saw them twice in concert and they were excellent on both occasions.

Out of the dozen plus books I read this was one of the most informative and best written of them. Certainly one needs many other sources to get a full picture of what is going on in the NT and in Matthew in particular, but this book gives a great amount of info you probably won't get from anywhere else. Also, since the author is writing about the context in which Matthew was written, he seems to have no interest in the traditional critical questions such as authorship, date, sources, etc. This makes it friendly to those interested in the Bible from either side of the conservative/liberal divide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries and Charger did not work.","review":"The price was right, but when the product arrived, it didn't charge the included batteries.

Yes, we are talking about a simple battery charger.The charger charges AA and AAA batteries, it can be either a single battery, 2, 3 or 4 of them. Each compartment which holds a battery has dual connectors, depending on which size battery you insert (AAA's go in the back, AA's in the front). If you don't insert them correctly, well, then the charger wont work.When fully charged, the charger supposedly starts trickle charging, so the batteries are being maintained and not overcharged.I own quite a few of these combos.

This album is uplifting to anyone of any belief. The music reaches inside and grabs you with catchy rythms, beyond excellent musicianship (without being overly technical), and soaring vocals.

The boys are one of the greatest rock and roll bands of all-time, yet still unknown to your average music fan. GGTN is hailed as the band's masterpiece by most people who care. Although you cannot count me as one of those, this is still a great album with no weaknesses. \\"Over My Head\\" has become a live classic over the years. All the songs are top notch, and as with any King's X music, buy it if you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly great music from the soul!!!","review":"I've been a King's X fan since this album first came out in '89. I heard them on MTV (of all places) and immediately fell in love with their talent and sound. I was amazed at Doug's powerful voice, Ty's tasty and soulful chops, Jerry's consistent playing, and their simply wonderful songs. There's not a bad one on this album. Doug's singing is best on \\"Everybody Knows...\\"Send a Message\\", and \\"I'll Never Be the Same.\\" Ty also stands out too though. \\"Summerland\\" is beautiful and it's on this song that you realize that Ty's not only a great guitarist, but he's also a great singer. Finally, \\"Over My Head\\" is just a great song. If you don't have their greatest hits, the live version they do of this song alone is worth the money.

This CD was released in 1989, and it is still far from being dated. From the Wizard of Oz/Alice in Wonderland dreamy opening track, to the Gospel-laden Over My Head, to the most unique song I've ever heard in Pleadies, this adventure of a CD doesn't give you a chance to catch your breath. Every song is a 5 star song (maybe not I'll Never Be the Same, but who is perfect?). Each track is different from the rest, making this a calvacade of music that tells a nifty story, without being predictable or hokey. Do yourself a freakin' favor and give this a spin.

And Ray, of course, works the piano, but every so often, there he is on the alto sax.And he isn't just taking up space. He can play that thing, and you wonder why he has doesn't done more with it.

Other than that, not much good to say. On the good side, the graphics are very well done, with attractive rendering and details, and nice iron sites on the weapons.The bad:The enemy doesn't move too much, except when they are scripted to do so. You can sit forever in one position and keep shooting or just hide - they will never come look for you.So far (I have gotten about half way through the game) you don't get to drive vehicles, fly planes, etc. Compared to BF and Medal of Honor, this is a disappointment.As other reviews said, you basically just shoot and move. This gets rather repetitive very quickly, especially since the computer seems to just sit around (though perhaps that's my difficulty level).The missions are basically get from point A to B, by flanking.For 5 dollars this game is fine, but I wouldn't spend much money or time on it overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30","review":"It took a call to UBI to install this game.

I was not impressed with it at all. I got tired of it after 10 min. First of all when you shoot at the enemy, is it just me or when you hit them, they kneel down and heal. Oh yeah, those enemey locaters are anoying. It takes several rounds to kill the enemy when your at range and the aim of the gun it terrible, it moves around a lot. The whole concept of ordering the troops is nice but it could have been better. The only thig I did like was the new graphics and character textures, it looked real almost.

So far, it's a mixed review with some people liking it and others hating. It's hit or miss with this game.The graphics are a little old- it's based on the OLD Unreal engine. That sucks.

If you want a simple run-'n-gun shooter, then look elsewhere. You won't be charging around killing scores of enemies within minutes either (but you will kill enough to satisfy your trigger finger!). The utter authenticity and feels-like-you're-there atmosphere is absolutely amazing, as is some of the blood and gore one might witness in combat (during certain chapters of the game).

I have adequate water pressure to the faucet, but it just won't flow out of the head. I called Kohler's customer service and they were very helpful. They sent me an entire new head assembly at no charge. I replaced the head and it worked great. That was in late February. Here it is mid-April and the faucet has started acting up again.

There are maybe a few songs that were in the show in there but most of them aren't. It's a good thing I get to hear the score piece in there it's beautiful but the rest of the songs sucks.

It was definently a pageturner and I didn't want to set the book down; every chapter left you wanting to continue on with the book. I only gave the book 4 stars however, because it was slightly confusing, especially the end, which I kind of wish had been different. Olin makes it feel as if you really are Britney and you can just picture each and every thing as if it were a horror movie. This book is pretty good, though I would recommend it for ages 13+, maybe even 14."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mysteriously engaging.","review":"this book is a mystery of its own, Sean Olin has created an engaging plotline with a mixture of different types of characters, from the stuck up populars to the old boring freaky friends.

I read the description on the back and thought it sounded interesting. The fact that it was based on Madison, Wisconsin, in which is where I live, made it even better because i knew of every place it described. Plus, it sounded romantic and hey those are the ones that us teens like to read. So I borrowed it from the school librarian (it hasnt been put on shelves yet) and I've read it in a night and a half. At the beginning what happens is a total shocker and a total tear jerker. This book is very descriptive and definately keeps you on your toes but is more of a beginner-like mystery book. I'd agree with the others that it is a page turner and definately a book you want to finish ASAP. All i can say is that you'll never believe the ending so even if you think you know whats going on, really you're fooling yourself.

Killing BritneyHeartThe Aurora Public LibraryMystery NovelA novel of mystery, suspense, tragedy, and high school romances. This novel takes place in the present day. It takes place in a small town called \\"Madison.\\" All the characters in this novel are realistic and they are filled with drama. The main character is Britney. This novel probably should not be read by young children, due to the content.This novel is an easy and a fast read as well. The chapters go by really fast. Basically the novel is about a seventeen-year-old girl named Britney, who lives a very tragic life. First, her mom dies in a rafting accident, and then her boyfriend dies in a hit and run. Things just keep going wrong in her life. All of her friends start to worry about her as all these horrible things continue to happen to the loved ones in her life.

It goes beyond the cliched plot of a heroic preppy chick who is the heroine and person who solves the mystery. In fact, the preppy chick is the killer!

Definitely read this if you love suspense!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I put this book at the top of my wish list, hoping to find in it a history of the development of writing in Sumer and a description of how the writing system operates. Instead I found a long-winded, repetitive discussion in the French philosophical tradition of the nature of reality and whether writing is a \\"different language\\" than speaking. More than half the book is spent deriding other French authors. The main thesis of the book, delivered with great rhetorical finesse and little or no evidence, is that writing did not develop gradually but was \\"invented\\" suddenly as a full-blown system."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written","review":"The title of the book should be \\"Writing in Sumer before the invention of cuneiform\\". The author's erudition shows everywhere in this book, however, the text is much too chatty and I found it extremely tedious (and I am very interested in the topic). At half its length it would have been too long. Trivialities are being treated in epic detail. Many statements are obscure and unsupported by evidence. Because of my deep interest I read the whole book, but it was a waste of time. It seems that I had to give it one star, but I would have preferred to rate it with no stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got options for ya","review":"Most people seem pretty disappointed by this book; on the other hand, I am very satisfied with this book: Before Writing, Volume I: From Counting to Cuneiform, by Denise Schmandt-Besserat. It refutes the very thesis that cuneiform developed out of nothing, instead, her theory is that it developed \\"from an archaic counting device.\\" The foreword is by an eminent Assyriologist, and there's a volume II which is basically all the data (pictures of counting tokens), so the reader can judge for themself. If that weren't enough, she also wrote \\"'How Writing Came About' [which] draws material from both volumes to present Schmandt-Besserat's theory for a wide public and classroom audience. Based on the analysis and interpretation of a selection of 8,000 tokens or counters from 116 sites in Iran, Iraq, the Levant, and Turkey, it documents the immediate precursor of the cuneiform script.\\" Anyone interested in this topic should be satisfied..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective and interesting","review":"I've been using these recordings in conjunction with other materials and have really enjoyed it. The program takes you through dialogs with a male and female speaker in various situations. There are intermingled segments on vocabulary, cultural information, and listening to and responding to dialog. I've found this format much more useful and interesting than just lists of words repeated over and over. A beginner might find the quick pace of the conversations challenging, but the narration helps a lot and the early lessons focus on helping you catch the \\"gist\\" of the conversation even if you don't understand all the words. It's geared toward travel phrases and expressions, but covers a range of subjects and introduces simple grammar. I'm someone who gets bored with memorization quickly, but I've found this program's lively exchanges between the speakers holds my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I purchased this program to supplement my introductory Spanish class. The lessons COULD be very useful but I find the male speaker, Alberto, extremely frustrating. He speaks so rapidly and unclearly that I just become annoyed with the entire process. At this point I realize it's time for a different program altogether."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for learning conversational Spanish","review":"This is a nicely done set of CDs that give you a chance to listen to dialogues in Spanish spoken at a natural pace - the way people really speak and the type of language you will actually hear if you visit a Spanish-speaking country. You need to pay attention to use these CDs effectively, so they are not so good for passively listening in your car where you will be distracted by your driving. But if you can sit quietly and really listen, you will certainly improve your listening comprehension. I enjoyed this program and found it helpful to my understanding of Spanish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I just finished taking a semester of Spanish at the local community college. When I saw \\"Spanish on the Move\\" at the local library I thought it would provide a fun way to get some practice while driving in my car. Unfortunately these CDs throw out too much vocabular too quickly, the speakers speak much too quickly for a product aimed at relative novices, and the speakers are hard to understand. There are better products out there. --Jeff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoagie's Gifted.org","review":"This terrific book is for homeschooling parents and more - there is information for schooling parents, school teachers, gifted teachers, and more, on gifted children, learning styles, internet resources, and so much more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I borrowed \\"Creative Home Schooling...\\" from our local library in search for information about homeschooling, I have since read a few other books, but this is by far the best one I have found. it truly answered most of the questions I had about homeschooling, from why should I homeschool to which curriculum is best for my children.

Opal names a dog after a store and noone even notices, except for Gloria Dump who barely said anything about it anyway. The dog wasn't gone a minute, he just hid under a bed. What I DO think is cool about this book is it talks about how people have REASONS to be upset or be mean or be strange. The End. Not a very good book, unless if you like reading this; Blah blah blah.

She writes about very serious issues: moving, school, alcoholism, parents splitting up, being lonely, being poor, religion, in a way that anyone can understand. Often, books written for children about such serious issues, are obviously meant to be about those issues. This book is simply an engaging story that happens to deal with these issues.

The author does a marvelous job of capturing the style and diction of the southern characters, and gives each one a complex personality. As for content, I thought it had just enough heavy subject matter and philosophical reflection to make it a valuable read (messages about death, family, friendship, loyalty, bravery), mixed with plenty of lighthearted adventure and exploration, narrated with classic story-telling charm.

You could probably find lots of interesting things that she does for people she doesn't even know, but after a while, she gets to know them and she gets more and more friends by the day.

This author makes the characters come alive and become such close friends -- particuarly the mouse in Despereaux. This book requires a more mature child than The Tale of Despereaux.

It would be a great book for a parent to read to a child or a teacher to read to his or her class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because of \\"Because of Winn Dixie\\"","review":"I read this book to my almost-8-year-old daughter (two chapters a night). It is the first time she has been hooked on a story and concerned about the characters. She tried to predict what would happen next and what would happen in a sequel. I truly found myself looking forward to the nightly reading for the same reasons she did. Because of \\"Winn Dixie,\\" my daughter learned the joy of reading (and got into the back-to-school bedtime routine)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me!","review":"I just read Because of Winn Dixie with my 3rd grade class. Because of Winn Dixie is a book about a girl named Opal who misses her mom. She adopts a dog and names him Winn Dixie, because that's where she found him. This book is about Opal's summer spent with Winn Dixie and the life lesson she learns along the way. I give this book 2 stars. I didn't personally like the book, but this doesn't mean it's a bad book. One reason I didn't like the book is I don't like dogs or reading about them. Another reason I didn't like the book is it was too slow paced for me. I think elementary students or dog lovers should read this book. Elementary students would be able to relate to Opal and her life experiences. Dog lovers would enjoy reading a book with a dog as one of the main characters. Read this book to find out what happens and to see if you like the book or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold attention","review":"I bought this book for my nine year old daughter.

The part of this book I liked the most was when India 0pal (the main character) had a party at Gloria Dump's yard because she met a lot of new friends.

I was curious about the book so I also read it. WHY??? I don't know why of all the wonderful books out there this one was chosen. The story is centered around a little girl who is having trouble understanding why her mother left her. She moves to a new town and it talks of the people she meets. A girl who's brother drowned recently, a prisoner, etc. I found the whole thing rather depressing. And the way it is written runs on and on like my four year old daughter who talks just to hear herself talk. The only thing that actually happened in the book was the dog disappered... but was quickly found. It very much lacked any action or excitement. Also a note to parents there are a couple of curse words in the story... which seemed unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book had a very boring motive and included no interesting material.

Cause there is a dog in this book. Opal is a girl that moved and is living with here farther. So if you like to read and like dogs this is the book for you. Have you ever moved before? If you have than you would know what Opal and her farther are going throw. So I think that little kids would want there parents to read it to them. This is a great book for little kids to hear. I think that this book is better than Stuart Little. Because of Winn-Dixie has more detail because the author put more time and thought in to the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little jewel of a book","review":"This book unfolds softly and consistently loving throughout. It takes place in the south (Florida) and tells of a young girl, her father \\"the preacher\\" and their life - making due after their wife/mother leaves the family. Winn-Dixie (a stray dog) joins daughter and father and leads them into adventures of self discovery and family bonding. I'm from the west and enjoyed hearing Cherry Jones' southern accent, slow pacing, and wonder as daily events take on signifance through a childs' eyes. It's a simple story with bigger issues brought to light: loss of loved ones, friendships, what it means to be part of a family and community. The eccentric characters and their relationship with Opal(the young girl) are fulfilling too. Nicely done and from the heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and Enjoyable","review":"There is something about this book that really pulled me in. Maybe it was the unique characters, or the sweet, sneezy, smiley Winn-Dixie. Or maybe it was the well-thought-out story, about a poor, lonely little girl named Opal, who finds a scraggly stray dog that changes her life. Some parts of the story were sad, others were exciting, and all of them were interesting. The chapters were short, so I could almost always stop at the beginning of a new chapter if I was interrupted. The way Kate DiCamillo wrote the book is hard to explain...the writing had this sort of simple, perfectness to it, but it wasn't emotionless.Overall, I enjoyed this book. It wasn't my favorite, but I'm glad I gave it a chance. Now I want to see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Because of an AWESOME BOOK!!!!!!!","review":"Because of Winn-Dixie is the best book I've ever read!It is about a girl named India Opal who is new in Naomi Florida who is in desperate need of friends.

Because of Winn-Dixie, Opal meets all sorts of new friends. I recommend this book to all people who love dogs. This book is special because it won the Newbery Honor Award in 2001. Winn-Dixie is the first book by the author, Kate DiCamillo, who works in a children's bookstore.
