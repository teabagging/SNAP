The narrator does such an EXCELLENT job of telling this story. His inflections, voices, and story telling ability are outstanding, and he paints the horror and humor beautifully. It is wordy, and the folks who say the book could have been shorter are probably correct. But as far as the tape goes, I am glad I didn't miss a word. Does anyone know when the third installment will be released?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious but I perservered till the end and was enlightened.","review":"Having read only Coldfire and loved it, I was prepared for another great Dean Koontz novel, but perservering through the first few chapters proved a challenge. Koontz is an author who can certainly use an adjective or two, and the fact that he can describe one night in ten chapters also proves he has the gift of the gab. But once past the very detailed and lengthy descriptions the storyline began to intrigue me and I was sucked into Koontz's bizarre world of time machines, insane monkeys and oddly, down to earth characters. I was certainly glad by the end of the adventure that I had met the challenge Koontz delivered."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it!","review":"What a great book. Koontz is one of my favorite authors, and he always entertains me. I've discovered another writer that I must tell everyone about. His name is A.T Nicholas, and he wrote a novel called, 'The Fist of God'. It will blow you away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It's classic good against evil story with cool and original twists. The plot unfolds through the eyes of a homicide detective, who becomes a reluctant participant in the bloody battle for souls. Nicholas has a fresh writing style that brings the dialogue in the book to life. It's a fast pace read and every chapter is a cliffhanger, so get ready for one hell of a ride. I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing sequel to Fear Nothing","review":"While Fear Nothing introduced some neat characters and an extremely \\"creative\\" storyline, Seize the Night adds nothing to this series. The characters do not develop further -- they are like two dimensional caricatures of what they were in Fear Nothing. The plot is like a one line joke (or storyline) stretched out to novel length. The whole book is one good guy vs. bad guy episode after another, strung together with no neutral plotlines or character development in between. Some may call that \\"breakneck pace\\" -- I call it tedious. Good pacing in a thriller requires some \\"down time\\" between the tautly suspenseful scenes. A very disappointing sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"slow,not his best","review":"Have been a Koontz reader for years, found this one to be slower, hard to follow at times, not the usual can't put it down quality. A very slow starter. If you are an avid Koontz fan, read it but otherwise easily skipped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writing is too cute and the similes/metaphors go on and on!","review":"The story was interesting, a more or less novel concept, but dear God, the ridiculous and over-used similes and metaphors diminished the plot and made me gag as did the surfer lingo. When did it become unacceptable to say a persons face \\"turned white\\" or drained? Why does it have to be \\"turned as white as a person half way through putting on mime makeup for an evening performance\\" (that may not be the exact quote but it was much like it). Over use of A LOT of terms including \\"animal eye-shine\\" took away from the intrigue. The surfer lingo was annoying and diminished the story as well. This is the first Dean Koontz novel I've \\"read\\" (I listened to the audio version) and I'm not sure I'll read another one of his."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I've Read","review":"I know that many of you may not want take the advice of a 13 year old, but trust me this is a book that is not worth getting. I love Dean Koontz, this one being the 5th novel of his I have read, but the worst. You don't get into the action of the story until you're about 80% done with the book. Before that, it's just description leading up to the main part of the story. However, It was saved from a 1 star rating because of its totally unpredictable plot. For those of you looking for a good author you've found the right one, but don't get this book. Titles from Koontz I highly suggest in order are \\"Twilight Eyes,\\" \\"The Servants of the Twilight,\\" \\"Watchers,\\" and \\"The Bad Place,\\" all of which deserve a 5 star rating"},{"rating":"1","title":"why not write the screenplay and not bother with the book?","review":"The main character Snowman is well defined and interesting. I liked the book before last that Koonzt wrote, but I think that with this one he saw big movie $ signs. There is too much description, too much special effects, nothing makes sense, except on the screen I suppose, but the dialogues are still good and the relationships between the 3 main characters, and the cat and the dog are interesting, but please write to be published in a book form, or get a good agent in Hollywood and get a development deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seize the Night will seize your days and nights.","review":"Koontz does it again!. The on going saga of \\"The Snowman\\" keeps the pages turning and your mind spinning. This story is so believable it makes you really stop and think of what may be going on around us. This was a great sequal to Fear Nothing and the way this ended it looks like we could once again have the opportunity to peak in to the strange and exciting life of Christopher Snow and friends in Moonlight Bay. Can't Wait!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have enjoyed it better if the dog was the hero.","review":"The story of this adventure/mystery could have been a nail-biter if the hero wasn't so wordy (maybe because he's a poet). He had to explain every thought because of his ego. I just didn't feel the warmth in Chris. Great idea for TV series, because of Chris's XP. Bobby is cool, including other characters. \\"Watcher's\\" is the best Koontz has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is dean koontz???","review":"man i love dean koontz...his books keep me spellbound till the end...but this book was so boring and it didn't hold my attention like \\"the bad place\\" or \\"lightning\\" (definitly two of his best). whens his next one coming out anyway?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT READ","review":"Well Dean writes another good yarn. I found this a great book. I find Christopher Snow a great character. While some parts in this books are really out there, it is still great. I found Fear Nothing even better; but this is a excellent book with a great ending. One could associate with it. One must read Fear Nothing to get the full effect of Seize the Night. I hope their is another Christoper Snow novel to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seize Something Else by Koontz","review":"Severely disappointing. Shallow characters, moronic dialog, and tedious prose. Koontz is one of my favorite authors, and I've read most of his books and short stories. Some of the early work had one-dimensional characters and shallow plot, but if I listed his titles from best to worst, this would be near the bottom. For Koontz at his best, try Lightning, Watchers, Strangers, Intensity, Hideaway, or Dragon Tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to see if theres a third book in the series....","review":"Koontz does a wonderful job of keeping the reader guessing. He keeps the pages turning in \\"Sieze the Night\\" by adding a ton of mystery to a very scary story line. I hope that Koontz can find a way to use Christopher Snow's character in at least one more novel. To end the saga now would be a shame. For those of you that are Dean Koontz fans try this book on it will keep you wondering and guessing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grabber","review":"Interesting characters and non-stop action in a more sophisticated style than earlier Koontz works. I hope he keeps the Christopher Snow series alive awhile. (It won't be easy if he keeps having to face dangers like those in SEIZE THE NIGHT :).)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz is Slumming with this \\"Trilogy\\"","review":"\\"Seize the Night\\", with its paragraph-long, faux-humorous relections and descriptions, seems like the work of an author who is creatively bankrupt and bored. The characters are plastic, cartoonish, two-dimensional, and totally unbelievable. The surfer lingo is so annoying that I was actually (spoiler warning) glad when Bobby was shot. I wanted to shoot him myself. Dean Koontz has basically written the same book about 25 times (boy and girl fight bad monster together, etc.), and Seize the Night is no exception. It reads like Koontz had a bunch of half-baked ideas and he threw them all at the wall to see what would stick (little does). Genetic mutations, exotic diseases, Hell, time travel, serial killers--it's all here folks! Step right in! One last note, if I have to read the words \\"sussurant\\" or \\"preternaturally\\" again in one of his books, I think I'm going to scream. Doesn't Koontz own a thesaurus? Save yourself $8 and read a newspaper instead..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dean is slipping","review":"I've read Dean Koontz for years and always looked for his new book to come out. He is/was one of my favorites. But Seize the Night (for me) just didn't do it. I did not like the plot and it took forever for the author to get to the point. Dean, your slipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"If anything, seize Fear Nothing.","review":"Seize the Night was a great disappointment considering how good Fear Nothing was. The only reason I read it was because I was left awed when I finished Fear Nothing, but this book contains none of the greatness that Fear Nothing had.Christopher Snow seems to somehow get duller, and the events that happen towards the end of the book are just downright ridiculous. There are indeed some funny parts in the book, some action, some horror, but not enough of any of those things for this book to earn my seal of approval.Read the book for the sake of reading a good book's sequel, but do not expect it to be anywhere as good as that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd pass on this one","review":"To me it wasn't up to his usual style. I thought it was too wordy and it just rambled on and on and on. I just kept flipping the pages to get done with the book. I think the best book he ever wrote was The Watchers. I've read that over and over many times, and still never tire of it. I wish he would write a sequel, or a continuation of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Rubbish. This book was overly long and could easily have been halved and therefore more interesting if he didn't keep using two pages to describe something as menial as a lamp. It's all well and good having a vivid imagination but rabbiting on about how vivid it is and then imposing it on your poor reader is unfair and makes for an irritating and boring read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This one really disappointed me!","review":"I have read every single book Dean Koontz has written, and have been an avid fan. In fact, Watchers is my second-favorite book of all time. Lately, however, it seems that Koontz is losing that magic that made us all fans, and with Seize the Night he has descended to a new low. I thought Insanity was a pretty lame book, but this one is worse. The characters are not believable; the surfer lingo and flip retorts in allegedly dangerous situations are not realistic; and the relationship between characters seems superficial and without depth. Has Dean Koontz just burned out? Maybe if he stops producing books so rapidly he can get back to the wonderful prose, superb plots, and clever twists which endeared him to millions of us in the first place!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Is Koontz on drugs? This book is so far-fetched as to not qualify as science-fiction. It is hallucination. I have enjoyed other Koontz books, but this is over the edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"A surfer's dictionary","review":"I have read all of Dean Koontz's books since I discovered \\"Watchers\\" in the late 80's. I will now stop. Though Koontz was never heavy on characters, concentrating more on story, this book hit an all time low. The characters are all cardboard, spewing surfer lingo. They are so distracting and unlikeable that I lost sight of Koontz's themes of love and warnings about genetic engineering. I had to force myself to finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Dean Koontz","review":"Although not a fanatical Dean Koontz fan, I have genuinely enjoyed most of his works and consider myself and enthusiast but that may all change if he continues to produce drivel like this. From his \\"hip\\" surfer talk to the paragraph long descriptive phrases, this book disappoints at every turn of the page. I found it neither entertaining nor worth the effort to read although I did finish it having spent the money to purchsae it to begin with. Knowing that Mr. Koontz is capable of far better work than this only serves to increase the disappointment. The prequel was not much better although at least it was fresh, where this is book could well be the sum of the parts that were cut from the first novel. Could this really be the same author who penned Dark Rivers of the Heart or did he put his word processor on auto-pilot and what we're seeing is a first of what promises to be many \\"computer generated\\" works of \\"literature\\"?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Carpe... a different book off the shelf","review":"Two nights and one day of glib wise-cracking by a host of cartoonish characters bent on trying to convince the reader that surfers actually say things like \\"it's sharky,\\" and \\"macking thunders, bro,\\" punctuated by brief periods of action... well, wait a minute, the action seems to be all the talking... and paragraph-long sentences that go on and on... time travel me past the third installment, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many similes!","review":"While I normlly like Dean Koontz, this was the worst book I have ever read. I struggled to get through this boring list of repeated similes. As if he had to come up with 2 or 3 every page, regardless of whether it had anything to do with the story. Just write the story, if its not long enough to be a novel , than call it a short story. But please don't add words for the sake of size. Really Boring and uninteresting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expect from Dean Koontz","review":"I wish Dean Koontz would get back to the quailty of work I have become used to, as in The Watchers, Dark Rivers of the Heart, Lightning, etc. I could go on and on but his latest works have left me flat. I don't know that I'll read the third book in this series (although I probably will). Come on Dean give me a page turner that I can't put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing style is too poetic.","review":"Dean Koontz has used far too many similes this time. That makes it difficult for the reader to get through. Christopher Snow is a great character and the reader has trouble imagining Chris Snow thinking such poetic thoughts and musings while in the midst of grave danger."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is AWESOME!! Can't wait for the next one!","review":"Dean Koontz just gets better and better with every book he writes. I like that he continued with the story of Christopher Snow and went even further than I had ever imagined he would. His characters were easy to follow and I felt like I actually knew them and felt their emotions. Great plot and story line. What an imagination! I could barely put the book down to go to sleep. Can't wait for his next read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"hakneyed plot, cookie-cutter characters and no protagonist","review":"This book reads as though it were written in a week. Christopher Snow is virtually non-existent as anything other than a narrator. I know nothing about him other than the fact that he is light-sensitive. What makes him really unique as a person is beyond me. There were some interesting scenes - particularly within the first 100 pages - but if the reader is expecting plot tension similar to, say, \\"watchers,\\" forget it. Also, the surf lingo and tongue-in-cheek observations of life are also trite and distracting. I have always enjoyed Koontz's novels - I have at least 10 on my shelves! - but this simply does not live up to his earlier work. A big dissappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"Can anyone really find suspense within this heap of trash?I had avoided reading Koontz for a long time, fearing that a \\"poor man's King\\" could hold no intrigue whatsoever. (How could I possibly have enjoyed Steven King's books when I was an adolescent?).When I found myself backed against the wall, with no books in tow and Koontz on the shelf, I took a chance with From the Corner of His Eye- which was actually a fairly good read, demonstrating a depth of character and understanding that I did not expect. Could the same writer have written Seize the Night?This prose is terrible. It resonates like a cut scene from Bill and Ted's excellent adventure. Did I miss something by not being scared or mesmerized? The dialogue was too atrocious to take anything else from the book seriously. Avoid this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This book is awesome! One of the best books by Dean Koontz. A real page turner from start to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"SEIZE NOTHING","review":"As a long time Koontz reader, I was supremely disappointed in this latest effort, or lark. I closed it after 130pgs. Do not buy this book! Re-read WATCHERS: same idea, excellent execution without the surfer lingo and total lack of constructive dialog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment from Koontz","review":"Koontz really let me down with this one.The whole effort feels overly contrived and seems to be a B movie script gone wrong. Having read over 20 of Koontz's novels and having really liked about 16 of them, this and the novel preceding it both were really a chore to read. The main characters did not really interest me. The mystery aspect lacked in suspense. The end of the book is nothing new.Only read this if you need to cross it off your Koontz list..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great sequel to \\"Fear Nothing\\"","review":"Wonderfully read with some truly scarey moments. The story picks up the saga in Moonlight Bay with some interesting twists. Never a dull moment, however, I feel it had unnecessary attempts at offbeat comical narration which at times distracted from the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to fast-moving, attention-holding Kuntz???","review":"This book has a clever plot and complex characters, but not clever or complex enough to use so much of the English language. Too many words! Wait for the Reader's Digest version on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way bad, dude! (I mean...really bad! Like...terrible, dude!)","review":"I used to think that Koontz was the most under rated writer of the 80's. Now I think that he's the most over rated writer at the turn of the century. The storyline itself isn't too bad, but it's almost impossible to read since every single bit of dialogue spoken by Christopher Snow and his friends is spoken is ultra-annoying stereotypical surfer lingo (I used to live and surf in Huntington Beach, CA and the surfers don't talk like that all of the time). Mr. Koontz, please publish some of your old unpublished works and stop writing new books. Or better yet, read some F. Paul Wilson or Robert Sawyer and find out what real books are all about...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaves you wanting more","review":"I love Dean Koontz and I loved \\"Fear Nothing\\" the first in this alleged trilogy. However, this book was published in 2007 and the third and final book is still be written. That is very disappointing. When I finished the first book, I was like \\"that's it?\\" Then I found out about the trilogy. So, yippie! Then I finished the second book and was so unhappy to discover the third and final book hasn't been finished or published. Still a great book. Leaves you wanting more. If you are a fan of Koontz, you will enjoy the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is the next one???","review":"I thought this was another of Dean Koontz's best works. The characters are great and full of life. The story line had me glued until I finished the book. I would definately reccomend this book to any of my friends(which I do often).Chris Snow is one of the best main characters in any book. It sounds like he is challenged by his dissorder, but it doesn't keep him from having fun. He and Booby's(His Good Friend)surfer lingo and Fresh look on life give the story flavor all the to the end.So once again I Reccomend this book to anybody who likes a good story."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEIZE THE NIGHT","review":"This book is written as the sequel to \\"Fear Nothing\\". Not knowing this of course, I read it first. I am glad that I did. By itself, it gave a good understanding of the characters and plot. If I had read the books in order I know that I would have been put to sleep by the similar discriptions of the people and places which exist in the mind of the main character (Chris Snow). It was an exciting, keep you on the edge of your seat book. Although some of scientific ideas could have been explained more in depth, I really enjoyed exploring the ideas which it offered. This second book is by far more complete and superior to the first in the series. I suggest reading the first only for a deeper understanding of the characters and events which led up to the final book"},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz does it again","review":"This was a very good book. The characters and events were so well thought out and portrayed: I felt sincere pity for 'Bighead' after his scene; I read through the ending in this dream-like state that I would be in if that was actually happening to me. I also really like those sort of things where you find out where a certain myth or legend came from, in this case, demons and hell. A great read, a must for any Koontz fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I need another vacation !","review":"About 4 years ago I was a Koontz fan, and it was for good reason with titles light Twilight Eyes and Hideaway. I took an extended vacation to investigate some different authors, finding great pleasure and depth in the works of Stephen King and John Irwing. Whilst at an Airport a few weeks ago I picked up 'Seize the Night' to whittle away those long hours on an airplane. I should have stayed well away!The plot is ridiculous to the point that it staggers through some senseless and far removed scenes, I found myself lost, confused and frustrated. The characters where dull, and the surf lingo made things idiotic. The effort required to reach the final chapters (which where an incredible let down) left me feeling exhausted and extremely disappointed.Is it me that has changed? Or has Mr Koontz fallen off the pace?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nightlife Is Not Always What It's Cracked Up To Be","review":"Chris Snows life goes from bad to worse in the excellent sequel. Taking up just 2 months after Fear Nothing this book is a non stop nail biter. This book has everything from Serial Killers to Time Travel. Not to mention some Killer Monkeys. Koontzs' descriptive talents had me so wrapped up in this book I actually felt what the characters were going through. I have never been so attached to a dog in my life. I think what I found most remarkable is that even though it is a sequel you do not need to read the first book to understand it although I highly recommend that book as well. In conclusion if you like to stay up late readin a book you can't put down then pick up this one you will not be sorry. Oh Yeah...Beware the \\"Egg Room.\\" That scene actually gave me motion sickness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for the third","review":"Well, I have read the reviews. I have to say I liked both \\"Fear Nothing\\" and \\"Seize The Night\\" and am waiting for the third book to see what happens. I read books for entertainment and I have an imagination that allows for any premises. Mutated monkeys? Sure. Ghosts in the Attic? Yes. Headless man on the moor? Of course. Anyone who does not like horror or fantasy should not read Dean Koontz. He is a master of such tales, along with Stephen King. I don't like books about sports, so I don't read them. It is as easy as that. I'm hoping the third book will be out soon. I want to know why the battleship was just offshore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something to read","review":"If you can get over the excessive surfer lingo and stereotypical characters, then this novel is for you. It has typical Koontz plots--paranoia & the dark side of humanity--it's a thought provoking story filled with the sometimes amusing insight Koontz is known for injecting into his characters if nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Book","review":"This book was recommended to me by my friend. It is the second in the series. When I read it, I found out hwo wrong he was. It was way too long, and didn't have the suspense of any of his other books. He also spent way too much time describing unimportant things. Overall, a poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I loved the earlier works of this author, but the later(newer) books are not nearly as well done. This particular one, especially, I found to be boring, long and tedious. If you really feel the need to read this book, then go to your local public library and check it out for free! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seized up in the Night","review":"This is one of the worst books I have ever been forced to listen to. My wife and I listen to audiobooks during our hour commute every morning and evening. Unfortunately, my wife is a Dean Koontz fan. The characters are laughable, the plot ludicrous, and once again, Koontz demonstrates his literary diarrhea when using 500 words to describe something which could have been better portrayed with 20 words. Mack Bolan mercenary books or even Louis L'Amour westerns are better written than this trash. Having to listen to another Dean Koontz book may be grounds for divorce."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't even finish it - I think that's a first for me","review":"The characters were incredibly grating, and their use of slang became unbearable after a while - I had to put the book down. Are there really grown-ups who speak like that? Evidently not too many, since the author felt obligated to include definitions.Regarding the story - the premise seemed kind of cool, but I didn't understand the environment the story was set it. Maybe because this was a sequel?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Super-Intelligent Mutant Monkey's?","review":"It had the potential to be a great story.

When it turns out that they did genetic tests at the base and there are mutant monkeys attacking him, I lost all hope.

I'd be afraid to mention any part of the plot for fear of giving something away, but no one would believe all these bizarre things were connected. I read the book and I don't believe they're connected either!And the surfer lingo!I annoyed me to no end and I grew up on the beaches of So. Calif. Will I read the next one in the series? Probably, because I don't give up easily. Will Koontz tie everything up in a tight little package? I highly doubt it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragged down by a boring story and poor writing","review":"It seems that around the late 90s, Koontz was developing a rather wordy, pompous writing style. This book, along with False Memory, is bogged down by puzzling analogies, irritating metaphors, and questionable word usage. We all know Koontz is a great writer, but at this point he begins showing off too much, which is really off putting.Despite the above, a Koontz novel can be saved by a compelling plot. This book doesn't even have one, however. The mystery surrounding this tale is hardly intriguing, and it's a struggle to maintain interest throughout this book.Only read if you feel the need to round out Koontz's bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Traditional Bellydance music","review":"This is a good one for a bellydancer cd collection.All the songs are nice, you will find in this cd useful piecesfor your performance, buy it you will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stand","review":"I bought this to use with shure super 55 deluxe. the chrome looks great, the stand is solid. so far i have no complains about it. the shipping was fast as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on ABC!!!","review":"I was under the mistaken impression that I was buying a video about the US military's campaign in Iraq.

The video spends most of its time talking to and showing us video of the Nightline team lying around trying to catch 40 winks here and there.They made no mention of the Thunder Runs and showed no video of these attacks made by the US ARMY's 2nd Brigade (never mind that Fox news had huge amounts of this harrowing attack conducted in early April of 2003).So if you're a Nightline fanatic buy this video.

A pilot who took great joy in flying but not in flying in war, Tom's willingness to leave the enemy alone as long as they leave him alone is an eye opener in this era when authors like Stephen Ambrose try to elevate every person in uniform to mythological hero status. I wonder whether the cynicism of the pilots was prevelent during the war or is a reflection of the disillusionment the author and these young men felt in the years after the war? The last paragraph is especially moving, considering what has gone before.Addendum Oct, 2012: An answer to the question of the pilot's disillusionment can be found in two excellent books by Peter Hart, \\"Aces Falling\\" and \\"Bloody April\\".

Not including the war time propaganda nor the valour for fighting for your country, Yeates writes from his soul and is not affraid to release his views on war time politics and religion and the roles they play.

In the simple 6 steps which he has listed, it's easy for anyone to subscribe to these concepts and apply to our daily lives. More importantly, unlike many books, he preaches for one to share your own successful stories with others so that they too can reap the rewards of their hardwork.This book probably isn't for keeps, its for you to pass it on to those who need that little nudge in your life to the right path for success.

There were several mistakes like this. They solicited people on the street who obviously were not fans or who were not familar with her. If the video was $5.00, you could waste your money. Obviously, the makers of this are trying to make money off the grief of Aaliyah's fans, so I don't recommend that you buy.

First, if you're going to make a documentary about an artist, the least you could do is get the name of their works right: the narrator said \\"Resolution\\" instead of \\"We need a resolution\\" and \\"Mistress of the Damned\\" instead of \\"Queen of the damned\\". To me, that's totally unacceptable, because it seems as though the makers of this documentary didn't even take the time to do any kind of research on Aaliyah. And could somebody please explain to me what was the point of showing the remains of the plane Aaliyah died in for 15 minutes??

As I was drying the car I noticed my drilled slotted brake rotors were totally discolored and spotted. They are zinc plated to prevent rust and they were perfect before washing. I have been sick about this ever since. Read the label later and there is a warning that this material is corrosive. Great time to find out. Who would have thought that a cleaner for chrome would dissolve a zinc plated rotor. Plain soap and water from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I did not purchase this on Amazon. I seen this in my garage stored away. I decided to use it on my chrome coated rims that were terribly oxidized and grimy. It would not come off with soap and water. I actually was thinking about buying new rims cause I thought mine were terrible. I used this spray, which sprays surprisingly foamy, and quickly did all the other ones. I grabbed my garden hose and clogged with my finger so the water pressure would be higher (on the directions it says to use a hard stream of water) and it rinsed clean and shiny. My car is a 2001 Chrysler Sebring and I dnt remember the last time my rims shined this much and the results last. This cleaner is definitely good for even chrome coated rims.Tip: I dnt know if it's just my car but becareful not to spray on brake pads or anything other than your rims. It discolored it and make a weird noise when I brake but I promise it goes away.

The Demonic is astonishing in every way, and will only satisfy. Don Juan has never been played like this, IMHO.The other disk is Russel Sherman's Transcendental Etudes. Now, though my favorite version of this set is Claudio Arrau's, Mr Sherman's rendition is this: If you ever wanted to slow down a piece of piano music and actually hear all the fine detail, this is the version for you! And although it's very very slow, there is a magnificent touch, making this a most enjoyable set.

No mention is made of any of the errors, nor is Ms. Lewis cited in the index. Rather, Ms.Fiedler lists Ms. Lewis' more famous daughter, Monica Lewinsky, who isn't mentioned at all in the book, as a citation in the index.

The description of one Met impresario succeeding another reads like those interminable 'this one begat that one, who begat that one, etc' parts of the Bible. And those worn out old stories about Kathleen Battle's bad behavior have been repeated so many times that every community college freshman voice major is weary of them.Plus all the parts about Maestro Levine sound like they were written by Aunt Bea if she were Levine's publicist. \\"Oh, Andy!

They have her cancelling a production of SEMIRAMIDE, which in fact was taken away from her when she cancelled ABDUCTION, giving them over a year's notice.

I was never able to get rid of the odor, despite using different foot sprays and clean feet. Also, they scuff incredibly easy. A shoe polish lasts about a day.

Doesn't the Value Line summary of 100 most timely companies list companies that have ALREADY DONE WELL? Which means that you will most likely get in when the market is high and wind up losing money when the market goes down (this has happened to me). I think I will have to get out of this method after coming as close to my buying prices as I think possible and try a different way of doing things.

Each song has its own unique feel, yet that distinctive R&B sound of the Bee Gees is present throughout.Expect \\"Sacred Trust\\" and \\"Wedding Day\\" to bring tears to the eyes of \\"brides-to-be\\" everywhere, while \\"Deja Vu\\" and \\"Technicolor Dreams\\" will take you to extreme ends of the dance floor!They say that there are only TWO certainties in life: Death and Taxes.

The BeeGees take the best of the 60's and the best of today and manage to do it without it being a rehash. Touches of the Beatles, The Hollies, ABBA, even a hint of The Association, but always BeeGees. It's refreshing to hear the recurring theme of loyalty, stability and unabashed romanticism from guys without being sappy, all done in wonderful melodies, harmonies in a mix of everything from punchy rock 'n roll to slow ballads. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing, real voices, real music","review":"I always loved the Bee Gees. They always amaze me. With the untimely sudden death of Maurice this album is extra special. He sings two songs on this album. Man in the Middle and Walking on Air. I love both songs. He's a great songwriter and singer. He puts his heart and soul in every song it shows. So far there is no song that he sings solo that I don't like. I love Robin's Embrace. I love his haunting voice. There's no voice like his. I love Secred Trust and Wedding Day which sounds like christmas with the bells added to the song. I can't say enough about Barry. His high sexy falsetto still gives me gouse bumps no matter what he sings. I recommend you buy this album you won't be disappointed. They sing the way they did when they started out. Real voices, real instruments.

I hear songs that are goofy, ridiculous and nonsensical.I don't hear the \\"back to basics\\" sound that Barry Gibb has described. In comparison to their work from the 60's and 70's, this album doesn't do it for me.I played the album all the way through, one time, to give it a chance.The only song that I can tolerate is the title track. The rest is garbage.I never thought that I would say this, but, guys, it's time to retire. I think you've used up all of your ideas.

I usually don't have to listen to Bee Gees albums before I buy them.But from now on I will. I think this album is a dissapointment.There is a little too much of Robin Gibb in this album.Barry Gibb sells albums. If Robin wants to be the main focus of the band he should go solo.If not he should get guitar lessons and contribute in other ways.There are a few bright spots on this album.Sacred Trust is good.Maurice's Walking on Air is also good.Barry's Technicolor Dreams has alot to be desired.If you liked to the last few albums you will be dissapointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Brothers are back,\\"Where they came In,\\"Better than ever","review":"\\"This is Where I came In,\\" reminds me alot of the early BeeGees,with no Fallsetto's from Barry,and no Disco.Its now called Electronica.Robin's \\"Embrace\\" has that style,and this cuts going to be burning up the dance floors this summer,but wait untill you hear \\"She Keeps on Comming.\\" I swear if you heard this number on the radio you would never know it was from the BeeGee's.If this record gets some air play It's going to be a Huge hit.Barry's,\\"Loose talk Costs lives,\\" is my favorite.It melts inside of you ,like your dreaming,just like \\"How Deep is your love\\" did years ago.The CD ends with the Hardest,Fastest number I've ever heard from the Brothers,\\"Voice in the Wilderness.\\"There's only 1 song I don't care for out of the 12 ,\\"Technicolor Dreams.\\"It even sounds like Barry's off key,and can't hit the high notes on this 1920's style number,other than that,I can't wait to play this CD all Summer long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last Legacy as The BeeGees A wonderful Gift","review":"I have always been a devoted fan of the BeeGees since way back and got this CD when it first came out and have played so much I had to replace it recently. This CD if a wonderful gift of their talents as the BeeGees and so very sad that this was their last CD together. I love \\"Sacred Trust\\" and it reminds me of their song \\"Alone\\" which is one of my absolute favorites besides \\"Nights on Broadway\\". I truly hope Robin and Barry continue in their music as it would be a shame to not hear these truly talented voices again. Maurice would want them to continue. Long live the BeeGees in our hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"I know now why I bought this","review":"It is, amazingly, the first Bee Gees studio album that I have ever bought, so I did wonder at the start! I heard the title track performed on TV and went out and bought the CD - I wasn't even sure I liked the song. I am still convinced it is the weakest on the album.Whatever! The version I have has two extra tracks and the tracks that follow the title track are all excellent and typify the singles - the singing by Barry, in particular, and the harmonies by all three are brilliant. You can understand what they are singing and the mix of song styles is another strength.Favourite tracks are \\"Just In Case\\" and \\"Promise The Earth\\" (the two bonus tracks), \\"Wedding Day\\" and \\"The Man In The Middle\\", but it's difficult to pick out the best from a strong set.The other reviewers have said it before - they continue to show the young pretenders how it should be done. I hope this great album is seen as an appropriately deserved epitaph for the sad and sudden death of Maurice."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 4 years, better late than never!","review":"You've never heard the Gibbs like this before, and yet you have. They have taken bits and pieces from a number of their albums and put them on display in their latest effort. There is a wide variety of music here, but it flows from one song to the next very well. The title cut is a wonderfully arranged work taking full advantage of the vocal talents of both Robin and Barry. Unlike some of their previous works, the production retooling doesn't seem overdone here. Other favorites are Wedding Day (sure to be a wedding anthem), Man in the Middle (Mo's look at his relationship with his brothers)and Sacred Trust. After forty years in the business, the Gibbs prove that they're still able to write songs that can connect with a number of generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Work To Date....","review":"I have been a fan for along time.

I really like all the songs on their new CD, especially the sound of the title track, \\"this is Where I Came In\\". My other favorites are \\"Man in the Middle\\", \\"Sacred Trust, \\"Wedding Day\\" and \\"Loose Talk Costs Lives\\", but there is not a single bad song on this CD.

While Garageband has a few nice upgrades, iPhoto has completely destroyed my photo library. Attempts to re-install the older program fail, as the new one seems uninstallable. Apple's help forum is virtually unmanned, except for one regular who has expansive technical knowledge but can't use any of it and gives horrible advice.I have a friend who owns a Mac store, and the vote is unanimous among customers everywhere: this pack of programs is an insultingly useless and expensive steaming pile of dog squeeze. Avoid it at all costs. I've given it one star because 0 isn't an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"iLife or iDeath?","review":"I primarily use only the iPhoto, iMovie and the iDVD functions of iLife. I have no idea what Garageband is and don't care. I think it is just a way to charge more for what is basically entry level, bare bones editing software. Then again, I once made the mistake of buying iWork (never again, what crappy software). Anyway, my biggest grip with iPhoto 08 is the same one I had for 06- that even you change the file name of a picture, as far as the computer is concerned, the change only occurs in albums. The problem with that is that if you ever try to browse for a photo for whatever reason, i.e., email, send off for prints, you can't find your picture. Trying to locate specific photos in Mac is virtually impossible, as the computer does not view your pictures by albums, only film rolls, and only in whatever order they were originally uploaded, and even then only by some long file the Mac assigned.

You won't be able to organize your photos in a logical manner. You won't be able to find your photos. Resizing will be so difficult, where on a Windows machine using Thumbs Plus, it was so easy.

A step backwards in user control.","review":"Customers are well advised to read reviews of ILife 08. It is a large step backward with IMovie. Customers used to previous versions of IMovie will be disappointed with loss of simple control. Two examples. First, you cannot alter audio volume within clips. You can only affect the overall volume, rather than making some parts silent, quieter, or louder. Second, you cannot change the length of transitions, for example crossfades. Preset speeds, no alterations. The software will be simple, I guess for some, but is a real step backward.IDVD is not much better. There are 7 new themes, all are very simple, with limited spots to insert video or photos.IPhoto seems better. I like the way pictures can be ordered by events. Pretty slick.I'll be using my older version of IMovie, and the new version of IDVD and IPhoto. Doesn't seem worth the money though for the huge loss of functionality in IMovie."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should have a zero stars option","review":"Let's say little Joey catches his first baseball. Want to slow it down. Sorry. A bunch of kids at a party running around and want to speed it up? You can't. Want to change a transition? Can't. Want to use some plug ins. Nope. Do not buy this software if you use iMovie. I should have read the reviews. The reason you can make a movie so fast is because there aren't those annoying features that get in the way. You can download iMovie 06 for free though! While you're at it go ahead and download OS 8, it's free as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it for iMovie","review":"I used to buy iLife just for iMovie and iDVD: I'm on a different universe with music so I never opened Garageband, I do not have a .mac account and don't use iWeb. iTunes is a free download, so really this suite for me is iMovie, iDVD and iPhoto. Iphoto is nice but I could live vith previous versions too, and for what I've seen iDVD seems quite fine (no big modifications), but iMovie is just a shadow of what it used to be. Although I have to admit that the skimming feature is quite cool to see, the \\"new iMovie\\" has many drawbacks. No timeline, no integration with iDVD (no more share to idvd option), no chapter markers, just really basic audio editing, no video effects, no more transfer back to camera and so on. So if you (such as myself) use to buy iLife just for iMovie and iDVD, my tip is to pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!!","review":"The problems with iMovie are legion and well documented. I bought the 08 anyway because I dont use iMovie and didnt hear any negatives about iPhoto or iDVD which I do use. In iDVD, you cant import music. You are told that you are not authorized to import a song from iTunes. Then, you jump through hoops to authorize it and still no music. iPhoto will jumble your photos into \\"Events\\" and good luck in sorting your photos out. It will take a while. I have no idea what the purpose of this is other than to create more confusion. Plus I lost about 100 photos in the process. This is a really bad program. I'd like to erase it and go back to the old version; more trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointed!!","review":"iMovie 08 is a horrible step back from 06.

I bought iLife 08 and was very disappointed by the disappearance of so many features of iMovie 6, especially the missing chapter marks, the much more limited titling features and transitions. Other than that the bug in the audio has been fixed, there is no reason to get iLife 08, since you lose so many features.

There are many warnings on blogs and other sites about iMovie not working properly with iLife '09 unless you have an Intel Mac. Definitely something for you to look into before you decide whether to purchase '08 or '09. Hope this warning helps you make an informed decision.

Well, this might be their best, but it sucks none the less. The first song comes right at you, rocking, heavy, an excellent song. Lyrically its moronic, but then again, it fits with the mood of the other songs. The, the album goes down hill. From that first great track (2 if you count the intro) the next however many songs just plain suck. It doesnt break any new ground soundwise, only bores you. Ok, it has horns, its ska. Ska was great in 6th grade. After that, all you fans of ska, you have a duty to realize how utterly boring and stupid ska-punk is. Groups that don't evolve die. Genres that don't evolve die (Punk anyone?) So yes, no matter how fast they play the music, this is ordinary, and boring ska fit for no one outside of die hard ska fans.

The prose varies from rambling to ranting. The author jumps from subject to subject like a pogo stick. At first I believed that the author was using the pencil as a vehicle to expound on engineering as opposed to science, art, or inventing. I believe the author then got lost in his tortuous prose. I know I did! I saw no evidence that the author comprehends any of those activities. If you removed all the information that has nothing to do with pencils or engineering from the first 90 pages, and then wrote the remainder clearly and concisely, you might end up with a 3 page monograph.

Spotted with gems (\\"Melanie\\" could be Steve Lukather's finest ballad, \\"Mad About You\\" is effective sing able pop, \\"Cruel\\" is first rate Toto pop R&B;, and title track riff is almost impossible not to hum along with); virtually ballad-free, but filler abounds.

Steve's lead vocal tracks are a mixed bag, but better than Kimball's. 'Melanie' is a melodic ballad that is really refreshing after the rockier tuneless stuff on here. I also like 'After you've gone' and 'Better world' is also a strong effort.My favourite track is not even my edition of the album, and I had to download it. 'Spanish steps' is sung by David and is a totally different style to the rest of the album.

I was fortunate to videotape it but, alas, I taped the first performance. Even with the glitch, I wouldn't part with it. The only major personnel difference in the earlier performance was the conductor, Zubin Mehta.

While I agree with an earlier reviewer that Herman Prey's Eisenstein is well sung, the sheer energy and joy that the Eisenstein of Eberhard Waechter conveys makes Prey's Eisenstein seem pallid. Janet Perry and Pamela Coburn in the female leads bring both outstanding singing and energy to this production that is not present in this Convent Garden Version. I really recommend the Kleiber version, not because this version is so terrible, but because the Kleiber version is so integrated and musical that it brings the pure pleasure of Fledermaus to the viewer and listener."},{"rating":"1","title":"A TRAIN THAT DOES NOT TRAVEL - FOR $25-$50","review":"I LOVE ALL GEOTRAX TRAINS - EXCEPT FOR THIS ONE.

As Thom Yorke himself has said, \\"I don't know if there's any value in being a rock band anymore.\\" Radiohead, with the \\"Kid A/Amnesiac\\" sessions, has certainly transcended that limiting label.This isn't just genre-hopping. It's the melding of avant, electronica and guitar rock into a new kind of music -- and the journey is extremely rewarding.

Putting it bluntly, Radiohead once again delivers and puts the competition to shame. Not much stood up to this at the time, which of course is expected from Radiohead. Despite crap overflowing the airwaves, Amnesiac could care less about what's going on in modern music. It just pushes the boundries of music forward. The only other albums I even bought from 2000 were 'Kid A', 'White Pony' by Deftones, and 'Mer De Noms' by A Perfect Circle. Kid A is still my personal favourite from Radiohead, but Amnesiac is a very satisfying listen, and I highly recommend it to any true fans. A near 5-star-performance setback only by a few forgettable moments, and \\"Hunting Bears\\", the song that could have been... But that is of course just my opinion. You'll love it.Standouts: Like Spinning Plates; Life In a Glass House; You and Whose Army?; Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall, a disappointing effort.","review":"I tried to like this album, I really did. I turned off the phone, locked the doors, sank into my listening room chair, killed all the lights, and let her fly. Now, writing this review after 3 complete listenings to the album over a period of a week, I find myself unsatisfied with the release. I like the \\"feel\\" of the album; I like the direction Yorke is trying to take it, but it just gets bogged down by the particulars; too long a track here, too underdeveloped a guitar line, or, more predominantly, too much low bass. Not something I enjoyed listening too; it's always a bad sign when I'm eagerly awaiting the NEXT track, hoping it will be something good. The one stand-out track for me is You and Whose Army, which is powerful and beautiful. It reminds me of Exit Music (for a Film) just a bit (my favorite radiohead track ever).. listen to You and Whose Army, in the dark, at high volume, if you've skimmed over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great album name - I can't remember why I bought this","review":"Despite the wrath of Radiohead fans I am sure to endure, I have this funny feeling that the members of the band are laughing at all the critics that called this album \\"brilliant.\\" Yes, I believe this recording is a joke. After listening to Amnesiac, I can't figure out the appeal. Perhaps I just don't get it, maybe I'm not intelligent enough to understand the \\"concept album.\\" I should probably stick to music that displays some sense of feeling and musical ability. Vocals that are sung while half-asleep and songs comprised of one measure repeated over and over and over again are probably too deep for me to understand. To all those that claim to love this album: Amnesiac - the height of pretentiousness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"Terrible. Boring.What a complete disappointment.

I've said too much already."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self Indulgent Art Rock","review":"Entertainment Weekly hit the nail on the head comparing Radiohead to Yes in the 70's. This is a band that, after OK Computer, has abandoned traditional rock constraints of song structure and melody. There's a place for this -- challenging \\"art rock\\" music has always had a market, and the positive reviews here point that out -- but if you caught on to Radiohead with The Bends or OK Computer, I'll bet the odds are higher that you'll feel put off by this CD.That said, Pyramid Song is a glorious exception on this CD. Had that song been representative of the direction they took with this album, this might have been Radiohead's second masterpiece. As it is, in ten years, nobody will remember this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"good music, sick cow","review":"Don't get me wrong---Radiohead's music isn't that bad, in fact i enjoy pyramid song, but let's face it---the lead singer sounds like a sick, dying cow. i mean, my god! this is depressing. i dunno. maybe i just don't like to sit around and listen to music that makes me want to sulk in the rain and cry myself to sleep. i just would like some variety. in fact, radiohead has destroyed rock and roll. let me put it this way: it's morphine music. it numbs your senses and takes you on a trip into the boohoo section of your brain. if u want a good psychedelic trip, try some Tool or Pink Floyd, not sick, dying cattle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, Sadder, Saddest","review":"A BIG disappointment!

This is interesting. Both albums both sound like reactions to the fame and fortune Radiohead found with the success of \\"O.K.

If yes to at least 2 of these questions, buy this album. Simple as that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dissenting Opinion","review":"This album is pretty much a collection of throw-away tracks that deserve to be b-sides, with a few exceptions. Songs like \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" will probably only appeal to those who enjoyed \\"Fitter Happier\\" off of OK Computer. For me, they're just songs I always skip over. Overall, this album feels less coherent and cohesive than either of their previous two. The saving graces of this album are the first single, \\"Pyramid Song\\" (a hauntingly beautiful song and video), and the tracks \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Dollars & Cents\\". If only they would've thrown those 3 tracks on to Kid A, then it would've been the equal of the classic OK Computer. I'm mildly disappointed, but still glad to have a fresh set of tracks to digest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where does it go from here?","review":"I like Kid A better, but Amnesiac is a dang good album.

Now I've gotten to the point that I'm actually used to it.Kid A was one of the best albums of all-time. This, while not as good, can still be enjoyable.It starts out with \\"Pact....\\", which is a more techno song from the album, as it isn't the best, but good first song. \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Door\\" is great, despite the fact that the same chords are being used throughout the song. \\"Life In A Glass house\\" happens to be my favorite track, a dancy tune that has decent vocals. If you're not already interested, get The Bends, OK Computer, or Kid A. This isn't their best, but I like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect memento!","review":"They can't help it. Radiohead is a brand name and their website an award-winning marketing tool. And Amnesiac is quite an experience - if I haven't forgotten (just kiddin'). Beautiful and impressive, it touches the heart as well as the mind. And the spirit. Unlike Coldplay and Travis this Radiohead does want to cause Trouble and do more than just Sing, Sing, Sing. And I like that, I like Radiohead for being anti-Blair, and even more so for being against major corporations and dollars and cents in general. Indeed they are. Just as long as the heart matters too (Pyramid Song) I can dig a little piece of Autechre (like in Pulk/Pull). I think of Amnesiac as the bridge between OK Computer and Kid A. Most songs on Amnesiac could well have been written and/or recorded before most songs on their predecessor. Perfect memento - when most bands just want to shut up and dance, this Amnesiac."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than kid a","review":"whoever said \\"still not ok computer\\" doesnt understand the essence of radiohead. ok computer was great, but why try and re-accomplish it? Radiohead has to move on and evolve. They are not defined by one album (as someother reviewer put it). They are defined by the way they can soar through any genre and still pull it off, they are defined by the emotions that they provoke through just sounds and lyrics. in my opinion this album is better than kid a. Almost every song on here is a masterpiece in its self. Kid a, i felt, only had 3 or 4 great songs. this album has 9, the remake of morning bell was uneccesary. In 5-10 years from now i hope that this album is more highly regarded than it is now. buy it, and listen to it with an open mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost Respect for Radiohead","review":"This album sounds like it's comprised of a few mediocre new tunes penned up in a jiffy and then all the leftover junk from the Kid A sessions. Really uncool (and lazy) of this otherwise talented band to put out an uncohesive collection of leftovers in the guise of an LP. Even and EP would've been acceptable. OK Computer was creative and brilliant and Kid A, at least sonically, continued to break new ground for the band, but the bulk of this album is just rubbish. The Morning Bell reworking is just awful. People giving this album 5 stars must be tone-deaf and easily swayed by hype, cool covers and packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Double album sold in 2 parts","review":"This in tandem with Kid A is one of the finest music experiences of my life.

Just as good as Kid A. Best tracks are Pyramid, Life in a Glasshouse, and Morning Bell. It's great to see a good band in the Billboard Top 10. However, I don't see hardly anyone else good in the whole Top 100 album sales. What else are you people buying? Do you think Radiohead is the only one making great intellectual music? .... Whatever the case, if you like Radiohead here is a few more bands you should check out instead of Garth Brooks' greatest hits. Mercury Rev, Sparklehorse, Snow Patrol, Neil Haggerty, Brave Captain, Simian, Air, and the ones who open for them in concert The Beta Band. Radiohead kicks [it] in concert by the way so if you missed them, check out the live album too."},{"rating":"2","title":"diverse mix of songs... another classic Radiohead album","review":"Amnesiac is an amazingly diverse mix of great songs. Piano and horns fill the void of electronic sounds found in the two prior albums, from the ethereal piano epic Pyramid Song to the sullen guitar and harmonies in You and Whose Army to the guitar-driven rock hits Knives Out and I Might Be Wrong (a couple favorite Radiohead songs of mine) to the nearly acapella Spinning Plates to the piano and horns in Life in a Glass House.It doesn't quite have the flow of OK Computer or Kid A, but nonetheless another classic Radiohead album that should be in your collection. Again, lots of harmony, piano, and a couple big-hit guitar-driven rock songs... the formula works for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm, this band needs to break up.","review":"okay, Kid A was kinda cool, but then this? I know people like this CD, but I feel justified in giving it a 1. Why, you ask? There is not one song (and I've givin it plenty of chances) that I like or even find interesting. My theory: these guys have got themselves so caved up in their own little world they've forgotten how to make music that doesnt just please themselves. Hey, I listen to some pretty outrageous stuff (melt-banana, Ween, Alien Sex Fiend) but this isn't expiremental in a good way, it's only exposing this band's out-of-touch state, and, well, I don't really think Im doing anything but wasting my time telling a bunch of people I'll never know how I feel.

The bottom line is that much of it is difficult to listen to. While that may make the album \\"challenging,\\" it certainly doesn't make it good. Some tracks, like #2, have beautiful pieces of music arranged in unorthodox ways; unfortunately, those tracks are the exception because much of the rest of the album is just bland and confusing music.

Once again full of synthetic sounds and incoherent, and when they are discernible, pointless, lyrics.Amnesiac is marginally better than Kid A (0.2 stars versus Kid A's zero) due to glimpses of the form they showed on The Bends and OK Computer, most apparent on the track \\"I might be wrong\\". There were no such favours on Kid A.Hopefully, OK Computer hasn't done to Radiohead what The Joshua Tree did to U2. After the commercial and critical acclaim achieved by The Joshua Tree, U2 thought they could release anything and it would work. So after the Joshua Tree U2 produced only rubbish, passing it off as deep intellectual rock when in fact they were just trying to show off how clever and cryptic they could be, ending up producing pretentious, boring pop and ripping off their loyal fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"if this is th ebest of 90's experimental rock...","review":"I am a rock fan and i've heard to thousands of rock and progressive rock records.

It is not even music and I dont no when I would even play it. Not around friends, not around the wife, and my two year old made it clear not around him again. Get the picture.I dont understand any review over one star. Radiohead says they do not want to be pigeon holed into the \\"O.K. Computer\\" band. That is fine with me. But where are the melodies and lyrics? I wanted something I could sink my teeth into. After repeated listenings, I still want to burst out laughing it is so bad.

Well, Radiohead fans here is your favorite band's big letdown. The opening track is as good as anything they've ever done, but it's all downhill from there. The album sounds exactly like what it is, i.e. outtakes from Kid A. I can't imagine how anybody could sit through this album and actually pay attention. I've put the record on at least half a dozen times and eventually the same thought goes through my head: \\"Is this still playing?\\" For a while I kept expecting the hidden genius of the record to unfold but now I have given up."},{"rating":"1","title":"the thin line between creativity and bad music","review":"After Radiohead's brilliant \\"Kid A\\" CD, I was much looking forward to their \\"Amnesiac\\" album. unfortunatly, after listening to \\"Amnesiac\\" I can't help but to be dissapointed. I respect (and usually enjoy) Radiohead's creativity, but this time they took it overboard. I just couldn't get into it, like I could with Kid A. I wasn't taken to that magical place I go to everytime I listen to the previous album. After listening to the new release, I was frustrated and had a headache. I think with a stronger musical backbone (some sort of rythm), \\"Amnesiac\\" would have been brilliant. However, I can't help but feel that Radiohead got lazy after their grammy nominated \\"Kid A\\" album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like uncovered Bowie and Joy Division scraps","review":"Radiohead has not broken any new ground with this album or Kid A.

I think that was the point of the album: it challenged us, it angered us, it drove us insane - with its subtle beauty.Amnesiac engages you and takes away all the feelings of isolation and loneliness that Kid A brought. It's almost as if Kid A was meant to condition us so we could hear Amnesiac better.The songs are lovely. I love Pyramid Song and You and Whose Army.

You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe I'm writing the first review","review":"Once again, Radiohead leaves the listener confounded. Just as with OK Computer and Kid A, a first listen to AMNESIAC results in equal parts pleasure and puzzlement. After my third listen, I'm convinced of this record's importance. Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors comes as a shock, a cleansing of the audio pallette after the majesty of the single, Pyramid Song. While not all rock/radio listeners will appreciate this, Radiohead is making vital electronic music. They understand the connection between 70's art/prog rock/jazz fusion and contemporary \\"techno\\" (for lack of a more descriptive term). The alternate version of Morning Bell is nice, and the almost swing-like finale Life In A Glasshouse provides some inspired lunacy. A solid effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am a changed man","review":"OK, OK, OK. I originally gave this a 1-star review, because I originally hated it.

Every time they issue a new album, I am impressed with the new direction and their ability to push the envelope. I give Amnesiac 4 stars rather than 5, because I don't think the album is complete (for reference I give OK Computer 5 stars). The way I see it, and from what I hear least one bad member thinks, the Kid A sessions produced enough music for one extra long album, not 2. Amanesiac has better songs than Kid A, but Kid A is a little more comprehensive top to bottom. I feel that Amnesiac has to many non vocal and filler songs, but between Kid A and Amnesiac, I think Amesiac has better songs.

There are a couple of good songs, but this is the band's worst album. A trite little disc from a band that is getting full of itself. Kid A was also overrated, sounding like a Joy Division album with updated sounds for the new century. One of the songs was such a blatant rip-off that it was almost as good as Joy Division. I'm not into gimmicks and muzak, so I guess I'll just have to keep listening to The Bends."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"This album is yet another good one from Radiohead. Perhaps \\"good\\" is a bit of an understatement, but I think amnesiac is a bit of an understatement as well. This band continues to explore different areas of rock themed music, and we are lucky enough to be able to listen in. Thank God a band is out there to deliver something that is truly progressive in this era of poppy-punk and annoying talentless bands. \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"Dollars and Cents\\" are true gems to be found on this album, and \\"I might be Wrong\\" and \\"Knives Out\\" aren't half bad either.

Some of the stuff sounds like it could have gone on ok computer(knives out), some sounds like nothing they have ever done. The reason i give it a 4.5 is that it doesn't hold together as well as kid a, i don't like pull/pulk that much, its not bad by any means, but just really doesn't strike me, same goes for spinning plates, which is amazing done live.The rest of the album is great, morning bell is better on here than on kid athis is easily the bands most creative album, and is definately a gem, (i say this about all of their albums) however don't start here, the best way to experience radiohead is chronologically, this album will be better understood if bought after kid-a and all of its predecessorsStandouts: pyramid, you and who's army?, i might be wrong, knives out, life in a glass house"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fighting, clawing, and tearing your way back onto the edge","review":"Radiohead have done it. They have accomplished the impossible. They took a band that was teetering on the brink of promoting bloated, pompus arena rock and turned it into a truly independant collective of audio artists. They turned a mainstream breakthrough and drove it back underground through sheer force of will and vicious tenacity. They got their edge back, and how. Dull knives are fun to play with, and kids can handle them, but this razor cuts, it cuts deeply, and requires super-vision. Experimention with total honesty isn't always the prettiest thing to listen to, but it is the most beautiful. Be brave.Lets stop comparing Amnesiac/Kid A to OK Computer and the Bends, shall we? If we as a listening audience haven't grown in the last few years, if we haven't matured, we don't deserve artists who have the incredible freedom to record what they want and still have the wheels of the corporate mega machine turn in their favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead - Amesiac","review":"Although Amnesiac may not be the \\"best\\" or most \\"influential\\" album in a catalog void of serious flaws (barring, maybe, Pablo Honey), it is certainly their most artistic statement. To me, Kid A is an overrated, patchy record with a couple amazing songs; Amnesiac, however, has fewer stand out tracks but flows and feels more unified. And the songs that do stand out here --\\"Pyramid Song,\\" \\"Knives Out,\\" \\"Life In A Glass House\\"--demonstrate a maturity and confidence that, at least in my opinion, can't be heard on Kid A at all. Another, more personal, reason I love Amnesiac is that frankly it appeals more to my jazz sensibilities as a listener. I find listening to Amnesiac to be a more enriching experience than Kid A, and I feel that there is a cohesiveness to Amnesiac that is not present on its vastly more famous (and slightly more influential) counterpart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"One of Radiohead's best, the title \\"Amnesiac\\" reveals the kind of music on the CD. It's ethereal and dreamy, focused more on the flow of the thoughts on the mind. The techniques used are also fabulous, and it's filled with bits of electronic music; a song is even recorded backwards, see \\"Like Spinning Plates\\").I recommend it, absolutely!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a blithering idiot!","review":"Disregard my previous review! This album deserved 5 stars! I apologize for not realizong this sooner. It just hit me this morning. I don't know why it took all this time, but It finally grew on me. So please forgive me, I have seen the light! I now LOVE this album! Go! Buy it! NOW!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amnesiac","review":"I can't believe that anyone would give this cd 4 stars. This is a brilliant collection of music. Although I love \\"old\\" radiohead, all of the later albums are a work of art different and beyond the older stuff. If someone had never before listened to radiohead, I would recommend Kid A, Amnesiac, and Heil to the Thief first! Listening to this music is an adventure for the mind and soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's different, that's for sure","review":"I think this album is pure genius. Like spinning plates is probably my favorite song on here. it is so complex. My only problem with the album is, it is mostly techno-experimental sounds, not alternative rock. So for a rock album, i don't really like it cuz...it's not rock. but for a techno album, it's awesome. basically, no matter what kind of music you like, you'll love this album if you only give it a chance because it is just so brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"New Misadventures in Hi-Fi","review":"Jesus. As someone who warmed to the difficult, but strangely beautiful \\"Kid A,\\" I eagerly awaited this title, particularly as the buzz indicated a more \\"song oriented\\" spin on the previous work. \\"Amnesiac\\" is a bin of cast-offs from the \\"Kid A\\" sessions, and is the most tedious album I've heard since Yes' \\"Tales from Topographic Oceans\\" way back in my teen years in the '70s. Boring drones dominate the proceedings, with even more filtered vocals and obtuse melodies. It's all well and good for Thom Yorke to feed his Brian Eno jones. It's quite another thing to confuse ambience with art; creating one doesn't guarantee the other. Excellent production rates it two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 stars, cause all the rest are better.","review":"Are the other reviewers kidding me? This album is by far the worst they have done. It contains 3 ok songs, the singles, following by one that is played backwards! Alright, Kid A was great, it was different and sounded marvelous, but this is just extracts from it that didnt make Kid A. In Amnesiac, they're trying to bring the sound of Kid A and mix it with The Bends and trying to keep the \\"new fresh ever changing sound of Radiohead\\". They've admitted they miss the guitars now, and i'm glad because they can't keep making Amnesiacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, the lost me here","review":"Radiohead delivers amnesiac as a follow-up to the much anticipated yet somewhat misunderstood Kid A. From here, it should become clear that leftovers are leftovers for a reason. In Ryan Adam's recent three albums of 2005, his plan was to release all music from one session and make not one album but three. The result. Fillers. Radiohead, however, made a remarkably experimental album in Kid A, and while by no means their best, remains severely underrated. Anesiac is almost the opposite. It was created from unreleased sessions from Kid A, and while a few songs such as \\"I Might Be Wrong,\\" \\"Pact,\\" and \\"Hunting Bears\\" remain true to form, most of these should have remained sessions. Sorry guys, bravo to the max for absolutely everything prior, but I can't really get into this one. I hated Kid A at first, kept retrying until I loved it, but I'm afraid that its just not working with this one. I'll give it an extra star for its three decent songs and for it being made by radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want to Forget \\"Amnesiac.\\"","review":"How can Radiohead possibly get more \\"progressive\\" than this? That's what I want to know. If Radiohead produced a song out of distorted farts and a jaw harp, critics would hail it as a \\"Progressive masterpiece!\\" Half the songs on this album aren't even songs--they're just mumbling, blubbering, lackluster pieces of electronic crap. \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"Knives Out\\" are particularly good, but most of this album is difficult to listen to--it totally lacks any emotion or energy. And how can they perform this \\"stuff\\" live? Do they \\"rock out\\" on stage with a bunch of synthesizers. Come on! What happened to the army of guitars from \\"The Bends\\" or \\"OK Computer.\\" Well, needless to say, I'm not giving Radiohead anymore credit just because they are Radiohead. Unless they regress and create some actual music, I'm not giving them my money. I don't care if it's artistically improper to regress. I just want some music with emotion. Give me The Bends!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please!","review":"In a word, awful. The emperor has no clothes, no heart, no soul. Endless acolytes saying, \\"Sure, it's not OK Computer, but still another masterpiece, blah, blah, blah\\", amuse me. Cacophonous, self-important noise by arteest, Thom Yorke.

Not only is this CD not the Radiohead we all know and love, but it is nearly unlistenable. Radiohead has every right to go off on this musical tangent. Just as their fans have the right not to purchase this dreck as I, unfortunately, did. Save your money until the real Radiohead stands up.

I had become quite a fan after listening to OK Computer and had the intentions of looking deeper into this band, so a went out to aquire this album. I'm sorry I did. I put this Cd into my player once. That was one too many times. Ever since then I have not purchased another Radiohead album and do not have the ambition or the drive to seek another. Don't be fooled, as I was. That is all. Thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable","review":"This CD is INCREDIBLE! These guys are so super talented.

Radiohead are capable of sublimely constructed pop classics... but you will find none of them here or on their previous dire offering ! The most upbeat song on the new album is \\"The Pyramid Song\\" and that in itself is depressing in the extreme.I cannot understand their success in the US. Has anyone over there listened to \\"The Bends\\" or \\"OK Computer\\", 2 albums on which they had the guts to do what they do best...brilliant catchy songs ?

We've become so blinded by Radiohead's supposed infalibility after OK Computer (which admittedly is a great CD), that we'll swallow just about any experimental art-junk they spit out.What ever happened to music you enjoy listening to? What ever happened to CDs you set back to play on track one the moment they had ended? What happened to tunes you hum in the shower?Amnesiac is noise. Din. Totally worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I cant begin to say how disappointed I am with this album. I just wish they would go back to the days of ok computer. But its another experimental artistic album which in my opinion has definately NOT hit the nail on the head. Apart from the song knives out the rest of the songs are completely weird and the drum beats are terrible. I really hope radiohead has disappointed me for the last time and hopefully one day they will go back to playing the music which made me worship them. ie songs like airbag, creep, talk show host."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed","review":"...Why oh Why did Radiohead have to put this out. I thought they could do no wrong, and they [messed] up and so very badly. While Kid A was IDM-lite, it had its charms and its masterpieces, like The National Anthem. Amnesiac is horrid, its so half-assed, that any Warp alum could duplicate it with minimal effort. \\"But its got layers dude, that you haven't explored,\\" the hell with that. This album is twaddle, that goes nowhere and right when a song is about to get interesting it stops, so yes I would classify this as self-indulgent nonsense that deserves to be thrown away with the rest of the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT discards from Kid A. Excellent.","review":"I read several reviews about this album. One reviewer said it was a mistake for Radio head to have released the discards from Kid A. I know that several other bands have this mistake, but Radiohead hasn't made the same one.The music is definately Radiohead, and though there are less electronic instruments, this doesn't mean that the album is less electronically affected.I went and bought Travis's new album yesterday and can't even listen to it after Amnesiac. It seems like shallow pop fluff in comparison."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Kid A","review":"Amnesiac is a great album. Although not better than OK Computer, it's really good, and better than Kid A. The only song I don't like is \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors,\\" which is boring, to me. The other songs vary from pretty good to wildly successful and beautiful in that melancholy Radiohead way, like \\"Pyramid Song\\" and \\"Life in a Glasshouse.\\" The Limited Edition packaging is pretty cool, too. The book has good art and is a nice artifact to look at while you listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Holy $hit this Cd is Some of Radioheads Best Work","review":"Let me tell you something, I am a hardcore fan of Radiohead and although I do appreciate Radiohead's older Albums I definitely think Amnesiac ranks with some of the best music of our time. Pablo Honey (Radioheads first album) was highly commercial(although also excellent) and afte that Thom Yorke grew and if people didnt want to grow with him they can go listen to N'Sync. During the Kid-A times Radioheads music changed very drasticly. Amnesiac was the perfect mix of everything. It even uses clasical techniques like in Pyramid Song with soft piano. Although there is a lot less guitar on Amnesiac ( compared to the bends and pablo honey) Such songs as Knives out have great licks of guitar that resemble there Pink Floydesk Style.. Purchas this album as soon as you can. You can't file this album under any genre all you can classify it is as music. Ofcourse Id love to stay and chat ofcourse id like to stick around and chew the fat.. BUY THIS CD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this is nice.","review":"No one has put their two cents on this yet? This is what a collectors edition is all about. First start off with the packaging. The box is bound with a canvas that has a textbook feel and look to it (does that make sense)? You all know about disc 1 (standard disc). Disc 2 is nice because it collects all of the b-sides from the Amnesiac singles plus adds some live cuts from Canal studios. What makes this release a must have is the dvd. It has videos, two live cuts from \\"Top of the Pops\\" and additional songs from Later with Jools. The dvd with this is superior to the one found in the KID A special collectors edition (however I prefer KID A to Amnesiac straight up). So kids cough up the extra cabbage for the 3 disc Amnesiac. (In regards to how you feel about this being a cash grab by capitol records...well it is what it is I suppose, but you have to admit they have done a really good job so far with these releases)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hauntingly Beautiful","review":"Having seen the band twice on the summer 06 tour, I was struck by how moving the Amnesiac songs were live. While OK Computer's emotionally charged 21st-century ballads and Kid A's movement into electronica each makes an effect in their respective ways, the Amnesiac songs had a hushed and muted but remarkably intense emotional impact.It caused me to re-engage with this album in a way I'd not done previously.\\"Pyramid Song\\" is a perfect example - haunting, metaphysical, beautifully lyrical and at the same time somewhat bleak. Hearing the chords of this song alone, with its near jazz-like arrangement, evokes our time and place in way few songs of any genre do.If you have put this one away I would dust it off and bring it out again. It's one that will live with you for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as it gets","review":"For starters, this album is nothing like OK Computer and nothing like Kid A. In fact, there is nothing out there to even remotely compare this album to. Suffice to say there are some truly great Radiohead moments here, notably \\"Pyramid Song\\" (which sounds like a nod to Ben Folds Five), \\"You and Whose Army\\", \\"Knives Out\\" and \\"Amnesiac/Morning Bell\\". The sound textures are hauntingly beautiful and push the experimental envelope a step further on songs like the techno chaos of \\"Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors\\" and the dissonant jazz-rock of \\"Life In A Glass House\\". If OK Computer was Sgt. Pepper, this is The White Album my friends. An extremely rewarding listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"when safer places are not around","review":"Que pasa cuando el mundo entero pierde su memoria? cuando las ideas se repiten a si mismas una tras otra como una sola nota? que pasa cuando un solo hombre puede hacer que nos suicidemos todos en un mismo isntante? 5 segundos para los que tiene suerte de olvidar nuestro corto viaje. quiza amnesiac haya nacido para ser olvidado, pero cuando eso suceda lo seguiremos disfrutando como si fuera la primera vez que lo hubiesemos escuchado."},{"rating":"2","title":"More accessible? No. Still impressive? Yes.","review":"It had been said in the media and among certain circles that \\"Amnesiac\\" would be more accessible, more mainstream than the widely acclaimed \\"Kid A\\" was. However, that is not the case. If anything, it's even more eccentric and heavily influenced by electronic sounds. It's not a happy record (none of theirs are), and at times its not even a very listenable record. But it is something that is very moody, and very respectable. I say respectable because even if you don't want to listen to it all the time, it's still one that you will be proud to have in your collection. If you want a fast paced, poppy record, get the newest Weezer. If you want something that;s brooding, and obtuse, and dificult, yet at the same time amazing in a way, get Amnesiac."},{"rating":"2","title":"i like it","review":"while not being as experimental (in my opinion) as kid A, this album isnt exactly your typical rock record (which is not a bad thing). however, i don't find it as exciting as kid A, maybe because i knew to expect such oddities as hunting bears and like spinning plates, or maybe because those avant guard pieces seem a little uninspired when compared to the brillant songs on kid A. the morning bell reworking is also pretty much unecessary, and i much prefer the original. none the less, it is still a very good album, and who knows, maybe it wil grow on me with future listenings?"},{"rating":"2","title":"not quite there......","review":"If you like Radiohead you will appreciatte this CD. There are quite a number of good songs on this album. Pact like Sardines.., Pyramid Song, You and whose Army, Knives Out, and Like Spinning Plates. However, it is not another OK Computer or Kid A. It lacks the composition of the latter and the track sequence is confusing at times. It is deffinetly worth the money you will spend on it though, but not recommended for new listeners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Album.","review":"More accessible than Kid A but not nearly as accessible as The Bends. This album focuses more on song structure than Kid A, less on electronica and creates a very happy medium without sounding like a \\"medium\\". Basically every song on the album is great, with my favorites being 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 11. i definitely recommend this album to anyone searching for something complex, creative and new. just listen to the album and give it a chance to reach in and grow on you will...it will, i'm almost positive.btw, i just read a review referencing people hating \\"pulk/pull revolving doors\\" because it's not great music. imo it's not meant to be an actual song...sort of like \\"fitter happier, more productive\\" wasn't a real song on ok computer. at least that's what i've always thought about pulk/pull... so...yeah.it's an incredible album. radiohead's darkest, most emotionally deep and complex album yet, imo... get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"turned out to be one of my favorite albums from radiohead.","review":"i am a BIG fan of radiohead, so i already knew how wonderful they were. i purchased this album in a used condition because i wanted to be frugal but also just because i needed to get more of radiohead's albums. i put it in one day when i was driving around town, and i was blown away at how relaxing and nice it was to drive to. i use it to calm myself down but also just enjoy the beauty and genius that is radiohead. 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I purchased this album on vinyl about a month ago because A)I liked Kid A and B)I didn't have any 10-inch albums in collection.

Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"Although the packaging was not as shown on the screenshot, it was very close and just as great-looking.

Incredible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid A&#65533;s best sequel","review":"This results to be a quite good album, like all Radiohead creates. However, Amnesiac is not as high-level as Kid A. It's quite hard working in all the songs. The ones I liked most are I might be wrong and Life in a glasshouse, in the latter, by the way, are played instruments like the trumpet, the trombone or the clarinet, weird sounds in a rock band, but I think it's very creative. In addition, this album contains such wonders like the rhythmical variations they often do. This album restores the way of OK Computer and Kid A at the same time, but in it rather predominate the electric sound.What's going to happen next? How will be the style of the next album, like their great hit, OK Computer, or maybe they will continue the way of Kid A and this? I wish Radiohead would amaze us with another marvel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"another mistake","review":"I was not particularly pleased with Kid A. I'm even less pleased with Amnesiac. What happened to the band that gave us Ok Computer and The Bends??? If you felt, as I did, that Kid A was a drab and ultimately boring effort; you'll want to save your money. There is only one, actually good, song on this album, \\"Knives Out\\". Worth it for that song alone? Probably not. A couple other tunes are somewhat interesting, but would have been better as B-sides. I suggest you buy a used copy. Hordes of let down Radiohead fans will surely be depositing their copy of Amnesiac at your local used record store. With the money you'll save you can buy the new Travis..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave it a chance to please me","review":"I bought this CD and listened to it several times but just couldn't get into it. It's just a bunch of noise! It sounds like Radiohead set out with the express intention of making the worst record they could. I think they just may have succeeded.I guess it does push the boundaries of listenable music, and I give Radiohead credit for that. But this CD is not something I got much pleasure out of listening to. In fact, it gave me a headache.Being experimental is great and all, but I feel like Radiohead is being experiemental just for the sake of being experimental. This was refreshing with their Kid A album, but grows old and dull so very quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"I hate this album, or do I?","review":"I don't know whether to like this album or hate this album. Every day is a different feeling towards this album. I didn't really get into radiohead until Kid A, ok computer got my interest up. I agree with a few of the reviewers when they think that radiohead is trying to \\"loss\\" fans by putting out this music and is just testing our intelligence but I think in doing this they're creating interesting music. The packaging is wonderful on the limited edition, kind of a bizarre library book. I think the artwork is the most interesting part of the whole album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadness","review":"This is not a great album. You can tell it comes from the same sessions as 'Kid A' as there is a distinct lack of innovative guitar work ( if isolated, the thing that made radiohead songs vital to the ear?) and no real regard for melody. I understand that the band needed to experiment, needed to move on - but they seem to have lost their way. Like Kid A , a lot of this is meandering around in search of a song foundation. To do it once is an acceptable statement, to do it twice could be taking the [dive]. It reminds me, to an extent, of the way that REM spluttered after going gargantuan and never reached the heights we hoped for. If this were a new band, we would all say \\"Hmm, when they grow up they could be quite good\\" and they would attain minor indie status. I fear the best of Radiohead is past us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"\\"Pyramid Song\\" is excellent. \\"You and Whose Army\\" is another favorite of mine.

The tracks are tight and flow well together. Radiohead, I love you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead's Best Album?","review":"I don't understand the bad rap for this album. Amnesiac is an amazing achievement. While I don't recommend this album to newcomers, I do think that every real fan should have this one in their collection.The harsh ratings are what kept me from listening to Amnesiac for so long. I decided to buy it recently and now I can say without a doubt that this is my favorite Radiohead album. Everything is just done right and there really is little-to-no filler.Do yourself a favor and give this one a chance.

If you want a CD of not-too-good amateur funeral music for your Uncle Fred's wake, then buy this CD now!

Oh Well!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite bad, and for no good reason","review":"Mostly boring, sometimes painful, with a few hints of remaining quality.I was actually embarrassed when I first played this the other night with my wife in the room. After buying Kid A and now Amnesiac, maybe I shouldn't be allowed to buy CDs anymore. It's because of albums like this that stores need more lenient return policies. If Radiohead continues on, I certainly won't buy the next album until I've heard it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congratulations Radiohead, you did it!","review":"Yes, Radiohead, you did it, you actually made a worse album than Kid A! After listening to Kid A for a long time, I was sure it would be years before another well-established group of musicians would be able to put out a bigger piece of ... than Kid A. Ohhhh how wrong I was. Here it is 6 months later and Radiohead themselves are the ones to put out that bomb. Alas Radiohead, you didn't get a penny of my money this time.

This probably wouldn't be a problem for most people, but it is why I didn't finish the job in just an hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy installation","review":"perks up the drab interior of my new mini suv (station wagon) did require a couple of accomodating holes for arm rests---which are not noticable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Gun Smokin Rock-N-Roll\\"","review":"Brent from Ohio obviously DON'T know what \\"REAL\\" rock-n-roll is about!

True, I would be more impressed w/Dave, Duanne and the rest of original Hatchet Band, but these guys REALLY KICK ASS!!! The bluesy, gear-driven guitar riffs show true talent in every respect!

If you're into other 80's AOR or hard rock, you'll like this - you don't have to be a southern rock type of fan to appreciate it. I liked it enough to burn my own CDs from vinyl LP copies before you could buy a CD (except perhaps for internet auction site bootlegs), and I like it better than a lot of what he did with Hatchet. Then again there's a reason why they still play \\"Edge of Sundown\\" live, even in the current lineup with Phil McCormick. If I remember right this album came about because of a feud in Hatchet that let to Jimmy Farrar taking over singing duties for a couple of albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy from Action Village!!","review":"Just recieved them this morning. The color is a burnt brown not the color in the listing. 3 of 3 bags had broken balls and the balls are dented. I called customer service @888-679-4327 the rep started a claim with UPS even though i told her the box was undamaged. She told me the paintballs are sold as is. They do not accept returns nor do refunds. She would call me when UPS let her know about the claim and that it takes 5-8 business days. I told her I bought them to shoot this weekend and 5-8 days will be to late. At this point she told me I could buy more. WHAT???? I wish i could rate them negative stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad paint","review":"Very inaccurate paint. The price is great and that is what got me to purchase the product, but I would not reuse or recommend. I bought it for practice with my first gun (BT Omega) and it really only worked for the satisfaction of testing the new gun :). When in game, the paint curved hard twenty feet from leaving my barrel. Also chopped (broke in barrel) frequently with rapid fire. The paint balls came in bags where at least 4-5 balls had broken, making the rest of the balls very oily and dirty. I actually threw a hopper full of it away it was that bad. I had other buddies shoot it out of their more expensive guns and they were also unimpressed.2 stars because of low quality but great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do it!!!","review":"I ordered 5 cases of the 1500 count paintballs from Action Village. of the 15 bags of 500 (3 per case), 12 bags had broken paintballs in them. Action Village will not take broken paint back so I tried picking out the broken paintballs and drying off the ones that looked good using a towel in a bin, but they ended up braking in our hoppers and guns making a huge mess and delaying our games. I would not recommend buying this product from Action Village. The time you waste cleaning guns and hoppers between games will negate (and then some) any savings you thought you were getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This paint ball are the worst ever i only had them for two days .

It was very reasonable. I ordered them with a bundle and didn't realize until after I had checked out that the shipping for the product was the entirety of my shipping costs and almost doubled the cost of my order. When I got the product it was pretty disappointing. I didn't expect anything amazing since they were so cheap, but what I got for the overall price, I would have been better to go out and buy a box at a sporting goods store. There were about 10 -15 broken balls in each bag of 500, which numerically isn't that bad, but makes for quite a bit of clean up time to get them usable. I would say around 30 - 40% of the usable ones were dimpled and will work only t o shoot around trees. Like I said, the price seemed right, but I got probably less than what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Achy Breaky","review":"So, I guess it would be naive to expect all the paint to get here without breaking a single ball. It just made it a little inconvenient to have to wipe off all the paintballs in the package as a result of two or three breaking during shipping. I would recommend sorting your paint into containers asap, as to cut down on the cleaning time later. Especially, after you transport them back and forth to the field a time or two. Otherwise this paint is fine, during combat. Good distance, good splatter factor. I ordered 4500 and it would have been nice to get some different colors which I guess I expected from the picture that shows the paint in a variety of colors. But, then again, we just covered how naive I am to expect all the paint to arrive unbroken. Take that last bit for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap but good for indoor id say)","review":"Get what you pay for.. these paintballs were pretty cool/good except the accuracy was garbage. 25 foot shot and you could watch the ball curve.. sometimes they wouldnt break, and also break alot in the barrel. not cool but if your goin cheap then i guess you could go with these."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Experience","review":"The paint balls arrived as promised.

The minute he saw it, he sat down and started playing with it. He just loves it. It has plenty of room for two or three kids to play and both the duplos and regular legos fit on the table. My only complaint is that the table is VERY short. I also have an 8 year old son and he plays at the table just as much as my 4 year old. We cannot find chairs small enough to fit under this table. I guess they think kids will stand to play, but my kids want to sit and even our smallest kids chairs(from Step 2) do not fit under the table. I think I will have to buy some wooden blocks to extend the legs so we can fit chairs under there.

The book needs a proofreader as there are missing vowels, misplaced vowels, a discussion of an alphabet letter which depicts the wrong letter and spelling mistakes in the English. The book is generally helpful, but it is unacceptable to have so many errors in a textbook. As a professor of Latin and Greek I can attest to the fact that some of the explanations of grammatical concepts are not correct. The transliteration also has some mistakes and should be used with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a Study Tool!","review":"I definitely recommend this book and purchasing it through Amazon as well.

This is the most boring thing I've ever sat though, and I only watched an hour and 20 minutes of it. To hell with it. I bet it was influenced by Wagner, I read that Verdi was, more's the pity. (Besides being an anti-Semitic homophobic megalomaniac who couldn't write good music, Wagner was a cad and an idiot.) In an hour and 20 minutes, there were only 2 tunes, one of which (what one reviewer called the veil song) I didn't even like. I have the Italian version on CD and thought I liked it (so what happened?), I only bought this (and wasted a ransom) because I wanted to see it enacted and I wanted to know the story. I should have read the libretto. This thing just goes drearily on eternally with nothing but plot to keep your interest or entertain you. Maybe when I read the story (which I'll do while I decide what to do with this DVD) I'll find out why Carlos and Rodrigue both needed shaves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legendary production; powerfully performed","review":"Luchino Visconti's famous Covent Garden production (originally from 1958, here revived in 1985) is now available on DVD--the sets are stark, the costumes sumptuous. Luis Lima is the most dramatic and moving Don Carlo on DVD; Ileana Cotrubas is a small scale but touching Elisabetta--tears well up in both their eyes in their final duet. The rest of the cast is fine, especially Zancanaro (Rodrigo) and Lloyd (Philip II). Picture quality is uneven, sound excellent. Haitink is a delicate but effective conductor of the full (3 1/2 hour) score. In general, the most powerful performance available of this most grand of Verdi operas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective DVD","review":"Neither the first DVD that I ordered, nor the second that I ordered after returning the defective first one, would load in my DVD player.

Frank Baum's take on Santa Claus and his origins, which are far outside traditional Christian beliefs. It is short, easy to read, but not just for children. It is something of a folk tale and alternate history wrapped into one story that explains how gifts, especially toys; stockings; Christmas trees; and reindeer became associated with Christmas. It even tells us how Christmas came to be on Dec. 25. Of course, it is all fictionalized and entertaining.

There didn't seem to be any real emotional connection between the hero and the heroine, and even though their sexual chemistry was supposed to be the one thing pulling them together, even that seemed a little off.In the end, it was a lackluster read, and the villain in the book (and the entire reason the H and h got together in the first place) came across as more silly than evil.I don't recommend this book to anyone unless you are able to get it for free.

First - there is only one. Will be a problem if/when I decide to buy a HD-DVD player in the coming years. Second - there is an obvious bug with switching between HD and regular channels - which sometimes causes the screen to go blank. The only fixes I've found is to either a) Don't use the HDMI input, or b) power the TV off and back on. I wish Sony would provide a fix for this.

It is the worst.","review":"Even the worst of the worst films might have a single retainable quality- not this one. I don't believe blame should be directed towards the actors' performances- the acting wasn't poor, the dialog was. I know, I've worked on the set. Two weeks into it, I quit after realizing the disastrious potential and the necessity to take my name off the credits.This movie started as a business decision- it's difficult for Hollywood to make money off any single project motivated by market, much less an individual with no previous experience in film, photography or creative writing. Thus, bad composition, bad lighting, bad timing, and cheap shots such as featuring a sympathetic star leads to the end result. This is the most factual, non-biased review I can give and it is this: watch this movie if you can.

Possibly.","review":"I am certain there are worse movies than this -- for example films made for high school film class electives. But there is nothing good or even average about this movie. The acting is truly the worst I have ever seen; there is nothing that even comes close. And I include \\"Plan Nine from Outer Space,\\" the movie that is well-recognized for being the worst movie ever made. Julie & Jack looks like it was filmed on a hand-held video camera, held as steady as someone with a bad case of the DT's could hold it, the lighting is wretched, the sound is abysmal, the story is just shy of ludicrous and I could go on, but I won't.

The handles are not anchored so they slide off way to easy. It should be adjustable with an end catch to keep the handles secure. Don't waste your money. I have 3 decent plastic cutting boards and about 3 good wooden cutting boards and I have to say the wood rules the day. If you want plastic because you think its safer and prevents bacteria you would be wrong. If you think its easier to clean you would be wrong. There's a reason why professional chefs use wood. Its superior. Anyways I thought an over the sink cutting board would at least justify using the plastic but I was wrong. Go get a good wooden cutting board and do what you need to to keep it in good condition. I will be retiring all my plastic boards at least for chopping and cutting purposes. I will likely use them as mats for other items to stand on. I so wanted to believe in the plastic boards. I was wrong!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not hot at all......","review":"If you think this hot sauce is going to be extra hot as they claim, you will be disapointed.

And as I listened to the songs, they grew on me...imensely. Like when Will says, \\"smart folks don't have to put no cursin' in their rhyme\\" it makes me realize for the millionth time Will Smith is the best rapper out there. Tracks like \\"Afro Angel\\" and \\"The Rain\\" are truly enlightening when you listen to the lyrics. The only reason I gave this CD four stars is because it is a little more \\"typical\\" rap than I am used to Will doing. It seems like he is conforming to the norm. But this is a GREAT cd.

Good for him, why the hell does he have to talk about it all the time? I'd have no problem with him dissing gangsta rap, IF he could bring some dope rhymes to the table.

It's adding cheesy rhymes to unimaginative sampling, the combination of which has often given real hip-hop an undeserved bad rap (pardon the pun), and taking it to a newer, lower level. I like the Fresh Prince, but this, my friends ain't no \\"Summertime\\".I bought this CD, played it in my car and asked for my money back within 30 minutes.

Unfortunatley, this isn't, and true hip-hop artists will always keep coming out with better and more original albums than this mindless tripe for the masses. As an early review said, almost all of Will's hits are based on earlier, more recognizable hits ( a la' Puffy ), and frankly, it re-enforces the stereotype that rap, and hip-hop as whole, is not music or an art, but thievery on a grand scale-- that it is unoriginal, and derivative (which it certainly is not). And although his stance on non-profanity is commendable, it is marred by the albums obvious commercialism. Good rap can be done without vulgarity, as done by Blackalicious, LA Symphony, Guru's Jazzmatazz, and Fresh Mode. This is music for people who don't listen to rap, and if you fit that description, then this might be for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could be better","review":"This isnt as good as Big Willie Style, but every song on Big Willie Style was good. He has quite a few good songs on this album. I like the songs that everyone has heard like Will2K, Freakin' It, and Wild Wild West. These are good songs. I like the song Da Butta featuring Lil' Kim, she performs very well in this song. La Fiesta and I'm comin are listenable too. In my mind the best song on the whole album is Potnas. THis is an awesome song just listen to it. There is the song Pump me up with Jazzy Jeff the scratching just gets really annoying. Overall this is a good album for a rapper that doesnt cuss. It is rare for them to do this and will does a decent job of it. A good album go and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wack.","review":"I don't know why anyone would call this a rap CD. It's not rap. I respect the guy for doing his thing and making his money, but this album is just not rap, it's pop. Not only that, he can't even get it right when he tries to answer his critics. On the song, \\"Freaking It\\" or whatever it's called, he says \\"what makes an MC great?\\" then proceeds to name cars, money, sales, and women. Now those things might measure success, but they have no bearing on wether or not someone's a good MC.

His ego is bloated, and no real emcee would celebrate the commercial \\"festivity\\" of the new millenium. To tell you the truth, I don't care about the new millenium. God doesn't care what year it is, so why should I? Sure MTV and BET will love it just like Juvenile and Puffy and everyone else who's commercial. This so-called \\"music\\" doesn't even come from the heart. Real rap artists like Kurupt, Daz Dillinger and Snoop Doggy Dogg don't edit the junk out of their albums. You can tell they don't double their vocals that much. The bottom line is that they ARE real and take their music seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"This is a very good Will Smith cd.

It still has the awesome Will Smith style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Love Will","review":"Let me just say that \\"Freakin' It\\" is such a great song! This song definitely makes the CD a must have! While Willennium may not be quite as good as Big Willie Style, I've always been a Will Smith fan, so no matter what he sings I'll listen to it! Overall, Willennium proves yet again that Will can continue to crank out hit after hit after hit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"I like the old Jazzy Jeff & Fresh Prince songs and even a few songs from Big Willie Style.

All songs sound the same. The only song by Will Smith worth while is \\"Men In Black\\" from another album. He should stick to acting, because he's a VERY talented actor and he is really a great guy but not-so-good in teh music industry. If you want some REALLY influential, danceable music, though not rap, check out the BACKSTREET BOYS! They RULE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good flashback to old school","review":"This CD is better than Big Willie Style in my opinion. There is still some of those will smith rap songs, but there are more old school songs. Gangster rap fans wont want to buy this album"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT rap","review":"I'm sick of people reviewing this CD and calling it a rap disc. It's not. If it were, than Will Smith would realize that what makes an emcee great is not money or sales, it's lyrics, flow, beats, and ability on the mic. First off, Will tackles no real topics on this CD, it's all party music, so right from the start you can tell the lyrics are worthless. There are no songs on here that are quoteable if you love rap. He's got a decent flow, and it fits his pop music, so I can't take that away from him. The beats are his best area, as they are designed for party raps. His mic skills pale in comparison to actual rap greats like Rakim and Big Daddy Kane, so he has no case to call himself \\"quintissential to this rap game\\". So there you have it, this album is a waste of time and money if you're looking for rap. If you don't like rap, then pick this release up, don't worry, it's pop and DEFINITELY not rap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will Smith can't rap","review":"I think that Will Smith needs to stay with acting and stop rapping completely.

There are some good songs but most are very weak, he just aint a good rapper. Yeah...he dont have 2 swear or talk bout sex,drugs,or money thats fine but he has not got any good lyrics. He did alot better acting, please please...listen to what i say i got this cd 4 a present and im glad, cause its not worth buyin' either record it off a friend just dont get it! believe me when i say this is NOT A GOOD CD- he really has nothin worth rappin' bout'. dont waste ur money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubble-gum rap at it's worst....","review":"I mean come on, judge the record for yourself- it's terrible! I appreciate the fact that he doesn't use profanity at all in his songs, unlike other rappers, but hey the song 'Will2K' is downright cheesy and corny, not to mention hideous. As for 'Wild wild west', you don't want me to get started on it-... Clearly, being a rapper wasn't meant for Will Smith- he has no attitude in his songs... Will Smith's a brilliant actor,no doubt, but that's it."},{"rating":"2","title":"DiS ALBUM IS THE BOMB","review":"This Album is off the hizzy. My main man Will Smith's flow is unmatchable..he makes Canibus, KRS-1, BIG, and De La Sol look Weak and Wack...He raps about TRU ish, not just the ghetto (but he still keeps it real, wit da Philly style). Also look for Will Smith's movies... Will, Colorado Loves You!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this cd","review":"Will Smith did a pretty bad job on this cd as he on all his cd's. He doesn't really even sing the songs. Don't buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"Will Smith shows once again that you don't have to be a foul-mouthed fool to produce good rap music. This album is an improvement over Big Willie Style, containing many guest appearances and much more variety. Check out \\"The Rain\\" for some serious truth. Biz Mark and Slick Rick add a little old school flavor. Money well Spent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Album","review":"This is the hottest album I have ever bought.

I've always liked Big Willie Style (I still do) Willenium was close to amounting to the success of Big Williwe Style. Will 2k and Wild Wild West and really good songs. The rest of the CD is Will Smith complaining about his lost life with Jada. I know this was in a few songs in Big Willie Style, but not as much as now. \\"Freak it\\" is a poor imitation of \\"Gettin' Jiggy with it.\\" Songs like Miami are needed to bring Will Smith back. I will forward to any new stuff by Will Smith, but this CD was bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save us all","review":"If Will Smith is claiming that he owns the 21st century, then we are in trouble.

He's very good at coming up with the rhymes and the music will grow on you, but... \\"it's not the second coming of Christ, it's the first coming of me\\"? That's blasphemous.

Will Smith is a pretty tight actor, but how he points out that he doesn't cust on his albums is pretty wack, also the themes he raps about are also wack. I guest though this is great for all the wacky Mormans who cant even watch a PG-13 movie when there 21 is ok. Yet if your a tru fan of hip-hop, go somewhere else, but tru hip-hop is underground!

I'm sure there's tons of teenagers purchasing this right now, but I don't really see whats so special about the cd. I am starting to doubt Will Smith's skill. I think the best thing he did was the show \\"Fresh Prince of Bel Air\\" and maybe a few standout songs (number 2) on this cd which I really don't appreciate. To tell you the truth, go buy Juvenile's Gcode if you want something worthy. Go purchase Eminems cd. Will Smith uses strange words like freaky and BS because he's too scared to utter a word of even semi-profanity; well then why doesn't he just quit. This isn't really that special unless you actually a fan of Will Smith."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Steve Allen and Donna Reed performed beautifully in this story about Benny Goodman. The difference between Benny Goodman and the musical icons of today is astounding. His music was brilliant.

His ex-wife does cause a lot of the same problems talked about in this book. But this book seems to focus totally on the ex-wife being a total ***. I thought it would focus more on the feelings you go through being a second wife and how to deal with stepchildren. I was very disappointed. It made it sound like everything is the ex-wife's fault. I don't believe that to be true. A marriage takes two people to work at it. It's never just one or the other. The failure of my husband's first marriage was a combination of the both of them. Now of course his ex doesn't believe that to be true, and she takes every opportunity to remind him of that. But she cannot be to blame for all of the problems. Life is what you make it. This book paid entirely too much attention to the ex-wife. It was very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Audio, Not Great Containment","review":"Seriously, these headphones sound fantastic, but they don't hold up because the plastic in the headset is awful, the metal arms connecting the ear phone fits in very poorly, which means over any light use, it will eventually fall out, so keep some strong glue handy, something you should not have to do when spending $150 for a pair of headphones...Really cheap looking and feeling headset, the phones are cheap, the plastic is cheap, the way it's constructed is cheap, but with great audio components...I prefer a headset that lasts longer than a year.I will never buy these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"As an audiophile, this was one of the best purchases I've made.","review":"I've spent over $200 on speakers and sound cards to try and get a great sound for my digital music.

The bass is thin and weak, the soundstage distant (as if you're sitting 50 feet away from the sound source), midrange is pleasant but average, highs are ok.

The pain is more noticeable lately and I'm wondering if the foam pieces are breaking down although visually they look fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great headphones!","review":"I bought Grado SR 125 headphones after reading many reviews. I figured they'd be good, but they turned out to be incredible! Every note and instrument is so clear and distinct. Vocals are rich and natural and there is no distortion.

I think it is a good toy for cause and effect. You have to press the head down to make it run. Only downside is the batteries did not last long in it.

It is the first since Cahoots (fourth album) that they play all their own NEW music and it is classic Band all the way with several wonderful songs and the rest very good!!

The resulting album, Northern Lights - Southern Cross is a solid, workman like effort that has some great songs. \\"Ophelia\\" is an excellent song as the stirring \\"Forbidden Fruit\\". \\"Arcadian Driftwood\\" and \\"Hobo Jungle\\" are good as well, but the standout track is the gorgeous \\"It Makes No Difference\\". Rick Danko provides the best vocals of his career on the track and it is a gem. Robbie Robertson is back on his writing game after some down time and Garth Hudson adds a Moog synthesizer to his repertoire and it adds an airy sound to the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recon Products","review":"This is the 2nd set of Recon lights I have purchased, first set was a set of cab lights that constantly had condensation in them.

No more, but certainly no less.This book is why I read (and heartily recommend) Jack Higgins. Absolutely first class. It reads like a screen play. Not a whole lot of character development, but enough to make you care for the good guys (and a few of the bad guys, too). He very satisfyingly brings together two plot lines (1. getting an American spook off of Nazi-occupied Jersey, and 2. Rommel sending a German-Jew ringer for himself to the Channel Islands to act in his stead while he conspires for a post-Hitler Germany) into a story that is accessible and enjoyable.

The stakes are high: the imminent invasion of Normandy. It's May 1944. Colonel Kelso is injured and marooned on the German-occupied island of Jersey. The British select Harry Martineau to either get Kelso out - or execute him to keep the secret. Martineau enlists the help of a variety of characters - his French mistress, an Italian naval officer and a Jewish German paratrooper.Higgins' skills are a masterful ability to deceive and counterdeceive his character - and the reader - in a journey of excitement and adventure. His characters are well-drawn. The pace is relentless. The stakes for Normandy are high and well-known. As a companion to his earlier book, \\"The Eagle Has Landed\\", Higgins continues in a fine tradition of WW 2 Intrigue.Michael Mandaville, Author \\"Stealing Thunder\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Night of the Fox","review":"Good story.

Night of the Fox wasn't up to par for him, however. The plot is a good one, but the character development, and the development of the sub-plots in the story were thin.

So if you want to keep the key on your key ring, you'll have to deal with lining up the T-bar every time you insert the lock. (If you have the key loose, you won't have to remove it after you remove the lock from the laptop, and then the T-bar stays in position.) The \\"manual\\" covers none of this.Before I learned how to use the lock, I called Kensington and the representative said the MacBook Pro doesn't have a K symbol, so their locks won't work with it.

This one had a came with a pretty generic key, like a skeleton key. It's so plain looking, I'm led to believe that every lock has the same exeact key.

The mower was easy to assemble and after charging the battery overnight, I mowed the lawn and had plenty of power. The mower never bogged down in the high spring grass.

I replaced it twice and finally gave in and got the gas mower since I don't have the memory or time in the day to baby a battery.

Put in the key, adjust the one-step height adjustment to your liking, and you're ready to go. The bag is in its 6th season with no signs of wear. What I REALLY love, though, is the edger/trimmer attachment. If you don't edge your yard, it just doesn't look manicured. This attachment does an outstanding job of edging----better than my neighbor's lawn service. I recently replaced the battery at $86, but this is after 6 years.

Moreover Hochschild's account is the result of years of research in libraries to reconstruct a history that King Leopold, Stanley's backer, sought hard to obliterate. When you read headlines today about atrocities in the Congo today, be aware that Stanley is very directly responsible for what has happened. To give you an insight into the man, his contemporaries report that he enjoyed shooting Africans for sport.

Think loud air conditioner. It's not something you can sleep with. However if you need a \\"white noise\\" generator to blot out sounds from other rooms, this is the perfect device.The other problem is that the water tank isn't designed to stand by itself upside down while you try to refill it. I couldn't even get it to lean against something; it kept falling over. You have to be holding it with one hand and preferably two hands. The easiest thing is to have someone else hold it for you.

The filter is what soaks up the water and if left wet it molds up pretty qick and at the very least you have to buy a new filter.

Yes, it has a fan noise, but it's not that loud or unpleasant and many people like the white noise. For fan sleepers, this is the perfect dry winter device.

I knew Mr. B would somehow manage to \\"Love it up a bit\\" for his coo'ing Female fans. On this CD Mr. B. and \\"artists\\" like him that do a tremendous DIS-service to musical masterpieces like Dylan's.

The formula remains the same: veteran soul material by the likes of Marvin Gaye, Ann Peebles, Louis Armstrong and Al Green fleeced and denatured as awful overblown orchestrations of pube-crimping, anglo-pleasing sap. Fans are sure to be tickled pinkish by the self-indulgent caterwauling. But even they might be inclined to turn up their snouts, if not at the fitting inclusion of the facile old acid lullaby Whiter Shade of Pale, then certainly at Moltin's excruciating emasculation of Dylan's Like A Rolling Stone. It's time for Michael Snap-on to cease and desist of the classics and muster the cajones to insert his own material in the white soul torture machine he's built for himself.Nothing less humiliating will suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Message to Michael: good riddance!","review":"Michael Bolton, one of the most overrated and overexposed pop singers of the '90s -- with an unapologetic ego the size of the Empire State Building to boot -- butchers a second set of classic pop and R&B songs. Give it up Mikey, it's over for you. You are one of the few singers I've heard with the ability to drain any soul or substance out of an otherwise decent song. The performances on this CD are dreadful, as always, and everyone knows about you and your self-indulgent reputation now.This CD failed to hit the Billboard 200, reflecting the current state of the Boltonite's career.

The tune choices were anything but classics, in my humble opinion, and the renditions were without the artistry we have all come to expect of Mr. Bolton. The first classics album was an absolute stunner. This album is stunningly inferior to it. The renditions are better than many artists could muster, but certainly not what we have come to expect from Michael Bolton. All in all a poor performance. I hope future albums are much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Soul Singer","review":"Michael Bolton is truly a soul singer. I love all of the songs on his Timeless CD except for Sexual Healing, not because Bolton sings it, but because I have never really liked that song, even when Marvin Gaye sang it. I love Michael's version of Try A Little Tenderness, and I also love Otis Redding's version. It's good to see Mr. Bolton paying tribute to classic soul singers such as Otis Redding, Sam Cooke, Al Green, Bob Dylan, just to name a few. I liked Dylan's version of A Rolling Stone, because it was recorded in a beatnik, hippie like style that was popular during that time. I also like the way Michael Bolton sings it. I also like the original version of Whiter Shade of Pale. Michael's version is good too. Keep up the good work Michael. You're doing good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"Timeless The Classics Vol.2 is one great CD and one that I was not dissapointed in.

The choice of material on this CD is reflective of Michael himself -- sexy, sweet, passionate -- and that unique Bolton voice has never been used to better advantage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classics yes. But NOT by him!","review":"This recording is nothing less than a rank obscenity. Bolton has butchered (as another reviewer so aptly puts it) some of the greatest music of an era.His temerity is only equaled by his lack of talent. Shouting, crying and growling his way painfully through standards like \\"My Girl\\", \\"Sexual Healing\\" \\"Tired of Being Alone\\" which were done as they should have greats. Forget about carrying their tunes, Bolton could not carry their suitcases.If you remember and love these songs, this is not the album for you. While Bolton may claim that he is recording these songs in some misguided tribute to to those who came before him, this is worse than damning with even less than the faintest of praise.At first, I though his \\"Whiter Shade of Pale\\" was a put-on. Would that it were!

To top it off, there were too many grammatical errors."},{"rating":"2","title":"soft and warm","review":"This book was so fulfilling and geniune, I really enjoyed the story and I see Mya is not alone in the way she feels about family. Her ex-fiance could have given her a second in the relationship because women always give men a second chance. She was just unpredictable about Kay-Kay. Mya had Chloe all wrong. Her mother and father relationship was so strained. Her uncle and aunt relationship was just dead. It is a good thing to find yourself and love yourself so that you can deal with lifes changes because you can open yourself for new things to come along. I think thats how she was able to perceive Alex so well, she was cleared of all that extra baggage (i.e. bag lady). Mya dealt with many situations and tribulations but she made it through the storm and thats what so warm about this book. Read it and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Letting Go","review":"This was a very good book! I found it very therapeutic! The book really addresses the importance of what real love is. Most people identify with the love they first learned from their families, particularly their parents. As with the character Mya. Through her journey of self-discovery she learned what real love was about-having it for yourself first. Until she found the love for herself, and healed from her past, family troubles, and learned to forgive, and accept...only than could she let go in every way. In a way I was surprised by a few things (I won't tell), but we as women do have to get away from the fairytales the \\"happily everafters\\" so to speak. In the end though, she got the love she truly wanted because she \\"let go\\" and was able to move on.I would love to see this into a movie. It was good read, and the only reason I didn't give it five stars is because there were a lot of typos, and it confused me at times. Margaret writes well, but needs a new editor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Characters","review":"This book is full of lively characters that seemed very real to me. I could relate very well to the main character, Mya. She was a work in progress who didn't have all the answers.

Her writing always entrances me and takes my breath away. Though I am not a poetry lover, Hodge gives me that through her eloquent style of writing. My only problem with this particular novel was the ending. I suppose Mya and Jeff could've gotten back together and made the story more typical. Okay, so Mya finds love in herself, but did she have to attract a man as equally edified and self-loving as she? It was all a bit far-fetched in spite of how well the story was written. There are a lot of people who love themselves and have it all together, but most are intimdiated by it and therefore never approach such individuals. Other than that unexpected ending, I still adore the author's ability to weave a tapestry with her words...."},{"rating":"2","title":"warm hands","review":"a very good love story.

A friend had an awesome sound system and it reproduced their live performance so well that I felt I could have been there. The Band played so well and sounded so good that night that it became one of the bands in the early 70's which inspired me to to become a professional musician and not go to college.

After listening to them that night, I felt that this recording was and is their best live recording to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live!!! (Before the Last Waltz)","review":"This Cd is excellent even though it is prior to the intensity of the Last Waltz. Some songs like Cripple Creek and Stage Fright are better on the Last Waltz but there are several gems that got snubbed when it came to that final concert. Buy this CD because Chest Fever has an awesome organ intro by Garth Hudson. I absolutly love this version of Don't Do It, its better than the Last Waltz version. Also the extra tracks w/ Bob Dylan are a rare treat. Also the exchange of vocals between Rick and Levon on \\"Loving you is Sweeter Than Ever.\\" I have always been a fan of \\"Get up Jake\\" and this version is pretty polished. At any rate I loved it, and was glad to have it in my complete collection of The Band."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated Live Album","review":"This album gets overshadowed by \\"The Last Waltz,\\" and that's too bad. There's some excellent material on here, and I like the horn section. Many live albums don't sound much different than the studio material, and the horn section gives the songs on here a unique feel.\\"Rock of Ages\\" should be on the Top 10 list of live rock albums of the '70s. Lots of solid material on here. If you want to get into The Band, I would not start here - I bought \\"Greatest Hits\\" first, and ended up getting most of the studio albums. But a great album nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But not the Best","review":"The Band were one of the greatest live acts around, there is no question that their live material is better than their studio stuff. Don't get me wrong there are some great tunes on this show, \\"Dont Do It\\" \\"Get Up Jake\\" \\"Life is a Carnival\\" just to name a few, but they are not Great versions, their just good. I find it hard to listen to this album all the way through I just get frusterated, especially at Rob Danko's shaky voice in this show. Get The Last Waltz if you want to hear some Great Band. I recommend this for long time Band fans, but if you are new to this group get The Last Waltz or Music from The Big Pink and go from there."},{"rating":"2","title":"The 2nd best of all time","review":"This is the second best live concert performance ever recorded by the hands of humans. As a matter of fact, when it comes to live recordings, there are only two that matter. This is a very close second to heavenly perfection. (For you young people out there, the best ever was the Allman Brothers Live At Fillmore East). But these two products transcend the earthly plane for very different reasons. Strangely enough both were recorded within a couple of months of each other---both in New York City (of which I am definitely not a fan)....the vibes were flowing from late 1970 to early 1971 like never before! Listen to them both and you will see how good it can get. I can't begin to do justice with words to either of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Band","review":"The circumstances of this recording are well known, so I won't dwell on the details.For myself, this is the definitive live abum by The Band. Although The Last Waltzgets lots of press, it is more about collaboration and the end of a era than The Band.These are great performances for the most part and the addition of the horn sectionjust makes it all better.

Nostalgia. The guests. The film. But when fans are asked to name their favorite, the nod usually goes to \\"Rock of Ages.\\" Trust a fan.Many of the usual suspects are here - \\"The Weight,\\" \\"The Night They Drove Old Dixie Down,\\" \\"Rag Mama Rag\\" - and that certainly isn't a bad thing, but the real treat is the horn section. It gives old songs a new feel, if I can be any more cliche. And the way they start out unexpectedly after introducing the horn players with the Marvin Gaye gem \\"Don't Do It\\" brings you in, sets you up, then knocks you out with later favorites like \\"Life is a Carnival\\" and \\"Stage Fright.\\" At the time it was excellent and revelatory.

My friend loves old aluminum Christmas trees and all things retro. I thought this book would be something she would really enjoy, and got it for her as a Christmas gift. It is a little on the small side. There are lots of pictures of aluminum trees, but none of them great or exciting...in fact, most of them are a little blurry and a bit dull. It would have been so much cooler if they would have made the effort to find REAL old photos and advertisements. There is not much written about the subject, either.

This flavor is particular is my go-to snack at night because they give me a full feeling without worry about breaking my diet.

You need a simple guide, one that you can take with you while you're exploring the area. Using the top 10 system you can find all the highlights in a few seconds.

There will certainly be a next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book with a great pullout map!","review":"I had traveled to Chicago before but I bought this book for my travel partner who had never been in the area. There were great suggestions for places to eat and what to see. It includes websites and phone numbers for all of the place suggestions and it also gives you hours of operation. The absolute best part about this book is the included map. It gives you an easy to read map of the city and a transit map that is super helpful on the go. I would definitely recommend this product if you're spending a few days in Chicago and you need suggestions."},{"rating":"2","title":"All you need for a 3-5 day visit","review":"I am not a big fan of the Eyewitness guides, but this Top 10 Chicago was the most useful, complete and precise travel guide I have used in a long time (I use a lot of them). It is all you need for a 3-5 day trip. It is a good reference for longer visits (coupled with other travel guides).So, if you are someone going to Chicago as a first-time visitor, get it.If you are the author or publisher, the only content suggestion would be to provide locations based on intersections (so that one can locate it by looking at the map - without having to go online), not only by street address. I wish the folding layout of the pullout map was simpler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top 10 Chicago","review":"Great source of valuable information.

All maps for Oak Park with the Frank Lloyd Wright houses are wrong so we had to wander round to try to spot the houses which were put on different streets or in the wrong place on the right street. Even the L map was out of date. We searched for the tea room in the Intercontinental hotel but it does not exist. A travel guide needs to provide reasonably up to date information - the houses in Oak Park have not moved for nearly one hundred years. When you are only spending a couple of days in Chicago you do not want duff information - this book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so impressed","review":"I was not so impressed by the content of this guidebook. All information is very high-level, there is no in-depth information on anything. I would have preferred to have less of the Top-10-lists, but rather some that also give some more information on the various sights. The maps are okayish, but not outstanding. Lots of other guidebooks provide much better maps with detailed directions to the sights - not here, you cannot necessarily rely on the maps in this book.The good thing is the size of the book - good to take with you wherever you go, easily fits into your pocket.

It begins in the earlier years of Kaczynski and logs personal event and how these events contributed to his psyche as a murder when he grew. One of the most compelling insights in the book is how he is thought to be insane and a madman. Kaczynski Knew what he was doing and did not what to be declared as insane because his environmental/anti-technology cause would be thought a joke. He took a plea bargain in order to keep the defense from declaring him mentally unstable. I was a amazed at the book and the great insight and detail it portrayed. If you are interested in Domestic Terrorism this is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful as a Textbook","review":"This book is useful as required reading for college students if the professor would like to help get the students past the trivial debates about whether Ted Kaczynski was a serial killer, ecoterrorist, or what. Far too often, attempts at criminological writing reduce to an essay on a \\"How crazy were they?\\" and this book helps correct that, making sense out of an episode in American history which frequently baffles explanation. For a taste of the author's writing, one should look for much of the same writing easily found on the web as a series of articles in The Atlantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Advaita Uncomplicated Nor Compromised","review":"\\"Nothing Personal\\" by Nirmala is a gem of a book when it comes to have a feel for what is being conveyed during a satsang or, my personal translation, gathering in the name of Truth.

And directly transmits that which is beyond/before words.I am only part-way through this book and am in no hurry to finish! (In fact, I can't imagine being finished with it because each sentence feels newly fresh and alive when I re-read it.)Each section or even each paragraph could take one directly to Truth. And to come from a different 'angle' with each section leaves my poor mind, again and again, with nothing to hang onto. Yet there is something deeper than my mind, that is being directly touched by Nirmala's words and presence. This 'direct touching' is transforming what I've been perceiving as Emptiness/Nothingness into something beautiful beyond words (and actually beyond what would normally be called 'experience'.)I am grateful, grateful, grateful for Life putting this book into my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"Few books earn the desert island status, but this is one of those rare books.

Great resource and makes a great gift or something to give skeptics.While Hank makes many valid points, skeptics might take it more seriously if he didn't so heavily reference young-earth creationists. Young-earthism is probably one of the biggest stumbling blocks for skeptics and Christians. It is unbiblical and unscientific. Hank often rebukes young-earthers for their emotional tactics, but never addresses the fact that they pose one of the greatest apologetic problems for Christianity.

We had met Pastor Dan in the two previous novels, but his character was fleshed out in this one. While fighting a fire, he is rescued by a pint sized, female, newcomer. It turns out that Ellie Karlson is the new Interim Fire Chief and Dan's boss. The story builds when Deep Haven seems to have an arsonist. Ellie has to find the arsonist and fight for her position in a man's world. This was a great story and you could tell the author did a lot of research in fire fighting. The fire descriptions were very detailed and knowledgeable. I enjoyed this book very much and look forward to other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready to move to Deep Haven, MN","review":"Thoroughly, thoroughly enjoyed this 3rd volume in Deep Haven series.

I thought the chapters were choppy and the story shallow. In the \\"Notes From The Author\\" section at the end of the book the author reveals her goal is to address the issues involved in changing careers or paths after many years of investment and how does one evaluate those years. Were they worthwhile and therefore am I worthwhile. I think her goals were worthy of a story but I do not think the story portrayed her goals. I was especially bothered that the single pastor was so quick to kiss the main character before she had made peace with God. I will not spend the time to read other books in this series.

Good Guy Wins!","review":"RObert Parker writes good page-turning mysteries and this one is in his upper echelon.Jesse Stone is a big-time L.A. cop who comes to be the chief of police in a small Massachusetts town. In this novel he solves two crimes - one a local rape and the other a serial killer. Along the way he has relationships with several women including an ex-wife he can not surrender. (Somehow, this middle-aged taciturn guy keeps getting the babes, but somehow it works.)The reader will find himself rooting for Stone in the rape matter and being very satisfied with its conclusion.In the serial killer plot, Stone's adversary is extremely unique and interesting. To tell more would be to ruin the first third of the book but suffice it to say Parker has masterfully created a challenging nemesis for his hero.Parker's writing, as always, is clean, concise and keeps the story moving. A good page-turner of a mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book and TV Movie","review":"The book by Ray B. Parker is great and will keep you glued to your reading seat. All the components to a wonderful serial killer murder mystery with some other side stories that truly add to the overall experience. This was so well written that it shouldn't be any wonder they made it into a TV movie. Tom Selleck played the Chief of police in the small town in Massachusetts.

But this one's a stinker, folks. Jesse Stone, who began life as a character distinct from Spenser, becomes in this one merely a clone of him, hewing to a rather tedious version of Spenser's philosophy of life. There are a lot of ponderous looks and deep, anguished sighs shared with various females, too. Overdone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best","review":"Although Parker is a personal favorite and this was no exception, it's time for Jesse to dump Jenn.

This is a boring march through two cases: (1) the gang-rape of an underage high-schooler and (2) a serial killing couple who kill for the thrill. Neither case has much dimension or plot, and worse, they are highly predictible. Then we throw in the love-life storyline of the Jesse Stone, our protaganist, police chief.

Stone has similar faults but, allows these faults to define him and, as a result lacks in self confidence and can get alternately whiney or abusive.

That the book draws significantly from \\"Brideshead Revisited\\" is noted early and often by the author herself, in a disappointingly obvious manner. But \\"Other People's Rules\\" also seems to worship at a less-exalted altar, Dominick Dunne's semi-trashy \\"A Season in Purgatory,\\" a roman a clef loosely based on the Martha Moxley murder and its Kennedy connection. As in \\"Brideshead\\" and \\"Purgatory,\\" the first-person narrator in \\"Rules\\" is a middle-class but comparatively impoverished young person drawn in by the privilege and eccentricities of a wealthy family; however, \\"Rules\\" resembles \\"Purgatory\\" not merely in theme but in plot points as well.

Thru-hiking the AT is a dream of mine. Raising money for charity is amazing and selfless!But this book was so incredibly boring to read. The writing was mechanical and overly methodical. The lack of emotion and description was painful. This felt like a high-school book report.There are many other AT thru-hike reads that do a better job of capturing the emotion and beauty of this hike. I *would* recommend this book for young readers as the author takes care to sanitize his language."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's ok","review":"I admire how he was committed to doing this walk to raise money for the home his brother is in, but I would like to have heard more insight into the people he met along the way and more description of the homes and inns he stayed in.

The author is articulate, sensitive to the reader, and has written an entertaining description of his journey without being preachy. The charity aspect is mentioned, but mainly to show part of the motivation for the walk. I have the 3rd edition, which includes supply suggestions and also information about what became of some of the other people the author met on the trail. I highly recommend A Walk for Sunshine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walking with my son","review":"My son is currently hiking the trail(2009).

I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a loved one on the trail and would like to experience the trail with them. It has also been very helpful in knowing what my son might need and of how I could be of better assistance on his adventure. There is Jeff's trials and tribulations along the trail as well as a great sense of humor. Thanks Jeff this was an excellent read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Walk for Sunshine","review":"For anyone who hikes or has backpacked along the Applachian Trail this book is for you.

I realize that silhouette novels are supposed to be schmaltzy, but I didn't realize how true this was until I actually read one; not an action I intend to repeat anytime soon.

Without telling you what the misunderstanding was and how it came about, I would highly recommend this book. When both characters are confronted about their mistakes, feelings and how they handled everything the wrong way, I feel they took the adult approach to try and make everyone involved happy. What I enjoyed most about this story was the characters did not go through a \\"I hate you stage\\" because of their misunderstanding. There was no long drawn out drama surrounding their situation.

More experienced gardeners should look at books written by Steven Still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent within its scope","review":"This is an excellent book for gardeners in USDA Zones 3b through 5b east of the 100th meridian. While one can certainly quarrel with which genera are covered, within its scope this book offers very solid advice. No similar reference offers as much breadth regarding specific cultivars. I hope the publisher will offer an expanded (including Thalictrums and Polygonatums!) and updated second edition in the near future. If you are a beginning to intermediate gardener this book is definitely worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guide for cold climates","review":"This book is a very complete guide for growing perennials in cold climates.

Loss, movement, and processes of forging new understanding are important themes. The volume is organized into sections, each of which begins with a dictionary definition of the prefix 'trans-'. Raz is one of theUnited States' most important contemporary poets and editors of poetry, so it is no surprise that she handles these issues with such dexterity in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing spectacular","review":"This book claims to have an interesting premise, and I quote from the back, \\"This elegant and moving collection grew out of Hilda Raz's experience with her son's journey to a transgender identity.\\" And while she does touch on it in several poems, she leaves so much of this unmined. I didn't find any of the poems in the book to be particularly outstanding, and as a whole the collection was rather weak, though it did have some highlights. It starts with a great poem by Rilke. Tough to live up to, and she does not. You get a couple of good lines and stanzas here and there, but there are so many really good collections of poetry out there, that you can safely avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this pump. First of all it is very big, so not very practical for taking on a camping trip. Also, the hose is not permanently attached like on other pumps I have used, and it does not stay attached very well.

I used to be so hungry and fill up my plate more than I can eat! Now since taking this pill I am sensible with my portions and do not rush to eat as if I'm starving like before.

The reason we purchased it was because we bought a 100 year old house with beautiful wood flooring and found tar and glue from old linoleum on the kitchen floor. The Goo Gone does wonders for the tar with very little effort, but it won't do very much if anything for the hardened glue that is underneath this flooring. Technically the product does not boast about the removal of said hardened glue, but since it did mention glue we had hoped based on previous claims from other users of the product that it would work. We are glad we purchased it because it is a very nice smelling product and will save us a few dollars when it comes time to refinish our hardwood flooring.

An average well-informed reader would know more about information systems than the author without reading a single page of this book. Author's style is old school, orthodox and boring. Maybe his military background is making him approach everything in a disciplined way without curiously questioning how and why. No examples, no case studies discussed. Way too generic, confusing and useless work. I wasted my money as this was a textbook for the course I took in IT auditing. My suggestion to readers is to explore other references in IT auditing on amazon.Amazon is not allowing me to go lower than one star. I will give it a one star since it is 568 stupid pages bound between two paperboards!

In addition, Palestine was sparsely populated the Jewish pioneers who cultivated the then unusable land attracted Arabs. Most of today's refugees are not genuinely refugees.

While there are chunks here and there that approach coherence, to a large extent the writing consists of a sort of manic hyper-caffeinated chattiness that at times verges on hysteria. Liberally peppered with irrelevant asides that careen from topic to topic without differentiating fact from wild speculation, the book is also repetitive and poorly edited. There's also an annoying habit of taking commonly used terms and arbitrarily coining new names for them (\\"minting\\" for nanotech assembly, the titular \\"spike\\" for Vinge's singularity). The jacket blurb casts this as accessible pop science writing in the tradition of Arthur C. Clarke's \\"Profiles of the Future.\\" While somewhere under all that verbiage Broderick seems to have a basic command of the subject, trust me -- Clarke he ain't."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Lovers of German Folk Music","review":"I was looking for something that was not a German brass band or accordion music from Oktoberfest. Not that I don't like that kind of music but I already have recordings of that festive, oom-pa-pa kind. I wanted something different but folksy. I found Die Blaue Blume and listened to some of the samples. It intrigued me so I bought it. I fell in love. This is like listening to Christmas carols or old Church hymns. I sounds like something that you would sing with your family and friends around a camp fire or in the evening around the piano in your living room. The songs are accompanied by guitar, violin, flute, and other instruments that give it a down home feel.

Sad, yet uplifting, the story demonstrates how the relationship between man and animal can transcend mortality.

Costopoulos is not a good writer by any stretch of the term, and his arrogance and self-absorption certainly do not help his case. Some of the sentences in this book are so poorly crafted you almost shudder in embarrassment. If I had not read \\"Echoes in the Darkness\\" already, I would not have been able to follow what happened--this is how poorly and confusingly Costopoulos sets out the facts. The ONLY things this book has going for it are the pictures included of the actual people involved in the saga (sorely missing from Wambaugh's book) and an update on what has happened to some of these people since Wambaugh's book was published."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echoes in the Darkness Wanna Be","review":"Costopoulos spends a lot of time in his literary effort designed to prove Smith not guilty of murder. He devotes little to no time on why Smith is innocent. Plus I agree with the earlier review that Costopoulos is full of himself - it does not make for an interesting reading, nor does is add to the story he is trying to tell. He is not a particularly good writer, but his story would have been strengthened if he actually stuck to the story! Frankly, I really do not care to hear about his daughters hair color, or the fabulous legal staff he has - not interesting, does not help prove his case. And this guy is supposed to be some great defense attorney? Smith is a free man due only to prosecutorial misconduct, not to his innocence or a great defense. He should have spent less time bashing Wambaugh's book, rightfully so a best seller.

That data is overwhelming for this book, and half of it could have been left out. Maybe I am not the target audience. However, I prefer a little too much data than a shortage of it.Mintzberg has laid out, with clarity, the structures of companies. He shows that he can think ahead of his time.

That it would be proudly published is shameful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sweet read.","review":"Grab a warm cup of tea, cuddle on the couch and share a young ladies thoughts on love, betrayal,rekindled romance and broken sisterhood.Betty Woodrum writes through experience.

These books contain such wisdom and insight - into striving for improvement and holiness in every day life. So among the messiness of life - family, work, relationships, dishes, expectations, dreams, practicalities, obligations and special moments these books carefully and gently take on everyday situations and finds grace-filled moments. I treasure these books, and after 10 years, I am still finding reminders of the holy in everyday situations. Great teaching, insight and formation. Find joy in the everyday. Find God at the center. Great companion to my day. A treasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"spiritual and practical","review":"Excellent blend of spiritual and practical.This set is unique in providing the riches of the best of the traditional sources of Catholic spirituality ( Church fathers, Medieval and Tridentine spiritualists and 20th Century orthodox theologians such as Garrigou-Lagrange) combined with down-to-earth , practical guidance for modern lay people.Being sourced from Opus Dei it contains many writings of St. Josemaria Escriva but these are all fully in keeping with the perennial teachings of mainstream Catholic spiritual writers.The English translations of scripture and mass collects present throughout the text are immeasurably superior to the 1973 ICEL versions and there are also many latin quotes and prayers ( with translation ).A tantalising glimpse of what could have been, had the directives of Vatican II been implemented in a spirit of obedience to the 2000 year patrimony of the Church rather than a spirit of rupture and iconoclasm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Catholic reading","review":"My wife is reading on a daily bases.

They are based on the day's Mass readings, are insightful, deeply spiritual, completely faithful to Catholic teaching, warmly conversational in tone, and eminently practical.It's first class material. If You put it into practice You will without doubt grow close to God and bring others with You.

Hers is a warm, lustrous, thrilling voice, powered by impeccable technique and taste. She brings dignity and beauty to the Gluck selections, excitement and beauty to the Verdi pieces, splendor and beauty to the Wagner excerpt, charm and beauty to the Bizet music, and seduction and beauty to the Saint-Saens aria (yes, even sung in German!)

The narration of the life of both Anthony and Cleopatra is too long due to some lousy acting that history lovers should have been spared.The second DVD starts with the legendary foundation of Rome in 753 BCE and ends with the reign of Justinian, the great emperor of the Eastern Roman Empire in the 6th century CE. The second DVD is an invitation to further explore the glorious past of Rome and its relevance to our western society.The photography in both DVDs is usually compelling, the interviews with leading archaeologists are most often interesting, and the narration of Joe Mantegna is to-the-point and accessible."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a peace of junk","review":"i just bought this thinking it was the documentory that played on the history channel about the accomplesments and enginering feats of the romans ,neros palace ,ceasars battles,the colosium ect. instead i find this bs naration by montania (they would have been better off with soupy sales at least it would have been funny)mainly talking and explaning about the sexual habits and in a way thats sure to bore and anoy anyone and guess what its almost 4 hours long i hope to get my money back for this if not it will soon find its way to a new home in the garbage can.this lesson cost me this much to learn that thiers a big difference between a master story teller and a wanna bee chump"},{"rating":"1","title":"....deceptive packaging???","review":"I am a real Roman Empire History buff and was jazzed at the idea of a new video documentary on the topic. There are two discs. The first includes the Julius Caesar bio and the story of Antony and Cleopatra. They aren't bad despite the fact the latter is given a bit of \\"hollywood treatment\\". I guess it's the History Channel getting ready for prime time. It's the second disk I have a problem with. It uses the programs from the Discovery Channel Documentary distributed by Questar Video afew years ago. That's four of the six programs in the set. So if you own the Questar set, like I do, you already have these programs. The History Channel set gives no indication of the prior packaging under Questar. That's a bit deceptive in my opinion. Be warned!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really lame","review":"As a fan of Wegman and Fay, I was hoping this would be as amusing as Alphabet Soup, but no, it's tedious.

I am also a 16 year old student and enjoyed this movie as much as I did the book. Yes, the quality is bad, but it was produced by the Boston affiliate (WGBH) of PBS in '79 I believe... since its budget wasn't huge, they had to make do with what they had. They did a great job and I reccomend this movie to all!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound quality poor","review":"Though the version was acurate to the text the sound quality of The Scarlet Letter was very poor.

I have the DVD.How nice it would be for PBS & WGBH Boston to catch up with the modern era and make their backlog of music scores available for purchase as mp3's. I would love to her the ominous symphonic piece they write for this as an mp3. Sadly, they just don't seem to get that they are sitting on a catalog of existing materials they could be making money from.

We all know the complexities of the novel - we are not reviewing that, but rather a version that is at least an 1 1/2 hours too long. The pacing is deadly, the set - a view of Boston in 1650 - looks like Peabody in 1625. 14 people gather around Hester after her 9 foot walk to the public scaffold. The whole production seems smallish.And I'm sorry, but Meg Foster's eyes are so weirdly other-worldish that I couldn't concentrate on much else.This production gets a Scarlet C-."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz............................","review":"When the movie stopped, I automatically woke up. I'm a 16 year old student, and I just want to say that this movie was just painful to sit through. The camera quality was remarkably cheap. Meg Foster's eyes had no color, they looked like white marbles in her head. That was just freaky. Kevin Conway didn't do to bad, he's a great actor (just watch him in Gettysburg), but you couldn't really understand what he was saying. The movie was true to the book, which may be why it was so bad. The music was unsettling, even kind of satanic sounding. Oh well. At least I'll never have to watch it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close to the text","review":"This film matches the book quite well.

The director did a good job with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gratuitous Garbage","review":"This is a terrible waste of time and money.

I NEVER even finished watching the movie, it was so awful.Save your hard-earned cash on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sexy Lana","review":"Many female actress hairdos of the forties and fifties seemed aimed at destroying sex appeal. Look at most of Lana's flicks after her very earliest to see that she was a typical victim. Slightly Dangerous is one of her early ones so Lana's youthful attractiveness is allowed to express itself. Even better, though it is a light comedy and Garbo had already played a similar though more dramatic role, Slightly Dangerous has its clever moments, is very entertaining, and has a feel-good ending. Nothing tops her performance in The Postman Always Rings Twice, though. In that one, Lana is as close as she ever comes to being an actress, and she is incredibly sexy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rare successful followup","review":"Perhaps the reason this sequeal succeeds whereas the vast majority of others fail is that the author took off in a completely new direction, using the first book only as a stating point. This new saga reminds one of a children's tale in both style and simplicity of language. But the story is original and even exhilirating at times. The **** was entirely due to the development of the characters, none of whom are memorable or even likeable - too cartoonish. The Ganymedes (the giants) seem more like cardboard cutouts of what aliens should be - not who they really are. I guess I found them too anthropomorphic for my taste. This book opens the way for a third one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"As always, Harry Crews does not disappoint.

It's also an inspiring story of the human spirit, containing extraordinary wisdom amidst the humor, joy and pain of this ordinary but very special life"},{"rating":"2","title":"looking for a great Lama","review":"The late Chagdud Tulku has left one of the best Tibetan memoirs for us. Non Buddhists can read it a bit like an adventure story or another autobiography or perhaps to get a clearer picture of the communist takeover. Buddhists from altogether different traditions can read it to glimpse the on-the-spot teachings dealing with duality and the magical benefits entering the human psyche through dreams & visions.This is a great gift to us practitioners. He mentions many of his retreats in practices that we do now. These amazing systems that he and many others have brought out into the west to share. Also for people who have leanings in these directions it clearly shows that a system exists and has existed and is accessible, there are options for the questioning mind.Doing practice is great however reading some books ABOUT Buddhism is dull indeed. This book is a gem. I hope some of his magnetism finds its way directly to many readers.

The DVD gives fan a visual aspect of what a Matrduk concert is (which sadly I haven't attend...yet), and the performance they put on is just amazing and very energetic, feeding off the Dark Lords power. Legion does a phenomal job of being the voice of the band with the prescence on the stage with his fellow band mates not playing on the exact same level. The DVD also includes videos for Hearse and World Funeral, and while a Marduk video is always good thing, the production seemed very early 90's.

It would appear that EJ participated in a few of these projects during his early days, and this album is the result of collecting a number of such tracks on which EJ sang. I have no clue whether he played piano on any of them, but have my doubts.It's amusing, entertaining in places, but not by any means a real Elton John album.WARNING: I found that it would not play in either my or my wife's car stereo, though it plays at home just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"The era Elton Forgets","review":"Back in the Reg Dwight Days, it was common play for \\"sound-alike\\" albums to be released in the late 60's and early 70's. I remember having a few on the Pickwick label. Even though Sir Elton doesn't ever talk about doing these tracks, they are a hoot! The quality is surprisingly good, although there are many labels that put this out. I have the one with this cover and it's on RPM International, which is under Pickwick. Some of the tracks don't sound like Elton but there are definitly some great tracks with Elton doing his best at these covers. Best tracks for me were Badfinger's \\"Come And Get It\\", Cat Stevens' \\"Lady D'Arbanville\\", The Beach Boys version of \\"Cottonfields\\" and \\"My Baby Loves Lovin'\\" could pass as an early track like his own \\"I've Been Loving You\\".

This soundtrack captures a lot of source music that was certainly in vogue and has captured that tantalizing cocktail jet set quality in the numerous compositions especially in IT HAD BETTER BE TONIGHT. THE PINK PANTHER theme is an endearing and enduring melody that has become instantly identifiable with both the cartoon character and the film series. The gifted Henry Mancini not only composed great and endearing songs and melodies but was also an exceptional and somewhat unrecognized composer when it came to scoring a film. Track 13 - Return of the Pink Panther, Pts. 1-2 is a very good background composition unfolding the caper of that outing and is included here.

Sadly he is trying to follow in my daughters footsteps by hopping it but in general it is able to block his escape.Update: So dropped from 4 to 2 stars. The button has been pushed in and broken so it won't lock in place. Still opens and shuts fine but for the amount I paid, I would expect it to last a bit more. Also the pieces on the end keep coming loose, making the gate fall over.

My guests appreciate it so much more, as they didn't like trying to step over the babygate I had been using.The adjustable extenders were needed and blend in naturally. The whole thing looks much more homey than the old gate I had been using. The only concern is that bumping into it roughly when it is not latched makes it move. I have tightened it but it still wiggles a bit if I am clumsy as I walk thru it. But when it is closed and latched this thing won't budge a bit!!

But since the soundtrack is from the movie, which I have watched many times, I think reviewing the soundtrack from seeing the movie only, is valid. The movie was superb, so good that I hate to quibble. But I thought the one weakness in the movie was the performance of the musical numbers by the cast, who are, after all, actors and not musical performers. The articulation, so important in G & S, does not measure up to that of good Savoyard performers, nor do the voices, nor does the staging (not evident on the soundtrack of course).

If you are going to use it 10 times a summer like me up here in Wisconsin, it's got a pretty good ROI. The paddle is pretty cheap, don't overtighten the connectors like I did the first time or they will crack. (fixed with duct tape, works fine)I wouldn't take this through any real rough or shallow stuff where there's sharp objects to rub up against. The vinyl derivative it's made out of is of a much greater quality than your standard $10 inflatable tube but it's still puncturable. It's pretty easy to inflate, with or without a pump. And it stays inflated well. You need to be very careful where you dock & undock, as standard boat launches sometimes have rocks and jagged edges.In terms of performance, it's very well-balanced and maneuverable. It's also easy to push around. I think it's a geometrically sound design. I like mine a lot, and for the money I think it was well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"Saw people using these kayaks on the lake, thought it looked like good fun and easier to transport than a regular kayak (it's inflatable!!).

You can carry them anywhere. The kayaks are light, stable, easy to maneuver and comfortable to sit on. The paddle can be unscrewed for easy storage. The small skegs on the bottom help prevent being blown too easily side to side.

My first kayak was a hard kayak, which I carried aboard my sailboat and used all over the bahamas. I could go further distances, faster, in bigger winds and seas than I could when rowing the dinghy. The second kayak was a higher end ($500) inflatable. Not as good as the hard shell but more stowable. This coleman, well, it does fit into my small car when deflated, which is about all I can say for it. And the seat is comfortable. I'm an excellent rower/paddler and still found it difficult to make way against 10 knots of wind and a half knot current. Maybe a longer paddle with larger blades would help? Definitely to be used in flat water/calm winds/no current. It would be good for running down a slow stream with someone to pick you up at the end of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"RiverRobb","review":"This is a nice kayak. It is easy to inflate and nice to ride. I am kind of a big guy and it is easy to get on and off. Smooth ride; nice for a beginner.Developed a hole in the seam on the right side of the seating area. After the cost of shipping it back (part of the warranty) and the return postage (also part of the warranty) and insuring the kayak during the shipping process (also part of the warranty) it was easier and cheaper to just buy a new kayak. That was disappointing to say the least. Coleman should really pay for all of the warranty issues with shipping etc. Unless of course you live near a Coleman center, then it's a piece of cake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small","review":"These earrings are much smaller than they look in the picture.

Another Great feature is that the Camera can move up and down, front and back, also the Camera takes Great pictures and as well with Video. Make sure that you suscribe to Sprints PowerVison or you wont get some of the more ausome features such as, Major t.v Stations, Serious Satellite Radio, Mp3 Player, and many more things.The only downside is that the battery life isnt the greatest.This is a Great phone!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy with this Phone","review":"I bought this phone as soon as it came out in December. I was dying to get my hands on it! I have been disappointed since pretty much day one and 6 months later I am sorry I wasted so much money on the latest and greatest (which will be obsolete soon anyway).My biggest complaint is the battery life. I have to charge the battery as much on this phone as I did on a 3 year old phone! Even in stand-by mode it's often out of juice when I go to use it.The speakerphone function is completely useless. Instead of a button on the phone, you must find it on a menu during a call.

Featuring David Cassidy and Shirley Jones. Don't let this one slip away, it is a true GEM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nostalgic","review":"This is a great album, but with some songs performed by generic singers. I'm glad they eventually included at least David and Shirley. This brings back great memories of when I was 9. There is not much more to say other than get it if you like nostalgia and have fond memories of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"beginners luck","review":"This was their first and highest charting album but certainly not their best. David Cassidy doesn't even sing on some of the songs. I think I love you(#1 in 1970) was a good song but is tiring to listen to today. It's the only song by the Family you ever hear about anymore. This is my least favorite of the albums overall. Their next 3 albums were better than this one. But I'd still buy it if you like the Partridges. POINT ME IN THE DIRECTION... , BRAND NEW ME and I CAN FEEL YOUR HEARTBEAT are worth the price you pay. Have a nice day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wish the songs were longer","review":"I enjoyed Sound Magazine more, maybe because I owned it as a kid. I remember hearing many of these songs on the TV show and like the ones that are fast paced. My favorite is I Can Feel Your Heartbeat but I wish it were longer! Brand New Me, Bandala, and Somebody Wants to Love You are all good to dance to (or dust the furniture) and I go around with Singing My Song stuck in my head all day after hearing it. I don't like I Really Want to Know You, Only a Moment Ago and To Be Lovers; all seem sappy to me. I realize the show was supposed to sound like a family singing and didn't start out to be a vehicle for David Cassidy but when I hear a song without his voice I am picturing the family and thinking, now who is this supposed to be singing? The redhaired kid? It sounds like a small male chorus; must be the redhaired kid AND the little kid on the drums. The CD is too short, but still gets 4 stars as I enjoy the fast songs so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"...Well, to be honest...","review":"To be honest, I only listen to \\"I Think I Love You\\". Maybe it's cause I'm truely a Beatle fan, or maybe cause the album is bad, or maybe beacuse the cosmic beings don't want me to like it, or maybe cause I'm psychoanalyzing myself right here and now. To put it plainly, there's only one good song. However if you would kill over if it weren't for the existance for these guys maybe you should buy it. In other words, extreme fans only, otherwise I suggest you don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst","review":"The lyrics are trite and sappy. The music bland and generic. The production is utterly unoriginal and soulless. This is teeny bopper product at its worst, and that there are still people who want to hear here is a sad commentary on how crass, cynical, and thoroughly manipulative marketing still pays off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard as rocks","review":"I did not like this pillow because it was as hard as rocks. Very uncomfortable my cat won't even sleep on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"I purchased this pillow when it came it was not the same one so be sure you check with the people selling it not to substitute which is what they did with me.

I will never buy from them again"},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite NIN CD","review":"This CD (Halo 15) is only for the most dyed-in-the-wool NIN fan. It includes three selections: a track from THE FRAGILE, a remix of another track from THE FRAGILE, and a third track unfamilliar to me. Although each of the tracks is at least worth a listen, Halo 15 is quite expensive for what it is. I doubt that this CD will encourage would-be NIN fans to explore the other halos, but if NIN is high on your list, you may want to check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical advice for anyone","review":"Dr. Chiesa's message is clear...follow the golden rule and the world will be a happier place.

This is a Motorhead DVD and, speaking as a fan, not a very good one at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing an old timer - same kind","review":"I was happy to find the same Kitchen Timer that I had (mine was dropped and stopped working). I had the thing for years!! Unfortunately, the quality of the product diminished greatly. The new timer is made of lighter plastic so right off, I did not really like it but was willing to keep it. The idea of me keeping the new timer changed immediately when I tested it and could not get it to ring. I requested an exchange. I was in contact with the merchant that supplied the timer and they had one more in their store. The merchant tested it before sending it to me and it didn't work either. I had to settle for a full refund. It's just too bad companies who have a good product don't maintain the use of quality materials. Why did they feel the need to cheapen the product?? It's annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Salter Housewares Extended Ring Kitchen Timer","review":"The Salter Housewares Extended Ring Kitchen timer DID NOT WORK and I was unaware how to return it, so I threw it away.Very disappointing.E.

The 45 degree stop created a fairly tight 45 degree joint. The down side was the back rest it is a little short and mine was not quite 90 degrees to the table top.

My main complaint is that the bar should be about 4-6 inches longer. A workpiece that is kind of wide isn't as stable as it could be.The adjustment of the nylon shims to take up the side to side movement of the guage in the miter slot is a little lacking but it does work. I would like to see the guage head itself made from cast aluminum rather than steel.It was relatively easy to set up for use. I am satisfied because it does work, just not as well as I'd hoped. If I had it to do over I would look for one with a longer bar and cast aluminum head.I do like the presets that are built in, the numbers are easy to see and it's easy to position the guage where you want it and tighten the knob."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delighted","review":"This miter gauge is vastly better than the next-to-useless, cheap gauge that came with my Dewalt DW745 table saw.

If the Band struggled to find an \\"identity\\" in its 1st two studio albums (although they are still good albums!), this follow-up effort to the \\"live\\" Stagepass left no doubt which direction the band was headed: crank-up the amps; they're rockin' on this one. Recorded in Monmouth, Wales, in an old castle (not far from Robert Plant's house) & remixed at Trident Studios in London (where the Beatles recorded \\"Hey Jude\\"), the band captures in the studio the sound and excitement they brought to their live performance in Stagepass.

Overall it works great, however the air pressure gauge is a joke. I bought a separate precision gauge and use it instead of built in.

Mine flat out doesn't work. I load it with butter, and the butter just sticks in there.

I still have half a stick in the thing, and I have no idea how to get it back out.Totally useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard, too soft, never just right.","review":"Total Fail. Those are my husband's words for this product. I purchased it as a gift for him but we just can't get it to work.

Not only did it not cut the butter, but the mechanism kept getting stuck to the point where I had to break the thing.

Its a terrific idea which I loved. However the reality is that the cubes of butter from Northern California do not fit. They are too big by a smidge and a half. If you live somewhere with narrow butter this is for you. but not here. The engineer needs to go back and jimmy things some and put it out again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was a great little gift","review":"I got this partially as a joke for my mother because she is always leaving the butter lying out to get softened. But, we then decided it was great for the family because we have a gluten-free individual, and this helps keeps all the bread crumbs from everyone else off of the butter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not dispense cut butter","review":"We've only had this a couple of days, but so far each and every cut has remained in the bottom of the cutter and you need to use your fingers (or something else) to release the butter. I'll try a different brand and size and see if that makes a difference.The first stick (Pulgra...absolutely the best butter) we are using is the longer, more narrow stick. I did have to cut the block before putting it in the butter cutter but is was a precision cut and any of the longer sticks would have the same issue.I did watch the video on the butter cutter web site and it shows in the demonstration the guy was jerking the cutter down as he was slicing it. I tried that and it did not work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent idea!","review":"I bought this butter cutter on a whim. Wasn't sure it would really work, but it does! It makes perfect little pats of butter with a click. Makes it easy to dispense just the right amount of butter, easily, and without having to touch the butter! It does sometimes clog up with a piece of butter, but not often, therefore, the 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Recording, But Get The Beaux Arts","review":"The five volumes (thus far) of Haydn's Complete Piano Trios by Trio 1790 are perfectly fine recordings of these great works.

Those performances that have been without peer since their initial release in the 1970s.

Some of our puritanical American viewers might get stuck on the sexual content and reject this film (probably out of a sense of their own sexual inadequacies). This movie goes much deeper than raw eroticism. It is a wonderful commentary on individuality and the psychology of individuality. This film celebrates the uniqueness of the individual human spirit. This film screams about acceptance and appreciation of oneself -- and to acknowledge and honor the normal and quirky traits we all possess. This movie is truly a great film. It will undoubtedly go down as an important cult classic -- I would argue on the same par as cult classics \\"The Graduate\\" and \\"Harold and Maude.\\" The performances by Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader are first rate. These were likely too very difficult roles to pull off and they did it superbly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexretary","review":"I saw this movie a few years ago on TV.I was shocked at what was edited out the first time!WOW!Maggie is strangely erotic I only say strangely because of the power that abuse has in sex!Good movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Secretary review by Brandon","review":"Good movie, kind of long though and more drama than action.

It seems the more the boss abuses here (he loves to read circle her typos), the more she enjoys it. It gets to the point where her boss finally starts spanking her. This changes her psyche and she no longer is attracted to her fiancee, who thinks it is a joke when she requests he spank her.Her whole world seems lost, when her boss tires of the game and proceeds to fire her.

Period. I guess the point is to try and introduce Sadomasochism into the \\"mainstream.\\" Not in the sense of whips, leather, and chains, but more along the lines of two pitiful people with no real way to relate to each other.I can truly say that this was the first time in my life that I was ever embarrassed for the two main screen actors. I wondered why, even with the money, James Spader and Maggie Gyllenhaal would humiliate themselves this way.

At first I thought it was bit much with the main character cutting herself and then submitting to spanking and domination by James Spader (Way creepy. What is it with that guy anyway?). But there's a humor there I haven't seen and an unexpected sweetness...by the end I was bewitched by this movie and all its weirdness. Horribly addicted, I watched it twice in one day, back to back. And I'll probably do the same thing tomorrow. This just made my top 10 fav movie of all time list.So if you are looking for something offbeat, unusual, and refreshing from Hollywood, this would be a great place to start.

Sure, I already had a long-standing crush on Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader (Lord, so much), as well as an interest in BDSM, but the movie was about so much more.I loved the details: the office decorated in a way that made you think of a forest, where she felt safe; the medical-like implements he used to care for his rare-and-delicate orchids; her childish way of dressing which then gives way to confident adult clothing.She learns to trust, to release her emotions, to communicate.Seeing the transformation from where she starts off is amazing.It's a sexy love story about exploring and accepting who you are (particularly Spader's character)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"I enjoyed it, have put alot of thought into it, and have determined that I will require a personal secretary for my own office.

We were floored. It was amazing. I've read all 135 reviews posted on this wonderful movie and I was shocked to see how many just hated it. I found the quiet flow and growth of the characters refreshing. As for people saying the setting surreal, obviously have no clue on the flavor of S&M and D/s.While neither of us have the overt issues psychologically that the main characters seem to, we both related to them amazingly close.This movie is about love and personal growth. The other stuff is just the mechanics to allow them both to happen.

Prepare a nice home-cooked meal, dim the lights, find a comfortable sofa, and watch this film together. It is a delightful romantic-comedy romp exploring the hilarious dynamics that often erupt between lovers when they first discover one another and decide to pursue a relationship. It's also a fun film to consider over the Christmas holidays, when you visit your parents and everyone in the family wants to stay inside and watch a movie together. Ice down some sodas, make some bowls of popcorn, gather all the kids in the den and watch this whale of a movie together -- it will become a repeat seasonal favorite, one to which you return year after year, just like \\"It's A Wonderful Life.\\" Enjoy !!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"It is hard to catergorise this film. Whether it is a romantic comedy, a black comedy, a drama or a sexual thriller there really is only one word I can use to describe it...Boring.I bought this without seeing it for one reason and one reason only. Maggie Gyllenhaal... She is an amazing actress and I am a big fan of her talents and while I was expecting this movie to be left of centre, not even her performance could stop me from falling asleep in parts.Its not that I bought this without knowing anything about it, I researched it and read many reviews, the storyline did interest me but I was just always waiting for the movie to get into it. James Spader is stale, as was the rest of the supporting cast. Two stars however for Maggie Gyllenhaal, who's performance alone will no doubt attract fans of hers to this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"it was a disappointment-----","review":"basically i found this movie very disappointing.i watched it with great interest at the beginning and then i just wanted it to get to the end of the movie.i liked the idea that two people with all their quirks found each other.they first had to accept the differences in themselves before they could have a relationship with one another.the movie just lost my interest somewhere in the middle and that \\"carnival\\" atmosphere at the end in his office with her family and friends ----i was just rolling my eyes with the corniness of it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and Adoring Movie","review":"Interesting that the boss's last name is Grey. Hmm. Just finished a book with another boss with the same name. This is soft and very subtle. There is nudity but not gross. Like the movie so much I had to simply own it. very sexy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"great movie, its one of my top 5 favs. i have a strange taste in movies. its sexy and exciting to watch. makes me wants to eat peas lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good & so unexpected.","review":"This film could easily have been the S/M crap feast that 9 1/2 Weeks was, but a fine sense of humor and a pleasurable tendency of the script, director and actors to play this straight makes for a fine film experience. The script walks a tightrope between humor and parody and finds the right tone throughout. The gal who plays the secretary is a revelation. The humor doesn't arrive from sniggering at the sex antics but from the interplay between characters. Very nicely done."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good film with great character acting","review":"The storyline is interesting to say the least. Young girl with obvious self-esteem problems and a penchant for enjoying pain meets older man who suffers from OCD and other 'issues'. Spader is famous for acting in this fringe, artsy movies. He does not disappoint in this film. We are drawn into his character from the beginning. As the film progresses, we begin to better understand the neurosis and what it is he seeks. The newcomer, Maggie G., has a breakthrough performance. The movie opens on a sad, pathetic looking girl and ends with a strong, assertive woman who is beautiful and knows what she wants.As with any relationship of this type, from the outside we see the dominant as being in charge. But looking closer and some of Maggie's characters actions at the end of the film, we see the submissive is actually pulling the strings - getting what she wants and needs out of the relationship.All in all, a fine film. We scripted, directed and acted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oodles and Oodles of kinky postmodernist love","review":"Wow, there are things I really loved about this movie. Turning the love story into a kinky, sexy, controlling, postmodern, postcolonial version of Americana in the workplace. It makes you want to roll over and get your butt slapped. Until the end that is. Then the filmmakers tank the whole film by forcing it to fit within the boring Hollywood convention of a love story. They even use reporters in the film, not to make a statement on our over powering draw to the media (especially to see the foreign and uncomfortable), but to make the interviewee's statement grounded in normality. It's a fantastic movie if you don't watch the last half hour...."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTAL Unabashed Love, The Dangers & Rewards That Lie Therein","review":"This movie just FLOORED me! I am a big James Spader fan and Maggie Gyllenhaal (Mona Lisa Smile) gives awonderful first starring performance... A young girl that has many life problems, wants someone to love her despite the fact and will stop AT NOTHING, even shaming & degradation doled out by her sad sack of a boss to get him to PAY ATTENTION to HER... If you are looking for a real eye-opening, erotic, fetish FILLED movie, (without the usual gratuitous skin shots) then this is the movie for you. Highly recommended as the whole ensemble turned in fine, fine performances. SMACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT","review":"I enjoy movies that do a good job developing their characters in the movie. This is definately, one of them. Lee and Mr. Grey, have a super hot connection. Try something \\"different\\", watch this movie!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe the reviews here...","review":"Are you guys friends of the director or something?I'm sorry but this is truly one of the most unpleasant and disturbing movies I have ever watched. I wish I could erase the memories of this movie from my mind, it was that bad. Whenever I think of bad movies, this is the first movie that comes to mind. It's sick, sadistic, about suicide, torture.. Words can't even begin to describe how disturbing and uncomfortable this film was. This is definitely not meant to be a feel good movie. One does not end up caring about any of the characters, because they're all so sick and twisted. I'm deviating from all the reviewers here, but believe me, you'll thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"I enjoy artsy films--this fell flat. Just plain dumb. Acting was bad, storyline was bad, continuity was bad---all of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not softcore not good enuf for TV","review":"DON'T BE DECEIVED BY THE COVER - NO STOCKINGS, NO HEELS. ONE BRIEF SPANKING SCENE (no flesh included) is the highlight of the film. Perhaps lifestylers would get nostalgic about this story, but for the curious weekend thrill seeker this DVD is sure to disappoint, if not get you 'shut out'. Definitely not a couples movie unless your lady is VERY much into BDSM, in which case this would only be a 101 level course if not a grade school primer. Don't judge a DVD by its cover!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Spader, what were you thinking???!!!","review":"Did I like anything about this movie? Well, I liked how Maggie Gyllenhaal's character, towards the 2nd half of the movie, finally ditched those dorky clothes she wore for threads that made her look like the sexy, beautiful woman that she really was. Other than that, though, it pretty much sucked. And it was REALLY weird!! A love story???!!! YEAH, RIGHT!! It was more like an exercise in weirdness!! Why am I not surprised that James Spader is in this movie??? (And I thought his character on ABC's \\"Boston Legal\\" was weird!!!) For once, I'd like to see him playing somebody that's normal. After watching this movie, I'll doubt you'll EVER want to watch it again. I won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"P - U this really stinks","review":"What movie was every one else watching? Certainly not this one. Very, very, slow. Disjointed story line. I hate to be a bore but this was boring. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst \\"so called\\" black-comedy I have ever seen!","review":"I did a search for black comedy movies and was happy to have found a newer release of a film of which I had not heard of. This is not a good movie! I hated every second of it. The acting was utterly horrible and one can feel no emotion for any character involved. The people in this movie live in a unbelievably fake world. I am a fan of black comedy movies like Storytelling, Welcome to the Dollhouse, American Beauty, and tv series like 6 Feet Under (on HBO), etc. but this is the worst so called black comedy I have ever sat through! It is a pure waste of time...that is unless you enjoy dream land and no depth in a character."},{"rating":"1","title":"totally insane, Amazon... offer us minus points... PLEASE","review":"this is about two people who belong in a psychiatric ward. When insanity is mistaken for love. Far from funny. Disturbing that writers come up with such a script. Maybe it's their way to deal with their own insanity. There should be a certain truth to any story. This story is not believable and far from interesting. File under garbage bin.this was a total waste of time. It's amazing that most people here give it such a high ranking. Big bag of zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, please.","review":"two stars for good acting, but this movie is pretentious beyond belief. under the guise of an s & m love story, it smugly dares you to say otherwise. if you don't like it, it's not because it's downright awful; it's because you're uptight and unable to appreciate alternative lifestyles. like many, many movies out now, this one insults the intelligence of its audience by offering up pure drivel disguised as art."},{"rating":"1","title":"A curiosity, but not a comedy","review":"Theatrical trailers sneakily suggested this was a twisted romcom, but this is one of those times when the trailer people created a different movie than the one you end up getting. Secretary's two leads are hard to like - a woman just out of an institution who cuts herself, and a largely unexplained sadistic lawyer. The romance, such as it is, has as its highlight a lengthy bottom smacking scene that will appeal only to people who like bottom smacking. The comedy adds up to perhaps half a dozen slight smiles. So yes, an unusual, even thoughtful film, but very far from a sexy date movie for most people. One of those DVDs you only play once."},{"rating":"1","title":"The posters were the best thing","review":"about this amazingly pretentious and just plain bad film. For starters, it follows no rhyme, reason or normal logic. Maybe that works in Fellini, but not a grade-C film being touted as sex-heavy. There is nothing sympathetic, really, about any character, and whatever happens, the viewer really remains unimpressed and uninvolved. The acting is OK. Gee! James Spader in a film where he plays someone with weird sexual tastes, or just someone weird, period. THERE'S something different. Was it a love story? Hate story? Both story? It doesn't really matter, because by then you won't care."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Erotic & Disturbingly Romantic Comedy!!!!!!!","review":"This was an absolutely great movie. Me and my girlfriend rented this one night after hearing about it on the Radio, and this has now become one of our Favorite movies to watch together. It's a very Dark Romantic movie involving Control, & Submission, and done in a tasteful way. This is also a great \\"In The Mood\\" movie for those who want to explore new directions with their intimacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"secretary","review":"came on time and in great condition. movie was so stupid i only got 20 minutes into it and had to turn it off. a big waste of time and money"},{"rating":"2","title":"NO MAYONNAISE THIS TIME !","review":"I'M YOUR SECRETARY! I'M YOUR SECRETARY! Punishingly funny. Sick, disturbing, entertainingly silly comedy. From subtle, to heavy-handed, to unpredictable.You're not sure if you want to like, hate, or pity the main characters; Mr Grey (James Spader - Stargate, The Practice, Boston Legal) or Lee (Maggie Gyllenhaal - Donnie Darko, The Dark Knight). But there are some outrageous scenes that make up for the somewhat (ahem) sick sexual practices that the boss and secretary go through.Jeremy Davies (Saving Private Ryan, Solaris, Rescue Dawn), as Lee's spaced-out boyfriend Peter, lends welcomed comic relief to some pretty dark and painful scenes (pun intended).This movie is definitely not for the straight-laced; even though you've got to keep reminding yourself \\"It's only a movie.\\" Not be be taken seriously. The tomato throwing scene was priceless."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE ROCKS","review":"I've never seen a movie like this. Amid the Dominant/submissive theme is a touching love story between 2 interesting characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's good to be bad","review":"the condition of the movie i bought was excellent and the movie itself was all that i heard it was gonna be. It wasnt x-rated but very sensual...just a peek at what it's like to be completely submissive and love it....2 thumbs up!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for any adult library","review":"I just love this movie. Its about an odd type of love affair. I would call it achick flick but some might not agree. If you like comedy mixed with a littlekinky sex (nothing explicit), buy this movie. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breakthrough in declining American comedy genre","review":"It was so nice to realize that American comedy cinema is not dead yet. Brilliant acting and a very intriguing and unusual plot makes this movie so different from the agonizing Hollywood production.I found some parallels betwenn this movie and French Amelie. If you liked Amelie, you will definitely like this one. If you haven't seen Amelie, then you should view both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sick dark comedy.","review":"Secretary is a movie you will really like or really loathe. I am somewhere in the middle. The story of a girl who cuts herself and finds happiness in a sadomachism relationship with her pompous boss could turn most people off and I have to admit some of the scenes are pretty risque but Maggie Gyenhaal wins over the audience with her dark optimism and self-deprecting attitude. She falls in love with Edward played by James Spader, it's an unusual kind of love but it works for her, she is used to hurting herself and now she finds pleaure in Edward releasing that same pain on her. This movie is not for everyone but it is worth a viewing or two. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, tender, disturbing, and hopeful.","review":"Maggie Gyllenhaal and James Spader's performances are both quite funny and also quite painful to watch. That both characters are able to overcome their self-hatred and -disgust by loving one another in a way that accepts, rather than negates, their sadistic-masochistic habits is wonderfully optimistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cant get enough!!","review":"In a few words....This is BRILLIANT acting!!! this movie has my undivided attention every time i watch it.there are so many ways to interpret this movie - it keeps giving you more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird Movie","review":"This is a strange movie about the relationship of a woman (The secretary) and her boss. They are not what you would consider normal, so their relationship is odd. The movie was slow in some parts and out of sequency in others. I believe most people will not enjoy this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is S&M \\"lite\\".","review":"Not much of a black comedy at all. With all the fuss & press I expected more than a little spanking with clothes on & simulated body cutting. James Spader was flat & not really focused. The only thing that saves this movie was a wonderful performance by Maggie Gyllenhaal, given the fairly weak material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oooh yes!","review":"I own and have seen this movie probably four or five times now. It is what turned me on to the fabulous actress Maggie Gyllenhaal. Of course James Spader plays his usual villainous role. It's definitely not your run of the mill love story but well worth the watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great performances of an Atypical love story","review":"If you enjoyed Sex, Lies & Videotape and the like, give Secretary a go. Even love finds a way with these two, messed up souls portrayed by Gyllenhaal and Spader. The subtleties of the performances are what get to me and under my skin, in a good way! The bond in which this unlikely pair forms is endearing and inspiring. The S&M angle, to me, is a lighthearted one, not necessarily to be taken seriously as it is more of a tool used to connect these two fragile souls. An honest reflection of overcoming one's demons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb edgy original movie.","review":"I loved the edginess of this movie, it's not for middle america for sure, but if you are somewhat off of center you'll get it and really enjoy it. Gyllenhall was awesome, her performance makes me want to see everything she's ever done. The movie has a big heart and a nicely perverse sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising","review":"Didn't know what to think of this film when I watched the trailer. And I REALLY didn't know what to think of it in the beginning, but the performances were so strong and the production values so good that I had to keep watching. When it was all said and done I loved it. What makes the movie work (aside from the acting of the two main leads-Spader and Gyllenhaal who are both terrific)is that with all the bad things that are going inside these two people you as the viewer do care about them. It works as a kind of perverse love story. This is not for everyone. Be warned. If you liked Punch Drunk Love or anything by David Lynch I am sure you will get a kick out of this. The ending made it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peronsaly Favorite","review":"Secretary is an unconventional love story involving Lee (Maggie Gyllenhall) and her employer, Mr. Grey (James Spader). Lee is a troubled young woman with an alcoholic father and a desire to inflict pain on herself (something she has done since the 7th grade). After spending some time in an instution she attends a community college and then seaks employment and is hired by Mr. Grey as his secretary.This leads Lee into the journey from darkness into light. Although what she considers light is not the most conventional. She takes pleasure in pain, spanking and obeying any order that Mr. Grey gives her. But, at the same time, the movie was able to keep a softness and caring surrouding the two as they traveled down this road together.I found the acting to be amazing and, despite several minutes of boredom towards the end of the movie, I greatly enjoyed the movie and it is one of my new personal favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had trouble with this one","review":"I'm not into blood and the cutting scenes with Maggie Gyllenhaal made me look away. This also starts v e r y slowly, and you might tune out before it really gets going, as I was tempted to do. In all, you'll have to work if you want to get through this one, so it's not a good choice for a night of easy viewing pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"This movie opened my mind to a different type of love. I love how it's so unexpected and daring. It was exciting to the process as the movie went on."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"I absolutely love this movie. It's one of my all time favorites. It's more than just quirky or a good romantic comedy. I'm one of those folks who admittedly finds it arousing. I guess it really is a matter of perspective. Either you \\"get it\\" or you don't. I don't know what else to say. Those who can relate to D/s will love this movie. Those who fear other-than-vanilla sexuality or who don't understand the D/s dynamic may not enjoy it as much or at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic!","review":"I watched this movie last night, and i never even thought of leaving the couch. Not only is it funny, but keeps you interested the whole time. I've heard of this movie and i was so interested in watching it. I wasn't prepared for it to be so kinky and raunchy, but it's in all good humor and the love they both share for their strange affection, just makes you fall inlove with the characters. It's really, really good and i truly recommend it to the young adults!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected or worth the time to watch","review":"Normally I have an open mind and always read reviews before buying something. After both of those I would have to say this was a complete waste of time and money. Amazon and the vendor worked well with me on the return. I just wish I could get the 2hrs of my life back that I spent watching it. The most entertainment this DVD could offer is to put it in the microwave for 10 seconds and watch the light show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I watched this because my nephew told me it was funny. I thought it was very sad, actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THAT ?","review":"It was one of the worst movies if not the worst,I've ever seen.Boredom and perversy at the uttermost level.It's not to say that \\"Spader\\" and \\"Gyllenhaal\\" are unimpressive.Indeed,they both perform excellent acting and they would be extolled if they've starred in somethink better.But purchasing and watching this movie is simply waste of time and money.I rue the day I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie was trying too hard.","review":"I can see how some people would be impressed by this movie, but I wasn't. It moved way too slow for me and I grew annoyed instead of intrigued by the characters. There were just way too many gimmicks for me to sit through! While the rest of the theater laughed at the pathetic title character's antics, I looked at my watch. I walked out of the theater soon after watching the scene where Lee and her boyfriend was having dinner at a resturaunt that looked like an adolecent girl's jewelry store. James Spader deserves better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The last time mainstream Hollywood tried to make a movie with material similar to this the results were equally ludicrous and disappointing -- and I am referring to \\"Exit To Eden\\", a brilliantly sexy book by Anne Rice (writing under one of her other names). I suppose Showgirls also fits the bill. They say that no one in Hollywood starts out to make a bad movie, and while I certainly believe that, The Secretary is one. While the acting is decent and the photograpy well done, the sexuality in the short story (from which this movie takes it's title) is so much better. Given the shortage, in my opinion, of mainstream movie with real sex scenes it must be difficult to do -- and this movie proves that. I can't really recommend this movie to anyone, unless you rent it with Showgirls and Exit To Eden for a night of camp laughs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance for the Mature","review":"A serious movie that is very well acted. It will compel you. Mature audiences only--not necessarily just by age. This is a movie you cannot quickly forget. Daring--like nothing I had seen before. A secretary into hurting herself physically develops a connection and a powerful DESIRE for her boss that has to be seen to be believed. The movie ends with the most beautiful and poetic imagery that has been burnt into my mind. ...and that song by Lizzie West, I had to look her up and buy the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I thought this movie was excellent. Very touching-watch it with a box of kleenex. HOWEVER for a movie that addresses diversity with disabilities I found it contridictory in that message when I found that it is not close captioned!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The power of agape' love","review":"Agape' love is the type of love that God has for us, and He showed it to Becca through Dean. It brought her healing, courage, hope, and love - after she had lost everything she thought would bring her happiness in her life. The movie doesn't get \\"religious\\" at all, because you can't find God through \\"religion\\". Like St Francis of Assisi said, \\"Preach the gospel at all times. If necessary, use words.\\" Dean showed the love Jesus has for us without getting preachy, and the result was beautiful and very inspirational. I pray I can be just like him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Movie.. A must see","review":"1 Message is a movie everyone should watch. I loved that Becca is a strong woman underneath her malady. This movie is awesome and uplifting. A definite must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!","review":"This is the latest in the adventures of the paper princess and it's as wonderful as the other two. I love the character of the dog and how the princess' cheerful and brave optimism plays against his more timid nature. It's a great book to read aloud and my kids were totally taken in by the story and cheered at the ending. We also love the two earlier books and they've become favorites that we read over and over again (my two year old now \\"reads\\" them to himself). Each of the three books has a very distinctive plot so they don't suffer from being bland imitations of each other. It's a rare author who can take a character and expand her world as successfully as Elisa Kleven does. We can't wait for the princess' next adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In a word: Awful","review":"Her first album was pleasant. This one is simply awful. Her voice sounds strained most of the time, and shrill at the highest notes -- almost as if she's a struggling falsetto. I had to shut it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read These Words Carefully.","review":"What do Marion Talley, Deanna Durbin, Ana Maria Alberghetti and Bejun Mehta have in common? They were all teenage sopranos who had better voices than Charlotte Church. Talley, in fact, was singing at the Met at 15. And yes, their voices had youthfulness, sweetness, and something besides - GOOD PITCH and STYLE.Give me a break."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Yet a Pro","review":"Ms. Church would be charming in a small town talent contest, but she is not yet a pro. As music, this overblown disc is worthless, really pathetic. Let her grow up and learn to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one gets the gong.","review":"I bought this album because I was blown away by Charlotte's Y2K New Year rendition of Just Wave Hello. Unfortunately, the song is poorly produced on this album, with a too cutsy children's chorale in the background, and things go down from there. Granted, Charlotte has a wonderfully pure voice; however, every high note is disconcertingly fortissimo, there is little emotion in the singing, enunciation is poor, and mixing is bad. All in all, this sounds like an amateur reciting her last music lesson.Music selection is bad, too. Summertime from Porgy and Bess just does not fit.I've tried listening to the album several times, and about halfway through, the cringe factor gets too big, and all listeners present give it the gong.If you want a classical soprano, get Sarah Brightman or Renee Fleming. Or Celine Dion if you want to go a bit more popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this CD!","review":"I just want to say that I love this CD. I don't think I will ever get tired of it. I originally wanted \\"Voice of an Angel\\" because Panis Angelicus was on it, but my mom picked up the wrong one, well I listened to it and I love it. People my age listen to bad music (rap, marylin manson, backstreet boys, brittany spears *cringe* to all of that). My favorite songs on this CD are \\"the last rose of summer\\" and \\"she went through the fair\\". I think Charlotte Church has a wonderful voice, if only I could get my friends to listen...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most enjoyable","review":"I recently read that Charlotte Church is the world's top-selling soprano. Pretty good for a 14-year-old! My favorite songs are \\"Tell me what love is,\\" and \\"She walked through the fair.\\" I also thought her Italian and French songs were beautifully rendered, as was \\"Men of Harlech.\\" She has definitely found her audience in people like me who enjoy wonderful singing without all the elitist trappings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Listen...","review":"Charlotte's voice has grown in the past year. This CD is two stars above her Voice of an Angel release. First the recording is much better, and second, her talent is better used.I was prepared to hate her \\"Summertime\\" cut. What could a 13 year-old Welsh girl bring to this Gershwin Classic? Well, she sang it straight with little dialect and finished it on a note so pure that it has become my favorite of the CD.The entire CD is done without her taking on any persona but Charlotte Church, and it works. I only hope she puts out a Christmas CD for next year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Voice","review":"Yes, I know she is not Kathleen Battle, so stop comparing the two. This is a child with an amazing gift. Only time will tell whether she meets or exceeds all the critic's expectations. I hate opera but I love listening to Charlotte. I bought her second album for \\"Summertime\\" and was not disappointed. When she hits and sustains the final note, her etherial voice sends chills up my spine. I can't wait to hear here Dream of Dream CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS NOT MUSIC.","review":"Music is a lot of things. Music is joy. Music is passion. Music is a sincere love for the beauty of the world. Charlotte is hitting the notes perfectly, but she has no feeling behind it. It is like a kindergartener reading a classic novel. They can read it, but they can't comprehend the words. She is reading notes on a page, but she is free of warmth and emotion. It has no joy, no passion, no love. This is not music."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want a soft voice buy Sarah Brightman","review":"I am glad that she has such a voice for a young age but she is singing songs that were not made for children ( no offence to her loyal fans ) but if your looking for a similar voice but with artistry with also similar songs buy Sarah Brightman she is afterall a Diva. If you are looking for power though look no further than Maria Callas the godess of them all has it all. Church is no more then Andrea Bocelli ( a wanna be opera singer that should really stick to pop )"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-style rendering doesn't work for operatic material!","review":"Charlotte Church does indeed have a lovely voice, but she doesn't yet have the control most of this material deserves. Handel and Bach should be served up with style and personality, both of which Ms. Church has in abundance, but also require precision and technique, which are lacking here. That said, the popular tunes are delivered nicely, if that's your cuppa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even one star","review":"I, too, am a classically trained singer, and I am not impressed with Charlotte. Everything that needs to be said about her frightening flawed technique, bland presentation, and de-void of any emotion delivery has been said.However, it is good to know that people that do not usually listen to classical music appreciate it more because of her. I just hope the more they listen to more classical music (and GOOD singers!), they will realize that Charlotte is NOT an opera singer....Thank you....I feel better now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good marketing","review":"Sounds like many a talented singer in her first year of conservatory. As she matures I hope her diction will settle and she'll be able to avoid accenting difficult unaccented high notes--that takes incredible muscles and it wouldn't be fair to expect them to be in place this early in her career. I forsee a great future for this singer-- especially given the market forces supporting her at this point. --Matt Fields, composer"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Most of the arrangements in this CD sound as if she has been recorded at a distance; she sound awfully young and thin-voiced in the early cuts. I hear no passion and joy and joy in her singing, at least not on this first listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"touched","review":"charlotte, an australian, at her age she is only in year 8! first year high school! but her sopprano voice is just un believable, she can sing such a high pitch, yet so tender and so sweet, there is no favourite song...i love them all! ...people out there who thinks classical music is dumb, listen to any one of her songs and it would change your mind, also...the more i listened to her song...the more i fall in love with them, her voice overwhelms my soul every time i listen to her songs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have never been an opera fan until I heard Charlotte Church. This album is a wonderful example of her great talent. Her voice is awesome and I recommend this to everyone. I was extremely satisfied with this album and I believe if you are a fan of great music you will enjoy this as much as I do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary CD worth 10 stars","review":"Funny how the voice students are always so insightful about Charlotte Church's singing and usually give just enough faint praise to... you get the idea. What is never fully acknowledged is the magnitude of beauty in her every note. There is something about her voice that just sounds better than all the other sopranos of the world. Obviously it's not her technique or interpretive skills, as some keen reviewers have pointed out. It has more to do with the absolute purity and richness of the sounds she emits. This isn't a question of her potential; it's a fact of where she's at now. It's perfectly obvious to millions of us that her voice was \\"kissed by God.\\" That is why she's a star at 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh quit complaining!","review":"When I get home from teaching high school each day, it is such a treat to relax and listen to a \\"freshman\\" sing so beautifully. I will probably wear this CD out--Charlotte's not perfect; she's only 13; but let's get over it! Stop complaining about her shortcomings and focus on her present gifts and enjoy hearing her mature as new albums are released.

Of course, she is not as experienced as some of the seasoned sopranos but give me a break, she is barely a teen! Look at many of the other singers today and listen to what they sounded like when they were young and you will see that we cannot be so critical of Charolette. We need to appreciate her and her talent and watch and see what God is going to do with her. I think the whole cd is wonderful and cannot wait to see what the future holds for this young woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful cd!","review":"Like many of the other people reviewing this cd, I can't stop listening to it! The varied selection of songs keeps the cd interesting and Charlottte's beautiful voice has the ability to move one to tears. There isn't a song on the cd that isn't good, but I think that track #5 Lascia ch'io pianga is the most beautiful song I have EVER heard! The only shortcoming is that the translation of the lyrics was not included-I would love to know what Charlotte is singing about in O mio babbino caro, Lascia ch'io pianga, Men of Harlech etc.(this does not effect the enjoyment of the songs) I highly recommend this cd to anyone who loves beautiful music. Who cares if she is only 13 and not quite as good as some of the seasoned opera singers? All that criticism just sounds like sour grapes to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new review for the charming Charlotte.","review":"One of the reviewers below chides me for jumping on Charlotte's ways with some classic songs. Well, I have not changed my mind, but he is right- this beautiful young lady with a heavenly voice should be thanked for helping bring more people to some old classics. Keep on trucking, Charlotte! Too many young singers these days simply scream or talk their way through their songs. Charlotte SINGS and does beautiful work. My misgivings about the future state of her voice is based on the fact that I want her to keep on singing for many more years. I remain who I am, I cannot be anybody else, with my fingers crossed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is wonderful","review":"I think that considering the fact that she is SO young, this cd is fantastic. Sure, some of the recordings are meant for more mature voices, but i think that she manages to pull them off rather well. I loved \\"The Holy City,\\" \\"Summertime\\" and \\"Voi che sapete.\\" I agree with another poster though--once you start listening, you just can't stop. I can't wait until she gets a little older and re-records some of these pieces so that we can all compare the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitation of a child - pure and simple!","review":"Charlotte Church should be STUDYING singing at her age, giving her voice time to develop and mature. She shows some talent, but it is not possible to be a child prodigy with the human voice: this is the one instrument that requires time and maturation to build a secure, solid technique. It cannot be rushed or bypassed. To do so is equivalent to putting on toe shoes before the leg muscles are ready for that. Already one can see Church's entire vocal apparatus wobbling with tension and stress. The jaw is not supposed to shake like that when the voice and technique are healthy. The people who are \\"managing\\" her are setting this young lady up for a brutal disillusionment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply astonishing.","review":"OK....so this is not pure opera. So what?

The music recording quality is some of the poorist that I've ever heard. It's particularly sad when a voice as great as Charlotte's, singing music as great as this, is so weak and muffled sounding. Even worse, much of her singing is drowned out by instrumentation.You only have to listen to her \\"Voice of an Angel\\" CD or her DVD to hear the way she should be recorded. Her DVD by the way, sounds so good that she seems to be live.Such a shame that this CD can be so bad.

As a soprano who has studied vioce for many years, I can say from experience and with conifdence that this girl is wrecking her voice by using improper technique as well as BUTCHERING some of opera and classical's most beautiful music. It actually made me retch to hear her struggling with every measure of the Jewel Song from Faust. How horrible to hear a child singing an aria meant for a mature soprano voice, and in such an immature, oafy sounding way, taking too may breaths in all the worng places. The only thing that could have been worse than her evasion of the usually miraculous high note at the end would have been having to hear actualy strain to eke out one of her weak squeals in its place.

I had originally heard Charlotte Church on the TV movie Joan of Arc (I love that movie!). I fell in love with Panis Angelicus. I asked my mom to get me Voice of an Angel (so I could pay her back, of course), but she purchased Charlotte Church instead. I fell in love with it. My friends may think that I am crazy and listen to 'wierd' music, being I am only 15. I laugh at that. I hate pop music! They are the ones who don't listen to good music. I at least gave their kind of music a chance. This CD is perfect. So it is played switching places with my Edwin McCain and Motzart CDs. What a combonation of music! Charlotte Church has a beautiful voice, especially for one so young. I can only imagine how her voice will improve as she as well as I grow up! --Carol aka \\"Lyra S.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"voice is OK, just not for this kind of music","review":"cannot agree more with the reviewers who said Ms. Church, while possessing a pretty voice (it certainly gets attention), should not be singing opera. Whatever Charlotte does in the future, and her life is literally still ahead of her, professional opera shouldn't be one of them. or if she really insists, she must come to grips with the reality that she won't make a great soprano. maybe she won't even be one when she finally grows up. her voice is good, but her singing technique, for the music, is flawed and is ruining her faster than she realizes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please SKIP this CD","review":"I am horrified when I think of how much money Charlotte Church is making off a CD like this when there are so many singers with one thousand times the talent. Church sings literature FAR too advanced for someone her age- and is slowly destroying her vocal chords. The Jewel Song from Faust is literature that no woman under twenty six should DARE tackle, not simply because of its difficulty, but because she could not POSSIBLY achieve the emotional depth the song requires(and she DID not, I might add- this is the poorest rendition of the song I've ever heard). Church is not musical in any sense of the word- she's merely hitting high notes. I implore listeners of music- listen to coluratura Sumi Jo, or a TRUE artist such as June Anderson, Kiri Te Kanawa, or some other such maginificent soprano, and SKIP Charlotte Church."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in the right direction","review":"While \\"Voice of an Angel\\" do provide some joy to me, I'm utterly disappointed by this new album by Church. Her voice has not developed on the right direction and has lost its delightful innocence that was present in the previous album. The songs aren't really that good and her singing is becoming increasingly boring and monotonous. I sincerely hope that she can be wise to put a rein to such projects and do some serious voice training. That will do her more good in the long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dear God, don't bother.","review":"There is no such thing as \\"child prodigy\\" in singing. Voice are not ready to sing until a certain point in development. At Charlotte's age, all children who are going to have good voices when they grow up sound exactly like her. Just listen to the clips here at amazon of Jussi Bjoerling when he was ten years old. . . .Classical singers are not supposed to become famous during childhood. People like Charlotte are a mockery of what it means to train a singer. If this culture is seriously starting to like to listen to children who are not vocally developed, I can almost guarantee that Charlotte is going to have a lot of competition in the near future. I can think of five young women off the top of my head in my community who sing as well as she does!If you guys care at all about Charlotte's voice and want it to develop into a healthy instrument (which it no doubt will---she has talent), stop buying her CD's and encouraging this madness!"},{"rating":"1","title":"decent","review":"I really will make no judgement calls on the tone and quality of her voice. She is trained beyond her years, and given proper training, could perhaps become a virtuoso. But she is not one yet. Aside from the merely technical aspects, which will come if her voice is not ruined from over strain, she lacks a certain showmanship. Maria Callas was often innacurate and sometimes her voice merely gave up on her, but she truely understood the music that she brought to light. Each word was infused with passion and gave the listener, no matter what the language was, a sense of the song itself. Ms. Church's translation of music is superficial and technical. She has yet to become a performer. Perhaps in time, she will prove to be as bright a star as she is credited to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential... Maybe?","review":"This is not a great CD. Charlotte Church has a nice voice, but she could use some intense training. She has a pleasant sound, indicative of real potential. Hopefully all the early attention won't kill a master singer before she gets to the meat of music.The CD is marked by alot of ameteurish mistakes. Sometimes she goes slightly off key, at times she is too loud or not loud enough. That she was very young when this CD was made makes these mistakes forgiveable. If you want to hear what raw talent sounds like this CD is for you, but if you only listen to the music I would skip Charlotte Church until she gets a voice trainer. She tends to sound like a so so pop artist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better!","review":"Charlotte Church has a nice pleasant voice and I have this CD and Voice Of An Angel, there are a couple of nice songs on this CD but some of the songs are kind of insipid so I can only take it in small doses and not listen to this CD a lot, actually I haven't listened to it in a very long time because it kind of bores me but it's not her singing that bores me it's some of the selections that they chose for this CD and also Voice Of An Angel that I really just don't find all that interesting and kind of has me reluctant to buy any of her other CD's but that doesn't mean I don't think she has a nice voice and I definitely think she has the potential to make a really great album if she chose some more interesting tunes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids and grandmas will love this album!","review":"One good thing about this Ms. Church's success is that children (and many adults) are being introduced to music by the great composers. It is kind of like Schoolhouse Rock meets opera. Come on all you music critics, stop taking her so seriously or at least wait until she is in her twenties and thrities to make your judgements. People love her and she is bringing in the money. You don't need talent to make money just great marketing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice job!","review":"I am just being introduced to the world of opera and to singing in general. I never had a decent voice until a few years ago when I started to sing well, so I don't know a lot of the technical terms and the way in which opera is supposed to sound. I think Charlotte has a beautiful voice and all of the critiques about her \\"not being mature enough\\" to perform such works have to be taken with a grain of salt - she is only 14 or so. Her voice will mature as she gets older and she will experience more things in her life so as to put more feeling into her singing. I am worried about damage to her voice - if she continues to sing so often, what will happen when she is in the prime of her singing career, say, late twenties to early thirties? Well, that's enough of that. I thought this CD was wonderful! Nice job, Charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"The prettiest voice in the world today","review":"Now I don't listen to opera at all so I'm sure there are plenty of GREAT soprano students out there itchin to be discovered who'll slap me silly for saying this but, for my money, Charlotte Church can sing like no one else in the world! I just can't imagine a prettier voice than what I heard in the songs \\"Summertime\\", \\"O Mio Babbino Caro\\" and \\"If Thou Art Near.\\" Her range of styles and accents must be the envy of any singer alive (let's hear all you \\"students\\" sing in Gaelic, Welsh, French, Italian, English and Latin!).

Now maybe it's because I was expecting apple flavor and it's peach or maybe it's just lost on me due to not knowing the extensive history of these two characters. Either way I was always waiting to be blown away by this but it never came. The art is interesting and it's one of the darkest renditions of Superman that I can remember seeing. I'd say take a chance with this but know that if you are in a similar boat as I was, meaning you never followed Supes and don't know all the twists and turns that Lex had, this may be a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I was hoping for something better than Brian's last series with Jim Lee (Superman: For Tomorrow) but this turned out to be nearly as confusing as his earlier work. Brian has tried to something different (as with Superman in For Tomorrow) but I am not sure he succeeded. The end was kind of a let down and what happened with Bruce and Lex I've never understood... why was Supes fighting with Bats.Brian once again brings in his character Mr. Orr and tries to infuse him with some traits that should have made him more interesting but all I could think was \\"He looks like Jim Gordon!\\" so kinda distracting.The art is well... good but I guess it has to grow on you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous tale of Lex vs. Superman","review":"Azzarello's storytelling is tight as always in this 5 issue arc that treads on the well worn storyline of Lex Luthor's latest scheme to best Superman.

Like the villain himself.","review":"Things are always interesting when seen from the villain's perspective but Lex Luthor has always been a complicated villain. He really thinks Superman is wrong for mankind and lacks the self-awareness to realize that he wishes he were a type of Superman or that his issues with Superman stem from any kind of jealousy. We see Lex here at his most human and inhumane all the while accusing Superman of lacking the very humanity that Lex truly lacks. Dark, interesting, complex.

It's great to have all the Goju-ryu kata on one video.Morio Higaonna is one of the premier Goju-ryu practitioners and everything that he does, every little detail of his kata is done intentionally and for the specific purpose of generating more power in his punches, kicks and strikes. One of the most impressive things that he does is turn around. His turns are precise and quick and stop on a dime. It is a sight to behold, that's for sure.Having seen home video footage of Morio Higaonna adds even more to seeing this video production. He looks exactly the same doing kata in the back of someone's dojo in one take as he does doing kata on this video. I'm impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect...","review":"Morio Higaonna's flawless performance of the Goju-Ryu Kata is nothing short of spectacular. He's certainly one of the finest practitioners in the world. PERIOD.

(They have a sign for example that says \\"Saifa\\" ~ but the chapter doesn't start THERE so you don't know which Kata you are watching! Instead it starts AFTER the storyboard, so you have to manually back up to find out! DUMB! DUMB! DUMB!).

Fifty artists are featured, with a description of each's concepts and techniques, alongside superb photography. Although the information is a sufficient platform for further learning, \\"Color on Metal\\" is not a tutorial (nor a formulary) but a stimulating exploration of each artist's personal approach to surface and color. You will find these diverse and often ingenious expressions anything but afterthoughts or casual embellishments.

What they would do is advertise for a poetry contest, get you to submit a poem and then tell you that you have been selected to be in the book and then they send you information on how to buy the book, and other products such as authenticity papers and such, which total about a hundred dollars. With about 3,000 poems in it, they figure if they do a limited market publishing, they will get at least that many buyers from just the people who contributed, if not family and friends as well. The whole thing is lagitimate, in that they actually do award prize money to someone, but the truth be told you can write a \\"roses are red\\" type of poem and still get in this book.

The music, the voices, are all very annoying. These young ducks are talking about one thing only and that is sex and cars. Don't get me wrong it all is okay, but can you be any less blunt about it, there is a whole lot more that other artists are singing and rapping about.

For example, in the song \\"I Want You\\" there is a verse that says \\"You had me fallin like some leaves in the summer. You had me fixing things like I was a plumber...\\" Leaves don't fall in the summer, and do I really need to comment on the \\"plumber\\" part of the verse? \\"You and me get down like 2 flats on the side of the street\\" is another crappy lyric from the same song. The worst part about it is the beats and the actual singing in the songs is pretty good but the dude kills it with the raps. The first single \\"Grind On Me\\" is alright and probably the best song on the album.The only people who would really enjoy this album would be young middle school and high school girls who are boy crazy because I have to admit these boys are easy on the eyes...but that's about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Straight","review":"Well i knew when the cd came out the only person that was go wreck was Pleasure (the one that be singing).

For 20 year olds they really laid down tracks that can make you wet and having your momma ask who they are. Songs like \\"Grind With Me\\", \\"Get A Lil Closer\\", \\"Juicy\\"... are the freak songs that can get you in the mood. \\"Shorty Be Mine\\", \\"Get You Right\\", and \\"Call Me\\" were songs that expressed how to make a girl be yours in a drop of a dime. The cheeiest songs on the album had to be \\"Grill'em\\", \\"Chevy\\", and \\"Girlfriend\\". Other than that the album get 4 stars! A good debut!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but Crap at the same time.","review":"While I did actually like \\"Grind on Me\\" for a few days, I downloaded the cd when it came out - sorry. I bootlegged. It wasn't worth my money nor do I own a cd player (thats so old-fashioned). I saw the video and at first thought they were cute but then when I saw them on tv at the VMA's (?), they looked like trash.You need some form of birth control to listen to their songs. I guess if your into hearing about sex, sex, sex, and more sex then this is the cd for you. If one liners like \\"I'mma eat ya body out like lunch\\", and \\"I'll be your mexican lover bangin' up your pinyata\\" interest you..then hey! Buy it. It mostly appeals to... people between the ages of 12-15 though.......but if you have a little more taste.. pick up Omarion's or Marques Houston's, hell even Ray-J's cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"more like \\"Ugly Ricky\\"","review":"I think the song \\"Grid with Me\\" (which was #4 on charts) sounds annoying they play it too much on the radio and they rap at the same time to. Their other song \\"Juicy\\" talking about getting intimate with girls in the bed room the only reason why girls want them cause they are in a band and they have money they wouldn't care about them if they were nobodies walking out on the streets.It's the same o same o another R&B; group that mix's singing with rap, these days as far as guys go their R&B; music is wack. Their voices are so deep they don't hit those high tone note's like the old school R&B; groups did back in the 80's and mid 90's like:(Keith Sweat, KC & JoJo, Jodeci, New Edition, Boyz to Men, New Kids on the Block, Soul for Real, Guy, and more).Today's artist have no talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Ricky has an ugly release","review":"The only thing the album Bluestars has to offer is a spot for an ice cold beer on the coffee table in my living room. Ever since Macho Man, a.k.a. Randy Savage, released Be A Man, the rap game just ain't the same. The only way to succeed in the business is to tag team with the former WWF Heavyweight Champion and snap in to a slim jim. Which is what will happen to Pretty Ricky in a battle with the Macho Man. Ooooh yea!!! So Pretty Ricky, if you're listening, STEP UP! Be a man!! I dare you to take it to the streets with Randy, straight up. Then we'll see who's the man.

To be fair this cd isnt horrible but its way below average. I heard this cd in a friends car. It sounds like a mixture between HTown and Bone....but in a bad way. They rap and sing but they dont do either particularly well. They need to find one thing and do it well. Its kind of lame to try to rap like your hard and then harmonize like Backstreet Boyz. This cd has a couple of songs with nice beats and thats it. I would give it 1 and a half stars if I could. The best song is the single Grind with Me (which aint that good to begin with)"},{"rating":"1","title":"fake ass crap","review":"Hey, what's this with all these 5 star reviews. This cd is crap. I sampled this at the music store and these guys suck. They have just given me reason to hate blue which happens to be my favorite color. They all look a little queer on the cover of this trash too. These mini Twista wannabes can't decide if they are singing Rand B or rapping. what is this? I know ladies are fine and all and nothing beats making love to your woman but I can't seriously put this on to get my girl in the mood. This is sucky crap with no substance. These guys are one hit wonders with their ole gringdin song and don't believe the hype. They seem to me to be the B2K of 2005 and y'all know hat happened to that boy group.

The book I have was a Sillohette published in 1990, and it's OLD, that's the cover I have. Oh, and I just have to mention that even though it's written in 1990, it's not too dated for a contemporary. The story of Madelyn's brother is told in Loving Evangeline, which I'll eventually check out. I'm slowly working... no savoring... my way through all of her books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Condition","review":"The book was in great condition as advertised and arrived promptly as promised. I read it in one night."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book :)","review":"I loved this book and it's definitely a keeper. Not a long story but soooooooo worthy your time.This is about a strong man (the typical Alpha male indeed) who is in need of a wife and finds one by placing an ad. He was scarred by a nasty divorce that left him broke and absolutely disillusioned by the matrimony itself but he wants a family and heirs for his ranch. And there she comes, a lovely city girl who will help him look at life with new eyes. Although Reese is abusive at times, you can't deny that he cared for Madelyn very much and since the very beginning, although he wouldn't admit it and not even to himself. The part where she risks hypothermia was very romantic and I loved how she proved all through the story that she was a good wife, in spite of his initial doubts.I do recommend this book because it has it all: a sexy hero, a very sweet and determined heroine and a solid plot that's very engaging and fast paced. The steamy bits add a great deal, too! ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite, wish was was in kindle","review":"This was a good purchase, fast shipper and am glad that I purchased, but should not have to write so many words"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read..couldn't put it down!","review":"This book has a modern day mail order bride theme to it. As I don't usually read modern romances what attracted me to the characters Madelyn and Reese was that they were instantly attracted to each other and each had a spunky personality. Each had quite a temper and she stood up to him. Reading the intense give and take between the two made you realize that the time period didn't matter. Ranch life in Montana was explored with all the difficulties. It was a quick read and one that will bring much enjoyment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read that takes the place of a good man","review":"This book is one you cannot put down.

Cascade Point by Timothy Zahn won a Hugo Award, and Hardfought won a Nebula Award. Both stories are novellas which is good for pace and keeps the reader interested enough to finish each story in one sitting. Cascade Point is the better of the two stories. It was an inkling of the great future novels to come from Zahn. However, I got the impression that Hardfought was a story that never made it to full novel status"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as other books of NMS series!","review":"After reading NMS surgery , i really trusted NMS series as review book for boards and end of clinical rotation exam. During my pediatrics rotaion i bought NMS pediatrics and start to notice the differences between the books of this series. But when i read NMS Medicine, i felt like reading newspaper about medicine! it is very boring and dry. It is not usfull (at all!!) for your medicine rotation since it doesn't give you management plan. The heamatolgy and neurology chapters are the worse, but i should say that it contains good respiratory diseases chapter. At the beginning of each chapter, there is introduction about history taking and clinical examination, which i used to skip when i satart to read any chapter! because it is wasting of time, it does not inculde the important points. For board review i suggest you to search for another book!What i understand after i read this book is that the author is very talkative and boring!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A book with a peculiar style","review":"NMS Medicine is a book which has its own peculiar style that is a reflection of some of the other NMS books as well.

This NMS book provides list after list of information about just about every topic in internal medicine, but does little to clarify what information is most appropriate. For example, in approaching a patient with an apparent GI ulcer, the book lists out all the diagnostic options without prioritizing them. Knowing what the best first-step is (or best next-step, as the case may be) is the key to providing rationale medical care - and to answering shelf exam questions. This book provides way too much info without much guidance as to how to use it. Not good for medical students in need of experience-based guidance.

It is so elementary that only a five year old would think it is advanced. It spends pages focusing on miniscule and practically useless attributes (such as announcers), rather than the important and meaningful ones (such as dual pronouns, and the o-class and a-class possession). Although it does touch on most elements of the language, it is very vague on every subject.The worst part of all is that it over-complicates grammar. For instance, Wight spends chapters explaining how to structure phrases, all of which I could completely summarize in a single sentence. Then it provides merely one vague sentence to explain a concept that should take several pages to relate. Except for the vocabulary, this book is just like taking a memo-note and stretching it into an entire novel.Using this book as a foundation only got me more confused.

Years ago I did purchase (by mail, sight unseen), a copy of the \\"Strom Classic Toys\\" that was published in 1983. I was royally offended to find that that 96 page book included 56 pages of a wordy and drawn-out kid's story that my own kids (who love books) never once sat through, and pictures of 28 individual toys and a marina complex of boats, docks, etc. There were, however, plans for only 6 of the individual toys, and only about half of the simplistic marina designs. The rest were listed as plans for sale; the whole thing felt more like a catalog than a book about building toys... This volume continues that format, with a larger proportion of plans included(20/35), but those are less than complete.

There are no details on how to actually construct the toy.

You must give him props for creativity and taking rap to that next level. New world is my opinion the type of song that literally no other rapper could make, his insight, his poetry, his balance of hard core and commercial make this album great.

At this time, two of my favorite MC's (Nas and Jay-Z) had completely lost their minds and direction with this music sh**. I loved his first two albums, but \\"I Am\\" in my opinion was too much of a mixed bag of songs and then this! Honestly, Nas might as well of had a cheerleader outfit on yelling \\"Go Ginuwine Go\\" on the second single. Thankfully, hot guest spots on The Wu and Capone-N-Noreaga helped restore some of my faith in him. By now, you know Nas has come full circle and is on top of his game again.

Nas's sound has got more poppier than his old NY gangsta roots he established with 'Illmatic' ('Nastradamus', 'You Owe Me') but he still manages to come through with some of those old street tales ('Family' f/Mobb Deep, 'Quiet Niggas'). 'Shoot 'em Up' is a very impressive track and is easily a contender for best song on the album. My favourites are 'God Love Us', 'Come Get Me', 'Life We Chose', 'Shoot 'em Up' and his interesting turn on 'Some Of Us Have Angels'. it was interesting to see the other side of Nas as this album is basically a forefront to the millenium/apocalypse in his own words. There you have it, Nas's latest CD, 'Nastradamus'. Not really any bad tracks (perhaps except 'Project Windows', way too slow and a whacked-out beat) and actually a very good CD, it will not at all dissappoint you dedicated Nas fans out there, no matter what you've been told.

But the Havoc produced track Shoot'em up is incredible...I'm a huge Nas fan, but this album is filled with songs that can be read radio friendly...(i.e. You Owe Me and Nastradamus) Both are good songs but don't add anything to an album that lacks the intensity as it's predecessors.>Oh yeah, and to set the record straight, Nas came out with this album so quick because he had some songs from I am... left over. You can blame cut throat bootleggers for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nas - Nastradamus","review":"This CD is raw, but it could be better. With all of the fantastic producers on this album, I would think that the beats would be better then they are. Dame Grease lays down some phat tracks on \\"Some of Us Have Angels\\", \\"Family\\", and \\"Quiet Niggas\\". Mobb Deep make a big difference in this album.

Nas does not hide behind guest appearances by other rappers to boost interest, nor does he stray away from the topics that got him to the status he is currently in in the industry.

Of course he's not the old Nasty, but the one we have isn't that bad either.

There are 5 tracks on this record that I find worthy of listening to. \\"Quiet Ni**as\\" is my favorite track cause it's something I agree with Nas about. A few songs have good rapping but nothing else.Negative: Beats sometimes lacking. Choruses seriously lacking. \\"Life We Chose\\" sounds like Nas isn't quite with the beat. \\"Nastradamus\\" is so \\"Made-For-MTV\\" that's it hurts. It surprises me how pretty good rappers continue to try to attract Backstreet Boy fans by \\"selling out\\". The track \\"Big Girl\\" is so bad/comical it could be on Adam Sandler's next CD. The beat for \\"New World\\" is another comical experience for the true hip-hop fan. I heard he made this 7 months after \\"I am\\". He should have waited a little longer.

Basically, Primo is good but chops up his music using heavy drums and his trademark scratches, which makes his music sound the same. And Timbaland's music is really R&B, very simplistic skippy beats which also sounds the same which is apparent on \\"You owe me\\". It sounds like that beat he did for Missy Elloit. And Dame Grease, this is not a DMX album it's a Nas album. Nas and Havoc work good together. My prediction for a great Nas cd productionwise is RZA, Havoc, L.E.S., and Primo. But stay away from the Wackmasters, and then we have another classic. Lyrically, Nas wasn't complex on this one either. Like on Cuban Linx's \\"Verbal intercourse\\", he displays the Nasty in Nas.

For an MC who wishes to be compared to the greatest rappers of all time like Rakim, KRS, JayZ, and Biggie this is a POOR effort which mandated that I call my fellow collectors and STRONGLY advise that they do not buy it and either purchase the Method Man/Redman project or wait for Q-Tip's release next week. The only saving grace is that my local music store has a policy whereby on Tuesdays I can return Nastradamus and Aaron Hall's \\"Inside of You\\" (don't get me started with that one) for something worth listening to."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWWWW MAN...

I feel horrible saying this but it is the worst album of 1999. I am i felt was not up to par either. It was written was lyrically a good album but the beats were wack. The beats for I am were excellent but the lyrics were bad. No both beats and lyrics are terrible. Songs such as some of us have angels and the bravehearts track are horrible. New World and The life we chose are the best songs on the album but even songs like dr knockboot on the I am album are better. Nas has to do alot better if he wants to survive in the next few years"},{"rating":"1","title":"why did he change the tracks","review":"How did Nas change so much? From a debut that is faultless to this rubish. Artists usauly advance thier lyrics over the years but Nas has actually gone backwards with each release. The original version of Nastradamus was very good and easily his best album since Illmatic, but only Project Windows remains on the retail version. The brillant Among Kings,Poppa was a Playa,Drunk by Myself,Blaze a 50 and Day Dreamin have been replaced with rubish like Big Girl and You Owe me. There are a couple of good tracks like God love us,Come get me and of course Project windows. This album will survive a few listens but will soon sit in your collection and gather dust with I am and It was written. Remember when we said Nas was the new Rakim... well we all apologise to Rakim.

His has respect from all sides of this bissness, when he drops an album, since Illmatic it gets respect.This album is terrible! It has no sense of style, nothing that his past cds illustrated. No great songs, Kill Em All, stand out; barely. If youre a big fan of Nas buy this, but I'll warn you, it might depress you, its truly terrible. If you just want to hear true greatness get your hands on Illmatic- What the critics say is true and more- Its amazing. This album is so far below any quality standards he has. Its almost as bad as Puff Daddy, PE2000- thats a terrible album- this marks the continued commericialization of this artist and of the industry.Its commerical, its terrible.

That's what he tried to do on this album. Most of the album was fillers, with a few pretty good songs. Nas' lyrics aren't bad, but on most of the songs he's very braggadocio and I don't enjoy the message he conveys.My favorite tracks: 1. Project Windows 2. Some of Us Have Angels 3.

The characters were shallow and typical, the dialogue was a bunch of useless bantering and the plot was predicatable.

The heroine is an insult to women everywhere; she is ditsy, easily manipiulated, taken advantage of sexually by every male she meets... I could go on and on. The main problem though is that she would have been dead after the first few hours if this plot had any credulity to it. In fact, I knew the book would be a tired plot as soon as she witnesses a gruesom murder and does nothing to report it, but rather goes back to her hotel room to take a bath - PLEASE.Do not waste your time & money - move on to something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah well...","review":"It is true, \\"Sphinx\\" is an enjoyable book. It is a quick read and Cook obviously took great care to portray ancient Egypt correctly. Only cynics would say he lets some of his books take place where he had his last vacation. Anyway, opening the story by letting it start during the time of the construction of the pyramids themselves was a great idea.Now to the bad point, which reoccurs in just about all of Cook's novels: coincidences. How plausible is it that our main protagonist, an egyptologist, gets lost in Cairo, stumbles into an antiques store which just at that time has a golden statue of Seti I, whose value is so high it is undeterminable, in its back room and whose owner gets assassinated for having the statue just as our brave egyptologist is at the place? I bet Cook could have come up with something better to get the otherwise nice plot together at the beginning.But again, \\"Sphinx\\" is an enjoyable book and far above some of the other works Cook publishes nowadays."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Country Gentleman","review":"Bobby Bare made his way into the music scene almost by accident .

The singer really is pretty good, there are a couple tracks that you wish Alice Cooper was on, but he actually isn't all that missed. and this album is better then most of Alice's solo work after Nightmare. This was actually made to be the Farewell album for the Alice Cooper Group, but after Nightmare Alice decided he didn't want to go back to the group so they made it without him.as for the extra discs, they are worth having if your a big enough fan to buy this in the first place. the Live disc has poor quality sound, but still a good disc.Buy this if Pretties for you through Muscle of Love has never been enough Alice Cooper group for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"ripped off","review":"As it turns out, according to Neal Smith's web site this collection is pirated and the band wasn't compensated(with one exception).

The main flaw with this book, which is strange for a geometry text, is that it is not logically structured. A book on plane geometry should start with a numbered list of all the definitions, common notions, and postulates. From there it should go in sequence from the simplest to more complex theorems, one building on the other. The proofs should then refer to these numbered principles.The author does not do any of this, instead he scatters the basic concepts all over the place. In addition many of the exercises are simple minded.My advice is to go back to the original: \\"Euclid's Elements\\" as translated by Thomas Heath. This is truly the most outstanding work of Western Civilization. It is far superior to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting","review":"Ostrowski, following Halperin, has some interesting theories on the formation of the Russian state. The title is misleading, though--Muscovy, according to Ostrowski, doesn't seem to have influence anyone so it is hardly \\"cross cultural.\\" He should have come up with a different title or found more cases of Russian influence.Many of his ideas should be debated and I plan on doing further research. The only thing I find fault with is that he could have included comparative studies on Mongol influence elsewhere, but perhaps he is saving that for the next volume.He also doesn't discuss in details the many other nomadic peoples of the steppe who influence, and were influenced by, the Russians and the Mongols. One final thing he could have included is more discussion of the early Russian state and political institutions. It was more complex than he allows for and this neglect of his makes the state building of the Mongols seem slightly greater than it was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Potential, no actualization.","review":"Ostrowski has the potential to write great, readable history. Unfortunately that's all this book shows. This book uses too many references to far to little good. Some chapters (about 20 pages each) have in excess of one hundred references; often there are pages where there are more footnotes than general text. This just exacerbates his problem with spending several pages talking about what other historians say, and then one or two saying his piece. On the plus side his prose if very clear and to the point when he finally wanders into one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"After months of searching for the perfect chandelier, we decided on this one from Thomas Lighting.

Circuit analysis for engineers, as an introduction to practical circuit design, is not Electrodynamics. You neither expect nor want Calculus or derivation of equations. You want and need rough and ready formulae and rules of thumb for practical analysis. This book provides them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book was simply wonderful.

I don't get how people can read this ugly stuff"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite of all time!","review":"I read this book July 10, 1993 on a beach in Eastern Michigan and have yet to find its equal. Seven friends also read it and we compaired notes as to if WE would have let Meade in the house, it led to heated discussions. Now in December, '98 we wonder when Michael will thrill us again? Deceptions didn't dissappoint! Have ordered Lies and have hopes for another great thriller. WE LOVE MICHAEL WEAVER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good enough to wear all day!","review":"Love em' the heel with platform make boot/shoe feel just right. Only one draw back you tend to get a greyish rim around the leg where the boot ends. But the look is awesome and the boots fit and feel comfortable. And the price? sheesh! buy em' OH, they tend to run a little on the big size. I usually wear 8.5 and these leave a ittle room. Would I of gone for an 8? I don't know I don't like my boots too snug either. So in the end I was ok with the fit. $20!! yipppeee"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOT a 4\\" heel but surprisingly comfortable!","review":"First of all the back of the heel measures 4.3/4\\" and the description states a 4\\" heel. I have NEVER EVER purchased anything near a 5\\" heel and would not have done so had they been described correctly. ...HOWEVER, I have had these on my wishlist for sometime now and decided to go ahead and treat myself to this cute bootie & I'm so glad I did! They are SO tall! ..but even so, they are really well made and the arch is a perfect fit. The straps around the ankle are designed to be tightened so they are more of a custom fit however now there is more left-over dangling strap than I need - so I think I may cut off the excess strap later on. I can't say enough about how cute they are. (I ordered the mushroom to match a handbag) and the color isn't going to wow anyone but the style and comfort surely will! One of my best purchases to date!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love this curtain","review":"I enjoy looking at this curtain because of the wonderful memories it evokes.

LOVE SOMEBODY, WALK AWAY, and BOP TIL YOU DROP are no doubt classic hits (particularly I love Bop Til You Drop). TAXI DANCING ended up with a minor hit eclipsed ironically by the re-release of Beautiful Feeling is a nice duet. STAND UP is really exciting live track somewhat like that of Heuy Lewis and Eddie and the Cruisers. Peter Gabriel's I'm Not Swimming is so so track. Recommended for Rick fans old and new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!!","review":"This album only has a few good songs on it. Half of the songs are really bad and they have the audacity to charge $42.98 for it? I'm glad I bought my copy at a pawn shop for $3.00.

Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT Buy the Cassette!!!","review":"I loved the book truly and madly so I purchased the audio cassette for my car. The prologue is read by Howard himself and its wonderful. THEN, the actor comes on.... Do any of you remember the voice of the man who did all of the narrations in 1960-1970 middle school science films? Well HE'S BACK!!! Monotone and uninspiring to say the least. Read the book but save the $15 and dont buy the audio book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something inspirational here!","review":"I found this audio cassette to be very interesting. Howard Schultz transformed this company from a small time coffee shop secluded in the Northwest corner of our country, into a world wide business allowing us to start our day with a fresh cup of coffee from virtually any location. Howard's sheer determination is motivation to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"This was a fantastic book!! It was also very inspiring and motivational. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"Half way through this book I was inspired to buy my first cup of Starbucks coffee... two weeks later I had quit a better paying job to work as a barista for Starbucks... I eventually had to move on, but the two years that I spent working for Starbucks were some of the best years (in respect to employment) of my life. I love this company, and have a great respect for Howard Schults. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved and Learned From This Book","review":"There was so much to learn about Starbucks itself. So, just the story of its evolution was interesting.But the story itself is inspiring, the author is brutally honest about his mistakes, near misses and even his struggles with his own ego. (I love the story about how he didn't want skim milk to be available, because it wasn't \\"pure.\\")There is so much to learn from this manager. I was inspired by the way he empowered his staff and love the way he moves up his own people. A company that offers health insurance to their part-time employees, it is such a different way of management.I love this book. I have a deeper appreciation for corporate growth and a good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I love Starbucks and I was interested in seeing how it came to be, but this book is more of a masturbatory celebration of Schultz's personal accomplishments than a book about how the business was built. I'm halfway through it and not sure I'll ever have the wherewithal to finish it. I will, however, continue to enjoy his coffee."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the price of 3 mochaccinos!","review":"Howard Schultz's narrative of the Starbucks story is fascinating and strikes an emotional cord on several occasions such as when he learns about his dad's cancer and when he almost lost Starbucks to a private investor.Though he seldom talks about most business issues in depth, he conveys that Starbucks success is because of his ability to successfully deal with people and sell them his dream.He is no coffee purveyor (he leaves that to Alfred Peet of Peet's Coffee and Tea and the original Starbucks Owners), but is an entreprenuer who saw a business opportunity and passionately pursued it...very much like Jeff Bezos (Amazon.com: Get Big Fast by Robert Spector). Btw, his childhood experiences are eerily similar to that of Sumner Redstone (Autobiography: A Passion To Win).Bottom line: a lively read and inspirational to entrepreneurs or otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy reading, entertaining, even inspirational...","review":"For anybody that has experienced rapid company growth, this book has a number of entertaining and useful lessons.Few CEOs are able to manage a company from inception to the size of Starbucks with so few bumps along the way. Howard seems to have achieved this with Starbucks.He positions Starbucks as not abandoning its core values, depicting the struggle involved in defending them. It may be argued that Starbucks has not always succeeded at this, but easily more so than other coffee chains.Definitely a worthwhile read, but not a book that I'd reread."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entrepreneur who teachs how to be a complete leader.","review":"Living in a country which is the biggest coffee producer in the world, I do admire Howard Schultz because of his vision as an entrepreneur. It was impossible, fifteen years ago, to predict this tremendous chain of coffee stores in a country where we used to have problems to find an expresso to drink. The book tells a fascinating story of a man who is, simultaneously, a strategic, inspirational, coach and technical leader. His understanding of the importance of employee's commitment (and the reasons behind it) is a model for any manager."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but is it true","review":"I found the book, relevant, inspiring, interesting and easy to read. So much so that I attempted to follow his advise and make contact with H. Schults to appoint him as my mentor. After numerous attempts to contact him without a single reply I am now of the opinion that his sucess came first then came the great phiolanthropic ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wake Up Call","review":"This book will awaken the hidden passion within. It shows what you can do if you are passionate about something. Quick read and a page turner every step of the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspiring book","review":"I read many company books. This is one of the gems. Howard did a fantastic job in writing the history of Starbucks, its root, its spirit, and its amazing achievement.There have been many coffee vendors. Starbucks sprinted from the pack. It actually revolutionized the coffee industry. While the business world has been looking for the next new hi-tech inventions, Howard creatively rejuvenated the coffee drinks by relentlessly pursuing the quality the culture and the experience. He did the mission-impossible in such a traditional industry. After reading this book, you will never look at Starbucks the same way. Yes, you realize that passion and quality can make a huge difference in this crowded world."},{"rating":"1","title":"Walk across the bridge, Howard!","review":"It's amazing to me that Howard grew up in Brooklyn yet claims that the day the first cup of espresso was served in Seattle in the early 80's was the first time Americans ever tasted Italian espresso. Now why do you suppose he never walked across the Brooklyn Bridge to Little Italy to stop in at any number of the old cafes that have espresso bars? I grew up in the Boston area and moved there in 1975 and then to the North End, the Italian section, and weekly stopped in at the decades-old Cafe Vittoria on Hanover Street for cappuccino and moccacino...long before Howard Schultz got his hands on Starbucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"egomania and bad coffee","review":"A foolish, self-indulgent self-promotion, filled with cliches and boring details about the history of one man's successful effort to sell coffee made from low quality, burned coffee beans at exhorbitant prices. Astonishing primarily for its gall-- presenting the founder as a man of vision and commitment to social values-- while his real achievement is packaging inferior merchandise and pushing it without mercy on an unsophiticated market."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE CUP AT A TIME OR ONE STORE AT A TIME","review":"I found this book informative and helpful from a business point of view. Although Schultz mentions here and there about his passion for \\"coffee\\", I don't believe it. Just because he has passion for coffee doesn't mean that a new Starbucks has to open daily. I recommend this book for the entrepeneurs and business owners. Schultz' ego is amplified throughout the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Cannot see why this book received so many stars from the readers...especially when considering Starbuck's losing its core thesedays...It's not anymore just about coffee... It's about making successful business model...and there's happen to be a coffe story...This book itself could be inspirational for people who are in need of self-help book, but cannot expect anything like \\"seeing Starbucks in a whole new way after reading it\\"...in my opinion...Plus, from my experiences of living many yrs in different cities around the world I hope that Starbuck could care a little more about its international branch management...in terms of quality of its product and service..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, nothing inspirational here","review":"I read all kinds of books and try to be open minded about what I expect from them. This was like drinking weak tea and barely kept my attention. The author never told me what forces were at work inside him, what drove him, what scared him, what motivated him. What should I have gained from this? Superficial..save your money...sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, nothing inspirational here in the cassette","review":"I read all kinds of books and try to be open minded about what I expect from them.

Howard S. has done a great job in documenting his early struggle, his passion, his determination to succeed, his persistence to go chase his dream, the risks he took in the growth of Starbucks, his constant need to reninvent the company.He has done a good job at it and it lays down the lessons that any aspiring entrepreneur in such a simple manner that you can get so much from it. It warns about the risks from transitioning from a small company to a national band and from a private organization to a public company.I found the book very interesting to read and would recommend it highly. Waiting for the second book he wrote.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pour your heart into it: How Starbucks Built .......","review":"Very inspiring for those who start out in life less privileged than others. A very down to earth style that even us Brits can relate to. An excellent read and a real inspiration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Working at Starbucks","review":"This is an interesting read if looked at as a fictional account of business. As a frustrated Starbucks employee, there are many an urban legend about how great we are supposed to be treated. Howard should go to work as a barista in one of his own stores, have customers insult him, throw drinks back at him and do all of the cleaning chores expected of the people making him his millions. As for the \\"One Drink at a Time\\", I wish that were true. We are expected to whip out drinks within mere seconds of them being ordered. Don't believe all the gospel of Howard. It ain't all that he thinks it is cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the book, stick to the coffee","review":"Very colorful descriptions about coffee, passion, persistance and fate. I expected to read a respectable minibiography about the details of the business not a romantic novel about the author's love for coffee and people. It's a marketing and PR tool. Why else would he write a book so early in his career? Starbucks' story can be told in 10 pages, yet this book streches is out with many pages of coffee love stories. I wish the author hadn't written a book so early in Starbucks' life and saved the story for a better more interesting book. 1 star because marketing works, and it worked on everyone who gave this book a positive review. Don't buy it and refuse it if given for free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful inspiration, remarkable story!","review":"Howard Schultz offers the details from the early days of Starbucks, over 25 years ago. The story begins with Howard's ambitions for working for the small bean company, and takes you through every phase of the business development. You will read about the first stores, the competition, the rapid growth, even the invention of the Frappuccino. This story is compulsively readable and full of inspiration, honesty and wisdom. You will also come to admire Starbucks the company. I am keeping my copy of this book on a shelf to refer to often when I need a reminder that anything is possible as long as you have a vision!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read Over Coffee","review":"Schultz has provided a recap of his life events, those of Starbucks and the factors that influenced him and Starbucks that makes them what they are today. After reading you have an appreciation for how a person can maintain his integrity and build an organization that is based on concern for employees, customers and quality of product. For anyone who is looking for encouragement or suggestions on how to improve themselves or thoughts for maintaining or improving their company this is an excellent read. You will come away with an appreciate for the Starbuck organization and realize that it is more than a \\"Good Cup of Coffee\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indispensable!","review":"Even though I am not an English native speaker, I can understand it thoroughly. The author's style is simple and easy to understand. The book explains how Howard Schultz built his world-renowned coffee company step-by-step, over a decade. I highly recommend this book not only for one who is interested in business, but for all you guys out there! This book is the incomparable!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and enjoyable to read.","review":"It is obvious that the author pours his heart into this book as much as into the company he helped to launch into the national mind. This was a relaxing, enjoyable read that provides some insight into good leadership skills. The quotes at the beginning of each chapter were as rewarding as the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"This is the biggest piece of self-serving garbage that I've ever read. Howard Schultz loves to pat himself on the back for being so enlightened, but his PR myth is falling apart. Maybe he'll write a sequel about the many \\"partners\\" that he threw under the bus when the going got tough. Until he does, let's just classify this book as a piece of fiction, and a bad piece of fiction at that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for entreprenuer wannabe","review":"I loved his passion and the story of how starbucks grew and growing. Impressive and heartwarming book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of Starbucks may be as good as their coffee","review":"Starbucks, it seems as if there is one on every corner. So I had to find out why, why are there so many Starbucks, why is it so popular. Well after reading this it seems to because of its founder Howard Shultz. He gives away his secret, hard work. It is a very inspiring story, although I do feel he is a little bit over driven. But he certainly does deserve all the success he gets. The real reason I read this book is because my son and daughter-in-law work at a Starbucks. I wanted to know what kind of company Starbucks was. Well I found out it is well run and seems to me to have an unlimited future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring Biography!","review":"The book throws light on the business model of the ubiquituous Starbucks.It takes you on an inspiring journey of a man - someone who gave birth to a great company, despite all the bumps along the road, and catapulted it to an extraordinary company. If you have an entrepreunerial bone in your body, or are a Coffee snoot, or simply like inspiring biographies, then you cannot let this book pass you by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coffee Lovers and Seattlelites educate yourselves!","review":"Starbucks is by far the largest specialty coffee chain in the world. If you're like me and you wonder how companies like this got to this point then this book will tell you exactly that. I have known of the Starbucks name since I was young and never knew where it came from or the journey the company took to get to this point. I was thoroughly interested in this book from start to end it is well written and easy to read. Howard's passion for coffee is unwavering and cannot be matched by any other person. It puts a CEO/owners ideas and passions into a relate-able story. Often we think of these executives as overly-paid, lazy, and deceitful but I can honestly say that my views of Howard are only positive. He loves his company, loves coffee, and loves providing the public with coffee that he takes great pride in. A great read and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done.","review":"This book was a great read and well worth the time. Being a small business owner it is nice to know how the really big ones got there. This book goes into details about how to keep a big business focused by always attending to the little things. It was a great inspiration I plan on using of my business in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Starbucks!","review":"I have a Starbucks Gold Card and am a frequent flyer at the 24/7 drive-through near Coney Island in Brooklyn,NY. I was thrilled at the opportunity to read this book about the origin of Starbucks by the man behind it. All the sophistication of the Starbucks approach was explained and I have more appreciation now for every cup. It's no wonder that they far exceed their competitors! This book is a truly interesting read about the evolution of SB from humble beginnings in the Seattle area to worldwide domination, as well as a model for other businesses to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good company history","review":"I found reading about the history of Starbucks very interesting, I thought he could have told the story in a shorter version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty pictures, great gift","review":"This Dover little Book has ten pictures of the delicate creatures.

Am thinking maybe he should not bite the hand that feeds him!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My funny valentine . ..","review":"This is a really masterfull compilation by Gabriel Yared and Co. I had been listening to the 'City Of Angels' (not saying that I enjoyed that movie) disk he did and found it impressive enough to seek this out. Introduction to the Guy Barker International Quintet is a definite plus. That's the definite upside to soundtracks, they force stuff on you that you normally wouldn't seek out. There's some great Jazz for late evenings and Sunday mornings. Dizzy's \\"Champ\\", Charlie Parker's \\"Ko-Ko\\" and Marino Marini's \\"Guaglione\\". My wife couldn't stop listening to the last one. The Most impressive though was Gabriel Yared's compositions that enhanced the movie, unlike some compositions that just put you to sleep. Well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review For Ripley","review":"The movie was wonderful but the music is FABULOUS! With Matt and Jude at lead vocals for 2 songs, an impressive return for Sinead O'Conner, laid back and swinging Jazz and traditional Italian Music, you just can't miss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tu Vuo' Fa l'Americano","review":"Great soundtrack. Mix of jazz and Gabriel Yared's score music. Featuring giants of bop and jazz music: Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Guy Barker. But there's no Chet Baker. Instead of him there's Chet-wanna-be version of My Funny Valentine performed by Matt Damon & Guy Barker International Quintet. Tu Vuo' Fa l'Americano is performed by Matt Damon, Jude Law, Fiorello & Guy Barker International Quintet. Recorded a year before Brian Setzer Orchestra's version!! Gabriel Yared's score is beautiful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely mix of jazz and mood music","review":"Very lovely soundtrack, though it didn't quite exceed the standards set by The English Patient, perhaps because this isn't a big romance piece. The reviewer valiant wanted to know the aria used in the trailer; it's Dido's famous air \\"When I am laid\\" - not quite what it means now, from Purcell's Dido and Aeneas. A rhythmic bass is added, and I haven't been able to locate this \\"mix\\" anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Soundtrack!","review":"The book was great, the movie was pretty good...the soundtrack is excellent! Lots of emotion, especially evocative of the time in which the story is set. A wonderful listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infused with Talent","review":"My main motivation for purchasing this album was to listen to the undeniably uplifting 'Tu Vuo' Fa L'Americano', and Matt Damon's impressive impersonation of Chet Baker with 'My Funny Valentine'. Both songs encompassed all that is great about jazz, as do several other songs presnt on the album. An added bonus was the fact that several pieces of score, composed by Gabriel Yared, also featured. I was first introduced to Yared on the 'City of Angels' OST, where his heart-wrenching and dreamily classical pieces of music saved the poor narrative of the actual film. On Ripley, the film is in no need of saving, but Yared's haunting contributions do add an essential intensity to it. Equally haunting is 'Lullaby for Cain', performed by Sinead O'Connor, who once again proves she is as talented as Mr. Ripley himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stabat Mater","review":"Get this cd just for 'Stabat Mater\\". It is one of the best songs ever written, and I don't believe you can get a better performance of it on another cd.bless you.wa"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-chosen music that completes the film.","review":"I am very happy with this soundtrack, except that \\"Tu Vuo'Fa L'Americano\\" could have had a better sound quality. \\"My Funny Valentine\\" is done well by Matt Damon. Gabriel Yared's score is outstanding and suitable once again. All in all, a good soundtrack!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CD rates a rave; Gabriel Yared rates a pan","review":"I had heard this CD at a friend's house and came to Amazon.com to buy it. However, after reading Gabriel Yared's opinion of his listeners, I'll take a pass on buying the CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this film score!!!","review":"This film score was perfectly composed and arranged to follow the story of The Talented Mr. Ripley. If you enjoy film scores/soundtracks I would definitely recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful and practical conversation piece!","review":"I hate to carry a handbag so when I was searching for a tiny shoulder bag and came across this lovely bag I thought I would give it a try. It is my most used and loved accessory! It is totally perfect for any cell phone but I find it most useful to stash my little camera in at all kinds of events! I have even \\"worn\\" it to a couple of weddings, yet it is right at home with jeans. You can even manage to slip in a credit card and your drivers license if you want! (don't mis-understand... it is a cell phone bag... not a purse, and it IS small!)I have received too many compliments on this piece of eye-candy to count! I used my first one for more than a year until a friend begged for it so much that I ordered two more, gave her one and kept the second as a spare... but that was soon begged away as well!So now I am placing my third order for a total of five of these bags and I will continue to get them to give as gifts as long as they are available!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Legend of 70s Country Rock","review":"Every genre has its Must-Have classics, and this album should be near the top of the list for Country Rock fans. Country Rock helped define the fabulous 70s music scene, and I can think of no better representative of the era than Poco's Cantamos.I'm proud to say I bought the album (as in vinyl) when it was originally released, and have since replaced it several times, with cassette, then another LP, and now finally CD. It's one that I plan to -always- own, in one format or another. It sounds as fantastic today as it did 35 years ago. Amazing.For true Country Rock fans, here's something else to hunt for: the two (and only two) albums by a group called Navarro -- \\"Listen\\" and \\"Straight to the Heart.\\" Rare gems."},{"rating":"2","title":"I remember Poco","review":"I remember when I purchased this as an LP a very long time ago. In those days I had almost everything published by those bands who had a \\"Western\\" sound, and even though times and tastes have changed I still enjoy them. This will be the last CD I buy, however; there are a couple of tracks that still cook the beans, but I think I'd have been better advised to get the downloads. Oh, wait ... I was unable to find anything from this album as a download. I guess that explains it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgiveness","review":"This book was a very exciting book; just when you thought all is well then there was something new to pop up. The four girls were more than friends they were each others strength. When one thought she couldn't make it, the others was there to let her know that she could and they had there support in doing it. Parts of the book I feel could have been left out, but the story line of the book was good. It gets you thinking about you life and reevaluating your relationships with your loved ones. It also shows what happens when you don't take responsibilities for you actions."},{"rating":"2","title":"I REALLY ENJOYED THIS BOOK","review":"THIS BOOK WAS AWESOME. I HAD NO IDEA THAT A LOT OF LADIES ARE STANDIND IN LINE AT A PRISON TO SEE THEIR HUSBANDS OR BOYFRIEND. THIS BOOK REALLY TOOK ME FOR A LOOP. I ENJOYED IT FROM THE BEGINNING TO END. THE SEQUEL IS GOOD ALSO."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?","review":"LADIES IN WAITING is the compelling story of four very different women from diverse lifestyles and backgrounds, all waiting for their men to get out of prison. These women, a preacher's wife, a stockbroker's wife, a baby mama, and a single cutie, meet, share their stories and their friendship. Each is able to learn and glean from the others. The book illustrates them making horrendous sacrifices just to make their weekly visit to see the brother, spend some time with him and (in some cases) give him their hard earned money for his necessities. LAIDIES IN WATING also displays a view from within the prison, one with physical violence and sexual abuse. It goes even further to show how inmates fake caring in relationships, run scams and control the women. This is an interesting and very believable book. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Emotional Journy of an American Hero","review":"I have one word to describe James Brooks. Hero. This book is an excellant portrayal of what our soldiers went through in the second World War. The words on the page are gripping and they can't even start to tell us what these men went through. It is amazing to see the bonds these men had for one another. Throughout the book, I pictured myself right beside Mr. Brooks. There is no other person that I would rather be next to if I was in this situation. He is an American Hero!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless piece of junk!","review":"I bought 2 new Audiovox VBP700 DVD players for our kids to use during vacation trips. The units were always handled with care and played indoors. They were never abused or mishandled. After several hours of use the first unit stopped working. The disc would spin but no video displayed. I exchanged this unit 2 weeks after purchase for a new one. The second original DVD player broke in similar fashion approximately 1 week after the 90 day warranty expired. The exchanged player (#3) broke 11 months after purchase with only 15-20 hours of play time.I will never buy another Audiovox product based on my experience with these DVD players."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all","review":"I think the best part of this player is the FM modulator.

I found it to be very informative as I had not heard of the new contemperary methods of induction. The book is written well and there are a lot of helpful references to relevent work. I liked this book as it was tied together professionally and wasn't just a collection of trance-scripts.Since I've read this book I have sucessfully hypnotized 3 of 4 attempts. The only thing missing was a pointer to a book that one could use for further self-learing about hypnosis."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand the raves about this flick. It was lame and too predictable","review":"I just watched it last night on cable so I'm not mad about paying for it. I just wanted to put my two cents in since it's getting 4 & 1/2 stars here. I knew the ending of this movie within the first five minutes as most people will. All I can think is that maybe when it came out this was the first one with this kind of ending. I love 70's chillers and absolutely love horror movies so I was expecting to enjoy this. I was wrong. It was not eerie, scary, thrilling, chilling or surprising at all. I gave it 2 (more like 1 & 1/2) stars just because it held my interest although I almost dozed off a few times. I hope I saved someone some cash haha."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVERHYPED!","review":"After reading all these reviews I decided to pick it up and after viewing this overhyped piece of junk I regret buying it. This movie was not suspensful at all or scary, It was like watching a bad 70's after school special. The ending was predictible from very early on. I just don't understand why a lot of people give this movie 5 stars and I've seen it on a lot of peoples list of best horror movies of all-time and trust me, you will be dissapointed, it's not that good so save your cash."},{"rating":"2","title":"disturbing !!!","review":"Okay I remember seeing this movie while browsing the horror section a long time ago and not really thinking much about it...Not until later and reading many positive reviews did I watch it...My initial reaction upon viewing it was that it's disturbing not at all scary...for some reason I always thought this movie was a ghost story but it isnt...it's a pyschological thriller and a decent one...For horror fans of movies like Rosemary's Baby, Psycho etc I recommend you watch this !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one made the hair on my arms stand up!","review":"This is one of the most unforgettable movies I've ever seen. I saw it in 1972, the year it was released, and also the year I graduated from highschool. I haven't seen it since, but for some reason, it's really been on my mind lately, and I'm anxious to see it again. The acting in this movie is superb--as is everything about it. The premise is different from anything else you will ever see. I'm surprised that it's a movie that alot of people have never seen or heard of. Too bad, because it could easily become a classic if given some media attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect chiller for a rainy day","review":"The brilliance of this movie lies in its lazy day innocence, which is in fascinating juxtaposition to the evil underneath. This is no blood-n-guts, thrill-a-minute ride, but a subtle (often slow-paced, but enigmatic) journey which is deeply jolting at times and psychologically terrifying. A great movie to watch with friends or a significant other, as it could very well spark a lively discussion afterwards..."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS FIRST: BRILLIANT MASTERPIECE OF GENUINE BONE CHILLING HORROR","review":"Tom Tryon's beautifully written novel has been transformed into a terrific film without losing any of it's mesmerizing punch. That alone is pretty incredible. And maybe why the movie works so well is that there's a carefully constructed story that is being told. And unexpected, to put it mildly. Why this has been overlooked and essentially forgotten as a film is a mystery. Well, not forgotten by those who saw in its initial release, that's for sure. Or those who read the novel.Okay, if you read this review first, don't read any more. Just trust me that this is one of those movies that works best knowing NOTHING about the story. I promise you are in good hands. This one delivers on every level."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other","review":"Excellent movie! The book of course is way better.Awesome surprise ending! I recommend reading the book first though.Happy to own it as it was hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weird Is Good","review":"I recall this always coming on network tv back in the day, usually on Saturdays in the afternoon... so I'd be watching it of course thinking what the hell? So therefore it's good lol."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare genre piece","review":"Simply put, The Other is truly a slow moving story, but has a certain creepiness that tends to open the doorway to the imagination. Don't waste your time on the film until you have read the book. There is a certain uncomfortable feeling you get while reading The Other, a stirring haunting feeling that starts at the base of your spine then travels upward while all the while building supense. I would have to recommend this book to those who have not experienced it's touch.Beware though, if this book is suddently coming back into print then one has to ask, is another remake on the horizon. Do yourself a favor, read the book, see the original film, and stay away from Hollywood's desire of remaking every classic movie into garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to be confused with \\"The Others!\\"","review":"The Other kind of has the feel and look of a made-for-tv movie. This makes the movie more effective, in my opinion, because you just don't expect this kind of acting and depth from MTV. This movie respects it's audience, and is not the typical Hollywood over-achiever. No special effects needed, here. I was surprised the movie was available, and even more surprised that at least 40 other advocates (no pun, again) wrote positive reviews. Maybe we should just keep the movie a secret among ourselves, and hope to god it never gets remade! P.S. If you can find it, \\"The Fool Killer\\", BW, with a young Anthony Perkins, is a real sleeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Show...","review":"THE OTHER works because it is put together like some dark engine, where every little piece is essential. Tom Tryon (I Married A Monster From Outer Space) wrote the book and screenplay w/ intricately devilish precision. The Perry twins, Niles and Holland (Chris and Martin Udvarnoky) are not what they appear to be. There is something very wrong going on. Something just beneath the surface. Something spiteful, malicious, and deadly. The rest of the family is either oblivious, or pretending not to notice. That is, they are mere fodder for an evil that threatens to consume them all. An evil draped in childhood innocence. What REALLY happened to dad? The cousin? The neighbor? What WILL happen next? Watch closely. Every scene has some small puzzle-piece. Some hint. THE OTHER is like watching a horror / nightmare version of THE WALTONS! Everything looks fine, but as the story unfolds, nothing is fine.

After her departure from the contemporary R&B scene, most R&B music has been somewhat lackluster in my opinion. Ms. Moore took every song she had and gave it feeling, truth, and emotion. And don't even get me started on Paul Laurence Jones III, Kashif, and Van McCoy, with their superior production and songwriting! Take the music and couple it with Ms. Moore's urgent, soulful, velvety voice and you have some of R&B's finest underrated, hidden treasures. Personal faves: Love's Comin' at Ya, Take My Love, Mind Up Tonight, Keepin' My Lover Satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"This IS It","review":"This is a great selection of work by one of the greatest vocalists today, Melba Moore.

I'd rather have some directions, maps and tips than stories about Luna and Chaser and what kind of spaghetti sauce they prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough substance","review":"While this book provides a large number of listings about the local parks and other places, there are serious flaws. First of all, there are no maps (!), and directions are minimal or missing from most listings. Second, a lot of the descriptions contain more details about the author's dogs than about the places they visited, which is fun, but largely unhelpful. Finally, a lot of the information is out of date (although that's par for the course with any guidebook). As a resident of Chicago, I found it only slightly useful. I think a visitor to the city would have a hard time using it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a reason to visit my mom!","review":"I love and dearly miss Chicago, but was not a dog owner when I grew up in the city.

Based on that, I have reason to question the accuracy of the other information in the book (ie. restaurants, parks, shops etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish there was a guide like this for other cities","review":"If you have a dog and live in Chicago, this book is a must. Just flipping through this book, you can quickly learn how dog friendly the Chicago are is.Having recently moved to Madison, WI, I didn't realize what I had until it was gone (most parks prohibit dogs, and the designated \\"dog parks\\" are usually over run with extremely aggressive, untrained dogs that are a serious danger to you and your pet).As one reviewer notes, you should phone ahead on some of the places in the book.

Songs like \\"she-wolf\\", \\"prince of darkness\\", \\"kill the king\\", \\"dread and the fugitive mind\\" just don't belong on the album over hits like \\"almost honest\\", \\"use the man\\", \\"crush em\\".

If you pay too much attention to your children, they have no reason to pay attention to you.\\"This sounds absurd to me as a parent. Mr. Rosemound encourages the reader to use their common sense when parenting but I can't see how children can thrive under these suggestion. Isn't lack of attention what's causing problems in American children today?With that being said, I do agree with a few of his ideas however, I'm so put off by so many of his other ideas that I don't think it's worth the read.

However, the author, who also serves as the only narrator, does her product a disservice by using her own voice. As you listen, you try to relax as the message persuades you to do, but it is extremely difficult due to the narrator's jarring, fast-paced, overly-perky voice. For example, she will instruct the listener to imagine a scenario and before the listener can even begin the imagination process, the narrator is jumping along to the next thought sequence.

From being copied for a character in a fictional book to hanging around wild grizzly bears, Doug knows and needs this sense of danger to stabilize his life or add excitment to it. This well written book follows his earlier works that are amazing accounts of his life fighting for his country in the desert, in the mountains and over seas against a government and the rules they have on this world. To be free and live free is to have these small wilderness areas that need to be linked and need to protected.

The \\"instant message\\" type exchanges between the sexy vampire siren and the dowdy banker had me alternately laughing out loud and feeling my own chill as I feared what would happen to the main character. I hadn't heard of this book before, but I'm glad someone else had the good sense to give it to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing male-voice that you haven't heard yet!!!","review":"Cliff has more #1 hits than Elvis and has been Knighted by the Queen of England recently.

As do Limbaugh and that guy who wrote the EAT THE RICH book (as if he were in Swift's league as a writer!), Shanklin confirms for me that not only are conservatives not funny, they are truly meanspirited, banal, boring, and forgettable.

Very relaxing and perfect for home and office.I looked around and found this one. It has the same design as other foot rollers but the material is very cheap and fragile. The rubber over the rolls is a joke - comes easily off and is not durable.The wooden sticks which the rolls are attached to are super-thin. No wonder my roller arrived damaged (two rubber rings had cracks and one wooden stick was broken).You can find better foot rollers out there - this is overpriced garbage.

Unfortunately it can not be removed without damaging the wood. This is NOT shown in photograph. The winder appears to work well and is very quiet.

Born and raised in Venice, the author returns to live there once again, after being absent for many years. The book contains his desultory ruminations on Venice as he wanders it's labyrinth streets. This is not Venice from the perspective of culture or history. It is a native's view of La Serenissima and how time and tourism has changed it. I found the writing amorphous and not terribly interesting. It's difficult to make this City of paradoxes dull, but the author has succeeded in doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Was Looking For","review":"There was far too much analysis of Steinbeck's novels... and not enough about the man. The author seems to have appropriated a great deal of his material from \\"Steinbeck: A Life In Letters,\\" which I just read. It was that particular book that left me wanting for more, hoping to fill in some of the blanks. This book did a little bit, but really I did not gain much insight into John Steinbeck. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great author - poor biography","review":"I am a big John Steinbeck fan. I was hoping for a biography to help me understand the man a little more. What I got was a critique of his writings. The author took great enjoyment in showing how he interpreted the Steinbeck writings. Hey, we have read the books and can form our own opinions! The biography was so long-winded that I found myself skipping entire sections. So, I was disappointed that the book was not a true biography of the man. The biography is in there, you just have to muddle through the author's side tracks to see it. I don't know of another biography to recommend since this is the first I tried, spurred on by the glowing reviews. Maybe I missed something and it is a great biography, but not for me personally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrifically insightful","review":"There's no doubt Parini is an excellent writer. He's proven that on numerous occasions. But the Steinbeck autobiography proves he is also an excellent researcher and distiller of information. Steinbeck has been one of my favorite writers for years, and, as stated within his preface, he is one of Parini's favorites as well. Parini's admiration for Steinbeck comes across, as he details the many periods of Steinbeck's life, such as the Depression years, the war correspondence days, and the latter novels, such as The Winter of Our Discontent and Travels with Charley. Of particular interest within this biography is Parini's exploration of Steinbeck's psychological background and why he includes so many strong female characters within his novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book, well-done !","review":"I am a kind of collector of Photoshop books, from beginner's level to advanced.

The book (contrarily to many other Photoshop books) is full in color, and I recommend it for beginners and even for advanced users (thanks to the bonus section at the end \\" Behind the Scenes - a gallery with techniques from the pros\\").

I guess I misunderstood when www.Amazon.com said it would be available February 21, 2003. However, they had trouble obtaining the DVD, so I had to order through ebay. I would say the concert in the DVD takes place in 1987. Right after his \\"Dancing on the Ceiling\\" album. Everybody looks 80ish. The quality isnt that great either and the special effects are cheesy. I also think the piano playing the songs by itself is cheesy and disappointing. I would much rather see Richie play \\"Hello\\" and \\"Truly\\" than some fancy piano. Unless you are a die hard Lionel Richie fan, I wouldn't suggest this 60 minute music DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"lionel richie the Outrageous Tour DVD","review":"Very disappointing.I preordered this.

I thought this was the new 2002/2003 tour and it was not. The DVD quality was good, but the performance not what I expected. I own many concerts on DVD and this is one of the worst.

The DVD is simply a copy of this tape. The sound quality is with my surround equipment better as on the tape, whereas the video signal is worse. However I still enjoy the show very much and I am glad I bought the DVD. There is no region code, so the DVD should play anywhere (the television screen should be able to show NTSC)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for DVD label","review":"I am a great fan of Lionel Richie. He is one of the best singer that is why I collect his music cds and watch his concert in Hawaii last Feb.2003 and as soon as I saw his Outrageous live performance on DVD I bought it right away at SunCoast, when I watch it, the sound and video was poor in quality, in my observations, the DVD is like from the VHS tapes that was transfer to DVD and the sound was not stable in my High Fidelity system, I keep adjusting the bass and treble to have a good quality sound. The picture of Lionel Richie on the menu screen looks current but the concert seems to me sometime in the late 1980's. Overall the publisher of this import DVD is misleading the fans of Lionel Richie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bootleg","review":"This was never released legally as a dvd.

He is a great pedagogue, and his book is wonderful. It is neither simplistic nor arcane. It is a non mathematical introduction to thermodynamics, with the advantages and the obvious limitations of such an approach. At the outset Atkins warns us that mathematics are a tool to help us describe scientifically the world, a very powerful tool indeed, but not more. And at first it is better to get a first glimpse of thermodynamics without this tool. Then for those interested in going further mathematics become indispensable. Atkins book, I hope, will spurr many vocations ; many great physicists of the future will fondly remember Atkins book as their first marvellous introduction to the beauties of thermodynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"great miter","review":"Got this for Christmas and am amazed at it. The quality is outstanding. It is a snap to sit up and use. Right after I put it on my saw I reached over to the scrap pile and got a flat piece of molding that was 1X1/4 inches. I put the stop down and cut a 6 sided figure within a couple of minutes. Laid it out and it fit perfectly and I mean perfect. Did I mention that I had also gotten a miter express. These two togather tools made the entire operation right on and safe. Those folks at Incra are changing woodwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super","review":"Having used a table saw for many years, I'd accepted the deficient accuracy of the miter gauge as unavoidable. Switching between accurately set miter gauge angles was such a chore such cuts were avoided. The Incra 1000se immediately opened new possibilities to my woodworking. It enables a woodworker to shift between miter angles at 0.1 degree increments with perfect accuracy and minimal time. Rip rip cuts HAVE always been the forte of the table saw, and now with the Incra miter gauge the accuracy of miter cuts are in the same ballpark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incra 1000SE Miter Gauge","review":"This is the most accurate and user frindly miter gauge that I have ever owned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the $$","review":"This is made very well easy to use and is DEAD ON !! I make mostly musical insterments and for me this was a must have. The nylon cams in the miter bar take out ALL the slop in the saw miter channel.

If anything ever happened to this, I would replace it tomorow!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"As usual, Incra products aren't just \\"close\\", they're right on!

WOW!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cumbersome for left tilt blade.","review":"I have a left tilt saw and use a miter gauge on the left side of the table. If I needed to move the Incra miter gauge to the right side of the table for use with the tilted blade, I would have to remove the fence extension, move the miter gauge to the right side, make my cuts, and then re-attach the extension when I moved the gauge back to the left side of the table. I did not want to make a permanent shift of the miter gauge to the right side of the table so I returned it. Otherwise, I thought the miter gauge was a good product and would live up to my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I thought that this book was absolutely terrible.

It is not worthy of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could not put it down; glad to see Ellie take center stage","review":"Maybe I'm biased because I enjoy Mr. Hill's novels so much as a whole. What I like best about this series is the way the writing complements the characters' personalities (literary and academic, and very, very human and realistic). For me, the weaving of three novels was intriguing--even the title is evocative (refer to George Bernard Shaw's \\"Arms and the Man\\"). As for the characters, I found them believable. I also feel like I know more about the main characters' psyches with every novel Hill writes (in this series). I think the unexpected events in the main plot that may seem like coincidence help build excitement. I wouldn't recommend this book as an introduction to the Dalziel and Pascoe stories, but I highly recommend it to fans who have some familiarity with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocked!","review":"I have waited so many years to read an author as thrilling, hilarious, and intelligent as Reginald Hill. I have read many other books in this series and have been completely satisfied. That's why I was ASTOUNDED at how utterly BORING this was. The last fifty pages or so I actually skimmed, praying for the end to come. If this was the first Reginald Hill book I picked up, it would have without doubt never read him again, which would have been a great loss. I recommend skipping this book entirely, but give the others a chance, as they are quite good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Ellie Ad","review":"On Beulah Height will probably be remembered as one of the ten best works of detective fiction of the last century; it's that good. But readers who had that as the first introduction to the Pascoe and Fat Andy series will probably be confused by this one. It's remarkable that Hill can go from an hysterical village farce such as Pictures of Perfection to such haunting stories as Bones and Silence and On Beulah Height. This is one of his funny ones. Those of us who have followed Fat Andy and Peter from the beginning will be laughing hysterically throughout this book; you should make a point of reading Dead Heads before you read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book buried in there somewhere","review":"I'm not a huge fan of Mr. Hill, finding his books to be good detective stories buried under an increasing amount of silly self-important schoolboy purple prose. And this book was my final goodbye to his work. After a few chapters, I started skipping whole pages. Then after a while, I just put the book down forever. So, can't spoil the plot for you-- if it has one-- I've no idea what finally happened. But, there were the bones of a good story in there, but not worth the slog for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sing, O Goddess...","review":"A departure for Hill: a book of pure fantasy, in the Innesian manner. Pascoe's wife Ellie finds herself threatened-by the Secret Service? By Colombian terrorists? By the IRA?-but copes by writing a parody of Homer in which Ulysses and Aeneas represent Dalziel and Pasoce. Entertainment abounds, although the plot is too wild and wheeling to really pass muster-which is what one may expect when the author weaves his plot around Cymbeline!Franny Roote appears, only to cut his wrists. A pity he didn't do the job properly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoy Reginald Hill and I have liked every other Dalziel/Pascoe mystery, but this one disappointed me. The plot here seemed very obvious and why has Weild been elevated to sainthood?

The language and thought are complicated, and often difficult to understand. But there is displayed a sure knowledge of the work and life of the three masters. I found especially interesting the analysis of Yeats who is presented as having elaborated a whole world of hermetic and symbolic thought primarily as means to creation of poetry. Shaw and Yeats are seen as essentially shy and withdrawn figures who wear public masks. Joyce is clearly understood as the overarching figure of the three who puts Dublin and Ireland on the world literary map in a way no one had done before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovebirds that pretend to be angry to hide true feelings.","review":"Spice and Wolf is a fabulous tale that will sweep you away.

I've played Gallop Racer and G! Jockey, and liked them both. The way this game was marketed, I thought it would be the eqivalent of Madden or 2K sports to horseracing. I was wrong. It plays terrible. It plays like a game from Atari, it is so bad. The races are ridiculous, you can go from 1st to last to 1st again. And in between races, you have to do all sorts of boring things to get to the next race. I think they wanted the player to concentrate on handicapping and betting to try and win over new racetrack converts. Maybe they will do that, but if you're looking for a good horseracing video game to play, this isn't it.

Yes the overall construct and presentation could be better, but if you want an inexpensive option to see if you might like a Horse race game then this one is the way to go. Good opportunity to learn the basics of the controls and get a sense of what the other (better!) games are like, and if you totally hate it you're not out all that much (only a couple US$ on Amazon as I write this) - just don't expect too much as it is grossly outclassed by Gallop Racer, Grade 1 Jockey, and the new Champion Jockey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game assuming that since the NTRA was involved it would be a top notch product. All they had to do was take Gallop Racer and make it better. What a disappointment.The first time I played I was able to win a race right away. There was no challenge to it whatsoever. The tracks are far from interesting and not at all representative of the real location. Several times I chose to run a dirt race and all but one of the horses entered preferred the turf. Pick the horse that likes the dirt and you win - duh. Graphics are mediocre at best and you get no sense of the racing experience like in Gallop Racer.Looks like the racing industry can't even get a video game right, let alone solve their other issues. Save your $$$ and stick with Gallop Racer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on the NTRA","review":"After being a fan of the Gallop Racer series for the past six years I couldn't wait till the NTRA brought out a licensed game. The preview sounded like you'd be racing/riding the famous horses of today. WRONG. I think I played for two days and I haven't touched it since. You have to skip through every single race on every single day which takes forever. I have certain horses that will win every time by daylight which is too easy. There's no challenge. You can beat the stars you unlock easy. I beat Citation (Triple Crown winner and one of the greatest of all time) with a random game horse. Save your money and go for a game in the Gallop Racer Series (I recommend 2003)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I found this game on a shelf at a store, and thought it looked ok for my daughter.

So I decided to get NTRA because I had played xbox most often and enjoyed horse racing. But I was wrong in getting this. This game is sooo boring!! You could win races with your eyes closed, literally. It seems almost impossible to lose, the breeding isnt that fun, and pretty much the whole game itself isnt that fun.

Instead, the book tends to wallow in the pop-psychology of \\"doing business on the Internet.\\" For instance, the author talks about the anxieties some folks (potential customers) have about making electronic purchases on the web... repeatedly... and ends up using a significant portion of the book to express what could just as effectively have been written in a paragraph or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"for the absolute beginner","review":"This book has almost no useful information for anyone with the slightest familiarity with a computer and the internet.

There is almost nothing that I don't really care for and nothing at all that is unlistenable. My favorites are a hall of fame rendition of the famous Take Five, the Latin grooves of Only For You, the dreamy Strawberry Moon, the soulful Summer Nights, the hard-driving Next Exit, and the funky The Night Fantastic.The CD comes housed in a standard plastic jewel case and is accompanied by an insert that usefully gives pertinent information about who plays what on each song.Prime Cuts comes highly recommended to anyone who enjoys great jazz.

Boston's changed a lot from the city I lived in during the early 1960s, but not so much it isn't recognizable and enjoyable. The characters don't beat the reader over the head with the social ills we all know about. We aren't preached to with in-your-face feminism, mostly, and there's a degree of finesse when it happens at all. In those instances it passes for a more-or-less legitimate young female with attitude, arguing about who gets to drive and why, who pays the check, etc etc etc, realism we don't have to like in the character to believe in a way to suggest it's not so much a social bludgeoning as actual characterization.I was never tempted to trash this book before I finished it.

So this film actually profiles two individuals, one an author, the other a filmaker, each of whom has given his heart and soul over to a creative endeavor.You'll want to watch this film more than once.

It chronicles Moskowitz's attempts to locate the writer Dow Mossman and, en route, it calls upon a score of writers and former associates of Mossman. The success of the film is this journey, a celebration of why we read and why we write. It makes you want to go home and start reading immediately--maybe dust off one of those books you've been holding onto for years without having read. Some literary masterpieces may not strike us until we are ready to appreciate them. Moskowitz couldn't breach Mossman's book when he first bought it, but found himself lost in its poetic imagery much later in life. Fans of film and reading will love this documentary.

If his e-mail was a joke it was lost on me and the 4 other people I know who got it. My sense is that it was VERY serious. The New York Times believed it was serious too. Why else would Moskowitz send it out? How creepy!I can't understand the Amazon reviewers who write that the search for Dow MossMan was meaningless. If there was no search there would be no movie.

The director is too busy shoving microphones in people's faces and books across their desks and raking leaves out of the pond of his suburban home. Can documentary makers afford editors?P.S.

I can't tell which ones were made up and which ones were not. I can't understand why a director would pull an email stunt like that. The only reason I can think of is he can't he take criticism. My criticism is that I couldn't sit through the movie even though I love books and I'm a voracious reader.

Whenever he talked I just thought about doing my laundry.Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very satisfying film","review":"This unique documentary is especially effective.

More a mockumentary than anything else, since the film purports to document real events, but in fact sets up ridiculous shots of, for example, Moskowitz and friends going to their mailboxes to retrieve copies of the book. And then, of course, the fake \\"search\\" for Mossman - a lovely, troubled man who seems to have had, despite everything, a real, lifelong engagement with literature - who, it seems, could probably have been found in 10 minutes, rather than months. The literary critics and writers interviewed are all interesting, but by the end it wouldn't have surprised me if the filmmaker had asked, \\" What would you say if I told you I had Dow Mossman in the trunk of my car?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I've changed my mind","review":"I had originally given Stone Reader a positive review despite reservations about the director's dubious 'search' for a missing novelist and his annoying attempts to upstage the publishing people he interviews.

Trickery of this sort lowers my opinion of both the director and his film. Neither is worthy of our consideration."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful exploration of novels and their impact","review":"\\"Stone Reader\\" was one of my favorite documentaries of 2003.Salinger's Holden Caulfied says something to the effect that you know that a book is truly great when you wish the author were a friend so that you could call him up and quiz him on the details of the story. Mark Moskowitz clearly felt that Dow Mossman's \\"Stones of Summer\\" was a novel of that stature and so didn't give up on his quest until he could have those conversations for himself.I found Moskowitz's passion and some of his discoveries along the way interesting and in some cases, quite moving. (Whether or not the book \\"Stones of Summer\\" is any good is an entirely separate issue for me.)There are some very strange things going on with the reviews down below, which I won't bother commenting on except to say that some folks have clearly decided to try to impact this film negatively in a way that bewilders me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent doc about the Great Lost American Novel","review":"To me, this wasn't just about him tracking down Dow, but every writer who wrote their one story, then vanished, but so did the book!

Salinger isn't around to discuss what his life was like for the past 40 years, John Kennedy Toole isn't around to discuss \\"Confederacy of Dunces\\", but Mark captured Dow on film, and even if people have their issue with the documentary, it succeeded in what Moskowitz set out to do.

I was left with no sense of the book Stones Of Summer or how it was written, etc. I left a posting on a movie website saying this and the next day got a meanspirited response from another viewer who amazingly turned out to be the director. I found this out by checking the poster's website profile. He wrote \\"Well, I saw it too. a few weeks ago, and it was clear from the outset to me that the movie wasn't about the book, but more about all/any books and we/audience feel about them.

Nothing really interesting occurs until the last thirty minutes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great info - but a chore to read","review":"This is a good book - but it's more for students than general readers.

One of the most famous Stones stories, for example, is when John Lennon gave them 'I Wanna Be Your Man' for their second single, but the meeting between them doesn't even get half a page.

For those of you who are turned off of a Batman story with Robin in it dont fret. Robin is hardly in it at all and when he is Jeph Loeb actually does a great job of actually making him cool.

But Franz Joseph is delighted with beautiful Elisabeth, that he choses HER to be his wife, to his mother's dismay. To read more about Elisabeth's life with the Emperor(or about her long, aubourn hair) don't flip through the pages of this novel, but actually read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and pointless","review":"Elizabeth never meant to catch the eye of Franz Joseph 1, emperor of all of Austria. He was meant as a bride for her sister, Helene, herself for his younger brother. Yet when Joseph passes over Helene and proposes to Elizabeth, she feels she has no choice to accept. This is the story of Elizabeth's life from days just before the proposal up until their wedding day, and the emotional journey of Elizabeth herself, destined to be Empress and rule beside the husband she never expected to have.Told through Elizabeth's eyes in the form of a journal, this book, in my opinion, was too short and utterly pointless. Half of the entries were Elizabeth writing that she had no time to write, and character's relations to each other were hard to work out. There wasn't enough description, and there were a lot of background references that weren't explained, leaving you in the dark to what was going on earlier in her life."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but too short, and not enough detail","review":"In this book we learn about Princess Elisabeth getting married to the emperor, and that's it.

The rest of the book is pretty much describing her getting prepared for her wedding.\`\`Katrina"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"royal\\" story.","review":"\\"Elisabeth: The Princess Bride, Austria-Hungary, 1853\\" was a disappointment.

It shows girls as being worth for nothing more then marriage! I learned nothing about the culture, history, or palace life from this book. All you will learn is Elisabeth is a slave to her husband who was meant for her sister. Elisabeth doesn't even feel bad for her sister, she acts as if she deserved it. She only cares about what her husband thinks. For example:\\"My teeth have grown a little yellow, I hope my husband approves.\\"\\"He has been gone for three days, I can't bear it anymore.\\"\\"I have grown a bit more plump since I last saw him and he seems to aprove!\\"I mean her life revolves around her stupid husband!If you 're looking for a strong girl to look up to don't read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent live EP","review":"Very good ep with good value having around 25min of live material.

The book is written in a very informal style. However, the first day after I read it I finished 6th out of 1600 in one tournement in which I never finished higher than 400 in before. This guy knows his stuff, but do you have the discipline and patience to follow his advice? This is not a formula book, as in play this way, and this way only. TJ goes into the real aspect of NL tourny play, as in playing the player, and not making mistakes. I would rather you not read this book because I don't want anyone who follows it to play against me. But if you do read it pay attention, TJ's style is understated to say the least, but he lays out a system that will win you tournaments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't know why this book gets high reviews","review":"I'm a good limit and decent NL player, winning at both regularly.

In this book you have the perfect example of how a master performs his craft. He draws real characters because he has considered that how people behave, speak, dress and think defines who they are. The protagonist Philip St. Ives is never described in any of the novels, but, though his first-person narrative Thomas gives the reader a clear picture of who this person is. The action, violence and greed in this novel is very real. Since the book involved a \\"kidnapping\\" of sorts it is not short on chicanery or action, both of which keep the action humming along. But Thomas keeps the characters real all along. That made me concerned about the outcome of the violence (I even wanted some of the \\"bad guys\\" to survive)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Seller!","review":"I got this product really fast.

The look and balance weight of each item is nice, but I feel that short cuts with alloy metals in manufacturing for a larger profit margin leaves the consumer with set of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful","review":"I read a bunch of reviews and learned not to use high heat except for boiling water, to use a cooking spray , and to wash it after it cools down. I got rid of my old teflon and bought this set at a local store. It was not the price I am seeing here but if I had ordered it from Amazon, it would have been the same price counting shipping and handling. I am really happy with this set. I saw in some of the reviews that it spotted. Well, stainless steel does spot with cooking. If you use BarKeepers Friend it will clean. up vey nicely. I am really happy with this cooking set and am very glad that I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and flimsy","review":"Turn brown on first use. Handles get extremly hot and the pots and not as pictured entirely and the ones I recieved looked slightly wider. They are thin and evin at the discounted price are pricy. Somethimes you have to see in person to buy and I think cooking pots are one of those. Should have sent it back but I bought it for an occasion but will probably throw them away or give them to goodwill when done. They are embarrasing next to my heavier guage stainless steel sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent cookware set","review":"I have tried many expensive cookware sets over the years and had to return them. I bought the large fry pan at another store and it worked out great. I then went to Amazon.com and found the entire set for under $100 and free shipping. I keep the burner on medium and no sticking. The cleanup is so easy and fast. Be sure to use a little cooking oil as to be expected with this type of pan. I was looking for quality that would last and these are that quality. Thanks again Amazon.com!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TFal Pots n Pans","review":"I loved this set so much, I bought it TWICE! After buying it as a gift for my daughter, I bought one for myself! Good quality, awesome pricing! Just follow Mfg. directions and DON'T use high heat - they don't require you to do this, they distribute and hold heat evenly and you will enjoy this set a long long time to come. You can also use either white vinegar or lemon to clean any discoloration (if you did use the heat too high) and it comes out beautifully. I am very happy with this purchase! Best thing I bought on Amazon so far!"},{"rating":"1","title":"T-Fal 10 piece Stainless Steel Cookware","review":"I bought this set on Friday, January 21st at Wal-Mart. Used the large skillet one time, and absolutely hated it. Food stuck and it was very discolored after one use. (And yes I followed the usage instructions.) The lids don't fit the skillets. Returned it to the store on Sunday, January 23rd. After reading reviews for the Cuisinart 12-Piece MCP stainless stell cookware, I plan to purchase.

I love T-fal but just not this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tfal Do NOT Buy","review":"purchased this cookware set two weeks ago and I have hated that decision. This cookware is HORRIBLE. Everything and I mean everything sticks in it. I followed their recommendations about seasoning the cookware and only cooking on medium heat but nothing helped. Everything still stuck. Also if you use the included metal spatulas it scratches the cookware really bad. I contacted T-Fal about the issues I was having with this set and they informed me there was nothing they could do about it and pretty much told me my warranty does not cover any of the issues with sticking and scratching. The ten dollar set of cookware you can get from dollar store is way better than this set and does not stick half as bad. I would in no way recommend this product to anyone.... Buyers BEWARE"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst set ever","review":"I purchased this item at a different store. I've been going to all places that sell it to tell you this is the worst set of cookware I've purchased.Everything stick to the pans. Once oil burns to the pan you can't get it out.When your boiling something the handle gets so HOT that I've burn my hand several times when removing it from the stove. Hard Water line stays on the bottom on the pot you can peel off with your fingernail but it can't remove when washing.Well I lost the box so Im stuck with an item I really hate...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not break your glass lid.","review":"T-fal does not offer replacement lids for this cookware, which is an issue since glass lids are fairly easy to break.

There was some mildly funny humor here and there, but over all the movie was atrocious!!Take three estranged & dysfunctional brothers that don't trust each other. Then place them together on a 1st class train compartment to travel across India in search of \\"Enlightenment\\". All the while each one of them goes about undermining each others trust for most of the movie. Sounds like they each have a lot of unresolved issues/baggage and an odd upbringing to boot.Somehow or another through finally meeting up with their mother, who is a nun in India, and has abandoned them all every opportunity she can find to do so and over coming their father's death, do the finally find peace in an odd sort of way or so it seems. The movie doesn't make it clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Funny.","review":"I'm not a big owen wilson fan, but this is amazing. I love it. Great Photography too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprise","review":"I bought this dvd to add to my collection of Owen Wilson films, and I had mixed expectations that I would like it. I was pleasantly surprised by how much I did enjoy it, and I watched it 3 times consecutively before I picked anything else to watch. I enjoyed the dynamic of the relationship of the brothers, the quest and the conclusion. I don't want to reveal to much of the story for those who have not yet watched it, but I found the visuals breathtaking and the story uplifting. Writing about it makes me want to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad disc","review":"Condition was basically brand new, probably used once or twice, but still very good condition. It came it the mail earlier than expected! I opened it and all looked right, the disc had no signs of scratches on it at all. However, when I watched it, half way through the movie it would skip about 2-3 scenes at a time and I can't even watch the end of the movie because it the disc freezes and won't even play, every time! So now, I am probably going to just go to the store and buy it :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop That Train, I Want To Get Off","review":"I adored The Royal Tenenbaums, and usually I find Wes Anderson's films fun and inventive. But sadly, TDL seemed like a misfire to me. The spritual journal of three brothers by train is a great concept, but this film seemed to lack the emotion necessary for me to care for the brothers, or to make me feel like they cared for each other. Visually, the movie is stunning, with vivid colors, beautiful turbans, and gorgeous settings. True, clever lines are scattered here and there, but overall I found the story too scattered, possibly in need some fine tuning, to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"Good quirky cast but story line, just seems to go no where. Something got lost in the editing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I liked The Royal Tenenbaums quite a bit, but The Darjeeling Limited wasn't that good.

Done up in beautiful color and cinematography, it flows flawlessly and INTERESTINGLY to its climax. The flawed characters, so well-known in Anderson's movies are endearing and memorable. I watch it over and over just too see the beautiful scenery~"},{"rating":"1","title":"dull and boring","review":"My husband and I could only deal with about 1/2 hour of this movie.

I like Angelica, but only tolerate Wilson and the other two actors because it's a Wes Anderson film. BTW, wtf were they planning on doing with that snake anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Wes' great ones...","review":"I just finished watching this....unfortunately. I really like Wes Anderson and had high hopes for this movie but I was completely bored. I should also mention that I like all types of movies, meaning not just Hollywood blockbusters, but this one left much to be desired.Quirky, yes. Interesting, no. Fortunately I caught this one on cable and I would not buy it nor would I pay to rent it either. Forgive me if this review is in disagreement with the others that rave about the film, but I just did not like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....horrible","review":"Another Wes Anderson movie, unfortunately they get worse one by one.This movie is basically Royal Tennenbaums II, except set in India.Owen Wilson is the same pretentious, faux-humility character as always.The scenes sputter along, with a lot of dead air, and dialogue about nothing imparticular. There is a vague gloom and sense of failure, again,and a screenplay that could be written over a bottle of $6 chenin blanc.Also, the intro \\"short film\\" was utterly dreadful and pointless. I'm sorry, but this is vapid garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I have watched a lot of movies in my life and there are only a few I would categorize as \\"never watch again\\" and this movie is one of them. It is absolutely pointless. Downright stupid with virtually nothing to gain from watching it. I really tried to like it and to find some humor in it, but the only thing I came away appreciating about this movie was the on scene filming in India and that was it. My girlfriend gave up watching it long before it ended and went to sleep and I mindlessly trudged through it to the end finding that the movie really does go nowhere. As soon as the DVD came out of the player, it went directly into the \\"trade-in\\" stack of movies to get out of the house as soon as possible and trade it in for credit towards some movies I might actually want to watch more than once. If you like depressing pointless movies then this one is for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and stupid, at the same time","review":"I just went on this site to see if I wasn't the only one who wasted his/her time watching this movie.The dialogue sucks. I can't see how any fictitious character would enjoy Owen Wilson's company. Are we supposed to think he's charming???.The story is equivalent in sucking as it is to Owen Wilson's \\"character\\". Boring, dumb and stupid. They are on a \\"spiritual journey\\" which includes them getting into some of the most uninteresting, plain, dull mishaps, I have seen in any movie. Watch it to see for yourself, or just read the other reviews that state how BORING it was.Jason schwartzman, who helped write this, does have 1 clever piece of dialogue near the end of the movie, asking his brother's opinion on a book which he has only written the ending for. The \\"short story\\" he wrote, is hilarious, and kind of out of place for this movie, because nothing else was at all as funny as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its real good.","review":"I think if you're buying this dvd you know it's good. Wes Anderson is a genius when it comes to characters and minute nuances. Every interaction is so smart. I just wish he wasn't so completely unsexy."},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of time","review":"Don't waste your time on this. I was mad at myself for watching the whole thing hoping it would get better. Never did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Limited Darjeeling!","review":"I hated this movie. It was 91 minutes of excruciating agony to watch three self-absorbed, small-minded jerks ride on a train. There is no message or deeper meaning to this movie, except perhaps to avoid films set on trains, films about Americans in India, and, above all, films by Wes Anderson. If you are looking for a vastly superior movie about three brothers and their bonding rituals, try any of those starring Larry, Curly, and Moe."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste","review":"wes anderson at his peak superficial. he has his \\"hip\\" music and video matching up, but in this movie it has no punch so it shows his cliche filming style to be all that wes has left. it was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this 0 stars","review":"This is one of the worst movies ever.

Self-indulgent, boring, all in all, an idiotic trifle Watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I have those 91 minutes back?","review":"I usally enjoy Wes Anderson's movies. I Loved Royal Tenenbaums and also enjoyed Life Aquatic to a good degree. Unfortunately The Darjeeling Limited features none of the charm or fun of those previous films. The movie is just dull from beginning to end. The characters are boring and uninteresting. They are not likeable or relatable in any way. Quirky should also be fun, but this movie is just quirky for it's own sake and it fails to entertain. I literally did not laugh once while sitting through this. My mother actually fell asleep during most of it. This is a film to avoid at all costs, unless you suffer from severe insomnia, then it may just do the trick."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Darjeeling Limited","review":"Item was in excellent condition and shipped in a timely manner.Stupidest movie I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike the last few Wes Anderson Movies","review":"I was excited to see this movie however walked away very dissapointed. Unlike many of Wes Anderson's movies watching this one again will not make it better.As a fan of the last few Wes Anderson/Owen Wilson films, this movie had very little of the dry, witty elements of movies like \\"Life Aquatic..\\", \\"Royal Tenenbaums\\", etc.This film has a few little laughs along the way, however always veers back into drama, leaving you wanting more humor. However, the attempts at humor break up the drama, leaving you in the middle.Good performances from Owen Wilson & Adrien Brody, however Jason Schwartzman adds little. Bill Murray makes a quick cameo in the first 45 seconds and maybe he was exactly what was missing.Unfortunately, this film gets stuck between a drama and a comedy and satisfies neither. I'll look fwd to the next Wes Anderson film but I can't reccomend this one in good faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good film but not as good as The Royal Tenenbaums","review":"The Royal Tenenbaums is my favourite Wes Anderson movie, and while The Darjeeling Limited is a great movie it is not that great. Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved by Faith","review":"In an age when there is so much criticism of organized religion and doubts of the role of faith in the lives of individuals it is refreshing to read Dr. Sydney Duncombe's new novel, Enduring Faith. It is a moving tale of the great love of a young girl for her kid sister. The story has its exciting moments with contact with the drug world and its disastrous impact upon a bereaved widow. There is the mystery of a cold blooded murder. This is the backdrrop for the love story of two innocents, Tom and Mary. Above all it is the story of the central role of faith in their lives. Dr. Duncombe writes with conviction that has been tested in great suffering in his personal life. His faith has sustained him in trials that would overwhelm the nonbeliever. Not only is his faith enduring but to the sensitive reader his faith can be contagious."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING","review":"this album is great. it has fred, john and my man richard. his song sweet jesus is the best on there. i didnt know much about debra killings but im really feelin her joint and marvin sapps, forevermore. if u dont have it u have to get it. its great."},{"rating":"1","title":"to much money and this is not good","review":"no buy this, i buyed this and i realy no like becouse no work, it's not comprecion, no sirve esto es tirar el dinero a la basura !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good, the bad, and the ugly","review":"Ordered 3 of these: first was fine, second didn't come with a set of keys, and for the third the door handle won't turn in 1 direction."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Impressed.","review":"These are made by Schlage, but they ARE NOT the same as their standard locks. These are MUCH MORE CHEAPLY MADE. When I attempted to master-key these for a customer, I discovered that Schlage plug followers are unable to remove the plug from the SEALED lock cylinder. A workable plug follower can be made, but if you don't have a buddy who's a machinist, you can forget about it.I didn't return the locks, because I'll use them eventually (maybe on a stand-alone garage or shed somewhere), but I did have to purchase another ORIGINAL Schlage set so I could master-key them easily to the existing building's key system using the Professional Schlage Keying Kit.If I was simply replacing the locks on a door where security was not a life or death issue, these economy units MIGHT do ok.

It powers through wood with ferocity. Drilling in concrete with 5/32 bit is slow and tends to burn up the bit. I like the feel of the handle and the balance of the unit. After 6 months of jobsite use, whilst drilling in porcelain tile with a 5/32\\" bit the motor shot out bits of its fan blades and other metal pieces.

Motor is under engineered compared to the battery and there is no safety to protect the motor. When drill gets stuck, handle bends and trigger becomes locked into on position. Expect the motor to burn two seconds later. In short, you have one second to get the trigger unstuck.The battery and the drill were designed together. The drill cannot handle the battery. I had two Porter Cables 19.2V previously and the handle and the same flaw which caused the trigger to get stuck on and the motor never burned. I should have bought another one, but I wanted Lithium Ion. The Bosh is either designed wrong or the motor was defective.Now I get to see if Bosh will uphold their warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power To Spare","review":"I bought this drill because it was a bargain and I needed a cordless hammer drill. I have drilled a few holes in old concrete and it is almost as fast as my corded hammer drill. I am also using it for hole saws and large spade bits. I did manage to bog it down using a Bosch 1 1/2\\" spade bit with the self feeding point. This was in hard maple. When I tried the same bit on a treated 4 x 4, it drilled through it as fast as I could push it. If you need a cordless drill with a lot of power you will like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good drill - bad electrical components inside","review":"The drill worked fine for about 5-6 times I used it for light work (maybe a total of 10 minutes run time?) around the house and then it gave up just when warranty expired.Upon disassembling the drill I discovered that the trigger assembly failed. Frayed wires on that little ribbon cable going back to module above battery pack and consequently melted plug with lots of green corrosion around the pins. Looks to me like something oozed out of that module and caused the mayhem. I would bet on cheap capacitors inside that spilled the electrolyte.Replacement part is $120+ for the whole \\"trigger assembly\\" and no sub-components available for replacement. Seriously?Whole new drill can be had for $140 but why invest in such poorly designed tool? To have it fail again in a year?There is no excuse for such part to fail on such expensive tool, I would give it 0 stars if I could but here goes 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"SENTIMENTAL, MELLOW, WONDERFUL!!","review":"In 1956 I bought the original.

These are wonderful old classics at their most enjoyable. Jerry Lewis has a surprisingly mellow, lovely, exciting voice. He may not be a top 'crooner' or 'king of song' or whatever the term, but he certainly brings feeling to the soul where it makes you feel so good. That's good enough for me, ergo 5 Stars.

I used to imitate him, I used to do that song ALOT. So when I researched if there was a cd in print with the song I found this one. However, I have come to find out that the copy of Rock a bye, is actually not the one that was recorded for sale. This one is of Jerry and sounds like, Deano, on stage, hamming through.

This tool, for just about twenty bucks, can save your customer hundreds of dollars in data recovery fees. Unless the boot sector is corrupt or your head on the magnetic plate is physically broken this tool allows you to view SATA and IDE ( 2.5, 3.5 and 5.25) directories like the HDD is a flash drive.

I realize my experience may not be typical, but the friend who told me about the Vantec is now having similar problems, although sometimes his will come up after 10-20 minutes.

After messing around with it for a few hours (and discovering that smaller files worked just fine), I began to get the feeling that it was a faulty product. After trying another Vantec with the same results, I returned it and bought the very similar product from Bytecc.

He says to see the sites of the other authors for the code to their chapters, but doesnt provide a link to their sites.

This album should be Black Betty, 20 times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dated but enjoyable","review":"1. The musicAs other reviews have pointed out, this is not the most sterling example of this genre. Black Betty is definitely the standout and I could hear ZZ Top doing this song. In my opinion, most of the other songs are just average for the genre, except side two of the second LP in which something lit a fire under the band and the tracks are fast and furious. Unfortunately production took a bit of a nosedive on that LP and the drums are badly recorded. Still, a lot of energy and power.2. The releaseThis is a German import from CBS records. The 4 page booklet does give complete publishing and time info on all the songs, and on the inner spread is a brief bio of the band - in German. I can only get a sense of it, but with phrases like \\"bahnbrechenden Hardrockern\\" (barn-burning hard rockers?) you can get a sense of it.

I personally want them to re-release Season 3 with the same treatment the first two seasons were given. The packaging is part of the reason I buy the DVDs. If I wanted plain discs I would download the episodes on the internet illegally and burn them on a disc.

You dont see them skimping on the \\"Simpsons\\" box sets (Season 5 is brimming with bonus material.The episodes are still great, but with reruns being played to death on FX, plus the show's time slot being victim to Fox's NFL schedule, this set offers fans nothing except owning the episodes themselves on DVD.Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's about time","review":"It's here, I do not know how much longer FOX could have waited to put this season out.

Songs like \\"Do you want me anymore\\" which is about a girlfriend who has left him to a three minute story about a person who drowned in a river called \\"Down by the river\\". The second half of the record is pure disco music, this sounds amazing due to Jarvis's snarling vocal style. I highly recommend this CD to all Pulp fan's.

This book desribes only Christian churches in America. Nowhere on the cover or in the description does it say so.

The author also fails to explain the differences within certain religions. Why are there so many branches of the Lutheran Church or among the Methodists? Does Ms. Steig have any idea? \\"Finding the Right Church\\" reads like an eighth grade term paper. It is ok for those seeking the most minimal, general knowledge.

Does anyone remember (or know where I can get) the St. Patrick's Day show he recorded in Dublin, Ireland? The Guy Noir skit on that broadcast was high-larious.This particular collection is a 9-track running joke. It has its standout moments with fantastic feats of alliteration in a couple tracks and the old fashioned sound effects are fun . . . but, as another post here says, it gets less funny as it goes along.The essence of comedy is brevity and most of these skits take too long. I recall the Guy Noir skits I heard on the radio being shorter, much more varied and having a bigger cast with more fantastic stories. Most of these tracks just drag on as if by taking longer to get to the punchline the same old shtick will become funnier; mostly, it doesn't work. Unless you're a real die-hard fan completing your PHC collection, this CD is a monotonous disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"first of two very funny series","review":"This first collection of \\"Guy Noir\\" routines, lifted from A Praire Home Companion, are very funny.

The technology is believeable with enough details to satisfy hard sci-fi readers without delving into textbookese.Having enjoyed the proto-ARs that are online games, I was interested in seeing what Ms. Cadigan had to say about the future.Similiar to Gibson's Pattern Recognition, all the characters in the book are looking for something. The focus is on the role of artifical reality in these hunts.

Usually when I dislike a book this much I just stop reading it, but I continued to expect that what I was reading was the set-up and that then the book would start.It has absolutely no character development. It consists almost entirely of dream-like disjointed, unconnected vignettes. So it doesn't have a story either! You couldn't like or dislike any of the characters because you learned absolutely nothing about them. I also thought that it was scientifically implausible, e.g. an 'artifical reality body suit' that could simulate the experience of breaking bones. It purports to be a detective story where the action takes place in \\"Artificial Reality\\" (AR), but I think that, at best, it was Artificial Lucid Dreaming (ALD).

The thing I don't like, but certainly can live with, is the motor not being attached to the breast shield. My chest is rather large, so putting the bottles in the unit and holding the unit to my chest with one hand is not an option. I have to hold each shield upto my chest and the motor sits in my lap. I can't control the speed or turn the unit on/off because I don't have a free hand.

I was on my first weekend away from the baby, and had to quit breastfeeding because I dried up without my pump (not to mention the pain). I tried using the manual one, but it didn't work.

I pumped twice a day until my daughter was 3 months old. I got at least 6 ounces of milk in less than 10 minutes of pumping and could get 4 ounces in about 5 minutes. I always started the motor with no suction, gradually increasing until about half way when I would get good flow and stay comfortable. I only stopped at 3 months because breast milk gave her so much gas that I finally switched to formula. But I will try breast feeding using this pump again for my next child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great buy","review":"I am a stay at home mom and nurse my baby most of the time.

It comes with earbuds and headphones, a travel case w/strap, rechargeable batteries and charger, and firmware. Playback is great; some previous reviews say that sound is horrible; this is because they plugged their headset into the wrong slot. MP3 playback is as good as normal playback. FM radio is excellent. The equalizer really makes a difference. This thing has, like, 500 different shuffle modes too. A very advanced player. My only complaint is that it comes with garbage for instructions. You have to go to the support site and work your way to the online manual for good instructions. The LCD has a nice backlight and while you usually cannot see a song's whole title, it will scroll by in a second. I would not reccomend jogging with it, though, as it has no real good place to hold it and has a slick covering.You will probably want your own headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid anything from SonicClue/Rio......","review":"I've bought three different MP3 players from this company (including two of the SP250) and they have all been defective.

It broke after a few months and they eventually sent me a replacement. This unit does not play self made music CDs, and will only play mp3s on CDRW (rewritable) discs, not on CDRs, and then only reliably with CDs I've made with one particular recorder (NEC) and not ones made with recordable drives on other computers (Sony,Samsung, and Ricoh brand CDRW burners). So I have loads of discs that will play on my computer or home DVD player but not on my RioVolt. If I want to listen to the radio instead, its reception is very poor. So I've recently bought a PDA with a built in mp3 player and am copying music (limited to 128mb at a time) to that to listen to.

I love stuffing song after song onto one CD. If you are looking for sheer sex appeal, go with the iRiver, but this one has every feature I could want. Screen, battery life, quality are all great, anti-skip is bulletproof. The only minor gripes are radio reception and that I wish they had made the LCD remote standard. But all things considered, I would wholeheartedly recommend this to anyone looking for portable MP3 music or trading up from a regular cd player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Product, but very, very susceptible to Terminal Damage","review":"I have had the player for about 10 months, and had no complaints. It was great: it remembered where I left off, had rechargeable batteries, had a remote, never skipped when I used it in the car. But...when I was re-arranging my living room and it slipped out of my hand 2-feet above a wooden floor, it broke its left hinge and has not powered on since then. I checked the Hold settings, took the thing apart, and even contacted support via e-mail. The small fall must've damaged its circuit board. Oh well...I still have working 8-track players, quadrophonic sound systems (yes, those things from the 70s), and near new Commodore computers. So, why is it that a 2-foot fall can damage this?

I searched for a long time for a phone number or e-mail address and I finally found an e-mail hidden on their web page. When I wrote to it, I got a form e-mail that said if my questions weren't answered to respond to that letter and someone would get in touch with me. Needless to say I was very frusterated when I responded to this letter (more than once) and recieved the same letter back. Bottom line, even if their products were superior to others out there (which they're not) I would still NEVER purchase another Rio product again because of their absoloutely terrible customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I bought one of these things from Amazon and it never worked. Not for one second. I let the batteries charge all night and it still wouldn't boot up. I tried different rechargeable batteries, but it made no difference. Between this and my Rio 500 which had to be RMAed 3 times, I'm starting to think Rio specializes in great ideas that they don't know how to make work. I'm moving on to the Creative Nomad IIc. Hopefully I'll have better luck with that."},{"rating":"1","title":"So So","review":"When I first received the RioVolt in the box, I must admit it looked very damn impressive. I was astonished by the display, and all the options it had, and the 8-minute anti skip. I also loved that it came with rechargeable batteries, and that they would last long. So, when I got it, I charged up the batteries and started listening to it during the days. I was amazed when the batteries ran dry on me in UNDER 3 hours. The player has gotten progressively worse since then. I can't walk from one end of a room to another without it skipping every time I take a footstep. It's a nice player, but it really doesn't do what I expected. I used to own a little Panasonic CD player, with 40 sec anti skip, and only played CD's (not mp3's) I could mow my whole lawn (over an hour of walking) and it would never skip, and batteries lasted at least 25 hours. So if you're considering spending a lot of money, I'd suggest a nice Panasonic CD player, better bang for your buck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought music could sound so good.","review":"I just got this so I cant account for durabilty or longevity but neglecting those two factors I must say: this thing rocks. It has all the standard options one would expect from an mp3 player and much more. The price is considerable but fair, the accessories are well above average in both qauntity and quality (AC adapter/charger, case made from some kind of fabric, presumably leather, two sets of decent headphones, and a remote control) The LCD screen is adequately lit, a problem way too common in electronics today. Where this player really shines is the quality of sound it produces. I've had players before, both CD and mp3, some costing more than this model, but this one sounds the absolute best. To say that this is worth the price is an understatement, its worth a hell of a lot more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great device!! no problem at all","review":"RioVolt it's a cool cd/mp3/wma player. You have a great sound, full capabilities, remote control, customizable options, etc. I have played cda, mp3's cd (multisession, rewritable, nested directories...all the possibilities!!!) and passed it ok. MMMMmmmm, yeah...some things aren't at the same level: the in-ear headphones doesn't sound so cool, the batteries charges very slow in the rio (but who doesn't have an external charger?...), and the FM tuner doesn't catch the lower stations. But think, what are these details against the possibility of get all the features and actualizations in your all-in-one-Rio?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Short battery, slow boot up, awkward controls","review":"Battery maxs out at 4 hours. Takes about 10 seconds to start playing. Very confusing control on player and on head phone. I got this because it is the only few CD, MP3 with FM tuner. The most annoying problem is the short battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless MP3 player.","review":"If you're thinking of buying the SonicBlue RioVolt SP250, think again. I've had nothing but problems with mine from day one. It had trouble reading my mp3 cds, which equates to long (30sec-1.5minute) startup time. That was just the beginning. It skipped all the time while driving around in my car. I haven't had a cd player that skipped for a long time, and my fried just bought a sony mp3 player that doesn't skip at all. This was all fairly disappointing when, wham, the worst thing of all. The electronic faceplate is screwed into plastic underneath the flip-up lid. After about 5-6 months of use, the screws broke free of the threads, and the electronic plate would touch the spinning cd when I pressed the play/stop/ffd button. About 4 months after that, the whole plate fell off and was just sitting on the cd. Needless to say, it doesn't work anymore.I'm now in communication with their support, which is pretty much worthless as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"What More Can You Want","review":"Its very simple.

I can honestly say, I dont know how I managed without one before!Some of the other reviews paint a pretty dim picture of this unit, but in my 8 months of use I have had very few problems. It plays all my MP3 discs (even if not closed),and CDs without much fuss. I found it will skip if I place it in a vertical position in my car, but that is minor.The FM tuner works fine, since it is only used at cricket matches anyway;-)The unit could do with some improvements, such as the ability to change discs while playing, plug/unplug the adapter without rebooting, and the choice of no backlight. Hopefully these issues will be fixed in later models, or firmware upgrades.I would buy another tomorrow if my 250 was stolen or lost. Truly a wonderful product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's pretty slick-it, ya gotta try it!","review":"I'd like to start off mentioning that I didn't mean to make the title rhyme, but it just came out that way...This player is great. I didn't even use the instruction guide and already I know how to customize almost all of the functions it performs. The LCD is clear and utilizes the small amount space well. The back light works great and contrast is adjustable. If you plan on using this primarily as an MP3 CD player then walking while listening to the player is amazing because the player truly doesn't skip. I've had it skip on normal CDs only.The player comes with rechargables that recharge right in the player. Just plug the player in and set it to charge. The player is also able to discharge and recharge the batteries too, thus elongating the life of your rechargable batteries.You should try this player out- or atleast convince a friend to buy it so you can \\"borrow\\" it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptionally good","review":"Where will Rio go from here? I suppose they could add an AM tuner and then throw in the digital remote control and car kit?I started with the Rio 90, which is actually a great entry product.

I burnt two discs and messed around with the player and my computer for a week before writing Rio and receiving a technician's answer. I appreciated the customer support, but the information really should have been in the player's documentation or on Rio's website. To listen to WMA files, I ended up having to delete and restore the 1200 songs on my computer because I'd stored them initially with the \\"automatic rights control\\" (or some such) box checked in the Windows Media Player. After all the headache, and two years of continuous use, I do enjoy having this player.

I like to take long walks and listen to books or music. I bought this player so that I could put an entire book on one CD. Actually you can put a bunch. But when you try to listen to mp3s or regular CDS while walking, it skips alot. The only way that you can walk and listen is if you walk very, very, very slow and hold theplayer in the palm of your hand so that it is horizontal to the ground. I've gone back to my 3 year old Philips Magnovox CD player with its 45 second anti-skip because it does work, although I have to use multiple CDS again for listening to a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked good for a couple months then..........","review":"The RioVolt has great accessories but they are no use for a player that no longer works.

I will never buy another Sonic Blue product and whatever I buy to replace it won't be coming from Best Buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I had reservations... But no more!!!","review":"So far, everything that I have asked of this CD/MP3 player has been met. I had read previous reviews of the flaws but so far I have found them to be minimal. Flaws: yeah, the manual sucks. The on line manual is better but not complete (I have suggestions). The secondary headphones (non-earbuds) are worthless (why do they send them?). Earbuds are not bad. Quality headphones give you an experience! Anti-skip quality has been flawless (so far). I've worked in the yard shoveling, poring cement and landscaping without a skip yet (I'm still working on it). In my opinion, excluding the previously mentioned flaws, this is an exceptional mp3 player. With the downloadable firmware update, recharchable batteries (the recharge gives you the ability to charge, uncharge and then charge or cancel) playlist capabilities (which give you the ability to download Winzip playlists), yadda, yadda, yadda.

The first one quit working after about a year, and I bought a lesser model the second time and have only used it a month before it too stopped working. They were feature-rich players at first with little competition, which I think led Sonic to be a little lax in their customer service and quality. Right now I've decided to hold off another purchase until I see some long term customer reviews of the iRiver player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Garbage","review":"This product is worthless.

The only thing it will do is play the radio.Soon I discovered their support is nearly non-existant. Their online solutions library has never worked althought I've tried to access it many times. The rest of their website has no mention of this problem, although I've seen it posted many times here and on other review boards. I've email their tech support, but have yet to receive a response.

Instead I was completely blown away. The skip protection is impressive; only when violently shaking the unit could I get it to skip. While jogging or in the car it has never skipped under normal circumstances. The interface is quite intuitive with only a few exceptions (the EQ is tough to figure out, and it could really use a battery level indicator). No problems supporting any bitrate that I've thrown at it (VBR up to 192kbp, and flat bit rates from 256kbp down to 32kbp). The ver 1.00 firmware that ships with it is very stable.

To date, I have received no response, nor do I expect one.I had read reviews that described the extremely poor customer service and thought the person just had a bad experience and ordered the product anyway.

So I wrigged it to work, but a few months later out of the blue it wouldn't read the disc past the loading screen.

Mine gets extremely lite use, (I only use it every other month), but the the case has held up. I've taken it on several trips and never had a problem. I'm sure to keep it in the included case although it is a bit ugly it prevents scratching and gives a little cushion if you drop it. The sound quality is excellent and I haven't had any trouble with the firmware. Battery life is acceptable and the controls are easy. I haven't had any skipping problems either.

Now for the main character, Allison Garret. I don't think a vampire character could be more slow-witted. Even the rest of the characters were impatient, nymphomaniacs.

The raging inferno consumed the mind, thoughts, concepts, everything I believed, everything I left unexamined... it left the \\"ME\\" in ashes...As Stephen Wolinsky puts it, Nisargadatta's words are like a virus... once you are infected it spreads and leaves no trace of the life story you once held so dear.This book is a living expression of your True Self, the true Guru - if you only get one book, this is the one. But in reality, you don't need any books to discover what you really are. Nisargadatta said that Spirituality was as discardable as dishwater. You already are what you are seeking.

At the time, I subsequently looked for books that would help me to convey my understanding in clear English, and I returned to \\"I AM THAT\\" by Niz. Wow! Every line in the book resonated at the deepest level of enlightenment. I consider this the single best book on Advaita ever published. It cuts through illusion like a buzz saw.

Take your time when you are reading this book... its one of those books you can literally meditate of every sentence he speaks. I get goosebumps reading it.

I rate this I AM THAT and Ramana's Talks as two sources for inspiration and guidance for persons exploring the question \\"Who am I?\\" and, also, the spiritual philosophy of India. Both Ramana and Nisargadatta point us to the nonideological, nondogmatic Truth that is already present, rather than the endless mentalisms that fascinate so many in spirituality and religion and, thus, demonstrate the egoic complicating that only diverts us from the obvious and simple Truth \\"I AM.\\" Like Talks, this is in brief, dialogical segments, one segment short enough for reading in only a matter of minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"seemed like a good book and probably is but...","review":"Good book I think just waaay to bloody expensive!

Once read and understood, this book is sure to change one's perception towards life. His way of explaining the rather esoteric concepts like witnessing, awareness and consciousness, desirelessnees, purpose of life, present moment, etc. is very clear and simple.The Maharaj says \\" The seeker is he who is in search of himself\\".I therefore strongly feel that anybody who is interested in seeking him self/her self must have this book on his/her bookshelf to refer to more than often."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is it","review":"This is the one you want on a desert island.

Past - stops haunting you once you realize that past is just a product of mind and a bundle of memories.3. Present - becomes easy to live once you realize that what ever happens is automatic and is destined to happen - including the action and initiative by oneself out of free will.4. Future - becomes easy as something powerful leads you to the action to be performed for which you were born.While I have read thru the pages of this book, I have not grasped the full power of words of Sri.

Many questions asked of the master display a subtle desperation inherent in this predicament.Thirst for the divine can't be met because we are looking for answers away from the Source. In this book, this thirst meets the rock-solid, unyielding, uncompromising presence of the master.When reading this book i keep saying to myself without intending to - \\"i love this man\\". The interviews give me a sense of trust, of direction, of presence.A great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"great beginner book","review":"I bought this book back in 1993 when it came with a cassette. It's very good at teaching basic blues and helping you to play something quickly, which is important when you've first started with the guitar. If you're into Chuck Berry, Sokolow does a very good job at getting a player into his style (and by extension, the styles of a lot of other blues guitarists). There's really not any theory here, but I don't think a book for beginning blues needs theory. Sokolow provides a good balance between written instruction and allowing you to develop your ear. A really good book for beginning guitarists who like blues and early rock and roll."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview of many blues styles","review":"This book is an overview of the dominant genres of blues. It is a good book to begin exploration into the many flavors of blues music. If you want to learn how Robert Johnson or Chuck Berry or Albert King played then this is the beginning. I absolutely disagree with other reviewers about the difficulty and material covered. It is truly a basic blues guitar book and it is not a music theory text nor is it an in-depth dissection of every blues style. It is a book on HOW not WHY. To blame the book for not explaining \\"why\\" music does what it does is unfair to the author. To say that it is too difficult insults the author and musicians; nobody cared what Muddy Waters was playing before he was an accomplished guitarist...see what I mean?"},{"rating":"1","title":"you'll need fingerpicking ability","review":"If you don't fingerpick, your playing won't match the recording. Never. Fred is a good teacher and great in fingerpicking, but since this is a basic book, he shoud play it straight and be honest to the reader, since there isn't any explanation of how to apply this technique, and you're left wondering why the recording sound so better than your playing no matter how faithful you'll be to the tabs.That said, you can get good licks and a blues feel from the amount of licks here. That's it, the rest is complicated because:- scales fingering are lousy explained, there is no indication of which is the root note for example;- there are no double stops theory explanations, just the basic play here and here;- there is a good deal of chords that are thrown but no explained.I was impress with the large content, though. But I wouldn't buy another book of Fred, since they all seen to have this same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good work on infopartnering","review":"i've bought the book to use as a reference for my thesis. found the contents satisfactory and the authoring clear. there r not much reference books on efficient consumer response, therefore i advise this title to everyone interested in the subject.."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONLY THE FIRST PAGE IS ABOUT BITING!!!","review":"Only the first page is about biting, and the flip page concept is confusing.

Be warned.","review":"I bought this book because my toddler's friends were starting to bite and hit and I thought I would teach mine before she started to do it as well. Instead of teaching her it's wrong to bite, hit, kick, push, etc. it taught her to do it. She never grasbed the idea of the second page that shows you what you can do instead. Ever since we read it the first time she now says, \\"Hit Friends!\\" \\"Hit Mommy\\" \\"Kick Dogs\\". I was reading in a childhood development book later that we shouldn't teach by saying, No or Don't do this. Instead we should teach by saying what we want them to do. When you give them the idea of we don't do something, they don't understand and they now have the idea that they can hit friends or kick dogs.I'd recommend a book that says how toddlers should act like, we are gentle with animals. We hug our friends. Etc.I had to hide this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BITING!","review":"I GOT THIS BOOK AS PART OF A READING PROGRAM I ENROLLED MY DAUGHTER IN THROUGH OUR LOCAL LIBRARY.

I have noticed a decrease in hitting and biting.

My hope was that this book would be a great tool to help my almost 2 year old curb his new biting habit. Instead, the book introduced him to numbers of other negative behaviors, such as kicking our cats, \\"trying\\" to spit at me, etc. Needless to say, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"I purchased this book in the start of January as I thought it might be great to have on hand when these dubious behaviors (hitting, pushing, biting) come into our lives with our 18 month old. Well, somehow along the way, my child gravitated toward \\"hitting mommy\\" and it's now a battle we're fighting every day. He loves reading the book and as his love for the book increases, so does his horrible hitting. I can't say it's a direct/exact correlation, but I wouldn't deny that over the past month and a half, we went from zero to frequent hitting. Obviously after making the connection this week through a conversation with another mom in the same situation (same book), it has suddenly disapppeared and will not return to our bookshelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit negative","review":"I did not like this book for use with one-year-olds. It might work better with older toddlers. I felt the repetition of the word \\"biting\\" was a mistake. One-year-olds often don't understand that putting \\"no\\" before a word gives that word the opposite meaning, so reading a book that tells the children \\"biting, biting, biting,\\" gives the entirely wrong impression. The book does give the children ideas for what they can do instead of biting, which could be helpful for both babies and adults. Had I written the book, I would have emphasized the positive alternatives and shown proper uses for teeth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute stickers, but sort of teaches how to bite and hit","review":"I love Karen Katz books and so did my baby, so when we wanted to start teaching our son about hitting and biting, this book seemed the obvious choice. While it does have the cute illustrations that we love so much, and my son is absolutely enthralled with the stickers, it did the opposite of what we were aiming for. For instance, when we read the page that says \\"No hitting Mommy...\\" he hits me. It's like he doesn't hear the word \\"no\\" in the sentence. It's actually a confusing message for a child this age. He was nearly 12 months old when he got this for Christmas last year, but he thankfully lost interest in this one around 15 months. I'm not sorry to see it go. I think there are better books out there for introducing the idea of gentle touches."},{"rating":"2","title":"This a video for anyone who loves soundgarden!!","review":"If you dig Badmotorfinger then you will just love this!!

When done filming, they got together and edited their work, adding lots of slow motion. Then they added random shots and white noise in between moments in the interviews.Now, I know some people might not mind the camerawork here, but I think Soundgarden was a highly charismatic band and doesn't need the extra video techniques to create _____. (What were they going for, anyway? Drama? A sense of intoxication? MTV-style '90s sense of immediacy? The hunger and fear of buzzing around a room full of people?)

Ryan Reynolds IS \\"Van Wilder\\" , Jonathan Bennett is not even close. When the actor playing his prequel father is more beliveable thats bad . If they had made this movie with a diffrent title it might have been watchable fare, hot babes & college pranks. .

None of the main characters are trivialized, they all have qualities and character that show the best of human nature, compassion and generosity. Unlike Romeo and Juliet they sacrifice their (potential) love for the greater good.The directing and camera work are excellent. The story kept my interest throughout it's twists and turns.

The situation is complicated by her masquerading as a boy to earn some desperately needed money for her family.Although it deals with youong love, this movie is by no means a fairy tale, which is the fate of almost all Hollywood movies telling similar stories.

It is a shame that mankind had to wait for 63 years before a more balanced view of this human holocaust is finally brought to us. Reading about the cruelty of humans to each other, the needless civilian suffering, the summary executions and general barbarity one wonders whether the mid-twentieth century represents mankind's descent into a terminal stage of self-destruction. When we talk about atrocities, a lot of people tend to think of the Middle Ages, conveniently forgetting that the worst atrocities happened in our lifetimes, the 20th century. The Gulags, concentration camps, firebombing of cities, vivisection of human beings, revenge, selling out of governments....the list is long and a reminder that technical advance combined with moral degradation do not necessarily mean that mankind is becoming more civilized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but a little dry in spots.","review":"I liked the book and read it cover to cover.

Here Hastings states that the Ludendorff Bridge over the Rhine collapsed on March 15 (it fell on March 17), he writes that 28 engineers were killed (my research found 25 killed and 18 missing), Hastings writes the Ludendorff was closed on March 13(actually March 12) and that 5 pontoon bridges were opened across the Rhine. Actually one pontoon bridge was completed 200 yards downstream of the Ludendorff and another 2 miles upstream at Linz, both on March 11. If my research is correct, then Hastings has done some very sloppy fact checking.

The sound quality was a little bit under what we were expecting for such a production and that's why I didn't go and gave this film a flat 5.

All these funny stories writen with some black british humor about the american way of live from a man born in Iowa, living as an adult for 20 years in Britain and returning back to NH are true in the eyes of an european. When I came first to the USA, aged 45, I was full of prejudice. When I left, I knew everything was true and it's documented in this book. This is the way for aliens to learn how to love the american citizens and the american everyday live."},{"rating":"2","title":"I attempted to restrain myself","review":"I purchased the paperback before a flight. I read the first few essays and could not contain my chuckles. The passenger sitting next to me promptly relocated.The essays are extremely humourous and great fun to read.

And who better then a funny bloke like Bill Bryson to reflect on these in a combined 78 news paper columns as an American who lived in the UK for over twenty years who masters the art or exaggeration.

I have to say that, at least in part, the book had a realistic tone to it. Unfortunatly the author dropped the ball and filled most of the pages with dry statistics and a lot of personal preferences and opinions. I can't say the book is a wast of time, but it is a slacker! To put it another way, I felt the book was probably 20% of full potential.

His writing style is basic and at times awkward. The story is a simple chronological, third person narrative with no attempt to use any variety of literary device.While on the surface, the storyline seems to be sensitive to women, there is a consistent undertone of misogyny. Toth seems to equate physical beauty with self-centeredness. Batu is punished for her beauty and her self-confidence. She is punished by both the negative male characters and the \\"creator\\". It is as if Toth is trying to tell us that in order for a woman to be fullfilled she must not only be deprived of beauty but must be nearly destoyed by suffering as well.As for the butterfly on the cover? A cliche symbol of ugliness transformed into beauty while the story is the opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Superb and darkly hilarious as well as touching, the writing here is dead on and brilliant, simply brilliant.

You could describe the sections written from the points of view of children as unrealistic because of their advanced vocabulary. You could also look at them as using language to allow the reader to experience the consciousness of someone who could not themselves articulate it in precisely those words. This is what I enjoyed throughout this novel: St. Aubyn's ability to translate, or almost transcribe, wordless moments and the burble of consciousness (and self-consciousness) into finely turned sentences. Also, I would say that reviewers underestimate the linguistic abilities of young children. I found Thomas's speech to be extremely accurate in its combination of mimicry, wordplay, and unbounded originality. I know a three-year-old who talks almost exactly like him, and it was a pleasurable shock to read the words set down by someone half a world away."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive text","review":"Saphier & Gower's book is an invaluable resource for preservice & novice teachers or experienced teachers wishing to improve their pedagogical skills.

Sharply denying the government's strict anti-cannabis stance, and framing the his own illustrious, successful, and high-profile life with great acknowledgment for marijuana's beneficial herbal powers, David Ford is intriguingly unrepentant in its advocacy in behalf of marijuana usage. This along with wonderful anecdotes of his personal encounters with Gary Cooper, Don HO, Bing Crosby, Henry J. Kaiser, Groucho Marx, Wayne Newton, Richard Nixon, John F.

You spend much time to get the understanding of a subject. It isn't very much related with numerical analysis, instead modelling. Don't expect to find problems about using Numerical Formulas... Another disadvantage of this book is that it is divided into two parts, so, you must spend too much money to get the full content from two parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"a bibliomaniac","review":"I was expecting a much darker(creepy?) book from what I had read of the excerpt from the synopsis given by the bookstore. It turned out to be a very humorous travel log by Kevin Rushby's search of the Thug Cult. There are many entertaining encounters with the people in India, great descriptions of the food there, atrocious hotel rooms, the hustle and bustle of a very populated country - all a very informative and highly entertaining look of a Brit with a wonderful sense of humor travelling through ancient India. If you enjoy cooking or travel essays, this book's a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting topic and travels but....","review":"This book deals with some very interesting, yet somewhat disparate topics. Rushby's travelogue/history was apparently inspired by his learning of the British colonial administrator Sleeman, who allegedly eliminated the thuggees from India. He travels across India to investigate the thuggees, but somehow mixes them up with Indian bandits, gangsters, and assorted mischief-makers. His biggest problem is his tendency to write in a stream-of-conscious style that is confusing. He jumps around from different places, to different topics, switches between travelogue, history, and commentary, without effectively transitioning and explaining himself. At times he refers to phenomena, places and people without any explanation of who or what they are. With just a little better writing and editing, this could have earned five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milwaukee 6523","review":"Great product.

Hattenhauer's book, unfortunately, is a major disappointment. His interpretations are limited and overdetermined, he completely pathologizes the admittedly troubled Jackson, and (perhaps most alarming, given Jackson's fierce, dark wit) he seems to have no sense of humor. Moreover, Hattenhauer's style is so jargon-ridden it almost comes across as a parody. (And yes, I do understand and support the idea that literary criticism, like all academic disciplines, needs and deserves its own technical vocabulary; I also understand that books intended for academic audiences need not be \\"readable\\" in the same way as books intended for the general public.)

Who would have thought that the harshest attack on current anti-drug policy, demanding legalization, would come from a Reagan Republican? John Lott's book More Guns, Less Crime, was another highly credible book because it also came from an unlikely source. Diaz's book is disappointing and flawed because his agenda comes across on every page. The book becomes frustrating and painful. I find it interesting that reviewers on this page assume that people who pan this book only do so because they haven't read it. We've read it. But this book brings to mind the saying that a mind is like a parachute. It only works when it's open.

(no kidding - they are designed to be that way!)The author's agenda to eliminate guns is thinly disguised as \\"increased regulation\\".The book does not address the root cause of violence in America.

But in the hothouse atmosphere of antigun writing, it doesn't have to: political correctness and emotionalism substitute for intellectual rigor.

Gun violence is clearly on the rise in America and the number of Americans killed annually by guns will soon surpass the tens of thousands killed in auto accidents."},{"rating":"1","title":"What does Tom Diaz smoke?","review":"I purchased this book hoping to get some good \\"ammo\\" to argue with my gun toting friends on why guns should be regulated. Tom Diaz has not done the anti-gun forces a favor with this book; the arguements put forth in it are so obviously made up it's ridiculous. While it's possible some readers might be led down the path of absurdity with Mr. Diaz's data - even minimal investigation of the data presented in this book will clearly demonstrate that much of it is made up.A waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, concise and readable report into a complex issue","review":"Diaz succeeds in creating a detailed and objective report on the gun industry today and its flaws. This very readable book keeps the reader interested throughout and offers an educated argument for gun control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit Whining","review":"Why doesn't he understand that the only award winning studies and almost every US government study shows that more gun control only means more crime. I'd keep writing, but reviewing a book that has more B.S. than most high school term papers (I'm an english teacher) isn't worth the time it takes to reveiw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Tom Diaz does the anti-gun-rights movement no favors with this shallow, biased diatribe against the firearms industry in America. The book is clearly an attempt to provide legal and philosophical support for the ongoing strategy of suing the firearms industry into oblivion, but the book's rhetoric and half-supported arguments detract from any impact a better written book could have made.I encourage readers interested in the gun rights debate to spend their money elsewhere. There are better choices on both sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Enemy Speaks","review":"Never have I read A book so steeped in blatant misinformation than this.Your statistical breakdown regarding gun deaths falls very short of what most of us call \\"truth\\". Such as including incidents in which law-enforcement used deadly force with a firearm against deadly criminals. Twisting figures and facts to advance an agenda to disarm the nation makes this book worthy of a place near my toilet.The Second Amendment is NOT about crime Mr. Diaz. It is about the American people retaining the ability to resist government tyranny, which we all see and know is mounting.Am I a \\"gun nut\\"? Yes. I am also a \\" free speech\\" nut, \\"free press\\" nut and a person who understands that this book is on the wrong side of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless drivel","review":"This is why policy should not be from the heart. It ignores WAY too many facts that would clutter up the argument.

Your time would be better spent reading the many fan fictions based on this show at various websites.The characterizations had none of the flavor of those on the show, and were virtually unrecognizable. I have to doubt if the author ever even watched the show at all.I was hoping to like this book, but was sadly disappointed. As the other reviewer of this book noted, the only likeness to the show were the names, and not even all of those were right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I wanted to read this book after watching the classic movie with Rex Harrison and Gene Tierney. That movie was based on a book by HA Dick. This book, however, bears little if any resemblance to the original book or the movie made from it. It's apparently based on some TV show. It's dreadful: badly plotted with two timelines, pathetic twist ending, and a courtroom drama that reads like typical pre-Law & Order Hollywood nonsense, right down to the evidence not submitted for discovery and the surprise recognition of the actual murderer in the courtroom.Go find either the movie or the original book, and don't waste your time with this tripe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so inspiring","review":"This book had some cute project ideas, but not many that truly inspired me. Many of the projects just didn't tie together into themed rooms. To me, the rooms were not that creative nor ones that I would want to use. This book really wasn't what I was looking for for children's room ideas. If you are just looking to make a few projects (i.e. decorated lamp, storage box, or bulletin board) this book may be what you are looking for. However, if you want to totally redo your child's room another book may provide more inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Debbie's Do's","review":"I am such a fan of Debbie Travis.

(It was blowing 46 degree air after 2 hours). And it warms up quickly - 14 degrees in only an hour and 1/2.Add to that a continuous whir noise, so you don't want to bring it into your motel room and leave it plugged it and the battery load which occurs if you leave it in the car overnight, this is a limited use device (in my humble opinion)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koolatron not at advertised","review":"The Koolatron does not provide any additional cooling capacity or ability to keep cool beyond what any other insulated bag would do, and is not as cold as a bag that has had a frozen ice pack added to it.

I do not believe the capability of this container warrants the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"A very good travel cooler. Now it won't cool a warm product down immediately, but it will keep pre-chilled items cold. Example: used it as a second cooler/fridge for our boat, pre-chilled items were in it all day, 90+ degrees and things remained cold. Now internal size may be an issue, the internal fan does take up some space, but for our needs, 2 smaller tubs of fruit and bottles of water, it did do the job !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TeeJay","review":"Took the cooler on a family trip from the east coast to Yellowstone and it worked great.

Downie's evocative writing captures many facets of this beautiful city, from the booksellers along the Seine to the quiet pleasures of a morning in the Jardin du Luxembourg or an evening stroll in the Ile St. Louis. He combines the knowledge, and occasional cynicism, of a long-time resident with the wonderment of a first-time visitor, and he does it beautifully. This is not a guidebook, but a love letter to a city that, for all its faults, remains one of the world's greatest treasures. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exploring the clues to Paris's mysteries","review":"Downie's essays offers a quirky sense of humor and a wonderful eye for the details behind the details that at once demystify Paris and add to her mystery. Although the book is not a guide per se, the essays make me want to follow Downie's trails. As such, the book would have been better served with an index and some neighborhood maps. After all, give us a few more clues."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paris to San Francisco","review":"Having just finished reading \\"Paris, paris\\" I recommend it with great enthusiasm. As a 20+ year resident of San Francisco and a 30+ year visitor to Paris, I was pleased with a San Francisco native's take on Paris. They are my two favorite cities in the world; OK Venice is right up there too.I am particularly fond of the Marais, which is described in intelligent and insightful detail. The description of the \\"gentrification\\" of the Marias is particularly compelling and I find striking overlap to a similar transition in the Mission District of San Francisco. Like the Mission and Marais, I'm certain that there are countless neighborhoods around the globe facing similar challenges. I applaud this book for the effort to make us all stop and think of the consequences.

This book has 31 prose sketches of \\"Paris Places,\\" \\"Paris People,\\" and \\"Paris Phenomena,\\" including one about the Luxembourg Gardens, one of my favorite parks in Paris.This was a really great book, and I loved Downie's various essays and the subjects he chose to write about.

What a delight. David Downey describes aspects, areas and people of Paris today and in history in a unique and interesting way. Whether discussing Place des Vosges or the working barges on the Seine or the light(s) I felt I was being introduced to a Paris that I might have seen but didn't really know. It is not a travel guide in the sense of being a list of places to go and things to do, but it will definitely enhance any traveler's trip to Paris, especially as you visit the particular areas that are a focus of the book.

The book is a gorgeous, insightful combo of regional history and traditions, the shepherd's life, the journey itself over an astonishing terrain, De Larrabeiti's physical toughening and mastering of century-old skills... But, most of all, the ancient stories and legends he heard... Night after night around the campfire, each man telling his favorite as a bottle of brandy passed from hand to hand. We're not talking tepid fairy tales here. Rather seiges, irony, betrayal, tragedy, acts of faith, Saracen raids, hand-to-hand combat and fatal love. Last but not least, De Larrabeiti writes really stylish prose. Can't wait to read the rest of his stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best maternal infant care plan book","review":"I used this in college during my OB rotation and now I am a clinical adjunct and teaching clinicals.

The album featured the hit single \\"So You Ran\\" featuring Fran Cosmo's high vocal reach, which could be the reason that he was chosen to be Boston's lead singer to replace Delp. This song is available in MP3 format. Unfortunatly the self-titled album was the only release by the band. I would say that any fan of Boston or related work would enjoy the album.

The voices dubbed do NOT match the characters, like in the first couple of seasons of DBZ, (Ian Corlett, Scott McNeil, etc.). Even better about this is the fact that you DO NOT START FROM EPISODE ONE!

The results don't soar quite as high, particularly with the tossed-off quality of the opening blues, which is dominated not by Duke but by the organ of Wild Bill Davis. But the closing track, Duke's \\"Portrait of Mahalia Jackson\\", is one of the most haunting and singularly beautiful things Ellington ever recorded. It's like he's there floating with the spirit of Mahalia above some church somewhere in the dark Louisiana night. Soon the Duke would take his place alongside the musical angels, but he left this heavenly message to transport you, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd...great jazz!!!","review":"Duke Ellington is unquestionably a great legend of jazz!

How does it affect all of them? They are all angry and feel somewhat responsible for that but they have to deal with the situation and help each other. The rest of it you have to see for yourself. There are some interesting twists and turns there.

The father is a psychologist that is so incompetent that his patients again and again criticize him for his total incompetence, and we don't see him do actual work (although we do see the typical plethora of weird patients on the couch). Nanni Moretti's acting and directing is delightful but he has not given himself anything to do. The mother seems to do little else than advance the plot, and the daughter could be more interesting if she was fleshed out at all.I could see the rating for this movie go down in my head as it went on, out of boredom.

The story is set among the \\"Yao\\" people but no information is given as to who the Yao people are or where they live or whether this is a story told in Africa. The story seems to be set in East Africa (the slavers appear to be Arab, not European). Some background information would be very useful.

Not that good of a deal anymore.With the price of regular USB memory card readers reaching low levels, this device is needless.Also, if you were thinking of using the adapter on Linux, you will need a driver.

I also borrowed a single rail from a friend but didn't like it at all. I don't remember the brand, but it was the kind you just stick between the mattress and box spring. Everytime my daughter would roll against it, the rail would move and she would end up stuck between the rail and the bed. So I figured I needed one that would hold securely onto the mattress.This rail has been great so far. Very safe and steady. I just wish it would be wider, but other than that I have absolutely no complains and the price is just right! Specially for a set of 2.

I have given sort of a review I guess in commenting on \\"JESS JESS\\"'s review. So my diatribe is gotten to by clicking on COMMENT 1 at the end of his review.To be brief, I loved it back in the 60's and I love it now. It sounded so different from anything we'd ever heard where I come from, and it was just great to hear someone singing with one of our favorites. But, you know, that was in a totally different world and time. We Southerners/hillbilly/country lovers were laughed at and made fun of back then. But we didn't care, we still loved our hillbilly/country music. We appreciated and treasured things like that. It sounded great in those days. Even on our scratchy records. I didn't pass up listening to any of the songs. I played the whole thing over and over. I'm just glad to be able to hear it again on the CD I purchased through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neglected mini-masterpiece","review":"Wonderful collection of the two albums Jones and Pitney made together in the mid-60s. The pairing sounds far-fetched, but works amazingly well and their voices are a great surprise match. The material is generally first-rate as well (a couple of hokey bits, but that is par for the course for Jones, who seems to have a soft spot for corn even today). Fans of either singer need this record, fans of country music need this record, fans of duet singing need this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Pleased","review":"I had heard this album back in about 1962 and had been looking for the Song, Wreck on the Highway (written by Roy Aucuf) and sung jointly by George Jones and Gene Pitney.

The transaction was handled accurately and professional by Amazon and all concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better solo releases I've heard","review":"As a longtime Kansas fan, I was intrigued when I stumbled across this album(in vinyl). The first cut, and the title cut, jumps out from the beginning. The second cut, \\"Get too Far,\\" is also up tempo. The next song is the best on the album. \\"So many Nights\\" is a classic love song. Only better. Steve Walsh's vocals melt in your ears on ballads. The rest of the album is also very good. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Solo Debut","review":"Schemer Dreamer (SD) is Steve Walsh's first solo album, recorded in 1980 having split from Kansas.SD is an essential purchase for any fan of Walsh and Kansas and features a good collection of songs. Absolute standouts are Every Step Of The Way and So Many Nights, both of which are instant classics and would feel right at home on any Kansas album, Audio Visions and before.My only criticism is that it lacks the bite in places that Walsh had when with Kansas and when he wrote with Kerry Livgren. For instance Wait Until Tomorrow is just crying our for better lead guitar work that someone like Livgren could have provided, as is clear from his contribution on You Think You Got It Made. I'm also not a fan of the trumpet and sax on Wait Until Tomorrow.That said this is still a strong album - so its a pity that it's only available on import.Recommendation to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great solo album","review":"Having been a fan of Steve Walsh and Kansas since I was 16, I am now 50), I was delighted to find this CD available through Amazon.

I knew it would be this way since I saw it when I bought the album--but on closer reflection, the imagery is hilariously tongue-in-cheek (I hope!). Let me say that despite being a huge vocalist-fan, and fully in Steve's corner both vocally and musically, that this album was a disappointment. The songs are okay for what they are, and Steve's voice is, of course, powerful as usual--but the songs are dull and lifeless rock-wise. Maybe I didn't research this album carefully enough before purchase, but there is nothing whatsoever rockin'--prog, or otherwise--in this album. I was expecting a little more rockin' power here. But if you want lighter-side balladeering and radio-friendly-lite pop--then buy this album---just not for these outrageous double-digit Amazon prices!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Dog Sick......","review":"Well I have a Cocker Spanial, not the brightest bulb in the box, but he's a good eater, about most everything,,,,,, Ate 2, now won't touch them,and been eating grass for the last several days, (upset stomach)Hope you have better luck.Nick AndersonKey West, Florida305-292-2974"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"Great cd, but to fully enjoy Frankie, you must buy the other cd that goes along with it.

As other reviewers have stated, it is about a father's love for his son, and his longing to return home. But it is about all war, and about the uncertainty all parents have in a war; about the longing to return, and the uncertainty they will.It is about the unbearable ache in our lives when we long to tell those we care for that it will all be well, when we do not know that it will be well. It is about the tension between the obligation to tell the whole truth (as it is told in the drawings), and to tell only the truth that could be understood (which is written in the letter).

Raz Mesinai, formerly of Sub Dub, is a true musical genius.

Not that the style is similar to those musicians, this is much more middle eastern, but quite frankly there are few artists I know to compare this stuff with.

It is so easy to change cartridges to fit what ever need you have at the moment. You can laminate, apply Permanent or temporary Adhesive and also do various combinations.

They're almost all full or double-paged and in brilliant color. There is an occassional paired \\"original period\\" photo in black and white for an interesting contrast. Unlike some reviewers, I found the text informative because views of the clients and current owners are included - as opposed to just the critics and designers, as in most of the other books. The several appendices are very useful, as well. I would highly recommend this book at more than its \\"suggested\\" price, let alone at its incredibly low bargain price.

The book contains the history of each house, their designers and how the present owners came about collecting their furniture and accessories. Most of the important Fifties designers are featured - Nelson, Eames, Jacobsen, Heywood-Wakefield, Bertoia, Saarinen, Noguchi, just to name a few. There is a list of retail outlets, manufacturers and distributors at the back of the book that those of us hoping to acquire some of the furniture featured in the book will find useful.

Even worse, in a book that's supposed to be about the 2001 team's march to the title, he couldn't help but continue carrying water for two of his favorites -- Terry Glenn and Drew Bledsoe, constantly making excuses for them. For example, out of nowhere and out of context, he inserts a laughable screed against anyone who dares to criticize Bledsoe. It's bizarre! It's as if he had this whole rant built up and couldn't figure out where to put it and then couldn't contain it anymore and had to stick it wherever he happened to be in the book.Save your money and go elsewhere. Or if you do feel compelled to read it, use a library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing distracts an otherwise interesting book","review":"The book has dozens of interesting tidbits, such as the source of the Faulk pass to Brady. It has some great quotes from both Patriots and their opponents. Unfortunately, much of it is lost in a writing style worthy of a sixth grade essay. It almost seems like Nick Cafardo read conversations into a tape recorder and then just wrote them out verbatim. He also has the odd habit of disecting individual games during the Patriots' run backwards. He will discuss second half tactics first, and then go onto the first half. Disconcerting to say the least.In my opinion, this book was poorly put together and then rushed out the door so it would be out while the Patriots Superbowl win was still fresh on New Englander's minds and they would pick up the book.

However, that closeness does give Milkowski some insights into Jaco's personality that another author probably wouldn't have. Milkowski correctly recognizes that one of Jaco's greatest problems was the people surrounding him. One striking thing about the book was how many people close to Jaco blamed the \\"system\\" for failing Jaco (the author included), yet amazingly, how his family allowed a total stranger to convince a judge to release him under his own recognizance, 4 days before he received the fatal beating at the Midnight Bottle Club. However, unlike the treatment of John Belushi in Wired or Jim Morrison in No One Here Gets Out Alive, Milkowski avoids mythologyzing.

I was hoping that the video for 'Perfect Tonight' was included in this album since it is one of the catchier songs in this effort, but if you really would like to see that one too, you can always log on to their official website, Lambrettamusic.com. Some other catchy tunes from this album include 'Wake Up Girl' and 'Piece of My Heart'. This is a great album to have especially if you've just heard about this band and you decide to buy their most recent album, 'The Fight'. Linda is one great vocalist with a unique voice.

It took me two hours to solve the problem. My father, who is a novice user of this iMac, doesn't know what a driver is, and never would have been able to get this simple disk drive working. I'm sure there are tens of thousands of novice users of old iMacs who will have the same problem. So I give one star for their web site, which is well-organized, and one star for the hardware, which actually works after you spend hours downloading software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work for mac 10.5.8","review":"This item claims to work for mac OS X and higher, but won't work for mac 10.5.8.

Do yourself a favor, don't buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor quality poles","review":"Just want to repeat that the poles are JUNK. I figured some of the reviewers just got a bad batch, and decided to take a chance anyway. The screen house went up like a charm - oops, except that one corner looked a little weird. But no big deal. The next day took it down after an evening with no rain, light breeze, and in a very sheltered yard. WHILE TAKING IT DOWN, one pole bent severely and two others bent slightly, but it was clear that all would be useless in two trips (maybe one). This was not poor ability on our part - we know how to set up and take down camping equipment! And I know Coleman is not a top brand, but I find it extraordinary that quality has become this poor. To their credit, the return to Amazon was quick, easy, and free. Don't waste any time or $ with this screen house."},{"rating":"1","title":"not happy","review":"I have had 3 screen tents - all made by different companies. The others all lasted for several years and finally junked when the zippers died. The Coleman was only on its second summer when it croaked. The fabric became brittle from the sun and tore easily on top. The configuration of the poles on top made it hold water in a couple of pockets on top which meant you had to go out and drain it or it would of collapsed. The poles were lighter weight than others I have had and bent easily.I think I'll check another brand and skip Coleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointment","review":"I bought this because of the easy assembly info on the box. It's easy to assemble- you just need about 3 people. 1 of the shock cords broke when I was assembling and the whole thing came down in a crash. Will try to get Coleman to replace poles. The poles are way too weak and the whole thing is really flimsy till the screen is attached. The screen house part itself is really nice- too bad they didn't put it with a good set of poles."},{"rating":"1","title":"coleman 13x11 insta-clip screen room","review":"I was very disappointed with this product, Coleman 13x11 Insta-Clip Screenroom.

I set up the screen room and before I could get it fully set up the tiedown tabs continued to rip off.

Never tried it on the grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same problem with bending poles","review":"This is just to corroborate earlier reviews about the terrible quality of the steel poles. The screen room itself is great, sheds water well and is roomy enough to store all our outdoor gear PLUS a standard campsite picnic table. But, you have to be very, VERY careful putting the poles together properly, and even when you do the force of stretching the tent out to clip it to the poles can cause them to bend at the elbow joints. Once this happens the might bend back once, but after that they are weakened to the point of being unusable; plus, they rust as soon as the paint is broken from being bent. They'll also twist in the center hub at the top of the screen, making removal from the hub a wrench-inducing nightmare. Naturally, Coleman will sell you replacement poles...at $17.50 apiece. Multiply that price times FOUR poles, and I'll be buying a new screen for next season."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never buy another coleman","review":"With some difficulty I was able to erect this screen house by myself. My bad, since the instructions recommend 2 or more people. When disassembling, a pole broke - not bent, broke. Then another pole's shock cord snapped. I was able to repair the broken pole for a second trip. When erecting the tent a third pole broke. It was unable to handle the stress when I inserted the pin at the corner of the tent.I went online for parts at Coleman's website to find that it had been discontinued. Perhaps too many complaints?I had a similar experience with a tent. I think I will try another manufacturer next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nicely styled, but too fragile","review":"As soon as I had a chance after it was delivered, I decided to set up the screen house in the back yard as a trial run for camping. The directions were very clear, and even though it suggested two people for set up, I was easily able to set it up myself. I enjoyed the roominess and layout, and before long I had chairs and a table set up in it just to enjoy eating outdoors.When I went to take it down, however, disaster struck. There are no explicit instructions for taking it down, so I tried reversing the set up directions. As soon as I lowered one of the four poles, the entire structure collapsed. Three of the poles buckled and were subsequently unusable.When I contacted Coleman for support, I was told that the item was discontinued two years earlier, and that the poles were no longer in stock. They referred me to a custom tent pole fabricator, but the cost would have been excessive.Fortunately, I was able to return the item to Amazon for credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Birthday Party Treat Bag Jokes","review":"We had my daughter's birthday party seeing Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

BUT,it clips around your earlobe and this irritated the hell out of me. If you wear earrings you're gonna have to take them off to mount the unit on your ear. I had to tell my contacts to hold on while I fooled around to get this thing on. I felt as tho it was going to fall off at any moment, and that I would have to worry about how I moved while talking. I didn't want to do this. I get too engrossed in my conversations for this. NOT FOR ME."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality, average fit","review":"I bought this product as I want a headset that would not suddenly drop off when the power died.

Naturally, being a college student, I was looking for something cheap but functional so i bought I bought this for my iphone thinking that it was a great deal. I was really surprised when i tried to use it because first, the thing is confusing and there is no comfortable way to wear it and second, the plugin was the wrong size for my phone(way too small). Essentially, I spent a little bit of money (what very little I did have) on something on the off chance that it might work and I was wrong. My advice is, if you have an iphone or any phone that can use iphone headphones, don't buy this. Its a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I purchased this unit because it seemed to fill my needs; and that I've had very good luck with other Plantronics equipment.But there are two problems that prevent me from using this product.1.

However, when I did a Zoom on it I saw it was by Coleman so I went to the Coleman website and found it for $200 or so. Then, I checked my FAVORITE place to buy stuff...Amazon.com and purchased it for $179. Wow, what a Buy. Anyway, we received it and put it up at our kennel area and it is everything we had hoped for. Sturdy, Attractive, Ventilated, and a real Bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"GeoSport Screen","review":"I think the picture is misleading.

I'd say the first setup took about 45 minutes total. (Which was a little longer than I wanted.) I figure each additional setup will be shorter. This tent is very durable. We've been having high-winds all weekend and it's out back doing it's thing--taking the whipping wind. Which makes me very happy. I only gave it 4 stars because it's much smaller than I thought it would be. One other reviewer said it could hold a picnic table a couple chairs and cooler. Um--not really. We have a picnic table, 6 ft long. If I put that in there, there would be no other room what-so-ever. I'd say it fits about 4-5 chairs nicely and a cooler. This tent does it's job though.

All are terrific. The three merengues are average, the only one I liked was the remake of A Dios le pido. It has a very smooth tropical feel to it. The bachatas that are potential chart busters in my opinion are: #1, Ay, ay, ay, #4 Ay amor, #5 Chocolate hay en tu pecho, # 7 Vuelve amor. I will confess #4 is my favorite.

Actually he is her father-in-law. Not terrific, since she reports on all this psychic healing at face value, without really tieing it to any substantive facts. These people all believe in witches and evil causing them bodily harm as a way of pushing off the problem to somebody else, much as we are so prone to lawsuits. I do think there is a definite connection between mental soundness and physical well-being. These Peruvians seem to view the world they live in as full of evil witches and people who wish them harm. Does jungle living make people so paranoid? There probably is something in psychic energy being able to heal, and people's auras telling of their illnesses; but this author does not really have enough empirical data."},{"rating":"2","title":"what it is like to work and wonder way way down under","review":"This is a clearly written, funny, moving and fascinating account of what it was like for the author to work in Antarctica over a number of years. While he has told it like a one-year trip, in fact it is a distillation of 14 years experience.The book is distinguished in several respects. First, the photography is wonderful - just it is worth the price of admission. Second, there is the story of working there as a scientist, in particular the work underwater. It is really fascinating and full of quirky tidbits, like mummified seals thousands of years old or the faulty insulation of some fish. Third, there are the personal tales of what it is like for the residents, and they are harrowing not in any adventuresome sense, but in the psychological demands placed on them. Women beware of living there with so many hungry males!Warmly recomended. It is also beautifully written from a stylistic standpoint. Truly a mini-masterpiece of the genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent!","review":"very good, very informative, and written in plain english. it is a good book because it focuses on small independent retailing, not service or production like most \\"start your own business\\" books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous voice","review":"Howard Keel has one of the all time great, rich, baritone voices of our time.

The plastic frame is not wide enough to prevent a child's hands from gripping the sides while bouncing. My 8 month old son did this and smashed his hand into the door frame. Yes, we set the item high enough so that he was on his tip toes when sitting. The item was set in the middle of the door frame. I guess no one at Evenflo realizes that kids go side-to-side - not just up and down. That means you can only safely use it with a double-wide door.

I was so extremely upset that I took it back to Babies-r-us and they were kind enough to let me exchange it for the Graco one.

We have the FP Jumperoo at the house, and while my daughter liked it, there was NO comparing her reaction to this jumper! She LOVED it. Especially since it gave her the ability to move in a gentle swaying motion, turn in circles and of course, bounce.For those who gave this a less-than-stellar review, I'd recommend:A) using this on an older baby, not a 4-5 mon old. (Keep in mind that the instructions recommed that the baby should be able to sit unassisted!) andB) use in a DOUBLE witdth doorway! There is NO WAY this could be safe in a single doorway.

We used it from the time she was 4 months to almost 10 months. We have a nice wide doorway that we were able to put the jumper in. We never had any problems with fingers getting pinched or heads getting bumped. We believe her coordination is better because she used this so often. At just 14 months, she could jump with both feet off the ground. It is a quality product at a reasonable price. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed reaction","review":"We bouth this product a couple of days ago. My daughter is seven months old. So far, she really likes Jump & Go but only AFTER we put her in the seat. She is a bit scared during the seating process. But once she is in it, she starts smiling and laughing when she turns around. Unlike a stationary entertainment center, this one doesn't take a lot of space, it's easy to put up and take down so for someone who doesn't have much space - this is the product to buy. The only thing that I dislike a lot is that the toy which goes with Jump & Go is VERY loud. We tried to tape the speaker so that the sound is a bit lower but it's hard to do because of the way the toy is. So I would not turn on the toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"My child loves this jumper! Not only does he jump like mad, he spins himself silly.

Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"What a horrible design! First of all my daughter hates the strap behind her head which she is constantly banging against and then the strap that goes in the bouncing mechanism is all twisted and won't stay straight. As a result it is fraying and will break if I let her bounce in it much longer. Luckily my daughter never smashed her hands against the door frame but as other reviewers noted this is entirely possible and likely given the design.
