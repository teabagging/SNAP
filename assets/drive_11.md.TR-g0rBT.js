Ulmer Masterpiece","review":"Detour is one of the all-time great examples of film noir. The use of shadowy black and white cinematography, a star-crossed protagonist, a femme fatale, a cynical voice-over narration and ambiguous morality can almost be used to define the Film Noir Genre. Brought together by legendary director Edgar G. Ulmer in only a few days and on a diminutive budget, Detour's B-Film sets only add to both the film and the genre, a true testament to the mastery of Ulmer.Al Roberts (Tom Neal) makes a series of bad choices that bring him to a very low point in his life. Vera (Ann Savage) plays the quintessential Bad Girl. Their witty repartee and in truth, much of the dialogue throughout is a main attraction of this film. The plot is revealed in flashbacks and continues on uncompromisingly to the conclusion. The characterizations, dialogue, plot and photography all contribute to make this taut, gritty film a must for film noir enthusiasts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Detour ...","review":"I am a great admirer of \\"Detour\\" which is probably the best low-budget film noir ever made. But this DVD is a piece of junk. It is transferred from a lousy, battered 35mm print that has badly spliced gaps and screwed-up film footage in crucial scenes, obliterating some of the best dialogue. The company that put this out should be ashamed of itself, especially considering this film is now considered a low-budget masterpiece. If you have no copy of this, get the Sinister Cinema VHS. It is a much higher quality print."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Film Noir","review":"Film Noir flourished in the forties and early fifties. Bogart's Maltese Falcon supposedly is the first film with a destructive hard guy and scarlet woman pairing. Love rarely works out and you're more likely to get bumped off than score the perfect heist. The cinematography is black and white with plenty of fog or dark shadows. There's an underlying dread, a cynical Chesterfield cigarette on the lip of coming doom.Detour is classic Film Noir. It's a B flick that is at first glance primitive, maybe shot in ten days. Tom Neal is in Ann Savage's web after he accidentally kills a man. It is so simple yet so intriguing. Ann Savage is forgotten, but not by me. She is the greatest evil woman ever in film. Rent this one immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take a detour away from this DVD","review":"I wasn't all that impressed with this movie, finding it too self-consciously \\"noir-ish\\" for its own good. But you know something? I'm going to give it another chance sometime in the future, as I can't help but feel that the reprehensible shape of the print used to make this DVD contributed to my lack of enjoyment of the story. In fact, it's like I haven't even SEEN the whole movie, as entire lines of dialogue were missing every few minutes, accompanied by horrible splices. Trust me, stay away form this particular DVD and wait for someone to release a print of it that's at least watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"NOIR AT IT'S DARKEST","review":"Come on, it doesn't get cooler than 'Detour'! No budget, no stars, and a wacked-out story of hellish bad luck. Tom Neal is what passes for our hero, a pianist en route to the coast to meet up with his girl when 'fate sticks out a foot to trip him'. It's really amazing to see how great this thing turned out considering how little it had going for it. Watch it at like 3 a.m., when everything is a little foggy, and you'll appreciate it even more.

I have not found any other book which is a primary source on Bushido and I am using it as a supplement to teaching Mishima Yukio in a class on film and literature.

Whilst this book is very much \`of its time' and may seem unusual at times to western readers, it has a lot to offer if you take the time to digest it's wisdom properly and think about the ideas enclosed. Far from being about fighting and killing (although these aspects are touched upon) this is about living with a certain peace and honour. Films, like \`Ghost Dog', have made this more popular than it might have been, but there is a lot more to this book that you may originally perceive and you won't regret giving it a read and contemplating the wisdom inside.

There is a ton of wisdom and insight into not just the Samurai way of life, but the way people - particularly men - have changed (mostly for the worse) over time. This book is not about how to fight, or even being a samurai so much as it is about spirit, and courage in the face of life as well as death. There is an occasional absurd anecdote, but 99% of this book is insightful to this day.

It is a short book, but it should take longer to read than the Bible. I read it in two weeks, thanks to the cold, but, still, I missed more than I can imagine. Should your eyes miss one word, or a single thought take you away, you need read the passage again and again. This book will change your perspective... change how you view life. It is VERY philosophical, if you concentrate on the reading.

The lack of PVC and the somewhat Earth-friendly material led me to this mat rather than other longer mats.Early-on, the mat was both too sticky and too slippery. The slightest moisture made it slippery, and it is sticky when dry. Two or three times I stubbed my big toe in a big, painful way going from down dog to lunge. I do have a certain amount of excess girth that gets in the way of some maneuvers but I never stubbed my toe while using my first PVC mat. My leader thinks the mat is too sticky.

The Author tells of the events that led up to the attack and the horrific aftermath of it. The book tries to tell of the reasons for the attack, although we may never know. Why did the US Government and Israel cover up this terrible event, could the truth be so terrible that the American people would forever distrust the government?The Author makes us realize that if the truth is so terrible, it can be covered up and hidden from us. A call for a Congressional investigation that is honest and truthful is called for and should be undertaken so tragic events like this will never again occur in America's or Israel's history.A great military book and exciting history.

Very interesting!Israel never does anything wrong. ... For every event there is a good and long explanation for every major contravesy that shows that israels critics are just big mean anti-semites. Israel is simply never wrong.Israel has long used the tactic of faking attacks by other countries.

McDonald, chief of Naval Operations in 1967 was also interviewed and he \\"had no recollection of any such conversation with Fulbright.

Anecdote aside, I am aware that my review lacks proper grounds, but since there is so much to read and too little time, I strongly suggest you to look for other works of this author. During the first chapter I seems to be going great, the drama was cleaver and catchy. But suddenly in the second chapter it just stops and all the events seem to be going nowhere. Besides the construction of the language is boring and confusing. It feels like the author worked in this novel for a while, then left it during some years locked in a closet and one fine day decided to complete it, but without being at ease doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fable","review":"This was a great book with great appearance.

Faulkner's language and structure was not beautiful but forced and didn't seem to come natural like it had for me in his other works. There were times when I was reading when I thought that Faulkner was enjoying himself ramble aboout a non-sensical detail that left me frustrated and wanting to put the book down for good, but I carried on and finished the book.The book had its moments but not enough of them to make a clear and understandable story for me.

It is a chore to read. Only in a few passages does the reader have the sense that the writer can tell a good story. Worse than that, the characters are like Rorschak blots with the Christian mythology mixed in. Stick with Faulkner's southern writings for characters who remain in your memory and images that are profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not an anti-war novel...","review":"... this is a poor attempt at rediscovering the truths of Christ's passion. Faulkner says very little as to what his opinion of war is, his characters instead demonstrate an ethic that is apart from war. It is instead a story that lives within a war without being a commentary on war. Unfortunately, it is incomprehensible in language and style. Once you finish, it does redeem itself somewhat, in that you see what the point was (for most of it). But it is a harsh, rocky road to the end. I had to read it for a class... i wouldn't have gotten anywhere otherwise. Highly not recommended to anyone but Faulkner fanatics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A forgotten classic of Faulkner","review":"It seems every modernist attempted to write a great work concerning the great war (except fitzgerald, who didnt get to go himself).

I may have a Master's Degree in English, but I still had great trouble following what was going on in the book, much less appreciating what it was trying to say. It's amazing to me that the Pulitzer Prize committee could even manage to get through this thing, much less give it an award.

He also has to take the obligatory slap at McCarthy without bothering to admit that \\"we now know\\" (the title of another Gaddis work) that declassified material has largely shown that he told the truth and his detractors consistently lied.

If, like me, you are looking for a book that retells the history and events of the cold war then you will be disappointed. If you already possess a knowledge or vivid memory of those events and are looking for an opinion on the thoughts of individuals and the ideology that led to those events then you will be delighted. For example, I would expect a book on the Cold War to spend 10+ pages on the Berlin airlift. There was one sentence that mentioned it occurred. Checkpoint Charlie and the stories associated with it - not mentioned. Gary Powers and the U2 plane - one paragraph. Etc. Etc.

It was enlightening start to finish. Not just about the whos, whats, and wheres, but Mr. Gaddis also touches on quite a bit of political and military theory that I had not really thought about before in this context.I thought it was a great book, albeit a bit short, but that was the point. Mr. Gaddis wanted to put togethor a shorter version of a very complex story. In doing so, he was able to touch on a variety of topics and how they fit into the grander theme of geopolitical history in the latter half of the 20th century without getting bogged down in the details.I think this would be a very good book for beginners but theres something in there for everyone. It may expose you to some things you were not aware of and lead you to wanting to know more about certain subjects. It's a sort of gateway book in that respect, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for Cold War fans","review":"Anyone interested in the Cold War should definitely get this book from their local library.

To be honest, I think they were accidently put the 1-Tea light holders in the box, but they wouldn't admit that. It didn't SAY they were out of stock online. Someone just wasn't paying attention to what they were packing. But WHY would you send a different size of the production in its place IF the one you ordered is out of stock?!

Many of my fellow students in class were surprised at the book's content, and said that \\"this is something that one would see on a Jerry Spinger episode\\". (the content of the stories) I have seen many of these stories happen in real life so I was not so surprised at the content. I have never read anything about child abuse infidelity and threesomes along with fornication all in one book. Very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bloom's challenge: How Forgiving Are You?","review":"The characters, on quick glance, may seem crazy, immoral, half-witted; but Amy Bloom's writing and attention to detail stirs the longings we all have as imperfect people, exposes our neurotic, constant need never to make mistakes, and forces us to find compassion for even the most flawed judgement. Ms. Bloom does the impossible: love overcomes infidelity, the nut is the only one who's sane, and grief excuses our mistakes. This book is a rare, precious find"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have in my book.","review":"Striking stories. Amy Bloom is a long-standing favorite author of mine.

Nothing is taken for granted, including the way she carefully chooses each word, each turn in the story.Enter the beginning story with Ellen at her mother's funeral in \\"Love is Not a Pie.\\" Watch as Henry and Marie contemplate monogamy and negotiate the confines of their relationship in \\"Faultlines\\" and \\"Only You.\\" Follow Violet as she watches her sister fall apart in \\"Silver Water.\\"The endings of Amy Bloom's stories are surprising not because of shocking leaps in logic or tumultuous events, but because the world in each story unfolds so gently, envelopingly, and it is a jolt when each closes up again, leaving you with the imprint of a world gone as quickly as it unfolded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dog eared and well loved","review":"I've lost count of how many times I've loaned this book to friends (plus how many times I've read it).

I usually don't care for short stories. This book had a real sweet flowing quality to it. All of Amy Bloom's stories in this book are about very human, imperfect people in relationships with each other. At times I found myself actually laughing out loud and at other times I found myself teary and sad. These stories are quite beautiful"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is one of the most disappointing book of short stories I have read in a long time. The characters are shallow, boring and forgettable. The book has a section called \\"Three Stories\\", describing different times in the lives of the same characters. The character development, however, was so shallow, that I didn't realize I was reading about the same people until I noticed that I was seeing the same (unusual) name, Galen, so many times. Ms. Bloom tries to add surprises to each story. Since I couldn't identify or empathize with the characters, the surprises were just an author trying to add oomph to an otherwise dull story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Collection of Short Stories","review":"Amy Bloom surpasses the majority of modern and postmodern writers in her ability to walk us along the thin line between bliss and sorrow, hope and despair, often tempting us to jump or fall, but ultimately maintaining her course and bringing us to the end where the line dissolves. Her language is sensual decadence for the reader, but her control and neutrality towards beauty enable her to escape the pitfall of sentimentality._Love Invents Us_, a novel which she developed out of one of the stories found here (\\"Light Breaks Where No Sun Shines\\"), is certainly worth the read, particularly for fans of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and dry","review":"A very dull and dry book. Not engaging in the descriptions of the actions or events. A book with maps and simple listing of the dates and actions would have been far more entertaining and informational.Had a really hard time trying to read this book. Infantry and Panzer Aces by Kurowski, both provide better detail and information on the fighting on the Eastern Front. An even better book on the upper command situation in WW2 is Panzer Battles, by von Mellenthin.Recommendation, borrow it from the library instead if you really want to read it. You are not missing anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it would be better....Look at Something Else!","review":"Fighting In Hell at some pionts was like \\"Reading In ****\\" The book is on Personal passages of four German Commanders in the Eastern Front.

At some points in the book it is suggested what to wear in really cold weather, etc., For the average reader (like myself) looking for a good read with action, this is not the book. I did learn some new things that I was not aware of previously however, I could not wait to finish this book, it was boring and too long. I'm glad it was only a seven dollar book!

When I say fair I mean not touched by Cold War's blinders :)Well... again a failure. I understand that the book was written using defeated German (or still Nazi :) ) Generals during the 50s, but.... NOWADAYS I'd like to read a book without the cliche about the Russian Winter, Asian menthality (this is a bit racistic IMHO) and so on.However, if you like books with a strong German bias, and continue to believe to German General's tales you can buy it. But remember here you don't find real insight"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting for only the most hard-core WWII historian","review":"An interesting premise for a WWII history book - this is a compilation of the writings of various German soldiers in Allied captivity who wrote about thier experiences on the Russian front - unfortunately most, if not all, of the personal experiences and anecdotes have been left out. It reads like a fairly dry battle manual, describing Russian tacticts, the 'personality' and leadership style of the Russians, etc. very little in the way of interesting anecdotes. This is a valuable piece of researh - useful for a historian doing specific research on tacticts on the Russian front, but is little more than a dry overview. If you are looking for an interesting narative, this is NOT it. If you are looking for battle tacticts and examinations of the russian way of combat - possibly as research material for a book or research paper, this may be for you, otherwise, you may want to avoid this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on tactics","review":"This book was certainly interesting (admittedly a matter of personal taste) and would probably be recommended for the military specialist, rather than the general reader or even WWII buff. The book is essentially a description of German tactics and the tactical situation in the east. It's not really a general history of the eastern war nor an organized, thematic presentation. It is a compilation of essays by Colonel General Erhard Raus (1889-1956), Infantry General Waldemar Erfurth (1879-1971) and Infantry General Hans von Greiffenberg (1893-1951). The essays cover topics of specific military interest on the eastern front, eg. climate, partisan tactics, mud, terrain, reconaissance etc. The book would only be of interest to those with a knowledge, or an interest in the most specific details of combat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty terrible","review":"This is one of those awful marketing scams.

And then this has been called an SF novel! There's no science in it and little else of interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epistle liberation theology","review":"Dr. Elliott makes a wonderful argument for a new reading of Paul. He looks past the screen of history (especially Luther's views on Paul) and allows the context of the 1st century Mediterean world shape the possible intentions of the Apostle.

The text is designed to relate to the photos, directly or indirectly, without distracting too much from the photos. Adams does tend to lean towards the philosophical towards the end of some chapters, perhaps with a well-founded basis.However, I think it is fair to say that Adams has \\"visualized\\" himself in a stylized and abstract manner, not unlike his photographs of the wilderness, cropping any rough edges of his life and ultimately contributing to (even propagating?) the myth surrounding his life.After reading his autobiography, I am now looking forward to reading his biography, written by Mary Street Alinder, his editor in the present effort. I hope that she reveals some of the driving tensions and flaws in his life, much in the same way James Gleick filled in the more sombre details of Richard Feynman's life that he glossed over in his autobiographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Useful and Handsome Book","review":"This book has great explanations of the principles of photography, with lots of well-designed illustrations.Also lots of classic photographs from the Time-Life archives.

I am an avid reader of all kinds of books and I am old enough to know that hard work is necessary in many aspects of our lives, but surely this is not one of them. The bible is too complex even for educated theologians. I don't want to work that hard. The book is supposed to be \\"hands on\\".

I can't believe that I am the only person to comment on the major defect of these slippers: the unbelievable stench. The bottom and part of the sides is constructed of some kind of plastic material. After a short time, maybe a month or so, the slipper develops an odor that is unbelievable. It's like rotting vegetation. I put charcoal odor eaters in and the stench chewed those babies up and spit them out. The stink is like no other foot stink I have ever encountered in my long and stinky life. Out of desperation I put them in the washing machine. They didn't fall apart, but the stink still lingers on, after washing and two rinses and going mostly through a drying cycle.

The 11 BARELY fits, and I can feel my toes bumping against the ends of the slippers when I walk.As far as quality goes, the slippers do look nice, but unlike other similar slippers I've owned (and paid a lot more for) there is little to no cushioning inside the shoes. I'm not just referring to the cushioning between your feet and the floor, but between your feet and the seams where the sole is sewn onto the bottom. I can feel the pronounced ridges of the seams all the way around the bottom of my foot, and they make standing in the slippers for more than a moment or two quite painful.

It allows me to use the fixed base that came with the router for everyday routing jobs without removing it from the router table (this gets tedious). Additionally, the above-table adjustment is handy.Note, though, that you still need to reach under the table to lock and unlock the router for adjustment, so it's not a substitute for a router lift (that would have made it five stars in my book). Still, I consider it a good purchase--it's almost as good as having another router!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great router lift","review":"sofar this router lift has worked great. i like this product, iv used it a couple of times and it has done everything that i needed it to do. i like that here is a router lift for less then $200, its even better thats its under $70. its well made but the only thing i don't like is that there is no way to tell how much you are raising and lowering without using a combination square or ruler. overall this is a great router lift and cant be beat for $70."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely necessary","review":"Not much to say except that the product does exactly what it is supposed to do; the real value is in what it saves you from doing. Having to attach and detach my router's fixed base to the router table each time I wanted to use it was enough of a pain that I sometimes decided against doing certain projects. Now that I have the Bosch RA1165 permanently attached under my wonderful Bosch RA1181 router table, I jump easily and immediately between fixed base and router table use. The Bosch RA1165 looks to me to be exactly the same as the fixed base for the Bosch 1617EVSPK router, without the wooden handles (though there are holes to attach handles), so it works precisely the same as the base I was used to.If you ever use your router off the table, this product is absolutely necessary. Very much worth the low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value!","review":"This is a very valuable addition to my router accessories. It works very well at a fraction of the cost of the after-market router lifts. The lift screw retainer seems to work fine as long as you remember to release the locking lever.

Director Barry Sonnefeld (Men in Black) takes the cult fave tv sitcom and turns it into a gloriously filmed dark comedy. Anjelica Huston is marvelous as the quietly seductive Morticia and Raul Julia is perfect as the enamored Gomez. Of course, Christina Ricci steals her scenes as the demonic Wednesday and Jimmy Workman makes a fine Pugsley. If Christopher Lloyd can't quite match Jackie Coogan's Fester, it's more the script's fault than his. Elizabeth Wilson is very good as Lloyd's devious mother as is Dana Ivey as the frustrated wife of nogoodnick Dan Hedaya. I wish they'd have found more use for Vic Mizzy's marvelous tv theme song, instead of MC Hammer's ridiculous rap contribution.

By time it came on video something inside me was urging me to rent it. I did and it was worth every penny I spent, I liked it so much I bought it when I took the movie back.The cast gives suberb performances especially Christina Ricci who, in my opinoin, stole the show from the rest of the cast. Angelica Houston, Raul Julia, & Christopher Lloyd also gave outstanding performances. The story is quite simple, Gomez (Julia) is still searching for his long lost brother Fester. When a greedy woman & her son get hold of the story & hear about the Addams' fortune she decides to dress her son up as Fester to get hold of the family fortune.

It is obvious you have many names and many beliefs which have shown as contradictions to one another throughout your books. Even many of the young people are picking up on it. But some of the youth are much more aware and not as gullble as adults in the Pagan world. But I don't have to tell you that.

For those who would call Silver Fluff... yes she writes on a level that is a little fluffy... but it gets people to open their minds about our faith... and it gets people to think about our customs and traditions in a positive light.

It has only 3 spells for love, and it was only for sending love to someone else, and finding love, and she made it very clear not to cast it on a specific person. And the reason why they were simplistic,is becasue I alot of people intrseted in the history of Halloween and Wicca, ma get a little freaked out over serious hardcore spells, while at the same time catering to Wiccans. Although I disagreed with some of the book, like ritaul to speak to the dead, it was pretty good.

Also, if you're lucky enough to get coffee in the pot, don't try to pour it into a cup unless you're over the sink b/c it leaks from the seal between the pot and the top and pours poorly. This is by far the most expensive coffee pot I've ever owned and I'm going to try to return it to Amazon or DeLonghi and break out my old Mr. Coffee ulgy, but no mess coffee maker!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate manual for relationships!","review":"This book is the how-to manual for coping with a lousy relationship with your mother and how to have a good relationship with your daughter.

It did not work, the software came with it was very old and gave me a message something like \\"different partition size between the 2 drives, not supported\\" I went online and download Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0. It's free for 15 days. It also gave me an error message saying there are bad partition in my computer's HD and I need to fix those first. I ran the disc error check but everything was fine. Took me whole day nothing worked.I ended up went to best buy and bought a USB 3.0 case \\"Rocketfish\\" and use the Acronis Migrate Easy 7.0 free demo to clone the HD. Everything was done within 2 hours. So If you are buying a bigger HD, I say don't buy this. I think the problem is there is no power cord, it doesn't support the bigger HD.

Then I removed the new HD from the enclosure, removed the old HD from the laptop (and I needed a Phillips head screwdriver for this), and swapped the two drives. It took about 20 minutes of hands on time and maybe 3 hours to transfer the data. One word of warning, the product is encased in a difficult clamshell plastic package.

Here is my suggestion. 1. purchase a cheap enclosure 2. install your new hard drive. 3. download EASEUS todo B/U for free, clone your drive, install the new one, and save yourself around $40.00 plus the time and trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Short and sweet...","review":"This is a short little guide to writing comics. It was originally written in Alan Moore's early days, and then an afterword was added. Basically, in the first 3/4's of the book he goes through the( his?) creative process in a more or less step by step fashion. It is pretty interesting and has a lot of insight. I actually thought is was more helpful than either of the two Eisner books, but I may be a snotty nosed punk (I am a snotty nosed punk so...). The last section, the afterword, takes the rest of the book and stands it on its ear. I was a bit let down by it, but in twenty years I'm sure it will make perfect sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"comic book format","review":"As the band \\"Killing Joke\\" sings, \\"Alan Moore knows the score\\" -- but as much as I love comic books, and appreciate Mr. Moore, I was disappointed with this purchase.It's a comic book format reprint of an article by Moore about comic books from 2004 or such.Not that Moore isn't the best of the best of writers, but this is not \\"a book\\" and this is not something written for fans or wannabe writers to gain tremendous insight into writing comic books from Alan Moore's perspective.Instead, it's a clumsy attempt to score some sales based on Moore's name and legacy, by merely reprinting and repackaging an interesting article.Even with current comic book prices being what they are, I'd rather buy two comic books than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books on the subject","review":"I would recommend the Peter David book or the Denny O'Neil DC Comics Guide To Writing before this one.

I found the manuscript to be quite an excellent guide in the manner that we writer's might go about putting a story together. It focuses on thinking in writer's terms and at the end you will have a basic idea of how to composite a written work together. Mind you that these 'lessons', if they could be called that, are based on basic story construction, not necessarily confined to the graphic novel. In the end, however, Alan contradicts his earlier words with what seemed to be a post-written apology, that reeked of 'Lessons from the Frontlines'....At first, my impression was that if he was going to put this conclusion in, then why did I buy the book and what value did I glean from it? He answers that as well. In a nutshell...\\"Be original, be creative...keep your audience guessing...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Juice Newton","review":"Juice Newton holds a special place in the hearts of my wife and myself.

Within a couple of months I heard portions of the Christmas album, but it was a couple of years before I finally acquired it. Having listened to it now for 28 years, I can honestly say that it is simply the most beautiful recording I have ever heard. Not just of Christmas music, but of any kind. The harmonies are just incredible and the voices and the phrasing are perfect. One should listen to this album with absolutely no distractions in order to be able to hear each note of each chord. Although Gene Puerling wrote only four of the arrangements, every single one of the 17 is a gem. For anyone who wants to hear the ultimate beauty that music can offer, this cd is a must.

I will be referring to these as RC (Rothco) and the issued caps as OI (Original Issue).First, the brim on these RC caps is outstanding. They're firm yet they can easily be flexed to your desired curvature. I could never manage this with the OI caps; it would always tend to flatten out on its own. The velcro on the back is fine. The fabric on the RC caps is noticeably thinner than the OI caps. I prefer the heavier fabric of the OI caps but you may not. But by far, my favorite thing about these RC caps is their fit. I had to give the OI caps constant attention and some serious tweaking every time I put them on just to avoid looking like a combat baker or tactical train conductor. These RC caps require no extra worry and look fine when donned like a baseball cap.

We were a little resistant at first at what to do since he is only 18 month and it does say choking hazard. The set is really nice for the price. it does come with smaller pieces but what we did was we left the items that he could choke on off the table and will save those for when he gets older. he really loves the train and it comes with a plane and helicopter and the grandparents bought a few thomas the train extras to go with it that attached great with the set. i really recommend this table i also love the storage and the table was a breeze to put together at 10 at night and the instructions were easy to follow. two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy Buy Buy - if you have a boy over 2 years old!","review":"Santa Claus brought this for our son this past Christmas and he has played with it almost everyday for at least an hour a day.

For the price I paid ($119.00) I am very happy with what I received. There were a couple of things that I was disappointed with which are listed below:-Bridge wooden piece was broken where the rail connects and rests on. I was able to glue it back. Two of the eight screw holes were in the wrong place, but it is stable enough without them.-Water fall looks like it had sounds, but there was no electric component. I remember reading about it on another review, cannot remember if you can ask for a replacement.-When I was putting the board on the table it rubbed against the side and started to peel back the cover. I just taped over all the edges and it looks fine. Some of the pieces it came with are cheap, but both imaginarium and thomas the train toys work well with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for the money.","review":"Easy assembly.

It comes with three storage bins and they do hold all the pieces in two bins so you have a third one for whatever other toys you buy to go with the table. It is kind of big so it has to sit in the middle of the room so he can reach all the way around it.

First of all, the storage area under the table for the buckets is set up so that you have to pull out at least one of them to access the others. Second, the track pieces aren't completely flush and cause the trains to catch. That would be ok if the magnets were stronger, but even on straight sections the cars often separate, and definitely around curves and up hills. Overall, I wish I had shopped around a lot more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great...","review":"Our daughter received this set for her birthday. There are several small pieces that are a nightmare to assemble, that really could have come assembled to start with. The cars and trucks drive better on the train tracks than the actual train cars, the cargo boxes do not stay on the train cars very well, the buildings (aside from the one 3-D one) are just thin squares that you just stand up, so they knock over with any movement of the table, in reality, all of the accessories do. I know this is a cheaper set, but I'm sure some of the more expensive ones are of better quality. You really can't even push the train through the tunnel under the waterfall, and my kid is two... So I couldn't imagine other children being able to."},{"rating":"2","title":"High Quality Train Set","review":"We bought this train set for our kids for Christmas and they both love it! The height of the table is good (about 16-18 inches) and the set comes with a ton of pieces (train cars, stop signs, bushes, etc). I feel like it took me just as long to put together the actual train tracks and the small helicopter pad and crane as it did to put together the actual table (about 90 mins or so for each --- though mind you I'm not terribly handy). The storage bins underneath get caught up a little bit when you try to slide them out but overall they are useful to have.We also purchased a Thomas and Percy car separately and they both work nicely on the tracks.While this set seemed a little pricier than some of the others we came across, the quality seems to be very good. The trains seem to roll very easily on the tracks and the kids are having a great time! Overall, I would highly recommend this train set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Good quality product. I had no problem putting all parts together.

There are way too many pieces that are just junk! Putting this together was a nightmare. Pieces that could have been attached already had to be attached with the littlest tiny screws.

It is not, unfortunately, very good.The album consists largely of synthesizer driven mid-tempo grooves well informed with percussion washes and fiery playing from Sanders. At its best, it proves pleasant enough (vocal chant-and-flute piece \\"Kumba\\"), at worst it finds Sanders in drastic opposition to the music (ballad \\"Nozipho\\" finds Sanders overblowing and screeching against a soporific backdrop). It's not unlistenable, but its not the kind of record you'll be reaching for.Sanders and Laswell would succeed much more on their future efforts, this one is really pretty far from essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I made three recipes in this book before giving up in frustration.

Your time - because you will waste some looking for a new light in a matter of months. Your money - because even if you do not break it you will be buying expensive batteries to keep it running. Not water proof or resistant - I live in Monterey, California and we do not get much rain out here, nor do I like to ride in the rain. That said this light was ruined by what little water it came in contact with or by the process of changing out the rusted batteries for new ones.

I am now looking for a light that uses a more common/cheaper battery (like AA or AAA) and that is actually water resistant!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY Nice!","review":"This is nice light.

It's highly biased to the point of containing inaccurate information, and the content/topics the author chose to include (or chose not to include) is questionable as well. It's as if the author wrote it from memory during a creative streak but couldn't be bothered to check her sources. I used to be a big fan of those novel-like biographies for kids, which is what this book is reminiscent of, but calling this a history textbook is a whole 'nother story.

On most of the missions, you ought to have two lances or more, but you will have to cross your fingers and try to beat the four to one odds with your one lance and on again, off again lancemates. Perhaps Mechwarrior: Mercenaries spoiled me badly, but I was too busy cursing like a werewolf for most of the missions in Black Knight at the lousy odds and even worse mission profiles to enjoy any of it.

I am proud to have one, but it would not be many people's cup of tea in 2011. If you are looking for a good reliable, easy to read and understand Bible for today, the NASB or the ESV would be a good choice. It would have been nice if it had been printed and bound by Oxford, Cambridge or Allan Bibles in Scotland.

It is a reprint of the original Nelson and Sons of 1901. Star Publishing has done an excellent job of bringing back a forgotten translation. The below reviewer seemed dissapointed that it didn't measure up to a genuine leather Oxford Bible. I've been selling Bibles for years and this Bible is of the same quality of any other $60 Oxford Bible. Of course it doesn't compare with a $150 Bible, but you're not paying $150. For the money you won't be dissapointed and you will be able to add a new ASV to your translation list.

Imagine my utter delight to discover he is now handling more of the vocals (and not too shabbily either) and surrounding himself with the best band line-up in years. \\"STRANGE DREAMS\\" is the best from the reincarnated Savoy Brown in at least a decade not including Kim's fine solo albums which I highly recommend. My favorite song is \\"Memphis Last Night\\" because of the fine solo by Kim. All of the songs are first-rate. Not a bad one of the lot. Buy this CD. It is the one Savoy Brown fans have been yearning for for ages! Now get to work, Kim, on another fine acoustic solo album! Albums like this may yet bring the Blues back in vogue. Here's hoping!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps on rolling.","review":"The latest release from Kim Simmonds and Savoy Brown is a tasty sample of what this band is capable of. The songs are mid-tempo blues and can best be described as being performed by accomplished musicians who are comfortable with the material. There is maturity and confidence in the playing that is like the difference between making love and getting some. As always, Kim Simmonds' guitar smokes, and the band is a sympathetic companion.Kim Simmonds handles all the vocals on this release and he as never sounded better as a singer. His voice has taken on a fuller sound and is very appropriate to the material. All of the songs are good, although, \\"Keep on Rollin'\\" deserves a special mention, because it could be Simmonds theme song- The chorus states- \\"I've got my troubles, but I'm gonna keep on Rollin',that certainly has been how Simmonds has stayed in the music business for the last 30-some years, and how Savoy Brown continues to release worthwhile material like Stange Dreams."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Saying Much....","review":"Saying this is the best Savoy Brown release in a number of years is not really saying a whole heck of a lot. True Simmonds can play a mean guitar, but so can dozens of other blues artists. What really bothers me about this disc is the weak vocals from Simmonds; and the musicians for hire approach. Just call this a Kim Simmonds solo album and I'll maybe add another star. This is just straight ahead, workmanlike, \\"whiteboy\\" blues in the tradition (or re-tread-ition) of John Mayall; however Simmonds is no Clapton, Green, or Taylor. I've listened to the disc a few times and the repeated listenings have done nothing to change my opinion. Now it's headed for auction on eBay.Unlike my vinyl copies of \\"Blue Matter\\" & \\"Raw Sienna\\" which I sleep with under my pillow. \\"Lonesome Dave\\" rest in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Milkin' it lame","review":"Re-tread songs, helpless rhythm section, HORRIBLE singing...this is the worst CD I bought this year.

It's a glimpse into the former President's youth, a life which was never easy, but never one that was complained about. Rather than writing a diatribe railing against growing up without having been born with the silver spoon found in so many of the other Presidents' mouths, Mr. Carter explores and celebrates the small trials he faced and which, eventually, molded him into the man who became President. \\"Angela's Ashes\\" as written from Georgia? Why not?This book makes an outstanding gift, if only to yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A thouroughly enjoyable book","review":"Even if this book was not written by a past President, it would be a great read. For an urban Yankee like me, this story of a rural Southern boyhood was fascinating. It's hard to imagine a boy who grew up barefoot and worrying about being able to handle a plow becoming President of the United States. His style is easy and warm. There are lots of interesting stories about share croppers, race relations, farming, and things I have no way of knowing about, thus it gave me an insight into a culture totally different from mine. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jimmy Carter is no Rick Bragg","review":"I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book being a great fan of all Southern writings and writers. I especially enjoyed the wonderful It's All Over But the Shoutin' by Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Bragg.Let me say I have always admired Jimmy Carter; he seems a man of virtue and honor. Unfortunately he can't write and someone should have told him. I found the book repetitive and monotonous and in need of an editor with the best organizational skills. Carter jumped from one subject to another continously without any hint of where he may be going."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Cater, but can't cotton his writing","review":"Why is it that ex-presidents make poor writers? Is it that they have had to hide their feeing so long they are afraid to loosen up afterward because we might think less of them?

I spent a rural boyhood myself, but I cannot say it was as rich and varied and interesting as Jimmy Carter's, and it was not spent in Georgia. This is a very pleasant book to read, and you will never regret spending a little time reading this well-written book, full of insight and nostalgia. I hope it wins this year's (or next year's)Pulitzer Prize for Biography or Autobiography, as Russell Baker's delightful book did in 1983."},{"rating":"2","title":"A delight trip back in time","review":"I picked this book up at the thrift store and loved it. It really gives honest and charming insight into the boyhood of President Carter. I was pleasantly surprised.

Also a fairly detailed picture of life of the farm, all of the ups and downs, certainly not a bed of roses.

The cast does try hard, but the inept script gives them nothing to work with. The DVD quality is mediocre at best. From the opening seconds of the film, the screen is crawling with grain, not made any better by the low video bitrate. Audio is passable, and the only extra is a laughably bad trailer.

For example, anytime the camera points to the lights on stage, the video blows out, meaning that the band mates disappear into a blur of bright yellow. Of course, comparing this DVD's video quality to that of a cellphone's, is an insult to cellphones.It was mentioned in a previous review that this concert was for charity, so if you're feeling charitable and want to waste your money, go ahead and buy the DVD and use it for target practice (a la \\"Success Story\\") but if you're looking for a good Who concert DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap DVD","review":"As much as I like the Who and as much as I believe that they have really come back from the dead recently, this is a really crap DVD of a really good band.

Shearing's talent for playing the piano. This record was no exception as his phrasing and arranging done \\"internally\\" on one instrument is typically impeccable. The selection of material is likewise very, very good. However, this recording was done at the private studio of Hans Georg Brunner-Schwer in 1974. While the equipment there might have been quite good for a private studio in 1974, the tape noise on the recording is so pronounced as to be a real distraction. Perhaps as an MP3 recording listened to in a car this would be an acceptable level of fidelity, but on a decent modern home system....no. This is the first Shearing recording I've ever regretted purchasing. That's the bad news. The good news is that there are numerous other examples of his talent out there in print and many of them sound absolutely wonderful, even for their age."},{"rating":"1","title":"earings","review":"Earings are too big...no way of knowing they were as big as they are...nothing i will wear...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great intellectual gymnastics","review":"I completely disagree with his conception of reality, but I enjoyed this book. Bradley was a precursor to the language philosophers. Everyone seems intrigued with Wittgenstein; however, Bradley is far more comprehensive and profound. Plus, he writes very good English.

The CUP version only costs a little more, and it's, well, you know, a normal book.As far as Bradley's thought is concerned.

It is a pain to adjust, and will slip off adjusting it to the size of my other toe rings when they're not extended whatsoever. That was my cue that I wasn't imagining the discrepancy lol it's painful to keep on when adjusted to the point that it won't slip off. Save your $ unless you're buying it for a toddler.

And dont be fooled the stone in the middle is not like that it is a very small stone in a cone type thing and also it was a little hard to adjust the first time.

Someone please inform this storyteller about \\"Spell Check,\\" and all the other grammer tools available theses days. The 2nd and 3rd act dropped the ball completely.

I found this book engrossing and highly informative in areas (agriculture, farming and land use) most local histories ignore.It is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how the outer boroughs of New York developed.The photos are a hoot - showing long-urban areas as utterly unrecognizable farmland.The book's only shortcoming is the author's boilerplate Marxist analysis of how land and capital are used in a modern economy.With that one caveat, I heartily recommend this weighty tome for anyone seriously interested in New York outer-borough history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Balaclave Junction Goes Dark","review":"The Peter Shandy mysteries began strong (Rest You Merry) and then gradually became very light-hearted (The Curse of the Giant Hogweed).

The Herbert Ross directed film has Holme's loyal sidekick and chronicler Dr. John H. Watson (Alan Arkin) seeking the help of Dr. Sigmund Freud (Robert Duvall) in finding a cure for Holmes' debilitating cocaine addiction. Nicol Williamson portrays Holmes as an authentic addict, alternately hyper and depressed with manic episodes that suggest he has truly lost touch with reality. There's no tongue in cheek, winking at the audience here, but a solid piece of entertainment with the brilliant Holmes on the brink of losing his great mind to an obsession that leads to no solution but madness and death. The three lead actors are all excellent - Vanessa Redgrave has a supporting role -- and Williamson's drug addled Holmes is unforgettable. This fascinating film is long overdue for the a full Blu-ray restoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why in the world isn't this thing letterboxed!?","review":"The movie itself gets at least four stars, but minus two for the studio for being so purblind as to issue it with a third of the picture lopped off.

But I love the story. And have read the book.if you get a chance read the book before you see or after. The book came out not as a novel of the movie.

Well, to me, it's the worst ever made. Only the cinematography and the settings are worth a nod.

The casting is flawless, the production values sumptuous, and the video transfer is extremely good, even viewed on a high-definition screen (some regular DVDs look crumby on a high-definition TV). So I won't bother to repeat the lavish praise others have rightfully heaped on this film. My question is, does anyone know what, if anything, has been changed on the soundtrack? I never saw the film in a theater, and the original DVD release (unfortunately pan-and-scan) stated that portions of the music had been changed from the theatrical version, presumably for copyright reasons. This widescreen release seems to have identical music to that earlier DVD; does anyone know what specifically is different from the original theatrical release?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Saving Sherlock","review":"This oldie but goodie is a great film to add to your Holmes collection. It works well with the Holmes cannon (there are several references dropped for those familiar with Holmes) and the story is a lot of fun.

I wasn't intoxicated while using these, but they are more difficult to open than our usual durex and sometimes magnums.The fit on these is tight, specifically the girth. While the material is very thin, I can feel the restriction and it is distracting. The length is average and adequate.Worst of all, these lost all lubrications in 5-10 minutes. Twice I had to apply extra lubrication (think baby powder dry) and the most recent time I just gave up and called it a night.Shipping was fairly prompt from the seller, but the questionable packaging, small fit (must have done their product testing in Asia) and extreme lack of lubrication make these the worst condom I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small","review":"These condoms are no good.

Sing All The Saddest Songs, Disneyland Forever, I Still Love You, Hope You Fall (In Love), Hey! Mona Lisa and Heart As Big As Liverpool are stand-out tracks, each one packing gigantic emotional clout. Wylie's lyrics are of the simple, heartfelt kind. The music takes rock orchestration through a Phil Spector filter and is loaded with sharp, new wave attack and panache. Comparison with stalwarts of English rock music such as Bolan, Bowie and Ferry are apt and although Pete Wylie's songs don't cover the more avant-garde territory plied by those masters, he adds a drop of Motown and a touch of Bacharach for good measure. This album stands as fitting testament to Liverpool's most wayward genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lady","review":"Over 50 years I've been digging Dinah \\"The Lady\\".

I got really bored reading about Catherine and Christopher and their little family, but I wouldn't have said anything bad about it.Then came this book. B-O-R-I-N-G.

This book was haunting and unforgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"FERTILIZER FOR THE GARDEN","review":"This story was so bad that it was EMBARRASSING! Olivia, the matriarch of the Dollanganger twins is featured in this tired prequel. Bitter and resentful over her lot in life, she marries an unloving man named Malcolm and has two sons.Irate over Malcolm's adulterous ways, Olivia understandably resents Malcolm's latest love interest, the lovely Alicia. She doesn't take into consideration that Malcolm rapes Alicia and this act results in the birth of Alicia's daughter, Corinne. Malcolm insists on naming his baby Corinne after his dead mother. During Alicia's pregnancy, Olivia keeps her away from her son Chris (who would later, with Corinne, become the parents of the Dollanger 4) locks her away in the attic (the attic again)!Alicia is a fool for allowing Olivia to spirit Chris away and even more foolish for letting Olivia keep Corinne in that malignant household. Common sense does not enter into this story.This book is good fertilizer for the garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent prequel, but doenst satisfy me","review":"While I enjoyed the book, Olivia's plight against Malcom and society by no means justifies what she does to the Dollanganger children in FITA. While I do have a great deal of symapthy for her(losing her children,living without love etc) torturing innocent children because of what their parents did is inexcusable. Perhaps she was miss guided my her cousin John Amos, her only ally after the death of her sons. Perhaps if she had been more mature and not been so jealous of Corrinne 1/2 the bad things that occured in the book would have never happened-but then we wouldnt have a story now would we?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I just hated the grandmother in all the other books, until this one. Then I just felt so sorry for her. Malcolm seemed like the type of man who should never get married. He is just not the type.

I really enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wink Wink Nod Nod We Are So Clever","review":"Don't get me wrong Spider Robinson is my favorite author but not even the warmth of Key West where this novel is set could warm me up to it.This is a valuable lesson. Sometimes we must give up our fictional friends. Jake and his friends seem tired and need to rest. They have entertained us but now I feel like a guest at a party that has overstayed his welcome. Everbody is going through the motions but I just don't feel it.One of the things I really didn't like is Jake and his crew's attitude of: \\"We are so clever Nod-Nod Wink-Wink.\\" Everybody has some sort of power incuding his kid. It seems they are running into the same wall that Superman in the comics did. You make a character or a group of them so powerful you really have to strain to come up with a problem worthy of them.In short this book seemed a bit to much by the numbers.As much as I love the characters I hope this is the last I see of them. I will remember them fondly from prior books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best Callahan's Book","review":"I've been reading Spider since my first-edition copy of Antinomy 20 years ago (which I still have). This book was, in a word: lame. Too much reliance on mind altering drugs and old formulas. The plot (if you want to call it one) is too formulaic. It takes Spider almost half the book to get them from New York to Key West, another quarter of the book to establish the new bar, and the last quarter to save the world. Where are the puns and character development that made the Callahan's Bar stories so much fun to read? Sorry, Spider. Even Ralph would call this one a dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Spider Robinson book I have read","review":"I have loved Callahan books.I have loved almost everything by Spider Robinson before this book.I had great expectations before I started to read this one. Sadly I had to be very disappointed. It seems Spider had material for a short story, and got a contract for a novel. Never have I encountered such amount of padding in any book before. There literary pages and pages of pure, unadulterated padding. There are paragraphs full of names, which are repeated a few pages later. There are sidetracks in the story which lead nowhere, and have no relation with the main plot of the story, and have practically no entertainment value at all.This might have been a fine short story, but this is a horrible novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heir to Heinlein","review":"And I mean that review title for both good and ill. Like Heinlein's last few works (everything starting with _Number of the Beast_), the Callahan series has (d)evolved into tales of Extraordinarily Talented and Witty People, (over)laden with cultural in-jokes, references to earlier tales, and a twee jolliness that makes for light, breezy reading when it's not just irritating. Robinson has seemingly fallen into the \\"How do I trump what I did last time?\\" trap, and while it's nice to see the old gang again, hear the awful puns, and sit back for the ride, I look back on the much warmer, more *human* early Callahan tales (and even tales of Lady Sally's House) and miss them.I don't regret having bought the book, even at today's exorbitant paperback prices. I just wish I'd enjoyed it as much as his earlier ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have saved my money","review":"This is the first Spider Robinson I have tried to read. I'll take other's word for it that previous books were better. This one is smug, self-indulgent and boring. I kept waiting for them to save the universe and then skimmed through it because it was too silly. I like weird people but these were not interesting. The parrot was a stupid plot device, the baby is creepy (but that dancing baby always creeped me out, too), but I liked being reminded of Pixel. I kept picturing Hans Conried when we saw Nikola Tesla and I don't think that was the image we were supposed to get. I short, I didn't finish it. I should have checked these reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Conserve narratives: reuse, reduce, recycle","review":"First, there is nothing new in this book. Everything he says here he has said in the earlier books. Second, there is very little in the way of plot or character development. You are halfway through the book before the threat to the universe is even described. All the characters are almost cameo reprives of previous performances. Except the new characters who are introduced and then promptly droped from the narrative. Third,the few more or less new notes are nearly all obvious reworkings from other writers. The eighteen month old hyperprecocious girl who knows the size of her father's erect penis and has started a waiting list of partners for when she begins having sex just reeks of the Lazarus Long style of deliberately shocking sexuality. Based on this book I would say Spider Robinson has become a tired old man."},{"rating":"2","title":"The gang's mostly back","review":"And it turnd out that not only are they supposed to save the planet, but the whole darn universe as well. And tired of the whole Long Island rat race, they're moving to Key West. (circa 1989 before it got gentrified and duller). Fun stuff for the most part, and I liked the tale, but the pacing's a bit slower than the earlier Callahan books, which were pretty much short story compilations, and even the Lady Sally ones, which had at least a few seperate stories in each. It just seemed to take a long time for anything to happen, and Erin is just a bit too precocious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too clever by half. No, more than that.","review":"This is the first book by Spider Robinson I've tried to read. Tried. I couldn't try hard enough to get past the incessant cleverness of the dialog and characters. The phrase \\"too clever by half\\" doesn't cover it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't buy this book","review":"I loved the Callahan series. In fact, I love most of what Spider Robinson has written, but this book is boring, self-serving and exists only to help him pay for his latest vacation.I gave this book every chance I could. I would think \\"this is boring\\", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think \\"what a stupid plotline\\", but because it was Spider, I read on. I would think \\"this book is going nowhere!\\", but because it was Spider, I read on.Two chapters from the end, the book attempts a plot twist. At that point I thought, \\"You know what, I don't care.\\", and I closed the book.I never slam a book without offering an alternative. If you want to read an excellent book, try Amy Thomson's \\"The Color of Distance\\" instead. Leave this one on the book store shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance - bad opera","review":"This opera has pretty good singing and that's pretty much all. The sets and cosumes are just Eurotrash and the opera itself has little plot and even less interest. The music is Rimsky Korsakov at his most mechanical and even the orchestration disappoints --- which is unusual for this composer. Unless you enjoy watching a group of stupid drunks stumble around and hit one another, it is simply not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Read - Don't Bother","review":"One of the most one-sided, uninspired books I have ever read. Trashes American industry and government at every opportunity while Europeans can do no wrong. The lack of proofreading undermines what little factual information is contained such as confusing Lockheed for McDonnell Douglas. Numerous typos further show a lack of attention such as misspelling the term \\"CEO\\" (no joke) - AND THIS IS THE SECOND EDITION! Save your money and download a mix of Airbus press releases - at least they may contain a picture or two to distract from the propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading!","review":"I deeply enjoyed this book - i couldn't put it down! It's a short book, easy to read but very informative. It just made sense, it really resonated with me. I have felt a big pull towards the Sidhe over the past month and am just so pleased that this book was written. I just finished reading it today and i am very excited to begin the exercises given by the Sidhe. I recommend it for anyone wanting to know more about the Sidhe. )0("},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"I got this book hoping to learn more about the Sidhe. It was pretty much a bust in that respect. What this book doesn't really come out and tell you is that the whole thing is a series of channeled messages. The key is a design that is a modified spiral, a shape that is known to be able to produce altered states of consciousness. So my question becomes is he talking to one of the Sidhe, to a figment of his own imagination, or something else entirely? My guess is one of the latter 2, because at one point the Sidhe flatly tells him that there is no god, God, or gods, when Celtic myth plainly depicts the Sidhe as what became of the Tuatha de Danaan, when they were forced \\"underground\\" by the Milesians, and the Tuatha de DID have one or more deities.I never bothered to finish reading it after that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blah","review":"I was underwhelmed. It may be that Matthews tuned into a sidhe, but his personal writing lacked gravitas for me, and what the sidhe had to say was way too general. I must have expected some fire, incisive thinking. At the very least a rip-roaring good yarn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great new insight in the Sidhe","review":"This book is a wonderful and easy read and I'd highly recommend it for anyone who's not only interested in the Sidhe, but also anyone who's open minded on world events today and what's happening to us as a planet and species. This book gives a wonderfully different perspective on the Fairy realm but also doesn't diminish the idea of the fantastical. My philosophy is that if you continue to hear a common thread is a variety of different sources, books, areas, etc. Then that common thread is truly worth paying attention to. This book is right along those lines but also gives new perspective and insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointing Outing by the Flamenco Maestro","review":"This album is a deep disappointment. On 'Siroco', Paco had pushed the boundaries of Flamenco yet kept its roots. This album, in contrast, sounds like an uninspired rehash. Even the Bulerias 'Compadres' - with Manolo Sanlucar - generates no excitement at all. (Compare this to any Bulerias by Cameron with Paco and Tomatito playing.)

Basically, the game is exactly what you'd expect... it's a sim/strategy type game where you take the role of a zoo keeper, and build your ideal zoo. With dozens of animals, from African hunting dogs to saltwater crocodiles to Asian black bears, this game should appeal to any wildlife enthusiast. The whole goal of the game is to make sure your animals, and guests, are happy. The former is achieved by placing them in a suitable environment, the later by building animal house (like 'reptile houses,' 'primate houses,' etc), resturants, gift stores and other attractions. You can choose several scenarios, from free form games to pre-made games that require you to achieve certain, increasingly challenging, goals. Over all, a very cool game, and one you can get cheaply too. But it will still provide hours of enjoyment. Go for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game, but not perfect","review":"I thought that this game was actully pretty good, and it is addicting and fun. however, i have one complaint. the AI of the guests is TERRIBLE! when they are reallly really hungry, thirsty,tired,have to go to the b-room, etc, they walk RIGHT BY the things that would make it all better. this needs to be fixed in a patch or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff...","review":"Nice package for your kids.

Although there is a downloadable patch which is meant to address this probelm (...), it didn't work on my system. And the problem multiplies - soon the animals are hungry, even though their zookeepers are right there, and should be feeding them.It seems to me that even if it HAD worked, it's a little unfair to expect users to have to go download a patch just to make the game work. Microsoft should never have released it with a problem this obvious. Have they not heard of playtesting?My recommendation is to WAIT until an updated version has been put on the market before buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cool","review":"This game is a lot of fun, but I recommend getting the Zoo Tycoon Complete. You get more options with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Run a Zoo, Have a Little Fun","review":"In Zoo Tycoon you get to run your own zoo. (I'm sure you could have guessed that.) You set up animal exhibits, roadpaths in your zoo, and tourist facilities. When you set up the animal exhibits, the creatures you put in those cages are REALLY picky. Some want this, while others want that and it is difficult to please all the animals in a single exhibit. (They usually agree better if they're the same species of animal.)

Animal sounds are decent, but, overall, game sound is VERY boring - there needs to be more of it. It's really a shame, as the idea of this game has great potential.

An intriguing premise, easy to play, but hard to master, due in no small part to some poor programming of the actions of the zookeepers (who are responsible for the feeding of, cleaning up behind, and tending to the health of, your animals) and the maintenance workers (who are *supposed* to empty trashcans, mend fences, etc.). Your zookeepers, for the most part, tell you what your animals need, although they aren't as reliable as a zoo-owner would hope. And your maintenance workers don't always seem to notice the completely collapsed fences that will allow your elephants to trample your guests...But the variety of animals, complete with their necessary terrains, vegetation, and shelters, makes this game fun, it a bit frustrating, to play. Recommended, with caveats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zoo tycoon","review":"I borrowed this game off a friend, and almost refused to give it back! This game was instead of homework for me! I just couldn't stop playing. I found the layout and access to different controls extremely easy, making this fabulous gameplay. The graphics were quite good. I enjoyed feeding the animals and finding out if they had young! You always had to check on them to see if they had food and had suitable exhibits, which was good because it introduced a slight feeling of desperateness. When youre animals were happy or when an endangered animal was born you would earn awards. You have scientists who research different animals, toys, shelters and park equipment such as merry go rounds and stuff.

Then I got really tired of just cleaning up dung, and having people NOT go to some exhibits. It doesn't have a very friendly interface.

The only part about it that might be fun is the fact that the game does not take much time and that it is very easy, especially if you have the strategy guide which is very helpful, but if you have don't expect to be using much brain power when playing this game. Overall I would give this game about a 71%. I'd recommend Roller Coaster Tycoon over this game any day. RTC is at least a bit challenging and some creativity is invovled with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoo Tycoon","review":"Loaded fine but then couldn't get it to run. Couldn't even get back to a spot where I could get the unique product number. As it turned out, MS doesn't tell you that if you are running a newer version of XP (post Sep 2002, SP1) you have to buy a codec, online, from a thrid party company. For $14.95 additional you can get the game to work on your XP system. MS support was no help. I was very upset and will return to the store I bought it from, Staples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rollercoaster Tycoon fans will love this.","review":"Microsoft finally did something right! Zoo Tycoon is quite a good game. It's a lot like Rollercoaster Tycoon. There are various scenarios where you must build a zoo and ensure that you've a certain number of exhibts, get a certain number of guests, etc. There's also a freeform mode that's quite fun. I bought this as a bundle with Monopoly Tycoon, and this is most certainly the better of the two.The one thing that I didn't like is that the interface is a bit slow at times, and it can be a bit confusing. Overall, for the fans of Rollercoaster tycoon, and like games (Sim City, etc.), would like this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZooTycoon","review":"Zoo Tycoon is a great idea and has lots of potental. Beware of trouble. Its is not very compatible with all computer systems. There are alot of software conflicts that I have come across. Tech support is so-so from Microsoft for this game. They always blamed it on the computer and its software that was preloaded. What's so funny is that my new DELL computer is preloaded with Microsoft software. The troubles I am referring to are lock-ups, freezing and slowness of game prior to locks-ups/freezing. Microsoft needs to fix the problems with software conflicts especially when its their software that is the conflict. Graphics and the ideas of the game are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"gameee","review":"It is a fun game overall. But after a while, all your animals go sad. And non of its workers do anything, no matter how many u have. The people would walk off the side walks and would walk where ever.

I will be buying this game very shortly.I love games like The Sims, Age of Empire, Caesar III and Black & White, etc. From what I can tell from the demo, this game is very detailed oriented, like the beforementioned games. Plus, it has the freedoms that micro-managing-builder gamers, like myself, live for! It does feel like it is a bit more geared for children but that doesn't take away from the fun. If you like the games mentioned about, I have no doubt you will get hours of enjoyment with Zoo Tycoon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I *loved* Roller Coaster Tycoon, so when I saw Zoo Tycoon and read that they played similar, I couldn't wait to pick it up.I don't like it as much as I liked RCT though...it's RCT minus the fun of building the roller coasters, which I really enjoyed.I do like building the zoo, however. The animals are neat, the sounds and graphics are pretty good, and the interface was easy for me to use. I do miss some of the RCT features though, like controlling the prices of your food kiosks globally. The patrons of your zoo are much more varied and interesting than the \\"peeps\\" of RCT.Overall, a good fun game, but not quite as addicting as RCT was. I'm already getting a bit bored with it, and have had it only a month."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 Creating Game","review":"I think Zoo Tycoon is the best building game I have ever played. You can have so many different animals, and even make beaches by combining water and sand. One of the only problems is that the animals reproduce way too fast. I started with 4 lions and ended up with 26! Luckily, you are able too sell your animals. I HIGHLY recommend this game. It is really fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute joy! :)","review":"Unlike some tycoon games which are a bit too tedious and require a lot of time and patience, Zoo Tycoon is so easy to get into and very entertaining and enjoyable fun for all ages.It has it's flaws (don't most games?!) but at the end of the day, I haven't played a game this enjoyable for a long time.Build your zoo, look after it, keep the animals happy and get funding to buy the more rarer animals...The animals look and sound great even though they are very small graphics (A sequel could improve on this and allow to take a closer look at them, and maybe an even more bigger variety of animals)...At the end of the day, Zoo Tycoon is one of those games which make you wonder why they don't make more of this sort of thing...Highly recommended! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This game is fun but the reason why i put 4 stars,is because sometimes the guests can be mad and leave the area.But still it's fun!!!!

When you first start it can be hard learning how to use all of the buttons and controls but after you play for a while it is really good. You can go mad on freedom games.

I really liked this games and everybody out there probabley finds it fun too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snoozer-zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"People say one of the drawbacks for this game is--because it is too much like Roller Coaster Tycoon. However, I, a lover of almost all simulation games and Roller Coaster Tycoon, I disliked this game. Unless you find the concept exciting, do NOT buy this game.Unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon the scenarios are much more boring and broad and after a while (for me, two or three hours) the game became monotanous and boring. It was definately not worth the money and now it is sitting on a quiet dusty shelf.Also, unlike Roller Coaster Tycoon this game appeals to younger age groups. My friend's on (12 yrs. old) loves this game with a passion.So to conclude, I would only recommend buying this game if.....-The idea of building a zoo appeals to you.-If, you are not buying for youself, primarily younger people will take an interest in this.-You don't mind a somewhat monotonous game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"I really wanted to like this game. I did. The concept was good, the features seemed exciting, and I thought that I would spend many weeks enjoying the game. I was wrong. The game play is awkward. There is a patch on the website that helps a bit, but it doesn't fix everything. The zookeepers and maintence workers do their assigned tasks and then wander off into the undevoloped areas of the park, and then when there is a problem you have to hunt them down and physically move them to where they should have been all along. I have a pretty decent computer with more than double all of the requirements, but the game will still crashed on me. Stick with Rollercoaster Tycoon and its add-on packs, and if you complete all of the theme parks there, then keep searching for a new game. Don't think that Zoo Tycoon will be the fix that you need until more Rollercaster Tycoon add-on packs come out like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"crashes and bugs","review":"This game had potential.........but they never worked out the bugs! I find myself worrying about whether the stupid game is going to crash more than winning it! Not only that but you have to start the research projects all over again when the game crashes...even if you saved it. The animals also have issues....like my penguins who after a few months in zoo time froze. I truly was disappointed next time I hope Microsoft fixes the game b4 they release itHowever despite all this...I mastered the game in a few days. Maybe I became tired with the game because I never got far enough to unlock the secrets, which cannot be done if the game crashes every two seconds."},{"rating":"2","title":"**Very entertaining... hard to please**","review":"I love this game - not only can you design the animal's habitat, but you can choose how many animals and create all types of attractments in your zoo. The only negativity I found in the game was how hard it was to please both your customers and the animals at the same time. It's very challenging and fun. AND you can download animals from the website, so I think it was worth the money - well, maybe 1/2 the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good!","review":"I am really into tycoon games, and of the ones I own this one is definitely a cool one. I like the fact that you can put up fences and build your own custom environments for each animal. Although sometimes it does get hard to handle with keeping the grass from being trampled, that is part of the challenge! Another thing that I wish was added to this game was that you can get a Zookeeper to stay in just one exhibit. Unfortunately they walk around and sometimes the pens get \\"poo\\" in them, and the animals lack food. Those are the only two things that I have to complain about. Something good is you can start in a land with up to $500,000!!!! I like that a lot... I would recommend this game to people that like tycoon games and like to keep track of things for sure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft no longer supports this game...DON'T BUY IT!!!","review":"Microsoft no longer provides telephone support for this game. They only provide support for Zoo Tycoon 2. Since I have a new Service Pack for XP this product won't even run on my PC, They neglected to tell customers this as well. And still they allow suppliers to sell the game to anyone..... Boo Microsoft!! Get your money back now!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"chicago mom","review":"My son, who is 5, is addicted to this game. It is amazingly creative, and although you would think you need to read fluently, there are enough symbols that my 5 year old navigates through all on his own.He found out that instead of assigning a zookeeper to feed the alligators, he could just put zebras in their exhibit and they would make a delicious dinner!He also loves animals so much, that he took down their fences to set them free, and the game is so adaptable, that the animals actually started chasing the guests and eating them! This initially was little greusome, and now he is very protective of his guests, but the creativity is wonderful.A must for animal lovers. Great for kids to use their imagination and much better than vegging out in front of the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, But Roller Coaster Tycoon is Better","review":"This Game allows you to create your own zoo, with lots and lots of different kind of animals, exibits, shops, and more! The Scenarios are allright, and the animals look really realistic! I would reccomend getting the double expansion pack also, so you can have water animals and dinosaurs in your zoo too. You can also download different animals and scenery on the original one, and put them in your zoo. It is pretty obvious Zoo Tycoon is competing with Roller COaster Tycoon. So if you buy this, get the double expansion pack with it or later, and the game will be well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic. :)","review":"I do child care, and this cd is one of our favorites.

It is soft, not tough or lumpy at all but is very light and carries little weight. Not much inside it at all as far as stuffing. That's not so bad, though.The fabric is the big problem. It is silky in the way a sleeping bag is, not like a smooth cotton-based fabric. The blank is very loud in motion with friction and has a rough synthetic texture.Other than that, the \\"clover\\" color I ordered is not the very light green as shown on Amazon, but a darker pea soup green. \\"Puke green\\", perhaps.

Hopefully Amazon will fix this typo soon. However, while it does have a slight polyester sheen and rustle, the fabric is really very pleasantly soft with a suede-like finish. And unlike the other reviewer, who claimed that the clover green throw was more \\"pea-soup\\" or \\"puke\\" green, I'm happy to say mine turned out to be a beautiful light silver-sage. All in all, I'm pretty happy with this product.

I hate to say it but this book is no \\"Bad Cat.\\"This latter used the natural expressions of felines and some candid photography to really make a witty little coffee table and gift book. \\"Bad Dog\\" tries to do the same but ultimately fails. It fails because it relies mainly on staged photos of dogs in silly costumes instead of on the natural expressiveness of canine faces and the wide varitey of breeds, not to mention the interesting places dogs end up.Yes, there are some cute costumes and some witty captions here, but on the whole, the book is only mildly amusing.

If you really want the complete miniseries, you need to keep looking -- carefully. The running time for this edition is listed on Amazon (as I write) as 360 minutes. That's six hours. A reviewer states that this miniseries runs 4 hours and forty minutes. On the back of the video cassette case, the running time is given as approximately 192 minutes. However, the actual running time of the tape I received (in a case without shrink wrap but with a proper-looking label on the cassette) was a little over two hours. Even at the length stated on the case, this edition cannot be the complete miniseries if the figure of 4h 40m is correct. And there's no telling where the Amazon figure of six hours comes from. My low rating for this item is due to the unsatisfactory length, not the entertainment value of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than half the original mini-series","review":"The original series runs about 4 and a half hours (I taped it a couple years ago when a local station ran it).

There are sure to be activities to suit any group size, interest, ability and comfort level.

Turns out, that this CD is full of tunes that are so generic and repetitious that after the first minute of each song, you just get bored because it sounds as if the songs starts over again. Thackery doesn't really change the melody from one segment to the next and as a song progresses, it sounds as if he is running out of ideas. This is where things start to get right down dull and makes the CD a waste of money.Regardless of the great reviews this CD got, my opinion is that this CD deserves two thumbs down .... way down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasantly surprised","review":"I picked this one up on a whim, aware of Thackery's history with the Nighthawks. If you like to hear real fretboard mastery, give this one a shot. While he has a sound truly his own, you'll definately hear some of his influences: Buddy Guy and SRV were obvious idols of his. This purely instrumental CD covers nearly all aspects of of the 12-bar march, too. Jazz, chicken picking, a bit of country, jump, swing--an ...-kicking extravaganza.

I have all the songs, except the three new ones, but it is still great to have in one package. The last three songs, which take place live at Sulleys, and last over twenty minutes, is the best part of the CD. I was fortunate to be at the small club when it was recorded, and these excellent grooves of \\"Rude Mood\\" and \\"Detroit Boogie\\", along with the already released, \\"Edward's Blues\\" make in plainly obvious that there is nobody better than Jimmy Thackery and the Drivers when it comes to kickin' out some tasty rockin' blues grooves.

Curl up with it in front of a fireplace while a blizzard rages outside, and watch it warm your heart and cheer your soul. Set in a small town in the Bible Belt south, the book traces the lives of several characters, including a despondent minister, a sagacious masseuse, the local male heartthrob and several cultists, over a Labor Day weekend. Stereotypes quickly fade in the author's able hands, as he weaves a tale of his characters' endearing foibles and takes the plot round some unexpected twists and turns. There are some absolutely hilarious passages, written with a deadpan humor that had me laughing out loud in the middle of the night. The book is in many ways richer than the author's award-winning \\"Ella Minnow Pea\\", and demonstrates Dunn's extraordinary versatility as a writer - the subtext is more subtle, the humor more biting, the author's command of setting and tone more skilled.

Compared with the Juan-les-Pins performance of July 23, the repertoire is similar but the performances here are better -- the rhythm section in particular is very spontaneous -- and the recording quality is above average (and stereo).Many tracks are misidentified: (2) is Blues for Ilean, (5) is Boone's Blues, (6) is Whirly-Bird, and (10) is a blues in C for the rhythm section -- 4 minutes of Basie's sparkling piano, in a playful mood.The sound quality isn't perfect (some distortion and shifting of stereo image), and there are many concert recordings -- but this is one of the best of the late 1960s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banal Beyond Belief - Mickey Jones Home Movies","review":"I watched these today and was amazed at the unmitigated ego displayed by the [...] ex-dylan drummer Mickey Jones.

Billy Blanks offers suggestions on how your form should and should not look at exactly the same time when the camera is panning on one of the background exercisers. Plus, he likes to flex his muscles and say \\"don't you want to look like this\\"? Blanks focuses only on the upper body. He only does one lower body exercise. The stretches are uninspiring. He gives little or no direction and periodically he likes to ask - how do you feel? The few times I have used the tape - I respond: \\"Cheated!!!!\\"The Tracy York portion I have used once.

His workout was easy to follow and do on a rug. The 2nd workout with Tracy is awful. I gave up trying to follow it. Forget about doing this on a rug because she includes slides & crossovers so you have to pivot your feet. The camera focuses on her upper torso so you miss the change in movements. I'll definitely buy another Billy tape, but will avoid anything with Tracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape was a waste of time and money!","review":"After doing TAEBO basics for about 2 months, I was really looking forward to this tape, wow, what a let-down. Billy Blanks did do a good job with the toning section of the video, my muscles felt like they really got a good workout. The aerobics portion was really bad. Tracy Yorks went too quickly, with little explanation of what was going on, and the camera angles were terrible. The video was more like learning difficult dance steps than working out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm disappointed Billy!","review":"This tape was a real disappointment to me. As a huge Billy Blanks fan I was expecting more. The filming was very poor and the tape was slow moving and boring. I only made it through it twice. The workout was okay but nothing spectacular. The aerobic segment was impossible for me to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste!!!","review":"This tape was a complete waste of money. The only reason I gave it 1 star was because I couldn't give it less. The toning section chose to work selective random muscle groups which you couldn't even follow, and the aerobics was (a) low impact for experienced exercisers, despite what they say; and (b) you couldn't even follow her ridiculous 1980's dance steps."},{"rating":"1","title":"What what that?","review":"Thank goodness I just rented this from the library and didn't waste any money on it.The warm up was inadequate. Billy Blanks didn't actually do any of the exercises. He just stood around looking at the ladies surrounding him.It was impossible to be in good form, especially important while lifting weights, and follow the tape. He doesn't say what is coming up next. You have to turn to see. By the time you figure it out, they are on to the next exercise.I made it through 10 minutes before I hit stop and rewound the tape. I just couldn't take it any more.Avoid this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!!","review":"I thought this video was a DEFINITE waste of money! The first party with Billy Blanks is a good arm workout but the second party with Tracy Yorks was absolutely TERRIBLE!

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST Vidoes available","review":"Very disappointing. Sickening actually, with the class doing one thing and Billy saying something else, every 6 seconds someone hoots or hollars, FOR GOD SAKE WOULD YOU JUST SHOW US THE MOVES AND SHUT UP ABOUT IT. Billy doesn't deliver much that's useful in this one. Steer clear!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is probably the WORST tape I own","review":"I bought this tape because I figured that since Billy Blanks is like the Barbra Streisand of workout videos that this tape would deliver. I WAS SO WRONG! First half the time I couldn't understand his workout instructions, then when I could understand what he was saying the people in the video were doing something else.This is a dreadful workout tape, and I would not reccomend it to anyone for toning. It's too fast to get a proper contraction, and not only that you wait for it to be over.DON'T BUY IT! YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What \\"riot?\\"","review":"Ok the first half of the video is from a rarely seen live concert from the '88 Suffer tour. The sound quality is poor , but it's still cool..HOWEVER..the supposed infamous riot footage on the second half is nothing more but 30 minutes of filming broken glass and firetrucks..we don't see the actual rioting at all...NONE....the movie package misleads by saying \\" SEE THE RIOT IN IT'S ENTIRITY FROM FIRST BEER BOTTLE THROWN TO THE LAST , THE THROWING ROCKS , ect\\" ...none of this is seen.we see the footage where the promotor shuts the show down because the fire marshall thought it was too overcrowded....but no actual rioting..just 30 minutes of boring footage of broken glass...what a waste of [money]....don't buy it ....don't waste your money....I only gave it 2 stars for the concert in the first half.."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking","review":"Picture yourself standing behind a pole watching a concert.

The big problem as of this writing (6/10/02) is that we STILL can't sync Entourage to Palm. As far as I'm concerned, that makes Entourage not-yet-usable, since daily syncing with a Palm is, for me and probably most users, an absolute must!

Again, this is beautifully done, but it does not tell you anything. This DVD is to be enjoyed if you have a good knowledge of the space program and want to watch some unseen or rare footage.

At that time we'll discover how good it feels actually to use our brains for something other than passive, thoughtless goggling at spectacles. But until then we'll continue to get things like this. Very pretty pictures, potentially an amazing set of stories, reduced to \\"wow, would you look at that\\" cliches.This DVD is a melange of clips from Apollo VIII onwards, strung together as though it were all one disjointed mission. The footage itself is of course incredibly beautiful but there is a paucity of intellectual content. Very little information, less explanation of history and context, and ultimately it's junk food for the mind.With the footage available a really interesting and profound video could have been assembled. But until the revolution we'll just have to get along with this \\"turn off your brain and open your mouth\\" prettiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetic, plus the soundtrack gave me shivers","review":"This uses all kinds of Nasa footage never shown in public before. Some of the most striking was 'engineering' footage, showing rocket stages separating, various capsules separating and docking, and in one case, a moonwalk during the Gemini program. This concentrates on how the astronauts felt during their voyages and is based on audio interviews done years later. Some of these space cowboys get downright poetic. The best thing about the movie is the Brian Eno soundtrack which perfectly captures the balletic awe of space vehicles and the sights brought back from the Moon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succeeds in intent & we sent the right folks up there","review":"This beautiful looking and beatifully sounding film achieves its intent of capturing the feeling of the space flights of the 1960's. It was not meant to be a supplier of trivial information concerning pounds of thrust or specifications of spacecraft. This movie starts you out at at pre-launch, taking you through an amazing launch sequence, into orbit, off to the moon, around the moon and on it and then back to earth.Other than the visuals and the amazing Brien Eno soundtrack, what I like most are the commentaries by the astronauts. Listening to them, you understand that they realized the magnificence and importance of their journey. Whether NASA or the US government were flying people to the moon for Cold War sabre-rattling or not, the astronauts truly thought of their mission as one \\"for all mankind.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Go to the moon","review":"The moon missions are not very familiar to the the average person. We all know the footage of Neil and Buzz walking around out there for the first time, but some of the more inspiring footage comes from later missions: Astronauts driving the rover around, picking up rocks, skipping and bouncing and falling around the magnificent desolation; knowing you are the only ones on the entire lunar-planetary surface, that you are among the very few who have ever been there or will ever be there.As far as documentaries are concerned, this has got to be one of the best I've seen or can imagine. The extraordinary thing about it is that they make you feel as if you are involved. By not taking the viewer beyond anything but NASA footage and by not giving your ears anything but NASA audio, you really feel like you have shared in these magical, almost unreal journeys, missions carried out \\"for all mankind.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Best Buy","review":"Pros: Very compact, very comfortable, Great sound, Good envirnmental sound deadening.Cons: Messy cord arrangementI like these well enough in comparison to the old Brookstones that I am purchasing another set for my wife.

They reduce most background noise down to something way less bothersome.My only gripes: the huge battery brick you have to clip to yourself somewhere and is not so good for walking around, I wish they'd expand about one more click for people with huge heads... the case is solid but it's kinda awkward to cram everything in there (it should include a slot for spare batteries).Glad I didn't pay 3X the price for Bose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good headphones but not for noise canceling","review":"I rated these 1 star because they did not satisfy the reason I purchased them ... primarily to cancel out engine noise while flying. While they do give you decent sound from your music device, the open-ear design pretty much negates the noise canceling function. I have owned noise-canceling headphones before, Sony. These were closed ear design and did a much better job of canceling engine drone and other low frequencies, tho I had the same annoying problem with crackling and popping when I moved that everyone else seems to have experienced. Bottomline, do not purchase these if your goal is to reduce air travel noise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound!","review":"I thought I would write a review as I have had these for several years now. They are a great pair of headphones! Sound quality is excellent and the noise cancellation is terrific! The ONLY drawback is the battery pack. With this thing in the middle of the headphone cord, you will knock it around and it will fall on the floor at least once a sitting. The battery pack with all of the electronics for the noise cancellation is just in the wrong spot. It has fallen off the table so many times that now I have a low buzz in it. Oh well, I got a few good years out of it anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem With Noise Cancellation Feature","review":"The only reason for my purchase of the Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones was to cancel noise not listen to music, etc. The person that I purchased them for is writing a technical book and relative silence is an important part of the writing process. Unfortunately, the normal surrounding noise was not canceled and, therefore, it was necessary to return the headphones. Please note, the other features of the headphones appeared to be fine. As of 15 August I have not heard anything about a refund, but am confident that will be properly handled by Amazon. I have made several purchases from Amazon and until this one have always been very satisfied with them.

But this item is no good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sennheiser PXC 300 Noise Cancelling Headphones","review":"I read a lot of reviews before making this purchase. I'm not an audiophile or a technical expert on this item but I have good hearing, I know what I like and I'm totally satisfied with these noise cancelling headphones. They're easy to use, fold up neatly for travel and the noise cancellation is amazing.The active electronics are in a separate unit which also holds the batteries. This tends to mean the wires can get a little tangled but this is not a serious drawback. This is an excellent product. If I were to lose this headset, I'd buy the same model as a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable, awkward, noise cancelling just OK","review":"I purchased these headphones as a replacement for my Etymotic ER4 earbuds, which were a replacement for my Sony MDR-NC10 earbuds. Unfortunately, I found them much less comfortable than either the Etymotic or the Sony earbuds and no better at noise canceling.I have used headphones two hours every day for the past twelve years during my train commute. I have been through a long succession of iPods and portable FM radios. I have had a lot of time (too much really) to develop an opinion. I am sticking with the Etymotic earbuds.BTW, the Sony earbuds were great, but if you lose one of the rubber earpieces (like I did - twice) Sony dings you for about $40 for a replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome headphones","review":"Clear, crisp sound. Superior base. Sound not distorted when you use the noise-reduction feature. Works great on the plane as well as kicking back in the living room. I did a lot of research before buying these for my husband who was ready to graduate to something high end. I tend to agree with others that the Bose have a great ad campaign, but the headphones themselves don't compare to these. Also, they're lightweight and not clunky to carry around. Comes with a travel case that fits snugly into his messenger bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I've purchased these Headphones primarily for in flight audio. I've used it while exercising on my Nordic Track and Total Gym machines. They are extremely comfortable, cut out most of the noise from the machines and allow me to listen to my music without raising the volume too high. The sound quality is excellent. Be aware that they don't cancel noise entirely but enough to enjoy the music that's why I gave it a 4 stars intead of 5. I am looking forward to try them on my next long flight.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sennheiser Headphones","review":"Gave it as a gift to my son who flies frequently and listens to alternative music (deep thudding base and no melody - but I digress... this is a review of headphones, not music).

A no brainer in his opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Noise Reduction Headphones for Travel","review":"The best thing about the headphones are thier size and packability. They fold into a small space, fit nicely into the supplied case, and fit easily into my crampt brief case. The sound is excellent (second only to the more costly and bulky Bose), and the noise reduction is great. As with all sit on your ear headphones, they do make you want to take them off after a several hours of use. My wishes for improvements: A coiled cord that would make it easier to keep from tangeling; an adjustable volume on the cord; a cord that you could unplug from the headphone and replace, if needed. I predict it is only a matter of time before the cord gets pinched or damaged in some way and then...goodbye nice headphones. However, after much research, I found these to be the best NR headphones available for the frequent traveler, with limited space in the carry on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Bose QC-3's instead","review":"Bought these, tried them at home and was not impressed with the sound quality for being a Sennheiser model. Know that I am a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to sound quality, but I thought the noise-cancelling feature was more of a weak sound boost and the large noise-cancelling microphone was awkwardly placed halfway down the cord.I returned these and went back to the Bose store and purchased the QC-3's, which sound much better (clearer highs and deeper lows), have a more comfortable fit, have a built in noise-canceling microphone and a rechargeable battery. Yes, the Sennheisers are almost 1/3 the price of the Bose set, but if you're serious about sound quality and appreciate well designed functionality, then trust me, just get the Bose set - you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, all the way around","review":"great headphones, especially for travelling. they sound great and the noise cancelling unit is relatively small, so they are not a big pain to carry around in normal circumstances, but they really shine on the train or plane, where the noise cancelling feature makes a big difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleasing performance","review":"Puts you in a pleasent place while listening. Won't cover up screaming babies or barking dogs and car horns,but the white noise that is ever present is covered sufficiently to make the experience much better than conventional phones.

The Sennheister PXC 300 was given to me for XMas, and it has been a godsend.Pros:By my estimation (hardly scientific) the headphones cancel about 75% of the lower frequency noise on the subway. I get an instant boost in the quality of the music, while canceling out most of the mechanical noises. I will still hear some speech and mechanical noise, but it's no comparision.Very comforable.Cons:The mechanism holding the noise-cancelling circuits and batteries is seperate from the phones, and can be cumbersome. I usually clip it to my shirt.Case is not well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product with an added bonus . . .","review":"One unexpected benefit of these headphones is that with the noise-cancelling on, my hearing aid does not feed back. With most headphones, I have to turn down the hearing aid I wear in one ear to avoid feedback from the headphone cup. And so the music in that ear is much quieter. With this set (and perhaps other noise cancelling phones), I can leave the volume up on the earpiece, and I get a much more balanced audio experience than otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compact noise canceling headphones","review":"I bought these headphones over a year ago for myself and just got this second set for my wife for Christmas. She has a set of Bose headsets, which are great and have excellent sound and noise canceling, but they are just too big and bulky when you consider all the other stuff she needs to carry for business travel. These Sennheiser PXC 300 headphones are very compact...they collapse and fold up and in their case it is smaller than a typical paperback book. The sound quality and noise canceling is maybe a small notch below that of the big Bose, but the very tiny trade-off is worth it. I love these lightweight, comfortable and compact headsets."},{"rating":"2","title":"stupendously good!","review":"I've had mine for almost a year now, still can't believe how great they sound. There are days when I will just sit and soak in the music through these things with a big goofy grin on my face...The non-noise-cancelling Sennheisers are slightly better but I bought these because I spend a lot of time on the elevated train here in Chicago and it gets pretty noisy sometimes. Sure beats the heck out of the Bose phones which cost an extra hundred bucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I own the Bose QC2. The QC2 sounds great, but they are big and carry-on space is always at a premium. I wanted to try the smaller Sennheiser 300's. They are smaller, but they do not do a good job of cancelling out the noise. The right side was particularly bad. It seemed that the noise of the engines \\"leaked\\" through. I recommend avoiding these."},{"rating":"1","title":"decent while they lasted, but poorly built","review":"I enjoyed these headphones for the noise cancellation on long flights, but they are made of cheap plastic and did not hold up well over time. After one year, the the pretty silver pieces on the backs of the earcups came off. A few months later, one of the tiny plastic tabs holding the battery cover in place broke off, so I had to tape the battery case shut. And a few months after that, the rubber insulation pulled away from the jack at the joint, exposing the wires. I wrapped the frayed joint with electrical tape to keep them working a while longer, but on my last flight they finally stopped transmitting sound. The noise reduction still works, but who cares? For the price, they should be made with better materials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones for the money","review":"Sound quality very good. Noise canceling feature works quite well considering the size of the headphones. Major drawback is the separate power pack needed to power the noise canceling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deliver on promise of noise cancellation","review":"I got my pair of PXC300s in the mail today. These headphones do what they claim: They knock out most all low-frequency sound in the ambient environment. When I first put them on in the kitchen, with the fridge, a/c, and fan going it was like inserting earplugs into my ear canals. Deep silence descended. Higher frequency sounds such as the human voice are definitely muted, but will still be heard.As for sound quality, it is a real pleasure listening to music on my laptop or Ipod. Good bass-, mid- and high-range response. Yes, the in-line battery holder is large, but it rests easily on the table, lap or pocket. Good for the office, train or airplane, but I wouldn't necessarily want to go jogging with them. Overall, a good set of headphones for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievable","review":"It is truly unbelievable that someone who is supposed to be a Bible prophecy expert is teaching that Babylon will be rebuilt to become a global economic power.

I will see how long the craftmanship will last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointed!!!!","review":"I got these tweezers because I was very happy with my previous tweezerman for many years (but I lost it). When this one arrived it looked just great until I tryed doing my eyebrows. Instead of pulling the hair out, the edges are so sharp that they just pinch the hair off. It has been a great annoyance!!! Only 1 out of every three hairs actually comes out, the rest get pinched off and stay in leaving a short black stump. To even try to pull out the stump again you have to wait till it grows out a bit. Very disapointed!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Purchase","review":"The tweezer heads didn't align and couldn't grip anything.

I had heard good things about Tweezerman tweezers and wanted to try them, but was daunted by the high price tag. After finding this pair of mini-tweezers for half the price I had seen them in stores, I took the opportunity to buy a pair and have been very satisfied with the results. The sharp edges allow for precision hair removal and have not appeared to dull in the weeks I have owned and used the product. Also, the \\"mini\\" tweezers are sufficient for everything I need. I don't see a reason to pay more for a larger pair. These tweezers are superior to anything you will find in stores in this price range.

It's the best tweezer out of all the other tweezers that I've bought and tried. The way you hold them and the way the tweezer grabs is just perfect.

I have used nothing but tweezerman mini slant tweezers for the past five years.

When I tried them, I found that they were so heavy, and the edge so sharp that it cut every eyebrow hair at the base, instead of pulling them out by the root.

I had to run to the store to buy different tweezers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dry & theoretical","review":"I'm amazed that this book has received so many great reviews, when I've found it extremely dry and theoretical. It seems more like a not very engaging textbook than a resource for working development professionals. It becomes more interesting when Ms. Grace uses occasional real-world examples -- and if she decides to write a 3rd edition I'd strongly recommend she use an editor who can translate her concepts into a more reader-friendly style. I'm a graduate of an Ivy-level school so I'm not asking her to \\"dumb it down\\" -- just don't write in the style of an academic thesis. At least one reviewer noted that Ms. Grace is a warm individual, which leads me to believe that this person has attended her workshops. While she may be an excellent in-person presenter, much seems to have been lost in the writing process, as I didn't sense any warmth or personality in this book. I will continue to read the book to the end, and hope that it somehow gets better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure how I feel.","review":"I ordered this book and it had a nice looking cover on the picture when I placed the order and when I received the book it is just a black cover.

I picked this store due to its high 100% rating and right now I'm not sure if the rating was right. I think it needs to be disclosed you are buying a book without the cover on it.

This movie has the predictable chase scene, the predictible kidnapping, and the predictible boudoir action. If you loved seeing Michael Rooker and his basement in \\"Mallrats,\\" you'll like seeing him and his basement here. This time, he has cranial hair and it looks great on him. Don't get me wrong: some will like this flick. Still, many will see that it's the same ol', same ol'. It is just basically nothing to write home about. It's not despicable, but it's not praiseworthy either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice if you want to learn tips&tricks and nothing more","review":"This is 5 stars if you want to learn only tips&tricks; an learn nothing about assembly. After you read this book you know how to write to files in assembly, how to paint a image on the screen....However this 'master class' learn you nearly nothing about assembly programming. It's just a tips&tricks; book. In a tips&tricks; world you don't survive, because your tips will be soon obsolete. You can better learn the ideas behind the tips. You do need to have a great insight in the fundamentals. With fundamentals I mean: how to make and call procedures. How to pass parameters to procedures in assembly, how are instructions processed by the processors etc.If you're looking for fundamentals in low level programming I would recommend 'Assembly Language and Computer Architecture Using C++ and Java' bij Mr. Reis (ISBN 0534405274)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book presents a wide variety of topics, but doesn't go into a great deal of detail about any of them.

Jane's insecurity in her ability to help the victims of these horrific crimes is heart wrenching, as she struggles with her inner demons to help each witness/victim remember the minutest detail of a memory they just want to erase. Ray, tortured by his own nightmares, is a true doubting Thomas, but is perfectly portrayed as the dark, brooding hero needed for a romantic suspense.Secondary characters round out the story nicely, and Ms. Erickson's creativity allows evil to exude when the murdering rapist plays center stage. Once I picked up WITHOUT A TRACE, I never put it down until the last word was read. Strong, earthy characters, vivid imagery, and a suspense-filled plot, weld together to make WITHOUT A TRACE a top contender for best book of the year, and I am pleased to award it Romance Review Today's Perfect 10.Catherine McHenry"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWSOME","review":"I read this book in record time.

But not this time. A new case has Jane really stumped. The new case she is working on hits too close to home. She is working on a rape case. And along with that she no longer has the support of her friend lover Alan instead she has Ray. Rayhas been hurt too, very deeply and he refuses to heal. Him fueled with anger on the case, and Jane compassion they click.Read the book and enjoy while Janes own rape case iz unraveled and HER vicTIM is brought out, while Ray and Jane face new and old demons of both their pasts.YOU WILL ENJOY THIS BOOK.

They also noted many people were equally satified with the lower end model-so I came to Amazon looking for that one, and found this, reconditioned for about the same price.I have to admit that I bought it fully expecting not to be satified but got a pleasant suprise.

This movie has been adapted from the book Ivan by Vladimir Bogomolov which is hard to get in English.Tarkovsky shows how much can be attained through cinematography, just by using light and shadow, if you do not have a huge budget. Considering that this was Tarkovsky's first movie out of the school - this is a monumental achievement. It bring in the real atmosphere of the war in the backdrop of Russian winter. Every screen is like a picture postcard and actors are really derivatives and are automatically integrated in the atmosphere.Some of the clips at the end of the movie is from WWII and I do not think that was necessary - but again it gives the perspective to the ending - which I will not tell you. After this rest of Tarkovsky movies are quite abstract and difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another artistic movie from the master - Tarkovsky","review":"Tarkovsky has become one of my favorite directors because of the artistic, dream-like quality of his films.

This is a fine film, and that is coming from one who is not necessarily a Tony Curtis fan. This film can be gotten on a poor quality VHS rendition from several vendors (I know because I got one), but it should be redone on DVD while the subject is hot.

In this book, he fields a series of 100 science questions and gives detailed answers, even though each is only two pages in length. Some of the questions are:*) What are imaginary numbers?*) How many particles are there in the universe?*) Why do comets have tails?*) How will the Earth end?*) What is meant by curved space?*) What is the unified field theory?*) What's a breeder reactor?*) What is entropy?As a source for quick and complete answers to many of the common questions about science, this book is unequaled."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paco de Lucia's performance of Aranjuez","review":"I've only listened to the first movement of the Concierto de Aranjuez as played by Paco de Lucia, which is included in a Paco de Lucia anthology (thus I can only rate the first track of this CD, while not having heard the rest of the CD). Paco and the Orquesta de Cadaques really put the Spirito in the Allegro of the first movement. It's the best performance I've heard--full of rythmic energy and excitement. I think the flamenco guitar (I'm assuming that's the instrument Paco is playing) and technique are most suitable for the first movement. On the other hand, I suspect the classical guitar may be more suitable for the more famous second movement (John Williams' performance with the Seville Orchestra being my favorite)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Summer Time","review":"I LOVE Diana King.

The young children I teach enjoy it very much. I think it's great for preschoolers because in order to spot the mother fish on each page, they need to match the color and shape pattern of the little fish, which sharpens their observation skills and even relates to math (matching patterns). Whenever I read it, kids get very excited when they can spot the bit of the mother peeking out from behind a plant or another fish. Aside from that, it's a sweet story about a little lost fish looking for his mom, which is very meaningful and engaging for young children. I definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"how to install easily with latch","review":"I saw many negative reviews about instalations our with latch.

The huge, spacious, warm, and ethereal sound of his classic period were gone with the introduction of this album, and in their place we find dull, flat instrumentation and painfully cheesy solos. In essense, all the horrid 1980's instrumentation our modern ears have learned to despise are packed into this album, creating a landscape of neon and bad hair. The only listenable track is Death of an Analogue, which comes across like a funeral march, but with an eerie vocoder thrown in.

Having read his wonderful later works first, my expectations were high.

The plot is intricate, the characters believable, the research based action is accurate. This is the third of Gordon's books that I have read and I have yet to be disappointed. Increasingly it is difficult to find a novel that you want to read it forever, never get to the end, never have to go back to the beginning, reading that is as enjoyable as eating a good steak.

I purchased this hoping to read about Mr. Ali, the name in the title, NOT Mr. Miller; I have zero interest in hearing his life story. A completely misleading title in that respect, to be sure...Secondly, the concept that is implied in the title is that the reader will be exposed to the Tao essence of Mr. Ali.

Every Maglite that I have owned, in all sizes, have always performed well - buy Maglite. This S&W light drained batteries when off. Even worse, the design means that the front end twists more easily than the lens cover or the battery compartment covers.

I bought it for the UV light to check IDs with.It works just fine and had a solid feel to it. I liked the placement of the switches for the UV and white LEDs. The holster had a snap, but the snap was right over one of the buttons, so you have to be sure that when you put it back that the buttons aren't facing out when you put it back.Mine broke after about a year of use every weekend.

I own many fine flashlights, and I am afraid this is not one of them. First, the flashlight drains batteries even when it is off. I wrote to Smith and Wesson, and they referred me to the company that produces the flashlights for them, Powertech. Powertech will not respond to e-mails/voicemails. Even with new batteries, the light from the 3 white LED's is inadequate (I would say it is around 15 lumens or so at best), and the UV beam is even weaker. Would be good for detailed work (up close hobbies and the like) but completely inadequate outdoors for hunting and tracking purposes. For the same price, the new 3 watt LED mini-mag lite is a suprisingly good option. It has a powerful beam that can be focused.

The story is told in a vivid way that makes it more like watching a movie than reading a book. The main character is an orphan girl named Bird who thinks of herself as tough and brave, which she is. But she also has a tender heart. As she battles her way through life, looking for her father and a way to heal her land, her heart slowly grows in tenderness. She finds people she can love--and who love her. But also, she fails miserably in her quest, until in the end, well, you have to read the book. There is something comforting about the way this story is told. It's like being wrapped up in a warm blanket in front of a fire on a cold night.

Just before this book was released a lot of women magazines ran short articles about the superiority of women that had some men sort of worried. However, when the book was published the guys took a great sigh of relief. Bascially, Ms. Fisher went about it all the wrong way and ended up writing a book that's really nothing more than a bunch of wishful thinking on her part. Fisher states a lot of things that had me saying \\"okay, that may be true, now back it up with the facts.\\" If you're interesting in this sort of topic (and you should be!) check out Ashley Montagu's \\"The Natural Superiority of Women\\" it's out of print for some unknown reason, but you'll be able to find a copy somewhere.

For Ms Fisher's theories to have any validity, human brains would have to be hard wired like salamanders. ALL men thinking one way and ALL women thinking another. All human beings are individuals with individual talents and abilities.The idea that women have unique talents in verbal expression flies in the face of history. How would Helen Fisher explain Shakespear, Dostoyevsky, James Joyce, or thousands of other male communicaters? And where IS this evidence of superior female abilities at communication? They don't exist. If there are differences between the male and female brains, it is a difference in style and nuance, not the determanist gulf that she postulates.

And as for all the insecure men who are not going to like the inevitable changes to come... the human species thankfully continue to evolve. Deal with it. And women are stepping up again to take their rightful place in a world that honors the feminine AND the male, the yin AND the yang, the rational AND the emotional.

This book was poorly written, and is biased. I think it's fine to acknowledge the differences between men and women,in fact I'd like to see more discussion about this, especially the biological aspects. But why not show how both sexes have strengths and weaknesses, and how they compliment each other? Instead Fisher fills page after page claiming that women are superior at almost every task, and in most cases provides supporting arguments that are weak. Talents of males are mentioned as an afterthought. And of course in the 21st century the supposedly limited skill set of males will no longer be needed. I suppose many female readers will eat this up, but discrimination is discrimination, no matter where it's directed.

The plot was somewhat slow, as was the romance between Robert Downey Jr and Nicole Kidman. Thankfully they did get her camera right. But thats about it. Over all, a waste of the money I payed for this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review of Fur. Read on...","review":"Another amazing performance from Nicole Kidman in an extremely flawed film. This was an interesting concept, but the screenplay is weak, and the characters and story are both underdeveloped. There is no depth here at all. You find yourself simply apathetic towards the people on the screen, and this is never good when the film under question is supposed to be a character study.There are a few things to admire in this film, but you just can't get past the feeling that much more could have been done to make this a better film. Robert Downey Jr tries his best to deliver a strong performance, and he does a decent job here...even though he is covered with hair from head to toe through half of the film. You can barely recognize him.See only for two reasons: Nicole Kidman and Carter Burwell's score, which is amazing. I may very well purchase the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I'm not a big Nicole Kidman fan, she normally seems very cookie cutter, but in this movie she had guts. She starts off as a stay at home mom very white fence and apple pie. The strange neighbor (Robert Downey Jr)above her helps her break out of that because he senses something reckless in her waiting to break out. The neighbor has an extreme hair condition. He's literally covered in it. At first he doesn't let her see him, then eventually he does. She doesn't freak out or anything. He's an interesting character definitely, vulgar, outgoing, daring. The chemistry between the two of them is intense. The ending is heartbreaking, beautiful and inspiring. You will be routing for these two. This is one of my favorite roles Robert Downey Jr has played. If you like the blacksheep type of people and indie kind of films then you'll like this one.

Neither Kidman's luminous presence nor Robert Downey Jr.'s talent are enough to save this wreck. Whoever described it as a freak show was being generous.The idea of replacing Diane Arbus's fascinating real life with this \\"imaginary portrait\\" was a bad one, the screenplay is terrible, and the direction is even worse.

Downey, as Lionel, hardly speaks above a whisper and his soft, sinister voice greatly adds to the movie's suspense. His soulful eyes are arresting.

It wasnt the console, that works fine..it was the games. There isnt much to do on them and they get old very fast!!! Considering each game is $20-25, it would cost a fortune to buy a lot.

I find it essential reading for anyone who has read or is reading either the newer revelations of freud and jung, or the works of plato and other ancient philosophers.I notice that many readers are immediately offended by Frazer's apparent disdain for the 'uncivilzed savagery' of non-European cultures. However, this is a superficial conclusion to bring from this masterpiece. A little mulling over of The Golden Bough will show us that the savage's culture that Frazer so often refers to is none other than our own western culture. Frazer reveals to us our own social, cultural, and religious blindfold, which is none other than a pretty rendering of the ancient magics and superstitions explored in The Golden Bough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overpriced.

This book is simply too short and too basic to reccommend. I suggest Maya 4 Fundamentals instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat Little Book","review":"This is a neat little book (182 page). It's a short little tutorial book. It's not deep in-depth, but it has some useful tricks in it.

I used what I learned in the ball rolling tutorial to figure it out.The printing quality, graphical layout, and organization in this book is the best I've ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software and Support needs work","review":"While the techniques advocated by Princeton Review are very helpful, the software is not.

It required steady work, but I believe that the book was well worth it in terms of going in to the testing center on the test day and being fairly comfortable (though nervous) with the types of questions and ways of approaching them. I actually found that the math on the actual GRE CAT was easier than I had expected. My plan was to take the GRE only once, if possible, and with the help of this book, my scores were better than anticipated. Because I graduated from college many (30) years ago, I am certain that without the book, I would have had significantly lower scores in all three of the areas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contains some helpful ideas, but carelessly prepared","review":"Lots of typo's, even on test questions, which is a real problem when you're practicing for a standardized test.

Admittedly, some helpful advice and strategies are given in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is fine - CD-ROM crashes my computer!","review":"The book is fine - does everythign you need a GRE-prep book to do.

He believes he is protecting the flirty Mary Casallas (Karen Austin) from some rouge assassin. When he finds out it is actually a robot, he punches everyone around him, like a scene in \\"Airplane.\\"The movie reminded me of a low budget made for TV \\"Terminator\\" knock off complete with the roommate of Sarah Connor.

It doesn't take long, or too many times of opening the book before the glue comes undone and sections of the book fall out. I tried my best to be delicate to avoid this from happening but, it still came apart.Some of the information is written in a confusing manner and some things are not entirely up to date. The non-updated information is not abundant and one can still learn plenty of information by reading this book.The book does cover everything from the possible cost to the mechanics of a horse, and many other things. It is a good book to have if you're new to horses. But, I would only buy it if you can find a cheap price on it. Simply because of the binding falling apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there...","review":"I got this for a horse production class and was very unimpressed. I've worked in the horse industry for several years, have my own library of horse books and have since I was a little kid. The book is vague, filled with inaccuracies, and doesn't hold much appeal. People would be better, especially for a learning environment, to go with some of the more modern non-textbooks out there. I currently am taking Equine Studies classes that actually are featuring books from public circles and have found them far more informative and easy to follow.

From event listings, music reviews and bands to watch for, book reviews, a full calendar, the most comprehensive list of links and listings for clothing, literature, organizations, art and e-groups..and my personal favorite, a list of drinks from around clubs and bars and how to make them. I think the most suprising thing about it was that you do not have to be in the scene long to appreciate what you find inside though it will give you a better understanding. Even those outside the goth and Vampyre scenes will enjoy and find it an informative read.

While not an emotional tour-de-force like Vienna or Paris, Facing You's genius lies in the melodic motif; throughout the album Jarrett explores gospel-tinged melodies that are bristling energy. The album is punctuated with concise, masterfully executed movements that never lul for a moment, never bore for a beat or even repeat themselves. Easy to listen to (for almost anyone), this album features a Jarrett going light on vocalizations (there is far more singing than groaning here, and more often-than-note its thankfully in key) and playing some of the happiest, fastest (plenty of dazzling, jazzy and classical-inspired runs) and most interesting improvisation of his solo career, which was literally launched by this album.

I had forgotten how many great players came from, or passed through, KC. The names are all familiar, but I now have a better understanding of how the names fit in the development of KC jazz. Personally, I appreciated the pages dedicated to the history of KC and the information that explains how and why the town was \\"wide open.\\" Had the city not been this way early on, the music scene certainly would have turned out different. I also like the inclusion (p. 201) of early Down Beat writer Dave Dexter's explanation on how KC style jazz (or Southwester jazz) was different than New Orleans and Chicago jazz. Several years ago I got to visit the American Jazz and Negro Leagues Baseball Museums in the 18th and Vine neighborhood; I wish I had read this book before I made the visit.

I generally enjoy the writing of Diane Duane.What really spoke to me in this book was how Ms. Duane so accurately captured how it was for me when my mother died when I was a teen. The numbness, how nothing seemed important any more, how hard just sleeping or any thing was hard to do. The stages and feel of what grief is truly.This complete description of how the death of a mother effects and affects Nita's and Diairane's lives and behavior is what makes me urge others to read this book.

A reviewer said that he likes to listen to the PMG while traveling. From his description, while listening, he's instantly transported into a movie like setting. Back in the day, circa 1978 or 80, I was really in love with life, my family, friends and the thought of just being alive. The last time I heard this song was about a year ago or so. Still to this very day, I can remember as a child, closing my eyes, listening to this particular tune, and envisioning how life should be. (And then I grew up and soon came to the realization that life most definitely is cable of throwing a couple of curve balls now and then. Seems more often that not sometimes.)

At that time, I suppose few people realized the musical force Pat Metheny (and Pat Metheny / Lyle Mays) would become. Especially in comparison to Pat's later recordings, American Garage seems a bit dated and perhaps a tad too influenced by jazz/rock fusion style prevalent at that time. Still American Garage is a remains an important work for two reasons: 1) this album captures a developing Metheny/Mays signature style which would thrill audiences and critics alike for the next two decades; and 2) this album exposed a legion of pop-weary audiences (particularly young listeners) to the possibilities of Jazz. If you were fortunate enough to catch any of the Pat Metheny group concerts during this period you know exactly what I mean.Pat Metheny has only gotten better, but if you are a serious fan, this CD is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"a little R&R","review":"I've been a Pat Metheny fan for years. I have most of his releases and find myself coming back to this CD alot. I think American Garage has a more of a rock n roll feel to it. I think Pat was experimenting with a garage band sound. The sound is probably not as polished as some of other efforts but I think it shows that Pat Metheny can mixed it up when he wants. He is always trying to add & experiment with new ideas This CD exemplifies that and show Pat Metheny in a slightly different lightI think this a worhty effort with lots of interesting guitar work. I particularly like Across the Heartland and Airstream. Most of the songs are easy to listen to although they may seem a little improvisational at times they usually have a nice flow to them. I would recommend this CD particularly as introduction to Methenys work and if you like a little rock & roll with your Jazz.

Also Travels (live) is excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"America The Beautiful","review":"Not being much of a jazz fan at the time, in the late 80's I was coerced into seeing a Pat Metheny concert and left the show quite impressed.

Some of the compositions have their moments, but mostly this is pretty boring muzak; there's hardly any improvisation, inspiration, or edginess as there was on the aforementioned albums, just a reliance on cheesy new-agey compositions. This unfortunately foreshadowed stuff that I consider to be some of the worst music Metheny ever made, like Still Life (Talking)--totally dull and sappy music. Another factor that doesn't help this album is the muffled and unimpressive production. It just has no physical presence, crispness, or clarity. After hearing the first PMG album I was totally ready for the next record to knock me out. Instead, it was a total anti-climax."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good single to compliment cd 2","review":"Black and white town were a lot of main stream listeners first glimpse of doves, a good song but not a starting point.At the tower sounds like it should be on the soundtrack to a western remake.

Once I began reading, however, I found her writing style to be extremely repetitive, with many sentences being paraphrased over and over again. This may be intentional, to reflect the confused state of mind during a stressful period in the author's life, but does not, in my opinion, add substance to the book or to the subject matter.Having said this, I have to mention that I do empathise with her story, being a bipolar patient myself.

Its principal asset is that Dogbushes deals intelligently and sympathetically with a young girl's emotional and physical growth.

The only tough thing about the book is that it is sort of a slow journey... you might find yourself wandering a bit in the early chapters, but it is immensely satisfying if you can forge through them and take an amazing ride through this guy's life (don't skip any chapters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lust for Life","review":"After seeing the exhibit, I was wanting to learn about his life - the book, LUST FOR LIFE is very good reading and interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Provides a meaning to life","review":"Lust for Life has been and remains my favorite book.A fictional biography of Van Gogh, the great artist who 'cut his ear off', is not only well written, but a great motivator.Stone's sensitive and entertaining of Van Gogh's life helps provide some anchors in a search for meaning. What is truly impressive is that Van Gogh, despite his near 'silver spoon' origins and strong family connections with the art World, persisted in doing his own thing. He used to starve, while using his allowance for canvas and paints. And that too without knowing that he will be one of the Masters. This belief in self was truly insane.I am not courageous enough to follow such a path, nor have a comparable passion (or talent) to focus on. But this book helps in defining what life can be aimed at, and hence provides a meaning to life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful book","review":"I haven't read many biographies since I was in elementary school, but I suspect that even if I'd read hundreds, this would still rank as one of my favorites. Absolutely riveting, and it gave me a much greater appreciation and admiration for Van Gogh himself, his difficult life, his work, and his wonderfully indulgent brother, Theo. Highly recommended if you have the slightest interest in art and Van Gogh in particular."},{"rating":"1","title":"But it's not real","review":"Though this fairly well-written book tells A story about the possibilities in the life of Vincent Van Gogh, it's not what actually happened. There are real events and words from the painter, but it's strung together in the writer's imagination. I was left feeling empty, missing a real connection to what might have motivated Vincent Van Gogh during his life. Readers are left without the means to consider Van Gogh's actual life because this is just one person's guess-though an educated one-as to what happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best kitchen printer for the money","review":"In all my restaurants' kitchens, I need to have a copy of the ticket for the salad prep person, and another one for the line cook. This printer allows me to use two-ply paper that prints both copies in one go. I have used this specific model in 4 of my restaurants for the last 8 years, and I have been extremely satisfied with it. The paper is available very cheaply at Sam's Club and comes with a replacement ink cartridge in each box. If there had not been power surges that had fried absolutely everything that was plugged in, or the occasional bottle of cooking oil or balsamic vinegar that fell on them, I would still be using the original printers, as they are extremely robust and well built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy sandbox","review":"My boys thought that a treasure chest sandbox was a cool idea, being into the pirate theme. Thankfully I purchased this sandbox in-store, because I returned it the very same day. I didn't even fill it with sand before I realized it was a cheaply made toy. The plastic is thin and was bent or warped in a few places. The lid wouldn't fit on correctly, even if it wasn't bent at some of the edges it wouldn't have been a good, secure fit. I was surprised that Little Tikes would make something so flimsy. I exchanged it for the Step 2 Naturally Playful Sandbox, which is sturdier and the lid works much better. Spend the extra $10 for a sandbox that is higher quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just fine -- until it rains!","review":"We were quite happy with this sandbox until it rained! The lid and sides allow rainwater to fill the sandbox, and until we replaced it with a MUCH better alternative (Step 2's Naturally Playful Sandbox), we had a sandy-bottomed pool and a very disappointed little boy. Little Tikes was good about it, though, and in return for us sending them photos of the water-filled sandbox, they did send us a certificate for the purchase price to use toward other Little Tikes products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Flimsy Lid","review":"I bought this sandbox for my 2 1/2 year old son, and he loves playing in the sand with it. However, I am taking it back to the store & exchanging it for the Naturally Playful sandbox (which I was originally going to purchase, but got this one instead to save $10 - mistake). As soon as I put the lid on it caved in the middle (of course, I already had sand in it). Also, the lid just seems to lay on the top, and could be easily blown off. I'm sure it won't last through many sunny days or storms so it will be going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"moldy sand","review":"This sandbox is terrible. We have had it for one year now and it doesn't keep the water out even with the lid on. In fact, there are such large gaps between the lid and the box that it becomes an insect haven (spiders, earwigs etc). The wind has blown the lid off several times. And so much moisture got into it over the winter because the lid didn't fit properly that when we opened it up this spring all the sand was moldy on top. Talk about disgusting. Unfortunately, my hubby is really frugal so he won't let me buy a new box for our girls but for those of you still shopping, my advice is to save yourselves the hassle and spend an extra $10 or $15 on a better box."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"My son is turning 2 in a month so we bought him this sand box. He LOVES it! we cant tear him away. My husband and i also like it, Because it looks good on our patio and it doesnt stand out.Its a good value for someone with a small outdoor patio or deck that is covered.The shape makes it take up less room than the animal shaped ones and its bigger!Although, I do agree that the plastic it is made out of is not as good as the animal shaped ones. This one is thinner but its not that flimsy like some say. However the cover IS flimsy and i could see water maybe getting in if it rained hard. Or the cover blowing off in a big wind. We have NOT had that problem because we have a covered patio.That is why i gave the durabilty of the toy a 3 the cover could be made better. Other than that it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable sand box!!","review":"We ordered this sand box for our son's first birthday.

A forgotten gem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"I'm working on a project about Curie, so I've read several biographies about her thus far. This book isn't absolutely terrible, but I think it handles Curie poorly. It underexplains much about her life and motivations, gives little due to the science behind her work, and goes out of its way to make her \\"inner world\\" excessively dramatic. Curie's story is amazing and fascinating, but this book sacrifices explanatory detail and historical context in favor of an emotionally simplified (and thus more boring) version of the person. Even the title is misleading -- Curie was dedicated to her work and slightly reclusive, but she was hardly an obsessive personality.I encourage you to please check out the longer but much more engrossing biography by Susan Quinn (titledMarie Curie: A Life (Radcliffe Biography Series)), which provides the historical and scientific context necesssary to make Curie's story really come alive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book","review":"Very good book for someone interested in Marie Curie's life.

I bought it as part of a surprise gift for my daughter and had it shipped to my mom because they won't ship to APO. It's a shame that this company won't send stuff to the military families serving overseas, protecting their rights. Anywho, my mom never received any of the stuff and when I reported it to the company they pretty much called my mom a lier and told me that I was out of luck and wasn't going to get my money back. Thank goodness that Amazon stepped in and gave me my money back, but now I am still stuck with out any bedding for my daughters new bed.

If you primarily listen to music there are probably some other subs in this price range that may suit you better. For home theater though I think this is as good as it gets for the price. Now as you move up in budget there are a LOT of great subs out there starting in the $350+ range but not everyone has that kind of money.

I paid them for the shipping because the canopy is a necessity for me but felt really disappointed in the company for it (by the way, the postage stamped on the envelope that the canopy came in was about $3).If it weren't for the poor customer service and the disintegrating foam, the carseat would be a 3 star anyway.

Also the color of the usb cable is black and not white as shown in the picture.I am not too fond of the old school enter key that looks like a \\"return\\" key from older keyboards, but that is a personal preference.

My husband is military and we moved to Germany, so we canceled the service before our contract was up.

Much like 1984 by George Orwell, many of the prophecies have fallen short of the mark. The Utopian strain of Bellamys vision is apparent but we have not nearly evolved that much. This book contains a lot of the naivity of the Socialist/Marxist intelligentsia of that era. Human nature, alas, is still much too flawed for that. But politics aside, this is an enjoyable, well written novel. Bellamy is obviously preaching but it does not detract from the story. Julian West is a sympathetic character in spite his aristocratic origin. It should also be stated that some of the predictions of the book like credit cards and malls have come to pass. It was stimulating and thought provoking to read this book in the year the story allegedly took place. It should remind us that we have come a long way but we still have a long way yet to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Public Domain, Do Not Purchase","review":"You can get this book, and many other out-of-copyright (public domain) books, either in Kindle-compatible text or mobipocket format or easily-converted HTML, for the great price of $0.00 from source such as Project Gutenberg, The Universal Digital Library, and others.Kindle is great, BUT I don't think we should tolerate anyone applying DRM to public domain material."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is amazing","review":"Ok, i got this book as a gift. I had never heard of Bellamy and was worried that I would not like this book at all. But my apprehensions were soon soothed by the most interesting background story written by the editor Laura Bonds. The prologue she wrote about Bellamy sparked my interest and,honestly, I could not put the book down.The book is about a boy who goes to sleep and wakes up in the year 2000 (113 years later). The boy intellectually struggles with the facts of his old world and this new world utopia he has awoken in.The fictional utopia created by Bellamy birthed several utopia movements in America.I would recommend it to my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off and On Target (or Wal-mart)","review":"Edward Bellamy's vision of the year 2000 from the author's vantage of 1887 was wrong on the big things, but right on many smaller things. The Utopian communistic society never came to pass in America, but other things did. A previous reviewer mentioned the foreshadowing of e-commerce, but I would add cable broadcasting and the superstore, i.e. Wal-mart. Bellamy had a New Englander's hatred of waste and the book was his attempt to answer that very American question, \\"How can we do this better?\\"All in all, a hopeful and challenging book. It makes you ponder conditions in the real year 2000 and the possibilities a hundred years hence. If you liked H.G. Wells' \\"A Time Machine\\" or Thomas More's \\"Utopia,\\" then there's a good chance you'd like this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book--just don't buy this edition","review":"This is a great book and would rate 4-5 stars. However, this version is a 'print on demand' type reprint. The quality of paper is good but the font is very small AND the text is pushed together: there is not much space between lines and there is NO spacing between chapters (where usually it would start on new page). The end result is a great book that is hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth your time","review":"The book is (at best) a third rate utopian hack job, that maybe has some interest for those who have a special interest in utopian lit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book I have ever read","review":"When I picked up this book I was hoping for something in the strain of Brave New World or 1984. Well, Bellamy is no Huxley. This book is dry and unimaginative. The author's view of the year 2000 is almost comical. In over a hundred years(the book was written in something like 1887) the only change is that all of humanity has learned to work together. The funny thing is that is all this time the mode of dress has stayed the same. So somehow man has changed his entire inherently selfish nature but hasn't been able to come up with a better shoe style in a hundred years. Give me a break. If you are looking for a thought provoking look at the future I suggest Aldous Huxley's Brave New World. As for Bellamy's Looking Backwards, leave it on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paint Drying is more interesting","review":"Having been forced to read \\"Looking Backward\\" by Edward Bellamy, for a American History class, I can safely say that there are some parts that are interesting, but most of the novel is about as mind numbing as watching paint dry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but a bit boring","review":"I enjoyed reading \\"Looking Backward.\\" It speaks much about the problems facing America near the turn of the century; the problems that affected almost everyone in America every day. The problems of greedy monopolists is the most evident, but also others. The book is not as much as a story as it is the author laying out his groundwork for a perfect society with a story sort of, but not really, built around it. There is sort of a romace, but almost the entire book is characters telling the protagonist what the future is like. I do find it funny though. Back in the 19th century, authors GREATLY underestimated the technological progress of mankind. Just decades later, it was the opposite- and authors were greatly overestimating it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Victorian fantasy","review":"Written during the era of the worst excesses of the \\"gilded age\\" and some of America's worst early labor upheavals including the Great Strike of 1877 and Haymarket and just prior to the Pullman and Homestead strikes. Looking Backward is an expression of Bellamy's faith that the industrial age and industrial cities could be made to work for all, not just the few. The book, a top seller of its time, above all shows that our ancestors believed they could reach the future without perishing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good catalyst for discussion, but a dry, flat style","review":"Our high school read this book for our Summer Reading Program. Most students and faculty agreed that the book raised excellent questions for discussion, but the dry, flat style of the writing made it very difficult to read. After falling asleep several times trying to read this at night, I finally forced myself to read it early in the morning. Bellamy spends much of the novel explaining how this socialist utopia functions, providing detailed analysis of the economy, government, education, and other institutions. I would recommend this book to readers interested in discussing political issues, but not for readers who need a strong plot or dynamic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I continue to rate the skin medica products very highly.

The socialist Utopia taken to new heights, socialist USA. I knew this was a book highlighting the greatness of communal society, it was worse than most because it tries to paint the America of the past with a Marxist brush. It attempts to place liberty into a socialist utopia where, even in this complete work of fiction, it can't live. There is nothing particularly interesting or new here. Stick to the classics if u are amused by the socialist ideology."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obama Blueprint?","review":"I happened across this book while reading \\"the politically incorrect guide to the 60's\\".It was noted as a utopian fantasy where the government solves all problems, spreads the wealth around, and all corporations and capitalists are evil.Classic Marxism and typical liberal fantasy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stalinism revisited","review":"Oh how lovely. Bellamy forgot to mention the millions of people that were liquidated for the purpose of creating this little fantasy world of his. What happened to all the people that didn't quite agree with this little society and wanted to do their own thing? This is probably the most stupid book I have ever read. Let's just judge imperfect present with our imaginary vision of the supposed perfect future. Great, we all know where that leads. Bellamy would have been a good killer for Stalin, until he finally got choked by the machine himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly insane","review":"Insane, cute, or just plan weird this is a great book that shows just how creative Michel's imagination is.

I can't imagine how Jeff Scott Soto isn'tmore widely recognized for his contributions of melodic rock music, but hey, sometimes the best things aren't even known.Takara released this greatest hits record in 2004; and it covered their three studio offerings of the 1990s. \\"Eternity: The Best Of Takara\\" is what greatest hits packages should be about. You get a whopping eighteen songs on this baby, including five from \\"Eternal Faith,\\" six from \\"Taste Of Heaven,\\" five from \\"Blind In Paradise\\" and two acoustic numbers as well. That's a lot of tracks for only covering three albums. My favorite songs are \\"Spotlight,\\" \\"Fallen Angel,\\" \\"Two Hearts Together\\" and \\"Your Love.\\"Like I said, this is the way to go for a greatest hits offering. No way to go wrong with all the songs you get, and you may in turn want to track down the bands three studio offerings as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from complete","review":"I was very disappointed that some big Hollywood stars were not in the book (including some that were easy to come by), and yet so many stars that I've never even heard of were filling so many pages. I've been a serious Hollywood autograph collector and enthusiast for over 20 years and was upset to see some of the bigger stars not included. Some big and popular stars missing were Dustin Hoffman, Orson Welles, Cyd Charisse, Christopher Reeve, and Gloria Swanson. And who in the world is Kelly Reno? Sherilyn Wolter? Jackee Harry??A waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book really isn't worth the money.","review":"I am not a big fan of this book. If you subscribe to \\"The Autograph Collector\\" magazine, you would know that 80% of the magazine is advertisements, and you would think spending [money] on a book you wouldn't have 25 pages of ads. Also, many of the signatures in this book do not match signatures I have received in person. In stead of the ad's they should have used that extra 25 pages to list more examples of stars signatures, or at least list more people. I would suggest that they make the signatures themselves smaller, as many people are copying the signatures out of the book onto index cards and photos, and selling the forgeries on ebay. All together, I would suggest you buy a different book; this one is not even worth what you would pay for it used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid","review":"I saw these guys live on the Southern Ska Tour and bought this cd.

Aimee and Shane along with their new friend Stasia must stop them all by first stopping the Headless Horseman. Overall it was a great book. It got boring at times, but not for long!

I love the premise of this movie and can see a modern variation on this theme of giant bats that \\"sever the jugular\\" of their victims.As a warning to all, do yourselves a favor and only buy the one which states that the movie was released by the Bela Lugosi Estate since this version uses the original film elements to present a nice, crisp picture. Bela Lugosi Jr. offers running commentary during the film as one of the Extras. He looks well preserved for his age if you get my drift.Anyway, a fun movie to watch. Don't take it too seriously. After all, it is a 1940s B-Grade horror movie. Just sit back and enjoy the show.

It's easy to follow this film and its plot of a mad scientist turning loose killer bats on people, and the humorous idea of using a special aftershave scent to attract the bats. The picture quality in some ways is what you would expect from a film that's over 70 years old, but in other ways it should've been preserved better. The best part about this movie is its length: just 69 minutes of madness!!! If you like the chiller thriller genre, and are a fan of Bela Lugosi, then give this one a try. You may like it more than I did. This film seems to be hit or miss. It was a miss for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be wary","review":"The morons I purchased this item from sent me just another copy of Devil Bat. Just Black & White with no color version.

These fuzzy monsters are attracted by a new aftershave lotion he's formulated in his secret laboratory. He gets his intended targets to splash some on their faces.

Even though this movie doesn't compare to big hits such as Aladdin or Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, this movie is hilarious. Every time I watch it I still get a kick out of a new scene or two. I love the character Prince John. Now I know he is a villian but, with him being jelious of his older brother and trying to live up with his mother's expectations he acts like a little two year old and he shows it well.What is also neat is that Disney has used animals and not cartoon people.

My VHS version was looking rather tired.The animation is classic Disney, and makes a smooth visual transition from its predicessor, \\"The Jungle Book.\\" Musical sequences are interwoven beautifully with the story, and the outstanding character development imbues each of the main \\"leads\\" with a larger than life persona.This new DVD version of the movie has remastered the audio and video aspects of the movie, breathing a renewed life into a venerable classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great edition","review":"I can't add anything about the movie itself.

If you don't, there is no reason to upgrade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hey, it's a terrific comedy ...","review":"Robin Hood often gets slammed by people who don't understand what it's supposed to be. No, Prince John isn't particularly menacing; yes, he's outwitted by Robin at every turn. This isn't meant to be a dramatic confrontation between good and evil ... it's a comedy. A ninety-minute collection of cartoon set-pieces, most of which are extremely well-done and hysterically funny (with the intentional exception of \\"But Not in Nottingham,\\" which shows the human impact of the villain's machinations in a way I wish more Disney films would).Enjoy it for what it is -- this was Disney's funniest feature until Aladdin.

It's one of the few animal/human hybrid like movies the Disney company does. I like this one because there's not just romance in it and that's what really makes it more fun.The music is all right. Not really the best score but I think the script and colors makes up for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie comes alive on DVD!","review":"If you are a fan of this movie, you owe it to yourself to see it (or own) it on DVD. The color transfer is fantastic, the backgrounds are lush and detailed, as opposed to the washed out old VHS tape. The colors and line quality of the main characters are sharp and vibrant as well, I was hugely impressed. The movie looks on par with the newest animation releases, I can't say enough about the great colors. The background paintings look especially nice, with an almost computer-esque gradient fades on the sky. The sound is somewhat of a disapointment though, only Dolby Digital 1.0. I found it sounded best on 2-Channel stereo, even with a high end center channel.

For this DVD, Disney took a non-widescreen movie and MADE it widescreen. What does this mean for you? Less movie! Since they cannot \\"add\\" footage to fill in the sides of a widescreen TV, the only way they can do it is to zoom into the picture and crop out the top and bottom! This destroys any sense of composition those poor layout artists worked so hard to achieve, and is essentially like watching the film with your eyes half closed. In order to fill your widescreen television, and tout this release as \\"Enhanced for 16x9 Televisions,\\" Disney thought it was a good idea to bring you 25% LESS movie.

I recently rented Disney's live action \\"The Story of Robin Hood\\" and was so impressed I went out and bought the video - great film full of excitement and suspence. It also explained the whole legend of Robin Hood better and gave the characters a bit more depth.

Sure, it's entertaining, but the DVD release it got once was enough to satisfy it, I personally can't see the film improving with a digital restoration.Still, before saying anything else, I'll wait until the Special Edition is out and then we'll see, but so far, this film gets a 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T purchase from godsnet!","review":"I purchased this item as a Christmas gift for my grandson.

I had a VHS copy of this movie years ago and loved the movie. This was a gift for my little nephew. Needless to say, we were very disappointed that this DVD would not play. I contacted the seller, who suggested it may have been a European version, and then left it up to me to figure that out based on looking for either the number \\"1\\" or \\"2\\" somewhere on the item description page. I would suggest that sellers make this information more apparent on the item description page when selling to both customers in the U.S. and Europe. It is important to note, as with many Disney movies, this DVD is not in current production and availability is limited.

It was to be a Christmas present, but I received it January 15th. The cover and all writing is in Italian! The worst thing is that it will not play on the dvd player, or the x-box. It will play in the laptop. It says this dvd is only available for viewing in Italy and a bunch of other foreign countries nowhere near here. I ordered it from Utah, you would think they could send it here and it would play. I have never heard of such a thing. I can't send it back because it had to go back to Italy and I will not deal with that overseas mailing hassle. This has been a nightmare and I feel Amazon shouldn't work with 3rd parties like these people. I like to order from Amazon.

However, what puts me completely off them, to the point that I'd rather use GHS Precision flatwounds if I couldn't find Thomastik-Infelds, is that they are very slippery under my fingers.

I think it's his first work, and it basically sounds like any Jazz trio you may find in a college ensemble. CD's like Letter From Home (my favorite), Offramp, Secret Story, First Circle, and Still Life Talking have the outstanding and unique sound that made Pat a superstar.There was not even 1 song on this CD that I could add to my Metheny MP3 collection. Not even close. I wasted my money.

This is where as you would say, when Metheny and Pastorius were \\"pups\\".As Metheny once said in an interview on this album \\" itsan album that was very easy,Jaco was not on drugs,we wereboth very expressive,rather \\"clean\\" \\" These are the basics ofPat, even with Jaco ,he has not really \\"rounded out his sound\\"yet. Bob Moses picks up the beat quite well, followingJaco or again is it the other way around? An excellent CDstarter. There are now two different styles of Metheny,his early ,without the electronics,then the newer ones withpercussion,voices,and \\"fancy\\" guitars. This is the bestyou can get for an early sound ,but quite impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Right on!","review":"As the previous review comments, this is probably THE best metheny album just because on this album metheny shows off a level of improv and songwriting that he hasn't surpassed since ( he has equalled it though...). And given the fact that there's some of jaco pastorius best bass playing on this album (in my opinion), and that Bob Moses isn't all that bad 8-)....you get a hell of a record if you're into Pat Metheny.Btw. If you like this abum you should also check out questions#answers (metheny) which I hold as a contender to the title \\"best metheny album\\"; I think the combination Holland/Haynes works is slightly better than Pastorius/Moses. Well, my 2 cents for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"concentrate on Bob Moses","review":"I agree with all of the positive reviews for this music. As a drummer I am fascinated by the playing of Bob Moses. Bright Size Life was one of my first exposures to jazz music. It's 10 years later, all of the jazz genres have been taken into account, and this drumming still represents a peak of beauty to me. Missouri uncompromised and the concluding drum solo on the Ornette tune take the cake. Bob Moses!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Revlon Warm Light","review":"I love this product.

Harris directs his writings towards a dyed in the wool NetWare sysadmin, who is now confronted with Novell's new fangled Open Enterprise Server. The Open refers to an amalgam of the closed shop NetWare with the open source world of linux and its various network utilities. More to the point, the Netware sysadmin faces a qualitatively different approach.So if trepidation is in order, Harris combats it with plenty of details as to how to transition. Not that NetWare is being abandoned, he emphasises. But the positive approach you should take is that your NetWare skillset and marketability can be enhanced by learning about OES and its linux leanings. For example, the book shows how the Apache web server and the Tomcat engine can interact with NetWare. If you do not already know those packages, now you have a context to do so. And outside NetWare, knowing Apache and Tomcat is no bad thing, career-wise."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Concealer","review":"I have been using this product for about 6 years now.

Challenging a common assertion that the community are fully assimilated and largely secular. Instead, he found that due in part to persistent discrimination and exclusion early in that century, many Jews formed parallel associations. This arose in the occupational and social contexts. Plus also educational, as several universities refused to admit Jews.Some of the Jewish organisations were of a strongly religious nature, and looked to a lengthy Jewish history for inspiration and for recruiting members.The book delves into documenting numerous Jewish groups that flourished during these years. Not all religious. Some were quite secular.

I assume it recharges from the cradle along with the iPaq.

There's no over orchestration or overworked arrangements that can bury a singer. Ella's voice is the blossom on this lyrical vine. There is something about this album that captivates. It is my favorite. Ella Fitzgerald's singing is not of this world and this album would make angel's sit the set out. Hyperbole? Perhaps, but I challenge you to find another suite of songs by any other singer that just melts time and has you saying, \\"I have to listen to this again...and again...and again.

Written by series creator Terry Nation, this episode contains surprises and a satisfying ending to the saga of the crew of the Liberator. However, the BBC decided to bring the series back for one more season and with Nation in Los Angeles, the series was left in the hands of script editor Chris Boucher. In \\"Rescue,\\" the premiere episode of the fourth and final season, Boucher strikes again with a plot that starts off well, but once again offers a disappointing ending. Plus, the characters take on their darkest natures under Boucher's pen and it is hard to root for them during his episodes.

Well, they did. Yale, meet the Addams Family and The Munsters. Morticia and Lurch are more believable than the Skullsters in this thing.

That proceeds from false assumptions. The central theme of the film is about a power play between two council leaders. Once you see that, then the events of the film fall into place, since the junior players in the events are pawns of the council members who are competing for the leadership of the Skulls. This film has more layers than an onion.The special FX used in this film are so invisible it is amazing. All the FX serve to further the story.The additional material is superb, and the commentary shows the production process, amongst other things, and the deleted scenes show how a movie is crafted into a flowing creative, vibrant entity.ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the typical teenage horror movie...","review":"This movie doesnt have all of the blood and gore, but it does have suspense.

Joshua Jackson is OK; Leslie Bibb is, too.The plot is thin...but if you want something to relax with, enjoy and then forget, this is worth the time. It is reminiscent of other collegiate and prep school films. It isn't as good as Dead Poet's Society, nor is it another School Ties.The basic plot is predictable, but there are enough twists and turns to keep you wondering exactly how we're going to end up at that predicatable ending.The first half of the movie is strong, and if the screenwriters could have kept it on campus and out of the fully-adult world, the second half could have been stronger.Rent it...don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"'Skulls' hits a nail, dead in the head.","review":"I have gone to a museum and seen more life in a skull, than in the film The Skulls, a cheesy teen thriller about a college student who reluctanley gets into a secret society, named for the title, The Skulls and then procedes to find flaws in it, only then wanting to get out, and discovering the only way out, is to die. The only thing thats worth watching in this bore fest is Lesley Bibb, who we dont even get to see as much as we'd like. There is no suspence in this suspence, and no depth with the charactors, other than that they would pretty much do anything to get into a \\"secret society.\\" The directings not all that bad, but it doesnt help, the actings not either, like i said with the exception of Bibb, and the writings not even all that swell.

Jakcsons character, Lucas MacNamera, is a lower cless student at an Ivy league School, who one day gets accepted into a Secret Society called the Skulls. Caleb Mandrake, Walker's Character, is a rich student attending the same university who meets Luke due to fate and they become instant buds. For the first time, Luke's life is going great, but when his best friend Will suddenly appears dead, he knows it has somethinng to do with the Skulls, and then he realizes, if they could give him that much, imagine what they could take away! I really loved the plot, because it just kept getting thicker and thicker, and the intense subject matter was lightened once in a while by witty one-liners. I enjoyed it very much, but I would not recommend it for younger viewers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good looking but horribly dumb","review":"This film is nicely shot and has a really good look to it, but these can't save it from a terrible script, wafer-thin plot, generally poor perfomances and lack of a single character with whom one could sympathise.Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's no mystery","review":"This film lacks any of the suspense or intensity that makes good thrillers memorable.

I have taught out of the 5th and 6th editions of this book for 4 years. The students absolutely hate it. It is cluttered and confusing. The order in which grammar and vocabulary are presented defy logic and all current research in second language acquisition. This book has been torn down and put back together so many times, that it is a hellish mess. Language methodology has changed and evolved over the nearly 25 years this book has been in use, and now this book doesn't know what it is or wants to be. The exercises in the book are worthless. All the instructions are in Spanish from chapter 1 on, and the students cannot interpret them, which renders the activities useless. Dicho has had a good, long run.

This is a waste of time and money. I dont understand why your version is not the same as the one sold by the CCSF?

It starts out as the dream novel every baseball fan has been wishing for since \\"Shoeless Joe.\\" But, it quickly disintegrates into a story of friendship, true love, self-indulgence, and over-the-top cliche baseball drama.Another reviewer spoke of misspelled street names - even worse Mark McGwire's name is spelled incorrectly twice (McGuire - what MS Word suggests as the correct spelling). How can anyone respect a baseball book that spells a Hall of Famer's name wrong twice - what's next Babe Rooth?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Like it","review":"The book is readable but by the end I was wishing I hadn't wasted the time spent reading it. The author creates a character in Russell Bryant who is a sportswriter who doesn't really seem to like his job or sports in general. He's not a likeable character to begin with and the choices he makes throughout the story make him even less so. But at least he's realistic. The character of Casey Fox is a complete fairy tale. A rookie catcher who is inexplicably the greatest ballplayer of his generation even though he quit little league and didn't play baseball again until college. So he leads the Red Sox as they chase down the Yankees in the pennant race - despite several of his outlandish and childish stunts.The ending is utterly ridiculous and made me want to give up on reading altogether."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Career Minor Leaguer?","review":"Being partial to the Red Sox, and catchers, I thought this might be the one. The book has a promising start as Casey Fox and his Boswell Russ first cross paths at a college baseball game, and it continues to fulfill the potential for quite some time but ultimately sputters out, like a minor leaguer who gets hung up at the AA level. There is much to like, including the exploration of the Red Sox conundrum and the state of the Game, but it unfortunately veers into the pedantic. Two of the main characters are drawn well enough to hold the reader's interest, but the female lead is flat, a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"American Past Time?","review":"This book does a great job of demonstrating both the love and loathing we all share concerning the national past time of baseball. As professional sports have become big business and ball players have lost sight of the need to be characters of integrity, we, the fans, are left with questions about why this system has become what it is. I thoroughly enjoyed the questions and answers that Mr. Tooke offers through this great book. I hope everyone enjoys it as much as I have."},{"rating":"2","title":"beats competitions!","review":"Compared to Motorolla and Cobra brands before purchasing the Panasonic model.

If you don't need any fancy features, and just need a decent walkie talkie, this is it. The signal is clear and the unit is small. It fits nicely in your hands, and the buttons are ergonomically placed. Each unit requires 3 AAA batteries. I think most people who buy walkie talkies use them as a simple and cheap way to keep in touch with others within a close range. I think the KXTR320F FRS does the job well.

Also the LCD display wasn't looking all that good.I/we did nothing to them, ie-drop them or anything. I hope that it was just that one bad radio & the other one is okay.

With this mash, the library of lesbian cinema gets another addition to the bulging shelf of plots about unfaithful, betraying women -- a theme that seems to have become almost mandatory for the genre. And in what guide to creating low-budget lesbian theme films is the chapter that suggests it's a good idea to also add a soundtrack of embarrasingly second-rate songs? The whole production feels as if it was slapped together from disjointed takes and in some scenes Veronica Mittenzwei looks tired and aged. Kate Clinton's brief appearance isn't simply wasted, it's also monotonous. Sit through this if you must (at the least you'll learn what not to do if you should feel an urge to make your own video quickie)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst film I've ever seen","review":"Not quite sure why I watched this all the way through - really wish I hadn't.

Just my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartbreakingly funny and reassuring for us \\"normal\\" folks","review":"Heartbreaking yet funny, Hecht's collection of related stories delineates the travails of everyday living when one is a photographer of unwanted and unimagined series, a vegetarian, a committed environmentalist--with an aggressively normal husband. Moving in her rarefied world between East Hampton and Nantucket, with occasional terrified forays into the wilds of Manhattan to see her \\"world famous reproductive specialist,\\" she captures and makes even more ridiculous than one could have imagined our unspoken anxieties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not humorous--just annoying","review":"I must have read a totally different book from the NY Book Review reviewer because I would never use the word \\"hilarious\\" to describe this book.

I'm highbrow, I mean, I can endure all kinds of dull things if there's lurking merit, but I couldn't endure this. The characters are flat. The narrator is about as likeable as that of _American Psycho_. It's Cheever without the wit. Old-school New Yorker types leading New Yorker lives. I couldn't stand listening to this woman if she was sitting next to me in a restaurant or coffee shop and for the same reason I don't want to read a book from her point of view: She has nothing to say. So, zero points for content, maybe half a point for eloquence. The back page, rather than profile the author, describes the font in which the book is printed, and if it was worth my time I'd explore the ways in which that's appropriate for this abysmal, cheerfully decadent story collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"One-trick-pony fiction with a truly annoying protagonist","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the NY Times review and regretted it. The perspective and appeal of these stories are very narrow. I found myself bored with the privileged, neurotic protagonist and her comments on the inconveniences of modern life for the upper classes. A search for organic coffee in the Hamptons does not great fiction make. This territory has been covered by other New York writers and entertainers (notably Jerry Seinfeld) in a much more imaginative and entertaining fashion. Laugh out loud funny? It's not. The quality of the writing is unexceptional and does not redeem the one-trick-pony story line"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't stop laughing","review":"This book was so amazingly funny. It was like talking to a friend over lunch. Julie Hecht writes like no one else I have ever read. This book flows and all of the stories are somehow connected. Maybe they connect by being human.

Themes of appearance vs. reality and distinctions between the real and the artifical present our own world--the routine world of drugstores, David Letterman, and what we decide to eat each day--in a unique way. \\"Do the Windows Open\\" eleganatly elevates the mundane activities that typically occur outside the action of plot driven works of fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A superbly refreshing novel.","review":"Ms. Hecht's wit is truly unsurpassed. Her look at life is not only refreshing, but insightful as well. The narrator frequently expresses thoughts that we've all had but would never admit to. Her treatment of even the most mundane aspects of life is often hilarious, a prime illustration being when she hears the neighbor's boys arguing and hears one child refer to the other a certain offensive curse; she feels offended not because one child cursed the other, but because he used a verb incorrectly as a noun! In an era where we all appear to be taking our lives a bit too seriously, this novel provides a welcomed respite. Anyone who has ever lived in Manhattan should be able to truly appreciate this work. It won't 'probe your soul' but it will make you smile."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Books Ever","review":"I read a lot of books and this is really one of the worst I have ever read.

She is tactful, alienated, melancholy and hilarious, without ever indulging the confessional; that is, the tour we take is in her world, not merely in her mind. She is a guide through the insanity of the mundane, sure of her mark and always fresh.

For example, in the Chinese section, ther first word is \\"juji\\" (to gather), the second one is \\"ju-zhi-xianwei\\" (polyester), and the third one is \\"tui\\" (leg). I don't see any logic in this sequencing, linguistically or realistically. There is no instructions explaining this works. So, there is no way for me to use this dictionary.

Sadly, instead of giving us the theory, the evidence and the implications in a coherent flow, the book is staggers from one topic to another, oftentimes leaving you to wonder what any paragraph has to do with the one before it or, for that matter, the subject of the book. These many discontinuites make this a difficult read. In addition, the authors use many terms which the lay reader may not know, and which do not appear in their limited glossary. In the first ten pages of the book I ran across polyploid, archaebacterium, eubactierium, and karyotic fissioning (which the authors promise to explain in chapter 12!). The diagrams are also disappointing, including one which gives a color code for a black and white diagram."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant and Unconvincing","review":"I'm usually pretty forgiving when it comes to evolutionary ideas but I simply found this book unpleasant and unconvincing. The authors derided many scientists who don't seem to agree with them. That's pretty arrogant since the idea of evolutionary symbiosis seems overstated and many related arguments weak. For example, the authors assert that many terms such as \\"group selection\\" are pseudoscientific. That's code for \\"I don't agree with it\\" which only means the authors don't really understand it. Another sentence, for example, refers to a \\"student-infested house\\". Why pounce on students? Do the authors think that's cute or funny? To assert their own ideas, they also denigrate Darwin and present him as some muddy thinker. Oh please! Even though Acquiring Genomes has a 150 year head-start on Darwin's Origin of the Species, the latter is still a much more convincing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"They almost had me fooled ...","review":"I was almost ready to seriously consider Margulis' and Sagan's revolutionary theory until I read Sagan's update, in which he writes \\"Because chromosome arrangements differ slightly in closely related mammal species (e.g., dogs and wolves) that no longer breed with each other ...\\"Everybody knows that wolves and domestic dogs CAN breed. You can buy wolf/dog hybrids from breeders such as http://www.dogpage.us/wolfdogs.htm.If one of the authors is this removed from common sense, I wonder about the rest of the theory.

Both the artist and the book collector should treasure this volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big Impact","review":"This is my first read by this author. I found it to be engaging from the start. She writes with much insight and when I finished I felt I too had an understanding of a family who struggles with infertility and complicated choices involving family drama. The dynamics described in deciding how choices are made and the humanity of our mistakes and struggles with past lives coming to live in the present with us create an impact that makes us run or stay put. This one had a good lesson written with compassion and love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking......","review":"Good quick read.

I realized that during the depression was a really hard time for people, one book is enough for the topic of the depression. I believe if I had to get some sleep then I would just read this book. The one great thing aboout this book is that it showed human kindness to others no matter what their profession is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannery Row","review":"My opinion of the book is that is was too long and extremely too boring. It kept going to different subjects it made no sense at all. But there were some good parts in the book, like how everyone wanted to do something go for Doc. Mack and the boys were respected by everyone in Cannery Row they were like the town bums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannary [row] ( Cannary row)","review":"Cannery row wasn't in my words the most exciting book I have ever read(throwing slabs of meat against a wall would of been more amusing), but it wasn't the worst book I have ever been forced to absorb(The giver). If you're an adventure seeking reader(like me)this book is probally not for you....especialy if you're forced to read it for english class! Perhaps if the writter had worded the book a little differently it would of been better...*stops and thinks*(possibly...not...)*sweet drop*. Now that I'm done slammin on the book I might as well not scare you off to bad(you poor souls who have to suffer as I have)! There is one interesting part in the book, its the part where Mack and da boys get drunk and trash Doc's place! thats all I'm telling you! Your gonna have to tape your eyelids open and read it yourself!!!*laughs maliciously*"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice descriptions of Montery Bay area and little else.","review":"Nice descriptions of the Monterey Bay area where the book takes place and very realistic characters is about all you'll get from this work of Steinbeck's. What's missing is a story. The main focus is on the efforts of some bums to do something nice for Doc, a kind but lonely marine biologist who was apparently based on Steinbeck himself, but the book meanders from that plot line through stories about a Chinese grocery man, a quasi-French painter, a slightly bats housewife, a madam and her suicidal pimp, among many others. The only thing they really have in common is where they take place. They are all largely boring. And then in the end, you do indeed wonder what the point was. THIS is a classic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like this book","review":"I had to read this book for school, and it was no fun. amspacherb@pgcs.com, I actually didn't laugh hysterically at the beer milkshake--I thought it was stupid.

No plot, no main characters...the only good part was the poem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book review of cannery row","review":"Personaly,I did not like the book cannery row.The book was not action packed enugh for me.The carectors were very boring and didnt have much meaning to their lives.The book also jumped arond a lot and i didnt like that because it took my consentration off the main plot of the story and i got lost and it was very confusing for me.I though the auther needed to use a wider rang of vocabulary in the story as well.I would not recamend this book to many people, it is nonsenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little story about the town I was born in","review":"This book is a standing testament to a part of California that no longer exists. Steinbeck tells the story of the old residents of Monterey- once a quiet cannery town and now like any other little city in CA- overrun by tourists, crass comercialism, and land developers. \\" Cannery Row\\"is about the kind of people that used to inhabitat Monterey- honest, good-hearted, simple folks. The Row is now gone but survives in this classic tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book That Creates A World","review":"\\"Cannery Row\\" is an unusual book in that it has almost no plot, which would seem essential to a short novel. However, rather than focusing on constantly moving forward in time, Steinbeck uses the novel to explore his setting in three dimensions and in all senses. The interchapters, which at first are rather bewildering and seem basically irrelevant, are entertaining and serve to enlighten the reader as to what is going on outside of the adventures of Mack and his boys, a few of the many inhabitants of Cannery Row. \\"Cannery Row\\" is highly underrepresented and undervalued in the world of literary criticism. It's a very rich and rewarding book in all its layers."},{"rating":"2","title":"a tidal pool of humanity","review":"At times hilarious, at others poignant, this is a snapshot of life in early 20th century Monterey. The language is poetic and metaphoric. The plot, which is mostly Mack's attempts to give Doc a party, is broken occasionally by short \\"interludes\\", little paintings of other characters that may or may not be seen again. Like a tidal pool after the tide is out, this book is teeming with all sorts of life. A great introduction to Steinbeck, if you need encouragement to read his longer works."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Stienback is back and better than ever!","review":"I feel that if you want to read a good and interesting book than you should read Cannery Row.

I can't wait to read his newest book out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck at his best","review":"If I had to pick only one Steinbeck book out of all of them, this would be the one. It's full of humor and drama. You'll love reading about Mack and the boys, along with doc and all the people in the bear Flag. You'll put the book down after reading it and fell like you just spent an hour or two in Cannery Row."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic!","review":"Steinbeck\`s literary ability blows my mind! Characters, scenes, and vignettes are rendered beautifully. This book is another of Mr. Steinbeck\`s gifts to humanity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must-Read\\"","review":"While there isn't much in the way of a \\"plot\\" in this book, I still consider this a must-read. Steinbeck has an uncanny ability to put a sentence together in the most perfect way possible.The \\"story\\" is not a traditional story per-se, but rather, it is the story of the area at the time... a \\"slice of life\\" look at an interesting place at interesting point in time. It's a loosely related collection of short stories. The book accomplishes what it sets out to do, which is to give the reader a sense of the lives of the people who lived in Cannery Row during the Depression.The characters are colorful but still human and as I noted before, the writing is superb."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck does it again.","review":"For those of you who are fans of John Steinbeck's writings, this is another great book. He never ceases to amaze me with his creative writing. His witty intellect is definately shown in this book. He always finds a way to bring you into the lives of his characters, only to then show you the dissapointment of life and human behavoir. I would definately recommend this book to anyone who likes John Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Educated Opinion of Cannery Row","review":"To start off with, I think Cannery Row is a well written book. Even if the chapters bounce back and forth and are slightly askew, Steinbeck's imagery is well written. I enjoyed learning about all the different aspects of Cannery Row. I didn't really enjoy the ending, I thought it should have been more exciting.I had fun reading this book, even if my other classmates were drooling all over the cover. Mr. Steinbeck, you are my hero!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"i have enjoyed this book, my second Steinbeck book that i have read (Of Mice and Men)related to my son's highschool. For some reason i did now read in highschool or college. i am finding Steinbeck to be a good writer. this book is about observations of people in general and especially the bums who Steinbeck feels may have figured out life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"After a visit to Monterey & Cannery Row, I found this novel to be even more relevant than the first time I read it almost 50 years ago.The character development was well done & the fact that many of them were based on real people (if not all) made the novel true to the real life & events on this iconic street during its hayday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect little book","review":"Cannery Row is not Grapes of Wrath, nor is it trying to be. It is simply the most endearing 100 pages I have ever read. For anyone who enjoys this book and has not read Sweet Thursday, stop what you are doing and pick up where Cannery Row left off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cannery Row Review","review":"I think that the book Cannery Row is a decent book. Its not the best book that i have ever read but it is a good one. Cannery Row has a layed back kind of plot and the characters were very suspenseful. everything that happened could be foreshadowed. Doc was my favorite character. I liked him best because he was very layed back and was nice to everyone. He was always there when you needed a hand. I like how Steinbeck made the character Mack. Mack isnts the smartest guy butI believe that his morals were right. I like how Mack and the boys live life day by day and just try to have fun and not worry about anything. I think that this was an all around good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Steinbeck could capture the true American bumb.","review":"I have read this book seven times and always find something new that I missed the times before. He attacks every aspect of the human character; even himself. He leaves no stone (person) unturned. His development of character is still amazing and unmatched by anyone. It is easy to see that he patterns his characters after people he knew. The comic episodes juxtaposed with the sad lives of people in lives going nowhere is one of the greatest works of art since \\"The Grapes of Wrath.\\" This book is what America is really like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the seventh Steinbeck novel I have read, and also one of the worst (The Short Reign of Pippin the VII is worse). I loved The Red Pony and Of Mice of Men, so I branched out, reading some of his lesser known works. Big Mistake. This novella has no focus, no character you can relate to, no plot to speak of, no definitive climax, and no business being read. I daydreamed through most of it.The reason I don't give it one star is because Steinbeck, like in most of his novels, provided a great description of post-war Cannery Row, and did a decent job of presenting violence on the periphery (kind of like the news today). We see glimpses of violence but we, nor the characters are ever directly affected. Furthermore, the novel's ending is decent, comparing Doc's lonely isolation to that of a gopher being attacked while trying to seek out a mate. Unfortunately, most things leading up until the ending is uneventful, constantly interrupted by dead-end subplots, and lacking in intrigue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A row of cans","review":"Cannery Row is an okay book. I think Steinbeck threw in some unwanted and confusing chapters. If those chapters had more substance to the plot then it would be better. Out of the books I have read in school this is one of my least favorite, but not as least as the Great Gatsby. But in the book I did like the characters Mack and the boys, I liked how they were had no cares. Doc was also another likeable character. Because he was nice and like to try new things. Plus he was forgiving but sometimes to forgiving which I think is a big weakness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannery Row review","review":"This book was ok. One reason i didn't like it all that much really had nothing to do with the book itself, it is because any book in school i read i don't like it. So i guess that is not a really good reson for not liking the book. I'm not to sure that i liked Steinbecks way of writing. He would have odd chapters in there that didn't go with the story line. It threw me off. Then again some of those chapters were were kinda cool.If you are tired of reading the odinary kinda book and are looking for a change i say read Cannery Row. I myself woould not recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Steinbeck spends far too much time describing the setting instead of a plot. I kept waiting and waiting for ANYTHING to happen and nothing did. Although interesting in the first two chapters, you quickly get sick of the disjointed \\"plot\\". A vivid setting does not make up for the absence of a story."},{"rating":"2","title":"a wonderful delightful book","review":"I read this book shortly after visiting cannery row for a school feild trip. It was a wonderful book, and it was very immaginative. I read this book every once and a while, and I get something new out of it every time. When I read about Lee Chongs grocery store, I get a picture of it in my mind. This was a wonderfull book, in fact it is my favorite. I would reccommend it to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and toching book.","review":"This book is a wonderful book. It shows a society that we would not look at and Steinbeck puts such a nice story behind his description. A rare litterary treasure"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes we Cannery","review":"Man I love Steinbeck, love him!This book was not a disappointment. It wasn't as much of a novel as a group of short stories with a thin novel thread running through it. It's like the Canterbury Tales on steroids.The characters are all so interesting, almost each one has a chapter or two devoted to them. You could probably read the stories in any order, they're arranged chronologically but you could probably put them in a deck and shuffle them and come out with something unique and powerful.This book is written about the period right after the depression but right before WWII, this time period was still considered to be in the depression but the economy was past the low point. Things weren't as bad as they were but they certainly hadn't picked up.So I say yes yes yes read this book. it's a rewarding experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written novel","review":"I just finished Cannery Row and I loved it. I didn't care that the book didn't seemingly have a \\"plot\\". The characters were so realistic and such good people that I immediately fell in love with them. By the end of the book, I thought of each character as some sort of saint rather than the bum or hooker that they \\"really\\" were. Steinbeck gives the reader an intimate view into this community that he knows so well. I thought of Cannery Row as a sort of paradise where the ideals that are truly important prevail. Even besides all this, I thought that the writing was just so eloquent. I enjoyed reading about these characters that would be overlooked in real life because of the way that they live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck at his best","review":"Cannery Row is one of the most amazing literary achievements of all time. Steinbeck's words paint such a vivid picture of the people and places surrounding a vacant lot in Monterey that you will almost smell the fish rotting on the beach and hear the music coming from the lobby of the Bear Flag Hotel. The people of Cannery Row don't do much all day, and they never really achieve anything, but Steinbeck portrays them so magically that by the end of the story they have become archetypal heroes of greatness, honor, and beauty. This is the book that convinced me that I had to read everything ever written by John Steinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Steinbeck","review":"Having read many of Steinbeck's novels, I went into this one knowing what to expect, and I was not disappointed. In some ways this book reminded me very much of Tortilla Flats, in that it's largely about poor people who make the best out of their situations. In other ways it reminded me of The Grapes of Wrath, in that there was a lot of thinly-veiled social criticism, but the socialism themes weren't overwhelming. The one thing I found to stand out more in this novel over the other two was the fact that Steinbeck's humor really had a chance to come out in this one. His humor reminds me of, perhaps, the sort of humor one might expect from a grandfather. The book really focuses in on simple living, and the ability to find contentment without wealth. I would reccommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"Took me a while to get the significance (and magnificence) of this book. I usually read history/action books, so I initially found this a little slow. That is, until I realized the depth and complexity of the characters. The characters are the \\"action\\" of this story. Beautifully written...one feels the scenes are in three dimensional high definition. So glad I read it and looking forward to my next Steinbeck book. Strongly recommend this well deserved classic. Have vacationed in Monterey a few times...it will be even more special next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not His Best","review":"I did not enjoy this one as much as I did main of his other books. I guess I did not think it grabbed me at the start like many of his works. You get the always great character work of Steinbeck and the description of the town is wonderful. You can do a lot worse then this book, but it was not his best."},{"rating":"1","title":"LACKING","review":"BEEN THERE AND THE BOOK WAS SOMEWHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT.

MAYBE SOMEONE ELSE WILL WRITE A BETTER BOOK ABOUT THE PLACE."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband's favorite book.","review":"I enjoyed Cannery Row, but my husband loved it. He rarely reads fiction, but now reads everything Steinbeck that he can find. The characters in this novel are wonderfully bright and colorful, and wonderfully they have a happy ending and live again in Steinbeck's sequal Sweet Thursday. A great book to change the mind of someone who thinks they don't like literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Read","review":"Probably the easiest read of all John Steinbeck's books. I knocked this one out in one day after fighting my way through The Grapes of Wrath in my last read. I'm working my way through the author's California books and I'm about to start East of Eden. Only one more California book after that - Sweet Thursday. Cannery Row is so easy to follow, especially if you have seen the Nick Nolte movie which is a combination of Cannery Row and Sweet Thursday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Cannery Row is about a very strange community.

Too Bad. That's not the point of good literature. Plot is for critics and scholars. Steinbeck is for every man. Steinbeck is for regular readers like you and me. Cannery Row is a peek in the lives of a few people--people we'd never have had an opportunity to meet without the observing and reporting skills of John Steinbeck. Enjoy the book for what it's worth. . .and if you are a person whose interest can't be sustained without a plot, maybe you should go and read some of the hack writers that are flooding the markets today. You'll surely find the same tired plots used over and over again there. If you want a whodunnit, go read mysteries and suspenses and leave Steinbeck to those who don't need someone shaking a baby rattle in their face to be entertained. Thank You. And good night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light and airy, like this review","review":"Reading Cannery Row is a bit like eating cotton candy -- it's enjoyable, but it's a little too sweet and not very filling, and when you finish it you realize that there was a little more air inside than it looked like at first.The characters in Cannery Row are likable and, for the most part, believable, and some of the scenes are unforgettable. As I was reading, I did occasionally ask myself, \\"Okay, so where's he going with this story?\\" The answer, of course, is nowhere really, but the book is short enough and pleasant enough that it doesn't really matter.Of Mice and Men was for me a more meaningful and memorable book. While it extols some of the same values as Cannery Row -- friendship, trust, camaraderie -- it does so in a less simpleminded fashion, and its tragic ending makes it ultimately more poignant. When I finished Of Mice and Men, I said, \\"Wow!\\" When I finished Cannery Row, I said, \\"That's nice.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Reveals characters' psychology in a paragraph or less...","review":"This book is only around 120 pages but in what would constitute the first act of most novels, Steinbeck fleshes out a wide array of characters with great depth by revealing their psychological innerworkings effectively and efficiently with brief anecdotes. The storytelling is so economical that the layout is almost like a kids' book...but there is an adult depth to everything that makes this a high-value, high-impact 120 pages.In terms of the grand scale, the stakes here aren't terribly high if you look at them with pure objectivity, but the daily life and mindset of the characters is so finely revealed that even the small events that transpire in these pages feel like they carry great weight because you are invested so heavily in the ordinary details of the lives of these ordinary people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Virile fusions","review":"Before Hollywood and Tin Pan Alley songwriters picked up on Cuban and Puerto Rican styles in the pursuit of disposable novelty hits, these styles were being honestly fused with the emerging modern jazz of bebop and cool. Of course, this took place in New York City, as Machito and other emigres were welcomed by Dizzy Gillespie and Charlie Parker, and by dancers who no doubt wanted something hotter than intellectual bebop. The result is in these raw recordings, which are compositionally astute, blending Ellingtonian orchestrations with bop heads and the clave, while retaining and even magnifying the rhythmic intensity. Such a virile fusion of Latin and New York styles would not be heard again until the Nu Yorican movement of the 1970s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality!","review":"Though the musica has mucho potencial'...la qualita de recording es terrible'!

Today's rap and hop-hop stars draped in gold, driving flashy cars and using women like personal adornments owe an endless debt to the old blues men drifting around the country with their harmonicas and guitars, or playing the Apollo, even Vegas, but denied the right to stay in hotels.

You can really tell that the authors totally understand (and love) this unique niche market of toy collecting, as they delve into the very minutia of what makes this hobby so much fun, and make it entertaining reading to boot!.I highly recommend this book to anyone who ever purchased a kid meal for themselves, or a youngster.

Beginning last year as I started college, and continuing this year as well, that book has been The Seville Communion. This story is enjoyable enough being read superficially, as a mystery novel. However, the struggles of the characters, particularly Father Quart and Macarena, are what bring me back to the book again and again. For anyone who has felt that they are \\"bailing water out of the Lord's boat,\\" completed acts of \\"faith\\" out of pride, and has recognized that they are indeed part of a dying world, this book is for you. We are not alone....and some of Don Priamo Ferro's solace goes out to us as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Graceful story about a strong priest, small plot holes.","review":"The writing, even in translation is graceful. The central character is a priest, a strong \\"good soldier\\" who serves the Vatican as a combination hatchet man/private detective. The mystery is initially intriguing -- who is sending the Pope e-mails that are mysterious and of deadly import?This is an enjoyable book to read... but the central character, the priest, is so strongly written that when he falls for the woman, and fails in his mission, this is mildly unbelievable. His crisis of faith and strength is a bit too precipitous. And the solution to the mystery is not adequately foreshadowed, which makes a decent solution appear arbitrary. But this is in general a very good read by an author who is erudite, writes well, and captures some of the enchantment of Seville. Makes me want to order tapas and watch the slow Guadalquivir!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A diverting read","review":"This is the first of Perez-Reverte's novels that I have read. I found his descriptions of Seville interesting and the plot was engaging. I was a bit put off by the fact that all of his priests, monsignors, bishops, etc., (even the \\"good guys\\")readily admitted an utter lack of faith in the Church they purported to represent; but I still found the book well worth reading. Having seen from some of the other reader-reviews that this is considered by some to be Perez-Reverte's weakest book, I look forward to reading the others."},{"rating":"1","title":"A o.k read but not a suspense or mystery","review":"I read this with great anticipation and was let down.

In fact you begin to forget the mystery."},{"rating":"2","title":"Location, Location, Location!","review":"Location, Location, Location! Seville is so critical to this storyline that it takes on the status of a character itself. Senor Perez-Reverte crafts some great characters. He draws them out through their histories, their physical descriptions, and finally, their activities here. The good guys and the bad are all masterfully, albeit slowly, drawn. Their actions are completely consistent with their personalities, but in an unpredictable way. So, as their stories unfold, layer after layer, the novel grips you and does not let you go until the author ties up the last detail in the very last sentence (No Peeking!) This story has it all; Vatican spies, Spanish lovers, parish priests, thieving bankers, and a group of street villains Charles Dickens would be proud to claim. This novel is a great read. Per favor, Senor Perez-Reverte, a Sequel?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done -- Wish He'd Write Another","review":"This novel is more enjoyable than the Flanders Panel, but still not up to the level of the Fencing Master or his recent series, the Captain Alatriste books.

There are a few sections of the book that need some more editing to make them a bit more crisp, but I cannot tell if that is due to the translation or is in the original. The only real disappointment came when I finished the book: I wish there was a follow-up.J. Avellanet, Co-Founder of Cerulean Associates LLC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Charm but radically impausible","review":"Perez-Reverte clearly loves Seville, and I now want to visit it. The characters I would most like to meet from the novel are the \\"Three Stooges\\" villains. The major protagonists less so, though it would be interesting to see Macarena remove her cigarette lighter from her bra strap (something the author brings up over and over). At some points plausibility plunges out of sight but then an episode of humor (particularly some muddled literary allusions by one of the villains) redeems things. Speeches by high clerics in the Vatican are wooden and unconvincing."},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche ridden, weak characters, simple plot, awful!","review":"I was looking forward to an intelligently written novel What a disappointment this book was. I couldn't believe that anyone enjoyed this weakly written novel. It reqired no thought and in fact I was annoyed by all the cliches. The first rule of writting was ignored by this author.I can't finish his book because I am bored by his poor writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lack of communion","review":"Having read and tremendously enjoyed both The Club Dumas and The Flanders Panel by Reverte, I looked forward to another labrythine and intellectual tale. I was highly disappointed. The plot, or lack of one, is bad enough. Then, I could not decide if Reverte wanted to present a philosophical treatise or a mildly comic novel (clearly, he missed both points, if he was even aiming at them!). I will now approach his books with far more caution than I would have previously. If you enjoyed the two I mentioned above, save your time and money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Plot is Wafer-Thin","review":"it is perhaps appropriate that the bulk of this novel takes place in a musty old Spanish church in the act of being restored, as the writing a plotting here are as musty as the material. It pains me to say this, as I loved Perez-Reverte's \\"Flander's Panel\\" and \\"The Club Dumas\\". But what those two books carried in flair and style, this one replaces with dull characters and a plodding pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This book was highly recommended to me but turned out to be a major disappointment. The characters were one dimensional, the mystery was less than compelling and the writing was sub-par. The author kept interrupting the flow of the mystery with these supposedly humorous scenes with some bumbling co-consipirators. It wasn't funny, it wasn't mysterious, it was just bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perez-Reverte presents an angst-ridden cast of characters","review":"The engaging plot mechanism of 'The Seville Communion' is only its prima facie appeal. The real fascination for me was that the principal characters each in a distinctive way live the anxiety of post-modernity in its inherent absurdity as well as its incompatibility with the spontaneous and perennial orientation of man towards meaning. To make the same point another way, the characters each live in two worlds and two ways, mutually incompatible: the traditional and the post-Kantian. This profound unease has evoked a different response from each person, leaves none of them happy, and allows the author to figure forth the philosophical roots of the contemporary life of man in himself and in society. I found this book to be a highly provocative reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The mystery is secondary","review":"Ostensibly, this is the story of a hacker breaking into the Vatican computer system and appealing to the Pope to save a small, neighbourhood church in Seville from being shut down. Father Lorenzo Quart is sent by the Vatican to Seville to uncover just who this hacker, who goes by the code name Vespers, really is.But really, the mystery is incidental. For me, the book's raison d'etre wasn't really to discover who Vespers was, but to present the reader with vividly drawn characters and situations. The scenes that portrayed the slowly unfolding relationship between Quart and Maccarena, or the funny-sad trio of would-be criminals, or Don Priamo, the aged priest who would sacrifice all for his simple faith were what kept me reading.I will definitely read more by Perez-Reverte."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Seville Communion","review":"Reverte is someone I always enjoy--The Seville Communion was no exception.

Club Dumas was somewhat interesting, so I picked this up. In Seville Communion, the writing is lame and incredibly flawed, there's little feel for Seville (except that it smells like oranges, ok, I get it already), the characters are cardboard, and the plot is thin and obvious, except when it gets to the end, where it's just ridiculous. A total waste of time. This is the sort of thing Dean Koontz would've tossed off 20 years ago. I guess I was expecting more from a Spanish writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whodunit? - Who Cares?","review":"Nothing irks the mystery reader more than noodling through a somewhat logically-derived story, only to be served a ridiculous ending like that offered by Reverte in The Seville Communion. Frankly (and I'm about to give the mystery away here, so be warned), the ending - the whodunit - made more sense before the last page, which served only to insult the reader. Yes, I know, the priest was playing the martyr. The point is, Vespers made more sense as Methusela than the young nun. I can't possibly be the only one who thinks this, am I? I concur heartily with other reviewers who found the writing tediuous, the characters linear and wholly noncompelling, and the plot/story absurd. In addition, I found Methusela to be a half-baked version of Walker Percy's Father Smith, though Reverte's Smith wasn't nearly as compelling or intelligent as Percy's. In my estimation, Reverte has yet to write anything quite worth investing time or money into reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can only hope this book was better in the original Spanish","review":"I must have missed something that others got from this book. I found this book BORING! The characters, especially the comic relief trio, were incredibly inane. It was obvious who was the killer and the hacker about 25 pages into the book. I am sorry that I wasted electricity powering a light to read this book by. Upon finishing this book I quite cheerfully hurled it into the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the beef?","review":"This is quite an enjoyable book, but it never gets into top gear. The pages turn over quite quickly, but neither the plot nor the characters are convincing or particularly interesting. There are too many characters and most of these are rendered purely for comic effect. The shabby villains are very reminiscent of the losers who perform similar functions in Graham Greene's early thrillers. They may work as amusing caricatures and one might argue that the book's collection of failed flamenco singers and useless ex-bullfighters is ironic - a mockery of other countries perceptions of Spain, but the book needs more than irony, jokes, lustful priests and glamorous aristocrats. Neither the Vatican nor the computer angles are rendered with much conviction and there are many long passages that add nothing to the slim plot or our understanding of the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Baked at Best","review":"While I am a BIG fan of Perez-Reverte's work, The Seville Communion was a big let down. I have come to expect more from this literary master.I found the plot and the characters stilted and i could not even finish it. The plot could not hold my attention and I found myself more intruiged with doing the laundry than finding out who dunnit.I hope that Perez-Reverte's next book picks up the pace and is more akin to his first two books.

The 60s/70s/80s were full of sci-fi dystopian worlds for kids and adults alike: Philip K. Dick, Madeleine L'Engle, the creepily familiar-yet-alien magical realist school in The War Between the Pitiful Teachers and the Splendid Kids. But Bonham drew the future in this book with such specificity that it now seems entirely plausible: world food shortages; an America where real food is only for the ultra-elite, and everybody else has to subsist on processed by-products; a few food guerrillas grow corn and tomatoes in their basements, with fluorescent gro-lites, like marijuana. Sound familiar? Decades later, Bonham's disturbing vision of real food as a forbidden luxury seems eerily prescient."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd buy again","review":"I searched long and hard for a Stereo Bluetooth headset based on Bluetooth 2.0 for a decent price.

The mic works well, even though there's no boom visible.Most stereo headsets are expensive, and/or based on the BT 1.1 or 1.2 std., which is must less reliable and poorer quality. I believe GE just slaps there name on this, but like most of the GE products (except for the wireless phones), it appears to be good quality.The only problem I've had is that most of the time it will no connect to my phone automatically, but this can just as easily be an issue with my Nokia cell.

From reading the reviews it seems that the controller freezes and the only way to get it working again is to open it up, unsolder the wire from the battery, wait and then reattach it. You will be doing this daily. Otherwise you can wait till the battery runs down which can take weeks being that the only power being drawn is a tiny LED.

She is portrayed in the opening scenes of the movie, \\"The Last Emporer\\" as the somewhat sinister and ancient woman talking with the young 4-year-old Pu Yi.Sterling Seagrave endeavors in his 1992 book called \\"Dragon Lady\\" to dispell the myths that have grown up around the life Tzu Hsi. Futhermore, he reveals that the myths had their start with rumormongering on the part of British and European journalists interested in advancing the interests of Britain in China at the expense of the independent Chinese government, nominally headed by a woman, at the time of the Boxer Rebellion."},{"rating":"2","title":"More a history book than a biography","review":"People expecting to find a straightforward biography will be surprised by the lack of solid material on the Empress Dowager. Instead 'Dragon Lady' is a detailed history book containing important events in China that led to the fall of the Manchu empire. The huge cast of characters described by Seagrave can be daunting at times but with a little effort, it is a rewarding read and gives a vivid picture of life in 19th century China for both the Chinese and the foreigners living there at the time.Seagrave makes a good effort at uncovering the motivations behind the Manchu government and the Western powers, and the truth is unsettling to say the least.

Seagrave's thesis that the 'evil legend' of Tz'u-hsi was invented by Bland and Backhouse is false: apart from the material based on the Ching-shan diary, virtually everything in 'China under the Empress Dowager' is based on authentic Chinese sources. Seagrave creates an imaginary political scenario of a court dominated by a fictitious 'Ironhat' clique. Virtually every page in this book contains some sort of error, distortion, sweeping judgement based on minimal evidence, fabrication or even an ocasional barefaced lie. If you want a true picture of the late Ch'ing, read Marina Warner's biography of Tz'u-hsi.

(and humans?) hearts were prematurely stopped. This book was about a Mayan boy named Balam. Balam was fourteen years old in the middle of a draught in the year 1200 or so, and the whole novel is about his village trying to please the gods so they would send rain. There is a lot of bloodletting and fear of forest spirits who will try to capture you and haul you off to eat you. In the end Balam?s wife to be gets snitched away by people from another village and in an attempt to exact revenge Balam kills a jaguar, which makes him superior to everyone else, so his village sacrifices him.

When he has to be sacrificed it abruptly ends the whole story. It made me sad even if it was just a book.If Talbert agreed to change the ending a little bit, but wanted to keep the main idea of Balam getting sacrificed, I have some advice for him.

Had to send it back. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Missouri Breaks - a little strange","review":"This is a strange western - Brando and Nicholson in a western that is a little hard to believe but very interesting. Beautiful setting in northern Montana (the Breaks) but Brando plays one of the strangest roles you might ever see - unless you watch Apocalypse Now in which he plays an equally strange role. This is not a common movie but to have both actors in the same movie is simply rare. The title has some objectionable content due to the treatment of the horses in the filming of the movie - not that one can tell watching the movie but animal rights activists have it one their list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of an the era","review":"Cannot beat this little known weatern with Brando and Jack. What a lost treasure! Some truely great lines in this one and perfect Brando style. I have no doubt that both of these actors were just playing themselves. 5 Stars for these guys. What a great memory movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best scripted \\"westerns\\" ever","review":"This is one of my all-time favorite westerns. The acting and directing are terrific with an unusually colorful, eloquent script. It's just off-beat enough to make you want to watch it again. It's a lttle like \\"Tom Horn\\" (starring Steve McQueen), only more humorous in a dark sort-of-way."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Unique and Classic Western","review":"I am a huge Marlon Brando fan and this is one of my favorites. Although Brando is always interesting to watch, he goes above and beyond the call of duty in this film. Jack Nicholson is also superb, as always, and the other actors are great as well. A very entertaining film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Western","review":"\\"Underrated\\" is the theme of most of the reviews and boy is it ever. Nicholson is great, Brando is interesting and peculiar, and Stanton, Quaid and the rest are perfect. Not sure why I never see this on anyone's list of favorite Westerns. Interesting characters, good actors, clever plot, and a nice scenic setting for a western.The cinematography was very well done. It takes you closer to the action somehow.This movie gets inside of you a little more than most and I don't exactly know how it did it. Nicholson plays a great cowboy and it's a shame he didn't make more westerns. The movie drags just a bit at times, but this is easily overcome by the steady developments throughout the movie.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for those who like a good western."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original, and Fun","review":"This movie was panned--unfairly, I think--when it came out. It is odd, and treats violence and killing with an almost delicious whimsy that certainly won't be to everyone's taste, but this is not without purpose. Tom McGuane's script crackles with wit and originality throughout. Tbhe bizarre humor in this movie is a lower octave of the madness you find in his fiction.Marlon Brando is his typical mannered self; Nicholson gives restrained performance.The movie is well-plotted, and well-paced, with sound, interesting character development. Definitely worth a look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great scenery.","review":"Well, there really were livestock thieves back then, and they really were hanged or shot for their trouble. They really did consider rustling to be a viable career choice.I thought the mood of the enterprise that Nicholson's character and friends carried on was about right. Brando seemed to overdo it, but \\"regulators\\" or hired guns weren't exactly the junior exec type either.This is not a western or cowboy movie that small kids should watch. There are hangings and public displays of corpses in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"European DVD's","review":"The movie is a good one and the product was clean and on time------------------- Only ------------- movies from Europe will not work on American Equipment.

Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Sometimes life is twisted. Once in a while a movie is not made, it just evolves. Relax and enjoy the ride, peckish purists. The scene where Marlon ices his aching tooth with casket ice is hysterical - that alone keeps me watching it time and again. The director did his job when he allowed the cast to do theirs in such intuitive ways. The Missouri Breaks rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Street car named desire","review":"thank you.

I purchased this for an audition of \\"Streetcar\\" and fell in love again with the characters and story line. Doesn't hurt that a young, shirtless Marlon Brando was on the cover to reference back to throughout the play."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Drama Classic","review":"Definitely one of the most important plays of our time. It is a hurricane of sex, deception, destruction, beer, violence, loss, heat, blood, sweat, and tears. And whoever says that this is boring is missing the point. In the play none of the characters are bad guys, least of all Stanley, or good guys, least of all Blanche. They are all just people trying to survive, and sometimes they don't always follow the rules..."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a ride","review":"Whew! What a ride. What a terrible ride into the lives of three sad, miserable lives. Blanche comes to stay with her sister, Stella, after Blanche's life deteriorates. Stella has married and is expecting a baby, but her life is anything but cozy and warm. Stella's husband, Stanley, beats his wife and drinks heavily. Everything in this story echoes, No Way Out, and You are Doomed to Misery."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick! Sick! Sick!","review":"\\"STELLA!\\" This was probably the most memorable line of this movie which was not, to state it diplomatically, one of Tennessee Williams' best works. Marlon Brando was at his worst in acting, as was the case with Vivian Leigh. The French Quarter of New Orleans never looked worse, and the story-about a school teacher who had an illicit affair with one of her students- was also sick. I saw it once and regretted having done so. For many reasons it's far from being recommendable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Classic!","review":"This is a wonderful novel! It has a little bit of everything in it. It was very enjoyable reading it. Also, it was very entertaining. If you love classic stories, you will LOVE this one. A must read and a must buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Abusive man alert","review":"I'm not generally impressed with plays and movies of this era, as they portray a time when it was considered acceptable for men to treat women as property. Women endured physical as well as emotional and psychological violence, without a inkling that something may be wrong about that. When Blanche encourages Stella to leave Stanley after he hits her after the poker game, I agreed very firmly with her. I was amazed that Stella returns, and that she still stays with him after what he does to Blanche near the end of the play. Blanche is written as flighty and slutty and her final fate is galling because I believe she's the only character in the play with a lick of sense. I found myself reading this quite quickly because I just wanted it over with. The whole thing repulsed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stella!!!","review":"This is a play that has stood the test of time. You cannot take a class about drama without this play being referenced at one time or another. A must have for any personal library. You could read this play 20 times and get something new out of it each time. The symbolism and thought that went into this play is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Appreciation of Blanche DuBois","review":"Upon a recommendation, I read the stage play after watching the movie with Vivian Leigh.Sure, she is neurotic, but she suffered many losses. One loss from which she was unable to recover was the suicide of her young husband. The play specified the reason for his suicide, that could not be revealed in the 1951 movie. To me, it explained her promiscuity, because she needed to be constantly reassured of her attractiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Students opioin","review":"I usually do not like to read plays because I find it much easier to watch the charaters act it out on the screen, so when I read a Streetcar Named Desire for class I was a little skeptical at first, but by the time I finshed it became one of my all time favorite books. Once I started to read this book I could not put it down.......no joke(I finshed it the same night). I recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good outside reading book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An opus of dimensions and immortal peronalities.","review":"William's Streetcar is without question a masterpiece; the tale of the haggard Blanche's futile search for kindness and her destruction at the hands of the barbaric Stanely speaks directly to the mind of any reader. It is a work that brings us to a deeper understanding of ourselves: what we think of Blanche's character, Stanely's nature and Stella's metamorphosis speaks directly to our own character and ideals. William's view that Blanche, for all her errors, retains her dignity and her concept of a \\"lady\\", never deliberately harming a soul, is an important reminder to us all: we are no one's judge. Streetcar is a story of survivors, of dimensions and of immortal personalities. It can be enjoyed on multiple levels, and is to be recommended to any reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good choice","review":"The choice of copies of _The Streetcar Named Desire_(required reading for high school academic Englishthis summer) seemed to narrow down to ones withlurid covers or this plain one. Unfortunately, the textis almost like a typewritten script--small print anda little hard to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"I had to read it twice","review":"Williams describes in the play different characters and the life of those three characters. There is Blanche, a sentimental woman who is afraid of the light and on the other hand there is Stanley, Stella's husband who is a rude man and likes gambling and drinking. Between these two characters is Stella Blanche's younger sister who really loves her husband and who does everything for him and couldn't live without him. I think it's difficult to get these three characters together for a play with a lot of tension as Williams did. When I read the end for the first time I was a bit surprised because it sounded really brutal. But now I have read it again and I think it's the best thing for Blanche to live in this mental hospital because there she can live her own life."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Streetcar going nowhere","review":"Personally I only got this book because I needed it for an assignment. I don't know why teachers can't seem to update their literature cause this book was so boring I couldn't stand reading it. Why can't we read something like Harry Potter? Typically I enjoy reading books but this was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull....Very Dull!","review":"I choose this book because it seemed very interesting, also I had never read a play before. I would NOT recommend this book to anyone. There seems to be no plot and everyone acts encredibly dumb. I have to find three themes to this book and so far NONE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Dramatic Play","review":"I found interesting to see, how the story changed during the play. First I thought the visit of Blanche was just a normal one. But I found out, there is a lot more about it, it has probably been an escape from her old place. But the rumours follow her to New Orleans. More and more the story gets strange and Stanley becomes the person responsible for what happens. This I found well done. The end, when Blanche is taken to the lunatic asylum, fits very well with the rest of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Williams Paints An Accurate Picture of the South","review":"This is a play written by the Southern genius, Tennesee Williams. It is a tradegy about the life of a woman named Blanche, the main character. She has come to live with her sister, Stella, in order escape her past life. In the play Williams shows how women were dependent on men after the Second World War. Women viewed men as money makers and a way to assure their future security. Also the play is quick paced with moving conversations. Also the setting shows how Louisana was a very diverse place filled with many different ethnic groups. With this play, Tennesee shows how southern life was during the 1940's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick purchase","review":"Had to have this book for my daughter for school. Ordered it and received in a couple of days, in time for her to read it and do her report with no problem. Now someone is borrowing it from her as they could not get it where they were looking. THANKS AMAZON for being a life saver AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This play is the ultimate in 20th century drama.","review":"I was reading customer reviews, and all I saw were fed-up teenagers that couldn't stop for two seconds and THINK about what this play represents. It is a masterpiece of social commentary, and it shows a lot about how society can treat those that are different. To me, the play speaks were strongly. Everyone should read S.N.D., for if nothing more it is the most commonly quoted American dramatic work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Master & Commander","review":"This is the first of the Aubrey / Maturin novels and is the fourth time of reading and still the the experience is refreshing. The language and civility of the narrative makes one wonder that western civilization is now on the decline. How much has technology taken away the beautiful interaction between man and nature; when to travel around the world, all it took was wind, water , and the knowledge how to utilize them."},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't matter how often you read it...","review":"...there's still something to discover. For example, on my most recent reading I was especially moved by the scene where Maturin goes to the opera and sees Diana \\"on display\\"; his feelings for her utterly change, and his devastation is so great that he sits in the empty theatre until being told to leave by the janitors.The last time I read the series right through, I was struck by how O'Brian touches on practically every aspect of life. That richness comes into full bloom in Post Captain, which at the moment I am tempted to regard as the best book in the series -- until I reread the next one!I do have to admit, though, that the travelling bear episode is over the top, a rare lapse of good judgment on O'Brian's part."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am an active participant, not a passive observer","review":"Hailed as the nautical literary master of this century by the English press, his books, not least Post Captain, involve the reader in a way seldom done by modern authors. I recently had 4 more books of this series and as fast as I finished one, I started the other...1200 pages in 4 days!!! I have now come to Amazon.com to see if I can get more. Yes - I am addicted. Yes, it is compulsive reading. But then, to be addicted to quality - as these books are - is no shame. Masterfully written by a captain of the English language, especially older english, and conveying a real sense of historical authenticity, they are not simply a good read. They are an inter-active adventure. Superb. Enthralling. Captivating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey / Maturin Series","review":"Post Captain is a great book! Having said that, it is not the best book in the series. These are some of the finest books I have ever read, and I recommend them to any fan of adventure novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Off to sea with Jack Aubrey","review":"Such a trip - When you want to get away from the darn dailys and live a little in your imagination, this is a book to pick up. Besides, the language is charming, as are the characters, and a bit of a challenge. All the words are compatible with nineteenth century English; sailors' language is a new area for expertise; and all the words are precise and in the right places."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent sequel to Master and Commander","review":"I loved this book, although I would have liked a little more action as in the first novel. Iam eager to continue the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Post Captain Disappoints","review":"I am a great fan of the Aubrey-Maturin series, so I am loathe to write anything negative. However, I have struggled to finish \\"Post Captain\\". It is tedious reading, and dull for the most part. The book never really establishes a plot line. It shifts through a listless struggle between Aubrey and Maturin's romantic aspirations, and then back to Jack's dicey struggle with his chain of command. The book confuses and makes painful reading at times. It lacks the sublime feeling I had from reading other volumes in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with O'Brian's \\"Post Captain\\"","review":"I found Patrick O'Brian's \\"Post Captain\\" to be a plodding and literary \\"dense\\" read. I spent more time trying to decipher the archaic prose and search for sailing terminology definitions, then actually reading and enjoying the book. Also much of the \\"action\\" took place on land - another detraction from a high seas naval adventure. Much more readable and enjoyable are C.S. Forester's Horatio Hornblower novels that will transfer the reader to the age of \\"wooden ships and iron men\\" without the ponderous wording or having to master the British Seamanship Rules of Sailing Terminology.Glad I borrowed O'Brian from the local library... and was not out any money! Beat to quarters... but steer clear of this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the rest of the series is better...","review":"I was amazed by Master and Commander and resolved to read the entire series. But then I got to Post Captain, and it was like having a bad dream of an Aubrey-Maturin book. Crossing the whole country on foot disguised as a performing bear? Was I supposed to take this seriously?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Narrator turns O'Brian into a cartoon","review":"Simon Vance's narration would be comical if I hadn't paid real $$ for this. \\"Aubrey\\" sounds like a pre-pubescent male mocking a grown-up, and \\"Maturin\\" sounds like Smithers (The Simpsons). I checked out the tapes from our library with Patrick Tull as the narrator and all the true wit and color appeared. True conversational narration. I normally don't write reviews but I was so disgusted I just had to put this opinion out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Sailor","review":"I will continue to read the series, but I must say it could have been enhanced had there been some glossary of the nautical terms used so profusely. I would have expected nothing less mind you, but unlike having a good dictionary for other words, there were many terms to be found nowhere. It can make for some rugged reading.Still, the book is worth the effort. I am just not sure the full enjoyment is available to those who are not intimately familiar with sailing and with sailing a vessel during the Napoleonic era.And who am I to judge a book? Because I spent money to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good adventure on land and sea","review":"This novel is set roughly in the years 1802-1804, and is a sequel to \\"Master and Commander.\\" With most of the Royal Navy laid up during a temporary peace with France, Aubrey tries setting himself up as a country gentleman. Both Aubrey and Maturin have time to develop romantic interests, but a reversal of fortune leads them into some interesting and unusual (and sometimes humorous) situations as they dodge creditors. A renewal of war with France sends them back to sea as they attempt to restore Aubrey's fortunes. The action is fast paced and holds the reader's interest. Although part of a series, the book can be read as a stand-alone novel. The story is well researched and fits into the historic period. In addition to naval action, it provides an interesting look at some of the social and legal aspects of life in England during the early 19th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Aubrey/Maturin Appearance Just as Good as the First","review":"This is the second book in the critically lauded and very popular Aubrey/Maturin Series by Patrick O'Brian. It is clear inthis book that the story of these two very interesting characters is going to go on and on. The first book was excellent in that it introduced us to these wonderful characters, this second novel delivers further growth and development. Again, wear a warm jacket as you will feel as if you are on the ships. I truly believe that reading these books is just as good, if not better, than attending a history class.Excellent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This book has everything, from a beautiful item to display to much more inside the covers.

I wanted a five point unit that would work with just a seatbelt as I do not have shoulder straps in the back of the car. (I would have prefered the Fisher Price 20/60 five point unit but they stopped making it.)She fit in the seat with the straps in the upper slots. Unfortunately, there is a lump about an inch below the upper slots in the middle of the seat where one of the latching straps is attached to the rear of the seat. She felt this through a light winter coat. I had to put padding between the seat and the seat cover to prevent the bump from bothering her.If a child is smaller enough for you to use the lower strap holes they probably won't feel the lump as it will be between their shoulders and their neck. However, if they are large enough to require the use of the upper strap holes they will have the lump pressing against their spine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"A family friend bought us this booster as a gift because it has all of the features that she knew we were looking for in a booster. However, it is very difficult to adjust and the way it sits in our vehicle causes my son's legs fall asleep every time he rides in it. The straps are dependent on each other, so as you try to loosen one side you have to tighten the other. It takes a lot of fussing around with to get the straps tightened securely. Our son is currently in an Evenflo Triumph and the knob tightening system on that is a pain also, so I think it is time to pay the price for a Britax, just for the ease of use.

Doesnt seem to be a bad choice, has a nice fluffy padding (suggested by our friends that we should go with one which is comfortable for the little bottom). Installation was easy with the LATCH in our Odyssey. The tightening of the belt around the latches was a bit hard though. The top anchor held the seat tight in place. Like another reviewer said, the box says the seat is for 22 to 80 pounds and 32 to 54 inches children. But our son, who is 26 inches fits in fine in the seat. I especially liked the front lever, which lets you loosen the 5-point harness belt before placing the child in the seat and once seated, lets you tighten the belt to suit his body/clothing on the given day.

If you haven't done serious calculation work for some time, this is not the review for you. I use calculutions frequently as I work, and even so, these authors managed to make me question my ability.

It only has 50 pages to prepare you for the pharmacy technician and the rest are just exams. For those who have pharmacy experience, this book would be okay for you but for those like me who doesn't have any and would like to self-study, then it isn't for you. Honestly, the book is just a complete waste of money. It is only 170 pages or around there while the other books are over 400 pages. The book is also useless in preparing for the exam because I didn't pass by using this book. It does not mention drug interactions or touch on it unlike Del Mar's book. This book is a piece of crap. Do not buy and waste your money. You will not pass the exam if you buy this one because it barely expands on the topic. I recommend Del Mar's book because it has the most pages ever (600 pages.) Best book there. Just don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"To date I have still not received product I ordered and would like a refund immediately.

Later it would only work in reverse, and then a few days ago in quit working all together. I think my 2-year-old daughter stood on it, and messed up the internal gears. Knowing it was probably my daughters fault I didn't think the warranty would cover it. I went to the toy store with a year old broken toy, no receipt, and no box. Needless to say I fully expected to buy a new engine. To my amazement the toy store didn't ask any questions or have me fill out any paperwork. They just handed me a new engine, and that was it.

I credit the recent film \\"Master & Commander\\" with making the O'Brian series more accessible. One of the best films I have ever seen, it provided a visual context for me when I read the Aubrey/Maturin books. Though the film departs quite a bit for good reason from \\"The Far Side of the World\\", I thoroughly enjoyed the book and O'Brian's style of writing. Especially memorable for me was the unorthodox method O'Brian applied for conclusion of the book. Victory is in the air, and he dispenses with the need to drag the book out unnecessarily. Brilliant and revelatory to me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"This was the first book of the series that I've tried and this book did not catch my interest. Maybe I would have enjoyed it if I'd read some of the earlier ones but this book was very dull and had little action.

Maybe if you invested your time in reading all the books in this series you might feel an emotional attachment to these characters but from reading this one book I didn't. It wasn't hard to read as in challenging, it was hard to read because it didn't hold your attention. I could be slightly biased after reading the \\"Lymond Chronicles\\" if you want challenging, here's the series for you. Exciting and breathtaking and not enough words to describe the series. The \\"Lymond Chronicles\\" is the best of the best. Warning, the first book is the hardest to get through but so worth it at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I missing something?","review":"This is my first O'Brian book, and after reading it, I can surely state that it will be my last! I don't get all the furor about what a great series this is, because I found that, even though I finished the book, I didn't enjoy it very much. The plot (what there was of it) moved at a snail's pace, and kept getting interrupted by naturalist lectures and other really boring asides between the characters. There was more than enough going on with nautical terms that had me scratching my head in puzzlement, and that certainly took away from the reading enjoyment. Nothing much happened in the book, and it went through several hundred pages for this nothing to finally come to an anticlimactic end. Mr. O'Brian certainly has his rabid fans, but I for one will not join them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good yarn","review":"I like sea stories, Horneblower and Aubrey.

While reading, I thought often about just putting the book down and going on to something else - I wasn't carrying anything else.Having read the other reveiwers, I will accept that possibly I would have been better able to understand the story's origins had I read the other 9 books first. Also, I accept that the vast amount of detail missing at the end of the book may be found in the next of the series. I thought - and still wonder - that maybe there are omission of paragraphs, pages, and possibly chapters from the printing I have.I was looking for a stand alone story, not a book I would need to read nine before-hand and one or more afterwards to \\"finish\\".If you want to read one book to decide if you like the series, this is not the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strange and Wonderful","review":"Rich characters, refreshing originality, a good story, and plenty of surprises.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one for the time capsule","review":"The 10th book in the Aubrey-Maturin seagoing series. This was my least favorite so far in the series. O'Brian's books are always episodic, rather than plot-driven, but this story seemed even more of a collection of random incidents than usual. In this book, the Surprise is sent to protect the British whaling fleet in the Pacific. Along the way, there's adultery, a murder, a shipwreck, sharks, a lesbian band of runaway Polynesian women, and much, much more. Maybe O'Brian had writer's block and a deadline when he wrote this one, or maybe he was just \\"having us on.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping and well written","review":"An excellent addition to the Aubrey Maturin series.

There doesn't seem to be much happening so far and barely any dialogue. The descriptions are long-winded and put me to sleep and seem to take precedence over any kind of plot. I don't really care one way or another about the characters so far as I did in her previous books. I'm wondering if the author is trying out a new style. If so, I miss her old style.

She enjoyed the farm, the ponies, the visiting children and the warmth and love that her relatives gave her. She also had Frankie, her boyfriend, who lived and worked nearby. Frankie was the love of her life. That final summer saw the addition of another helper by the name of Lucy Dragon. What happened that last season, so many years ago, changed the course of many lives.

Although she created none of the patterns, she is seen modelling almost every one, with her leering face on practically every page.The history of crochet section is not original. In fact, much of it is a rehash of a truly great crochet book, \\"Encyclopedia of Crochet\\" by Donna Kooler.The instructions are confusing for a beginner and Ms. Stoller flatly refuses to acknowledge left handed people.

Debbie Stoller doesn't post the pattern errata online (maybe because she didn't write the patterns herself? I don't know), so obtaining corrected patterns is not an option.

Here's the problem--I am not a beginning crocheter and I had problems understanding some of the directions. On the more complicated patterns, they just are not clear enough. On top of that, there are so many errors that you'd better check the errata page for this book before beginning ANY pattern. When you have pages on other websites dedicated to co-crocheters trying to help one another figure out how to work through a pattern, I'd say you have a problem. Still, several of the patterns are cute. So, if you have a very good handle on crochet and reading patterns--and you have a lot of patience, go for it!

Mine was the second and still contained errors. I emailed the author at the email listed on the site and received no aknowledgement on how to complete the error filled pattern.

Plus, the first third of the book is a progression through the levels of crochet, with great illustrations. I love THH because it describes the yarn used in each pattern very well, making it easy to switch out the featured yarn for something more affordable or more easily located. The opening chapter about hook size, yarn types, etc is far more detailed and comprehensive than any other crochet book I've found. I also use the glossary whenever working on a pattern from a magazine, and I need to interpret an abbreviation or a certain stitch. I would reccommend this book to all level of crocheters.

Yahoo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I really want to learn to crochet!","review":"Stoller has done it again - she's combined her engaging writing style with contemporary, fun patterns, this time for crocheters!As someone who enjoyed learning to knit with Stoller's first book, I was excited to order The Happy Hooker. Not only does Stoller summarize the differences/advantages/disadvantages of crocheting and knitting, but she offers clear instructions for crocheting and finishing. Not to mention a wealth of wonderful patterns both kitschy and stylish! In the stylish category, there's a wonderful mohair capelet, some downright gorgeous sweaters (Froufrou is a favorite) a really fashionable grannysquare handbag, and a scarf made from pink and green crocheted flowers. For kitsch, there's an anarchist's cap, some silly skull coasters, and googly-eyed dolls!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Owning","review":"Love the conversational tone the book is written in. The \\"introduction to crochet\\" instructions are easy to follow (I'm sort of a beginner), and I really like quite a few of the patterns.And yes, there WERE errors in the patterns, but if you get the most recent printing of the book, those errors have been fixed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stitch 'N Bitch","review":"Came in good condition inspite of being well loved before and I have already made something from the book and refered to it on other projects.

If you are wanting to improve your crocheting this is the the book for you. I took my time and before I knew it I had made every project in the book . I have had so much fun going through this book. Great price and good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and modern","review":"This book is definitely well written and serves as a great beginner crochet guide (plus patterns). It explains not only how to do things, but the technical reasons why you do it (e.g. how to do increases to maintain a circle that doesn't ruffle/ripple).The patterns are nice and fresh, leaning towards things that people living in 2013 would find appealing, but doesn't completely neglect 'old school' patterns either (e.g. granny squares).Even intermediate crocheters will find useful information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Instructions!","review":"I started out self-teaching myself to crochet and decided i needed to learn the real way. This book couldn't been more perfect, there simple instructions how to maneuver the yarn and feel like an expert! Following those cryptic shorthand directions is now a breeze! The patterns are really fun and diverse, for men, women and babies. this book is great for beginners who need to learn the basics and there are plenty of patterns to keep the experts busy, I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Hooker","review":"I enjoyed the book, the patterns are great and easy to follow.

He uses real life examples to show how lust can destroy a persons life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filled with logical inconsistancies","review":"It was no secret that K had a long term relationship. He told some of his close friends about it. It's a private matter anyway. Radha's account on the other hand is not an expose, it is a nasty, malicious character attack of a man who is dead and can't defend himself.Her book is filled with logical inconsistencies: conclusions that simply do not add up. A book by someone who totally missed the boat for those who've missed the boat and are looking to rationalize it. Radha wrote to me that ultimately because of freedom of speech she can say anything she wants. That's how she justified the logical inconsistencies!! Too bad she didn't have the guts to do that when K was alive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assumptive,Speculative,presumptuous.","review":"I found the book to be highly presumptuous,misleading,and bias,in favor of her parents point of view!The only thing I would suggest is that one should read Krishnamurti,and the Rajagol's by Mary Luytens.They were using the affair between K and Rosaland as a blackmail tool to keep Krishnamurti from legally exposing gross abuse of monies gifted to the work of K , by D. Raja."},{"rating":"1","title":"A SLANDEROUS EXERCISE OF IMAGINATION.....","review":"I recently read this work by Mrs. Sloss. I've read many Krishnamurti works and willingly read this book as it presents a different opinion of the man. The conclusions as to Krishnamurti's motives, etc. are entirely imaginative in my humble opinion. It may have been a good sell had it not been so blatantly biased, basically the ramblings of a jilted lover filtered through her daughter who seeks to weave a very tall tale indeed. Shame, shame. While I would not recommend buying this book, if you must read it, borrow it instead!! In addition though, please read another book after that provides a most excellent response by Mary Lutyens called \\"Krishnamurti and the Rajagopals.\\" Only then will you be able to determine for yourself what the real story is!..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loaded with fallacious logic","review":"I read the book with interest and an open mind. The conclusions the author makes are often unfounded. There are some interesting historical descriptions and the most important contribution of the book was to depict that K was actually a human - and in my mind that made him even greater, because being a human he understood the human condition. But the author appears to constantly want to attack K for being a human and many of her conclusions seem to be inaccurate and unfounded - at least they are not presented with much solid logic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop preaching your faith for a minute!","review":"Let me say...I believe in God and try to live a spiritual life, but give me a break!Had a difficult time getting through this one. Ms. Fuller spends WAY too much time going on about religion, faith and God and not nearly enough time on the idea of teaching kids about music which is why I picked up the book! If I wanted a book on spirituality, I would've gotten one! It seems that every turn, Fuller is finding some excuse to go on about her religious fervor.Why do some Christians feel that they have to hit us over the head with their faith?I was very disappointed at all the dogma I had to wade through to get to what the book was SUPPOSED to be about!I would suggest that you try to find another book on this topic before trying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly organized not enough detail","review":"I work as an Apps DBA. I happened to get a hold of this book and read thro' it to see if it contained anything useful. Its awful. Its badly organized.There is no explanation on the architecture, no examples on how to use the adutilities and when to use them.

If you're a Propaganda fan, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Italian Metal","review":"This cd is awesome. Stormlord definitely have a very distinct sound with the epic riffing and melodic keyboards they use. Their vocalist has a nice range, able to go from gutteral growls to higher pitched shrieks. This album is solid from start to finish, and their cover of Iron Maiden is good. They have almost a kind of folk metal type vibe on a lot of their songs, which I dig. All in all, if you haven't heard of Stormlord, this is a good cd to discover them with. If you know Stormlord, then you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those Charming Men","review":"Not a bad band by any means Gene,however, never did forge their own identity remaining basically a less inspired version of the Smiths even if \\"Olympian\\" wouldn't embarass Morrissey and Marr's album record had it been theirs.The title track,\\"Left Handed\\",\\"To the City\\"and \\"Haunted by you\\"are the clear highlights."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I enjoyed my purchase, it was easy great product and arrived early.

I enjoyed \\"Buster\\" the best --- hands down. Ms. Dallas' art of finding and expressing the voice of an ordinary woman is at her finest in this book. Like several other reviewers, The Persian Pickle Club (her most famous?) was the least rewarding for me. But, she really has the voice perfectly with Effa Commander in this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshingly Bold","review":"In her poetic collection, \\"Blood, Tin, Straw,\\" Sharon Olds successfully manages to touch upon topics that others have not yet dared to try. Her exploration, explaination, and fascination with the female body is evident in nearly every poem. The synonyms used for describing certain body parts adds a mysterious curiosity to her poems, as though touching on some unknown. At times the collection appears to be a testimonial of Olds herself. A testimonial to herself, her husband, her children, her father, and to life in general. All the poems fit nicely into their sections whether it was \\"Blood,\\" \\"Tin,\\" \\"Straw,\\" \\"Fire,\\" or \\"Light.\\" The transitional poems between each section also worked well in tying the collection together as a whole. I was impressed by the honesty and true feeling evident in each poem.

The stories are told honestly and thoroughly. Very moving -- you can feel the anxieties of each person as they approach the coming out moment. I like the way the videos periodically display a quote that is about to be said by someone in the video. Very effective. Each \\"story\\" runs about 25 minutes. The picture and sound are high quality. We've shown several episodes at our high school's Gay Straight Alliance meetings and they sparked much discussion. I highly recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy with this car seat","review":"I purchased this seat after it received a favorable review from Baby Bargains. I was fairly happy with the seat at first -- it reclines much more than our Britax seat and is good for long trips with a baby. The fabric seems cheap and the straps and buckle are difficult to work with, though. After approximately six months of use, we went to turn the seat forward and found that the seat foam was actually disentegrating under the outer cover. I had to vacuum out the car to get it all up (and I've never even put the cover through the wash). I'm contacting Combi to try and get a return."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good study tool","review":"I begin by saying that there is no perfect practice set of questions for the USMLE Step 2 exam (not a single book that deserves 5 stars). This book highlighted several key points that actually came on my exam. However the format of the questions did not accurately represent the exam (but I have not found *any* set of questions that does). Good points: 1/3 of the questions have lots of lab values that you must sift through. In the actual exam you must be very comfortable with lab values. There are excellent quality images in the book. And the explantions are concise yet informative. Bad points: 2/3 of the questions are either \\"all are true EXCEPT\\" (which do not appear on the exam) or are quick recall (when the actual exam is more conceptual). All in all, I am glad I used this book and would recommend it as a study tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended!","review":"Break-up into timed sections, question length and content and subjects covered pretty closely matched my exam, which I took 2 weeks ago.

I particularly liked the last part of the book where Harris debates Wilde about male to male love vs. male to female love.Harris is plainly not intimidated by Wilde's witticism's and keeps to a serious vein without being rankled or becoming victimized by Wilde's ability to trivialize subjects with a veneer of parody. Among more of Harris insights is the statement that Bosie,(Wilde's \\"lover\\") and Bosie's father the Marquiss of Quennsbury are really 2 opposite ends of the same log.Harris biography seems more like a piece of literature and the life of Wilde,could even Dickens have thought up such a character as Oscar Wilde,I know Poe did!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Magic Flute","review":"I'm usually dismissive of most Die Zauberflotes because I find the overall quality of the singers and recording lacking. Then I came upon this recording...I have to say that it is simply the most amazing Die Zauberflote I've ever heard! The orchestrations to the singers to the conductor himself...everything is mind-blowing! I'm not a Mozart person, but if I really like a recording of his I will buy it. This is an excellent way to introduce yourself to the Flute, especially since there is such a wonderful introduction accompanying this extremely famous opera. And the Queen of the Night-Edda Moser!!! Amazing! Simply amazing! No other Queen has conveyed that much drama into her singing. This is the Flute. I would suggest Marriner's version if I hadn't seen this one, but then here is a Flute with all the greats in it! Get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mozart on Steroids","review":"I've seen Der Zauberflote performed two or three times and do not intend to miss any performances that I hear about.

Finally, the extra notes are a pleasure to read. What I am waiting for is a Black Dog DVD Opera series. However, until then, I really really like this set and I think that you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peculiar choice","review":"Nice idea to provide the series in a DVD-on-demand format, but what a peculiar choice to bring out the final season with all episodes, EXCEPT the final episode (PCA Confidential).They did something similar with the first season of Drake & Josh, skipping 4 episodes, but including 4 episodes that were distributed on DVD already (of course, in later seasons, many more episodes were skipped).But I support the request to bring out more Nickelodeon series.

Maybe it has something to do with the main setting: Malta, Eqypt and the Red Sea. Some people may be bored by it. I felt the story played across the desert landscape quite beautifully. This is a gripping read, full of political and personal intrigue, great atmosphere, science (Stephen and that damned diving bell) and pitch-perfect characterizations, especially of the two principal protagonists. While Maturin is usually treated more three-dimensionally in the books, it is rare to see Aubrey as fully.

Most of the book takes place on land (many fans of the series do not like landlubber tales) which I don't have a problem with but alas O'Brians fan/critics about hit the mark on this one. The story DOES drag somewhat and the writing is missing some of the polish and sparkle of the earlier books in the series. The reader must be patient however as there are some fantastic moments throughout and, as always, O'Brian stealthily injects witty and endearing humor. I very much consider Patrick O'Brian's series to be literature of the first order and although this installment misses the mark somewhat (in my opinion), it is still an excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for Netware Administrators","review":"Great book that I refer to as needed.

I admit that some of the plots have been predictable, but this is easily overlooked because Peters does such an expert job at bringing the 12th century to life, and Cadfael is such an entertaining character.This particular installment happens to be one of the better mysteries in the series. Like the previous thirteen, it is a well-written and finely crafted story, but there are also some clever surprises.

Ms. Peters depth of detail brings the period to life. The social structure and mores of both England in 1041 and the Benetictine order are a facinating contrast to today.

The book is rich with insights: One of a kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre","review":"Highly recommended for young teenage girls. The story captures a time when women were not considered highly in society. The existence of having a nice life was to find a good suitor with money to have the better things in life.Jane was one of the lucky ones where she did find true love. I recommend reading the book before watching the several movies that are out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godzilla Never Looked So Good","review":"In the end Zoey doesn't marry the stomper of Tokyo; although, he comes off as more sympathetic than the men Zoey cares about. But don't get the idea that this story is anything but a fascinating journey through the main character's life treatd with humor and and a touch of pathos. You will meet a fascinating cast of characters and a series of incidents that will hold your interest hostage through the whole book. A book about those who are the children of \\"the greatest generation,\\" it's worth your coin."},{"rating":"1","title":"not their best","review":"Izze sparkling juices are generally pretty good.

This is a great find. I've been keeping a journal for a few years and now a very classy hardbound book shows the passion people can express about the cigars they smoke. I bought this black leather bound book with gold embossed lettering \\"Cigar Dossier\\". Although I do have one problem: I have done about 50 pages with my cigar bands glued in its appropriate box and now this book is becoming much thicker than the binder. This will cheapen the look more and more as time goes on. Nonetheless, this is the best I've seen and definitely worth the buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed the Mark","review":"Boy did this book leave we wanting. There is no front matter to describe how to use the book. Probably because the pages aren't organized for the user to record information useful in tasting and rating cigars. The space for placing the cigar bands is too small for most bands and the comments section is way to small to record all the pertinant information regarding taste, construction, appearance, aroma, etc. There is only one box to record the wrapper and no space dedicated to recording the binder or filler information. The filler is probably the most important regarding the taste of the cigar and yet there is no place to record this information!This book was published in 1995 and was clearly sold to make a buck during the cigar boom of the '90s. This was not made by a person in tune with those of us looking for a cigar log book with substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mr. Trower's bestest original album!","review":"I was never a Trower (\\"Bridge of Sighs\\") fan, but you don't have to be to get excited about an album so fine! What really stands out is just how great his guitar sounds, it's the best in the business. And the timber of his vocals really match it like a hand in glove. 5 or 6 gotta-have-it greats; the rest of the album is interesting. Bluesy, jazzy, and kind of psychedelic."},{"rating":"2","title":"triumphant trower","review":"All in all, a good CD. My favorite tracks are Go My Way, Too Much Joy, and In My Dream. A couple of other enjoyable tunes were Into Dust and Run With The Wolves. As I listened to the music I closed my eyes and imagined what James Dewar would sound like if he were singing these songs. Amazing!! For that matter, even Davey Pattison would sound good. Not that Robin is a bad singer, but it takes some getting used to. His guitar work remains impeccable. My vote is to get Davey back and allow Robin to wail on his guitar. Hey, any thought to getting another Scotsman (Chris Rea) to do some singing for the band? I know it's not exactly Chris' style, but he has the same soulful voice James had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome back Robin !","review":"My first listen to \\" Go my Way \\" was like a visit from an old friend. From the title track's first note I was hooked.This is an excellent effort. Robin's unique tones are here with some fresh twists.His vocals are a great suprise to me.From \\"Go my way\\" to \\"In my dream\\" this cd or... should I say album ? rocks.This harkens back to any of his great seventies work without sounding dated.If you are a fan of Trower's or a fan of great guitar, buy this.Welcome back Robin.....We missed you !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go My Way","review":"I've been a fan for over 30 yrs. I can listen to Robin play the guitar 24/7. Singing is NOT his strong suit and the 'boy' singer isn't my cup of tea either. His guitar playing needs a 'voice' of maturity. Get the cd and ignore the singing. I gave it four stars for Robin's guitar playing, but I'd give it 2 stars for the singing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long time Fan","review":"Robin Trower is a true guitar legend that shuld never be forgotten. \\"Go My way\\" takes me back to the early Trower days. I've listen to this new release countless times just to see if I might have missed something. Robin plays guitar with more heart and soul then ANY other rock guitar player I've ever listen to. No his vocals isn't his strong point but some of our greatest voice's in rock weren't great vocalist...Hendrix, Joplin, dylan and Petty just to name a few. But we've become accustomed to their sound so if you're a true Trower fan don't be so critical open your ears to the music not so much on the vocals. \\"Go My Way\\" is a great CD Robin's best in a long time I recommend that you purchase this CD and share with someone who may say \\"Robin Trower who is that\\" then give them an ear full! And to Robin Trower all I have to say is sang on, play on brotha!"},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY REFRESHING","review":"I found GO MY WAY to be not only refreshing but a very laid back cd. Full of some tight jammin' that makes it easy to listen to from start to finish. Funny though, Trower is cursed in the fact that he was one of those guys(like Frank Marino)who in the 70's. If you played with any testical fortatude you were compared to Jimi Hendrix,lol. Now it seems all the other reviewers are comparing Trower to himself. I would and have recommended this cd to alot of folks based on it's own merits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good psychedelic-blues CD","review":"Robin Trower was the Procol Harum's guitarist.But his works are in a different style from Procol Harum.They are more blues and psychedelic.Trower was an Hendrix's fun, but this CD is a mixture between the sound of Hendrix and Pink Floyd.Perhaps one of his best !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash (disappointed to say the least!)","review":"Even Trower's somewhat uneven records (Back It Up comes to mind) were far better than much of the musical output of a thousand other bands. This release, however, truly demonstrates he is A. Stuck in a time warp or B. Totally bereft of new musical ideas. The vocals are horrible - why Trower feels he can (or should) contribute vocals is a mystery. The singing chores should have been left to Livingston Brown, who has the type of voice Trower's music needs and deserves. I've seen Robin play live twice with Livingston Brown, and not having Brown's lead vocals as well as better developed/more forward thinking musical material dooms this new release (in my humble opinion). To say that much more was expected is an understatement!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin Trower can't do without James Dewar","review":"Robin Trower has produced the best rock/guitar albums of the last century. All his albums were great with James Dewar as singer, songwriter and bass player. After James became unfortunately ill everything that made the music special is gone. Not only his beautifull and powerfull voice is missing even the sound of Robin's guitar sounds bad without him. Jimmy and Robin were the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trower's Worst CD Yet by ten million miles!","review":"I'm a guitarist and have been a big Trower fan since the very beginning. For the life of me, I can't understand how Robin has lost his ear for decent songs and vocals. For the life of me, I can't understand how any true Trower fan could even mention the title of this CD and \\"Bridge of Sighs\\" in the same sentence. This would make a decent Tom Petty album, but it makes a terrible Robin Trower album. It's tired, draggy, and monotonous, not even considering the \\"Bob Dylan's grandmother\\" vocals. Robin desperately needs a new vocalist and a decent songwriter. The only decent CD he's released in the last few years is 20th Century Blues.....and it's not that great....but a helluva lot better than this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Back To The Bridge","review":"RT's Go My Way is a much anticipated return to his 70s styled blues rock. Robin has brought back his atmospheric guitar tones provided by the swirly Univibe and Crybaby Wah pedals making this EASILY his best work in over 20 years. The songs are well written and his band sounds great with the addition of vocalist Richard Watts on 3 songs. Trower's vocals are much improved over the Someday Blues CD, and his guitar playing...well you know....great as usual. If you are a fan of Robin's music, you gotta have this CD, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product as promised","review":"The sporn halter was as promised.

Boy, was I disappointed. Most of the songs are either trite, sappy or too religious (not traditional gospel).

Still, 50% is a big 'F'."},{"rating":"1","title":"more bluegrass, less country please","review":"Like many other reviewers on this page, I heard Dan Tyminski for the first time on the \\"O Brother\\" soundtrack as well. I was disappointed with this recording, though, because it sounds a bit too much like pop country for my taste.

The only exceptions being Solembum and Angela-character wise- and the last two chapters. It wasn't this epic adventure...it was long and mostly boring. The chapters were too short. and parts of the story too clipped. And this did not strike me as original. It seemed like it was mixed up of Harry Potter, Lord of the rings, and Merlin(The BBC series). Not to mention the word \\"stymied' came up enough to be annoying.So, in short. Didn't love it. Won't be reading books 2-4."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sort of a slow start, but a GREAT story","review":"Everyone has put an emphasis on this book being written by a 17 year-old, but this is a good book by any standards. If you didn't gather this was a fantasy from the cover, it is. The story is set back (at least its back in my mind) in a time before electricity, guns, and many other modern conveniences; in their place the story gains Dragons and magic. I've finished all four books and enjoyed how well they go together and develop each other.This is one of the first series that I managed to get truly immersed in since Harry Potter (I know!). If you enjoy fantasy, be sure to give the Inheritance series a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"This is a very interesting story. YES YES it is not new. In fact I recognize all the elements that were taken from the classic works of Fantasy. Just like Eragon, Paolini is just a fledging, a teenager who is thrown into the perilous adventure of writing only to confront the evil critics into a long epic battle of good vs. evil. I admire him because he had the courage to give to the world this book at such a tender age. Also, like Eragon, he is not a master yet. There is a lot he needs to learn. He is still sloppy with his penmanship(sword) and his magic use of language. Give him time and he will prove to be a great writer and one to contend with.All in all I thought the story was quite entertaining, since I read it for the purpose of having a good time and not to rip it apart into pieces. Great things should be expected from these two young heroes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I love this book so much! My mom got it for me for christmas and I can't put it down it's so good. I would definitely recommend this book to fantasy lovers. It has a lot of words and creatures you would'nt understand... that's why I love it! Plus at the end of the book there's a language dictionary for the book. Definetely worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"book report","review":"This book was really just a book report on Lord Of the Rings and other geat novels. he put it into his own words and changed the names around but alot of the story was based on LOTR.

I was so happy to see him interested in reading! I purchased it mainly for that purpose...\\"Hey, this guy was your age when he wrote it!\\" Of course Mom had to read it first just to make sure it was appropriate...I had to go back and read it again when my son finished with it, because he kept wanting to discuss it and I had read quite a few other books in the meantime and had to refresh my memory. It was just as good the second time around. Some books really can't hold your interest again, but this one did. I will probably have to buy 2 copies of Eldest so we don't fight over who gets to read it first. I think it is a magnificent work considering the author's age. It has also been a wonderful catalyst not only for my son's reading habits, but a mother and son's quality time shared."},{"rating":"2","title":"the book was fine why complain?","review":"The main thing that I have a problem with is that the older reviewers of this book don't stop to consider that for kids this book was a fantastic story. Also, I know some are just trying to give Paolini constructive criticisim, but slashing the book and calling it 'all ready done' is immature if you ask me. Paolini was 15 when he wrote this. Give him a break he's a biginner and he'll learn. So for all you adult 'know-it-alls' cut him some slack and keep your rude thoughts to yourself. Your SNAP will make people not want to by his books in the future. Now how would that make you feel if you knew you were responsible for Paolini's downfall?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Yuck","review":"This was a complex story with good charecters, an impressive plot, and an amazing world.

Paolini is a talented writer. I don't think it's popular just because he's young, however. If I remember correctly, his father had it self-published before it was published by Knopf.The book took me a while to read, but it was worth it. Sometimes it was hard to remember every detail of the book, but I found that each detail helped to contribute to the complete image Paolini created.And if anyone is interested, it's being made into a movie, which I think will be pretty enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"It is really hard to put down.

Bad writing, dull characters, cliche plot, etc. But lots of reviewers have tried to defend Paolini's poor book by saying that it's meant for children. But is it?Allusions to rape, gory fight scenes, heroes stealing money from bridgekeepers, and a rather negative view on the meaning of life (or lack thereof in Eragon's case). And let's not forget the skewered baby that was almost eaten by a crow!Face it. It's not a decent children's book. It's a poorly written adult book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is Auful","review":"This book was so over hyped it's crazy. Let me be honest with you, it was written by a 15 year old... and it READS like it was written by a 15 year old. There's nothing amazing here other than that he actually got published.The name of the book \\"Eragon\\" is a plagiarism by itself! Ever head the name \\"Aragorn\\" before? Sound similar by coincidence? The main theme of the book is the \\"Dragon Riders\\" So we know the kid read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Dragonlance\\" before he started. I'll not go on... there's no point. The book is bad. I'm sure when he's 40 he'll be a great writer, but that's 20 years away. Don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book deserves negative 5 stars","review":"This book is horrible.

But from what I read, eragon doesn't really do anything wrong, but it didn't do anything new either. I can't really find anything to object to except that the book lacked life. It didn't have that spark of originality that I really want in books. If you want a good fantasy that isn't going to shock you, this is probably your best bet, but otherwise, I doubt this book would have done well if it didn't have the gimmick that it was written by a kid."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enchanting and heroic battle between two forces","review":"This is one of the greatest books of all time. One might call it good against evil, but the good aren't that heroic. It is a coming of age story where the main character struggles with himself and his own feelings as well as his enemies.

It was entertaining, entertaining enough to be not put downable, and to be read twice. I would only hope that the \\"criticisms\\" don't go to the author's head nor do they bog him down or change his style. I want the second book is written just like the first one is.It is a wonderfully imaginative story of a heros journey. I like the fact that the hero finds a soul mate, a worthy master to teach him, a friend for company and a possible love interest.

That is exactly what I believe an entertaining story would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rocked!","review":"I started this book around nine o'clock at night and didn't put it down untill i had finished it somewhere aroud noon the next day.

While the subject of dragons, elves and dwarves ext. may be used alot, this story was still original and the plot was great. I couldn't put it down. All i could think about was what happens next. I also disagree with many of the other raters of this book. I did not find it easy to determine that it was written by a teenager. If no one had told me I never would have guessed. The book was very well written. The fact that it was written by a 17 year old only makes it even more impressive. If you havn't read it and the sequel then I highly recommend that you do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Wish I'd read the first review on Amazon before buying this overhyped book. I can't say it any better then he- it is an impressive effort for a teenage author, but a poor imitation of Tolkien and McCaffrey's stories. The characters are wooden, and what really gives it away is the total lack of humor and the author taking himself and his story too seriously. Read the Bartimaeus books for a refreshing contrast. It did get me thinking about what qualities separate a good book from a bad one, though... When the author has to TELL you how the characters are feeling rather than letting their actions and dialogue speak for itself, that's one sign of a poorly written tome."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't really care.","review":"Okay, while I do think that Eragon has a few okay characters (Angela, the Werecat) the rest are just pathetic. Eragon can be discribed as \\"Hero who instanly knows everything and is the best at sword fighting, snapping at other people, drinking whineing, and getting knocked out when someone taps him on the back of the head.\\" Come on, the talking dog in my little sister's picture book is tougher!Don"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad, bad, bad","review":"As we all know by now, the author was fifteen when he wrote Eragon. Whoever he showed it to should have said, \\"This is a great book, kid. You should become an author when you grow up!\\" But instead they went and published it.Aside from the beautiful cover, the book has almost nothing to recommend it. There are nearly no original elements. The characters have no personality to speak of, except for the dragon, who is smug. The action is patently unbelievable from paragraph to paragraph--I remember one scene where Eragon draws his bow and fires an arrow behind him to kill an opponent who's chasing him, and I finally quit reading when he was able to beat one of the best swordsmen in the world, left-handed, after only a few months of practice since growing up as a farm boy."},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't get into it","review":"for the reasons others have said, I couldn't get into this book. weak dialog, ridiculously weak female characters, ripped-off plot, and I'm supposed to like it because of all the hype?

At first, I just started reading it because we do this accelerated reader program at school and it was worth a lot of points. When I started reading it I loved it and it also inspired me to write my own book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"The book is dismally written in an irritating voice. The characters are unbelievable. The plot is very predictable (almost the same as star wars). The world has been completely lifted from Lord of the rings and in the process has lost it's detailed history and grandiose mystique. I suppose it's good trashy literature for younger children, but then, there are better books that they could be reading instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon","review":"i thought this book was okay, because it sounded a lot like Lord of the Rings, with elves, dwarves, and names, such as Eragon to Aragorn. Brom seemed okay, but his having a white great horse was like Shadowfax, and there was a lord of horses in the book. I thought it wasn't bad, but it was just a little too similar to Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite, Of All Time","review":"I think that this book is wonderful. The mixture of fansasy and a little truth made this book irresistable to me. I think that it is imaginative, and made me almost believe this wonderful story.

Yes it is true that I am only 11, but all the same I have read a lot of books,none as good as this one. I suppose that the reason for me liking it is in the quality of the book, and...well, the fact that it has dragons in it. I have read many dragon books, and think that they are facinating in a cool sort of way. I like how \\"Eragon\\" describes flying. It made me feel like I was up in the air as well. I have always wanted to be able to just take off with wings... I know that my title says \\"The ups and downs of Eragon\\", but I can't find any downs,so lets just leave it at that. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very familiar, but fun nonetheless.","review":"I probably wouldn't have bought this book for myself, but when I got it for Christmas and had some free time on my hands, I figured, \\"What the heck\\". Right out of the gate, you can see where Mr Paolini's influences lie. All the standard elements are in place and ready for action. People with strange names, creatures with strange names, places with strange names. Extraneous apostrophes cavort with their umlaut buddies in all sorts of unexpected places. The good guys are attractive and the bad guys are ugly. Very black and white stuff. It's the superficial elements of Tolkien, Pratchett, Zelazny, McCaffrey and a host of others, all crammed into a single volume. I kept reading anyway.Before long I was rewarded with character development, a deepening plot, and a very readable writing style. So readable, in fact, that by 5:00 the next morning I was eagerly awaiting the next installment. When it hits the stores, I WILL buy it for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I have to be honest, I bought the book because the writer was a teenager and I had to see what he might write!Regardless of age, I thought his book was extremely interesting and I even lost sleep to find out what happens next. I think you can see some inexperience in emotion in how some of the characters interact, but it definitely does not detract from one's enjoyment of the story.I definitely plan on purchasing the next book as it comes out. I have to find out how the rest of the story of Eragon and Saphira unfolds. So write, Christopher, write!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extravagant Book!","review":"This book is awsome! It is the best book I've ever read! It is packed with so much adventure that if you put it down you just want to pick it back up again. It is very descriptive and full of suspense. It leaves you with unanswered questions that at the last minuet are answered, and they aren't answered in black and white. It is full of surprises and challenges so that when ever a character triumphs greatly he would also lose something. It leaves you sort of hanging at the end of the book but you have got a strong hold. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes adventure and suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"Eragon was the worst book I've ever read in my life. The concept was stolen from Star Wars and Lord of the Rings. He didn't even add anything new to it.There's a difference between paying homage to something and outright ripping it off. I believe that christopher paolini should be in prison for copyright infringement. He ripped right off Star Wars, which itself wasn't even that good. If you're going to steal ideas, steal GOOD ideas.Okay, I take it back. I've read books far worse than Eragon (for example, maya angelou's books all suck). But that doesn't mean that Eragon should be given leeway. And he shouldn't be given leeway just because he WAS a teenager. Lots of teenagers write great books. For example, Nancy Yi Fan, who became a bestselling author at age 13.I know it's a bit late to post about Eragon, but for those who are about to get into it, I strongly advise you to stay away from this \\"novel\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"i agree with the one sta review","review":"the book was horrible do not waste your money there were so many bad idaes and things this book is a piece of crap! wait no tha is a dis on crap"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like adventure and fantasy, you will love this book.","review":"I first read this in the Eighth Grade. I loved it then, and it has only gotten better with age. It reads well, and keeps you interested from the very first chapter. The Characters are intriguing and develop well as the story progresses.

Despite being gifted with two hardcover copies, I put it off until listening to the audio version. Sorry - I can't make it past Disk 4 of 14.

It is filled with too many pointless descriptions that come out of the blue, only to drag you away from the rocky plot. It is barely a story, mostly descriptions, and the names are all tears away from Tolkien as well.Ayra:ArwenEragon: This is /too/ obvious.And Brom is obviously molded from Gandalf.The boy, is way to unoriganal and acts like he's fourty! Everything that happens is very stereotypcial, and I had to force myself to finish it. All that happens: He gets hurt, he gets better.

Is it predictable, yes and no. But it doesnt hurt it whatso ever. You can tell the writer drew upon several influences. There are shades of Star Wars and Lord of the rings butits great.

If you are into Fictional Fantasy stories, then this is the book for you! It has a unique way of wanting you to keep on reading. When your not reading it, you just want to read it again to see what happens in the next chapter. The book's chapters end in ways that make you want to find out what happens next. The book does that in every chapter, so its not boring and you decide to skip on to another book. This book is about a boy named Eragon, who later on finds and keeps a Dragon! The Dragons name is, Saphira. Saphira is very protective of Eragon at first but after a while, they go for wild adventures in the cool book. The book has a Fantasy way of majic, and luck. It also has it's negatives. The only negative i would say, would be that it takes a while to add up to the end of how the story will and when take place. This book is simply amazing.

It's decent, yes, but its certaintly nothing new. Honnestly, I'm impressed that parts of it even made it though editing.Anyway. If you're just looking for a book to waste time with, I'd suggest a series that is less traditional. If you're looking for good Fantasy, I'd suggest a series that's, well, good fantasy.

Everyone seemed to love it, so I started the book expecting another great fantasy. I still haven't finished it, but I just can't bring myself to. I am bored out of my mind while I read it, and have trouble not falling asleep. I don't really care about any of the characters or what happens to them, because I don't feel like I even know the characters. And this is after 250 pages. I feel like I'm missing something, and I wanted to make myself read the rest of the book to find out what I'm missing, but there are so many really good books out there that I just don't have the time to slog through a book I am not enjoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring, been done, boring, been done","review":"This book is boring.

Every aspect of this book is an obvious rip off of fantasy based genres. If you happen to be new to this kind of \\"ideas\\", it would be a quite interesting book to read. But of course, in order to enjoy it, you MUST ignore the mediocre dialogue that doesnt seem to fit the whole dragon-king-castle era. By that i mean, what kind of medieval-old-wise man would talk like a 21st century suburban teen?

Why else would his book be selling well? The plotline and characters are certainly interesting. But they're not interesting *enough*--I constantly found myself capable of reading a chapter, feeling more or less entertained, and then putting it down with absolutely no subconscious need to pick it up again. Whenever I did continue reading, I wasn't bored, but I also never felt the compulsion to finish. The story is too much of a cliche, and there is really nothing about Saphira or Eragon that seemed unique enough to pull them out of the stereotypical dragon or adolescent hero-kid of mass-produced fantasy novels. The writing itself was decent, but not great. But the book was also not so bad as to make me *not* recommend it to other viewers. In a nutshell, so-so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is Paolini another Tolken???","review":"This book is wonderful in its detail and depth of imagination. Lord of the Rings has always been my favorite trilogy and elven-type fantacy... but we shall see if the Inheritance series doesn't top it!

Well done Christopher Paolini!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellently woven tale, keeps you riveted.","review":"This is a wonderful coming-of-age story, set in a fantastical land. Paolini does a good job of skillfully weaving the tapestry together so that you care about the characters. It's a hard book to put down once you get started.As to another reviewer who graded the book poorly for being \\"derivative\\", I seriously doubt there are any wholly original tales out there. What makes any work unique are the characters and events and how they are arranged to make a whole.

Mothers, if you give your daughters this book, you might as well tell them to forget about being a person in their own right.

Writing 101: don't start every sentence in a paragraph with a pronoun, it's obnoxious, and trying to vary that up with time indicators (i.e: while, when, at that time, at that moment, in an instant), is unimaginative and mediocre.

What Paolini has done is simply a failed amalgation of adolescent, prepubescent tales that caught his fancy. His depictions of women are ethereal, full of boyish longing. His plot flits hither and thither, from one iconic fantasy tale to another. But what is worst, beyond the sheer silliness of its subject matter and the workmanlike quality of its prose, is the mediocrity in which his subject matter is immersed. Like an adolescent preening for profundity, he simply lays naked a frightening lack of talent, and disregard for the innards of what gives true writing DEPTH. This tale skims surfaces, never plumbs the real depths of its protagonists, makes its antagonists caricatures rather than characters. A painful work to read. Adults and those of discerning intelligence--let the children read this, and have their day. Maturity awaits them down the road."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty imaginative","review":"For someone so young, this first book is quite complex. So waht if the author borrowed on a theme? Most published works these days are rarely an original thought.Eragon has accomplished in one book what it took the first four of the Harry Potter series to achieve. The book introduces us to a world of innocence that is quickly overshadowed by harship, mistrust, hard-won friendships, war, and politics. I also love the sassiness of Saphira. I do love Harry Potter, but I place Eragon much closer to my first love which is the Lord of the Rings trilogy.In a world where it is so hard to get some youngsters to pick up a book, I'm glad that one had enough imagination, drive, and support to write one.I look forward to the future of Eragon."},{"rating":"2","title":"An enjoyable and entertaining read","review":"Yes, there might be some that will claim it is similar to Lord of the Rings and other fantasy books, but it is still very enjoyable and a fun read.

It lacks depth, which doesn't bother me too much, and it is very predictable, but it captivated me and kept me reading it.

If this is one of this first fantasy books you've read then you might not be as dissapointed, but this book copied soooo many other fatasy books. It could actually be a fan fiction.

Sure, you can definitlely spot many similarities between Eragon and other very popular fantasy novels. But what is the problem in that? Taking an approach that has been sucessful is smart, and the book shouldn't be degraded for that. While the characters may not have been quite as personal as in books such as in the Dragonriders of Pern series, I thought that he did a decent job creating his main characters. The most important aspect of a book to me is that its plot is exciting, and makes me WANT to keep reading, and Eragon did that. The only thing I really had an issue with was the sometimes apparent predictibility of the novel (ie, he's going to be attacked right... now.)But overall, a solid book. I enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best story ever!!!","review":"The story was great and all but I do feel that the author copied a little bit. Eragon came frome the term of Aragorn from the lord of the rings. The fights on the other hand are awsome. I already know that they shall soon be making a movie out of this at the end of 2006. The enemies were sort of copied too. The so called Urgals a type of orc-like creature had something that represented the uruk-hai: the Kull faster,stronger, and bigger.

Yes I get that someone younger than myself wrote this book and I probably couldn't do a better job of writing it, but its NOT THAT GREAT. As everyone has been saying, it stole a bunch of ideas from other influential fantasy novels, which is fine but it poorly mooshed them all together to make a really long, dry book. Great storyline, but it could have been played up a lot more. It was too long. And it's not that I don't like long books. I love Harry Potter and the Count of Monte Cristo, but they are able to hold my attention and admiration the whole way through. This one was hard to get through. I bought the second book and still haven't read it because I'm dreading that it will be the same thing all over again.

As stated by so many here before, it's a rip-off of, to name a few, Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, Pern, Earthsea, etc. Paolini can't even make up his own language. If you look carefully at the words, they sound /strangely/ like synonyms of the word they're supposed to mean. Let me see, the word vonder for a thin, straight stick, can I say 'WAND'? Or how about thrysta for thrust... arget for silver? The word for silver in latin is argentium. GET ORIGIONAL, CP.And for those who say, \\"oh, he wrote it at the age of 15!\\" he didn't. He was 19.Another fact: Look at the majority of people who gave good reviews:A. They were CHILDREN. Under the age of 13.B. MOMS talking about their CHILDREN enjoying it.Again I say, save your money and buy a better book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage written by a teenager is still garbage","review":"If this book had not had a gimmick of coming from a kid, it would have been thrown on the scrap heap at any publisher and recycled. Which it should have been. This is a really terrible piece of fan fiction, and the fact that it has gotten the attention it has is a complete sin. When I first heard that a teenager had written it, I wondered if he might have had help from his parents. Now that I've seen it, I can only hope he didn't, because that means there are even more bad writers in the world than just him."},{"rating":"1","title":"why this book is so popular, I will never know","review":"Eragon has been hailed as an epic story written by a teenage prodigy, but few seem to realize the sad truth about this book and its sequel. There is barely any original plot or characters in this entire series, and it very much lacks in writing talent and ability. If it had been written by, oh say, a middle aged person who had experience in the writing field, it would have never been published. The author simply takes chunks from other, better stories such as the popular Lord of the Rings trilogy, Earthsea, the Dragon Riders of Pern, and Starwars, and pretends they are his own ideas. I highly recomend you skip this book and look for something with a little more taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooooo... BORING!!!!","review":"When I got this, it looked like an exiting adventure story. I've got into about a forth of the book and I can't read any more! I think I'll bore myself to death! My parents forced me to read this, and I can't imagin how bad the next one, Eldest, is! DO NOT GET THIS BOOK> IT'S A HUGE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many rip-offs","review":"As noted so many times, but perhaps not adequately emphasized, Paolini has obviously received influences from Tolkein, Eddings, Brooks, and many others; although influenece may be an understatement. This could easily be an uneducated rip-off of the Lord of the Rings. The book reads very much like it, from fantasy languages, to the naming of contrived species, to a hero who seems on the path to \\"an epic romance\\" with the most beutiful woman in the world (who also happens to be an elf). The epic romance bit is a direct quote from the book and shows clearly the 15-year-old mind behind all this. The only bright side is that in making the main character 15, Paolini has at least created one believable character. While there is definate potential here, Paoplini needs to start writing his own story instead of butchering his predicessors'."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of this has happened before...","review":"and no doubt it will all happen again. Entertaining book, but really, past the 2nd chapter, I've read this book before and seen the movie before. It's Star Wars, Wizard of Earthsea, LOTR, Pern, and probably quite a few I haven't read. Sorry, this book is a blatant ripoff of MUCH better books. Read it yourself...you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I got to tell you, I did not know about the existance of this book, until the movie came out. And what was I missing! A great book by Paolini that transports you into a world of fantasy, magic and battle between good and evil. The plot will submerge you in the live of Eragon, a farm boy who became a Dragon Rider. Paolini gave very good explanations of Eragon's quest and the battle within himself. Always a good read , the book make the reader know and care for the character inmensly. And it isn't that what a book is supposed to do? At least, I believe so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"One of my friends recommended this book, so I had high hopes for it. Alas, my hopes were dashed. This book blatantly rips off elements of other major fantasy stories--mainly Tolkien and Anne McCaffrey. A main character named Eragon who is a Dragon Rider that can communicate telepathically with his dragon. Gee, how original. And all the names are so unimaginative that I'm torn between laughing and crying at the travesty (a blue dragon named Saphira? Come on!). It's pretty much a cliched travelogue. Ugh. I'm rarely moved to write reviews but this book really just blew it. If you want some good fantasy, there's plenty of much better stuff out there--try some Robin McKinley, for instance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite Fantasy and Poor Writing","review":"I thought this story was going to be somewhat promising since the sales rank--but IT DEFINITELY WAS ALL HYPE. I tried my hardest to like it but the poor chracters and \\"cookie cutter\\" story time and again defeated that. I've never seen a fantasy story so unabashadly rip Tolkien--watch Fellowship the movie (or read the book) and you have the plot.One feels that he was inspired to change the names and write his 'own' story. Inexcusable and pathetic! The more you praise this worthless tripe folks the more of this is what your going to get. I know it's tough people but there ARE good fantasy books out there (and certainly better writers) so show a little discretion and take a stand for quality. It's CERTAINLY not here.Recommended for people without any taste in fantasy or like it predictable and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon: Don't waste your time on this one.","review":"I fail to see how anyone with half a mind could find the book Eragon enjoyable. I found it a dull and uninteresting read with nothing I hadn't read in another fantasy book before. Just because the author started writing the book at fifteen is no excuse for his poor writing skills and unoriginal ideas. I warn people not to waste their time reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, why the hype?","review":"Story was okay, just not the best writing. Seemed like a typical fantasy with absolutely no surprises. There are a lot better fantasies out there--try the Book of Three or even Tamora Pierce before this..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"My recommendation for this book: stay away. My 12 year old son is a huge fantasy fan, so I bought this for him after hearing all the hype. He gave it back to me after reading about 100 pages and asked if it was too late to return it for our money back. I figured it couldn't be that bad, so I began reading iti myself. It is. This book is simply poorly written, horribly derivative of quite a few other fantasy titles (I used to read a lot of fantasy to my son when he was younger), and simply not a very good story. I'm glad so many other people seem to like it (although I'm stumped as to what they see in it). I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly overrated","review":"As I read this, I was constantly shocked by the complete lack of originality of the book. It is one thing to be influenced by great fantasy writers, quite another to unabashedly lift ideas from them, as Paolini does. Many of the people praising him do so because they are caught up in the hype of his being a 15-year-old writer. I suggest they read Anne McCaffrey's books to see what a whopping amount of her dragon lore he has borrowed. For the source of his treatment of elves and dwarves, look no further than JRR Tolkien.Bottom line - disappointing for someone who is familiar with his sources, and is evaluating the book on its merits as a work of fantasy, not as 'a-work-of-fantasy-written-by-a-fifteen-year-old'. It might be 'original' for someone who is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took awhile to get into it","review":"First, I have to say that I didn't really like it at the beginning. But once I got about 70 pages into it, I was hooked.There were many parts of the book that I liked. I really liked how there was so much action throughout the entire book, not just at the end. I also loved the part when Eragon was trying to name Saphira and finally figures out she's a female. I like how Eragon and Saphira can communicate through their minds and even become as one mind at times.Of course I'll read the rest of the series! I started the second book, Eldest, but haven't been able to finish it.I am very impressed that the author was so young when he wrote it. I like how he had Eragon's future read because it gives us somethings to look forward to in the following books (like the deep romance & a family member betraying him). At times, it reminded me of The Lord of the Rings series. But I think the author did a good job in creating his own world without \\"stealing\\" too much from Tolkien."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon","review":"My first thought was how close to Lord of the Rings this was. I did enjoy the concept of the story but thought it could have been more original. Eragon (Aragorn?) to close. It was as if I were reading a distortion of LOTR, Dragon Riders of Pern, and Star Wars. I will read Eldest because I adore Saphira. She was what kept me going through it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best book","review":"This book was all very good to start with but then the main character, Eragon, and his dragon go out to kill someone. Thats not what i like. Near the end there is also a lot of fighting. I didnt like that so much. I will still read the second one to see if it gets any better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I recieved this book for Christmas after hearing a lot about it's 19 year old author. I originally thought wow, a nineteen yearold writing fantasy awesome, but then I started reading it. WOW this is a piece of crap. I'm going to assume that Chris has read a lot of fantasy, and because of this has been influenced by the books that he has read to the point that he is lacking any original thoughts at all. The only reason I'm giving this book two stars is because he is 19 and he needs props for getting a book published (even if his family oned the publishing company) when he is so young."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummmmm. . . . . Beautiful Jacket, I guess","review":"Before I begin, I have to give a nod to the author who, after all, is only 19 years old. If any of my students wrote this well, I'd be very impressed. That said, I still don't think young Paolini is anywhere near ready for publishing, and I'm frankly a little confused as to both how and why this book was accepted and marketed so lavishly.The plot line is predictable, the diaglogue trite, and the writing style very clearly that of a beginner. I read to page 200, hoping and hoping that something would happen to justify the glowing reviews featured on the dust cover. Unfortunately, nothing did, and I just can't make myself go on. This book may interest very young teens (although in our post-Harry Potter world, perhaps not), but otherwise, I would caution against wasting either the money or the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"I am almost finished with the first book and can't wait to get to the next book. Can't beleive the auther started at age 15 with this book. Look forward to many years of good reading from Christopher Paolini."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book ever","review":"This was a wonderful book that had all that a person could want in a fantasy book. A dragon and aboy on a great adventure. Best book I have read in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat Lacking","review":"The fact that this author is young does IS amazing, however the literary work is not so impressive. Yes, it is in-depth and has the normal twists and turns of fantasy books, but it lacks the craftsmanship of better writers. I believe this author has not yet acheived the ability to create 'atmosphere' liek many others have been able to. If you are interested in a hard-core fantasy series, Robert Jordan's 'Wheel of Time' is a great one to start in. With over 9 books, its completely comprehensive; the first books being easy enought o read for all people, and the latter ones being rediculously awesome and complex. A must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tolkien, this is not","review":"With Eragon, Christopher Paolini has attempted to write the next great epic fantasy of our time. He's taken all the usual ingredients; dragons, elves, dwarves, evil spirits who can't bear daylight, a fantastical new world, a wise, mysterious guide, and a young boy with a mysterious heritage, and mashed them together into a 500+ page novel. But in the end, Eragon is like so many other Tolkien-esque epic fantasies: all epic, and no magic. The story dragged on, and even when I skimmed whole chapters I couldn't make myself sit all the way through it. I've tried to read it twice now, and I've given up both times.Paolini's prose and plot aren't rotten; they just failed to grab my attention. If you haven't read a lot of epic fantasy, you'll probably like this. But for those of us who have ... this is pretty much a \\"been there, done that,\\" kind of story. There is nothing new under the sun, but most authors can put a twist on the same old devices and make them seem new. Paolini didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"great effort!","review":"Young Mr. Paolini has a bright future as a writer should he decide to take some formal instruction. While he is obviously blessed with a fertile imagination his prose are weak and descriptions need work. I am more surprised at a publisher such as Knopf for editing the work in this fashion and question whether this was a marketing experiment geared at young readers. Nonetheless, it should not be compared to the writing prowess of authors such as Rowlings or Dhal. It is just another episode of a Hercules-like adventure. A lot of fun, but I dare to see him study at college, then read him when he has a greater command of writing. Goodluck."},{"rating":"2","title":"J. Montgomery brings up some good points, but","review":"J. Montgomery, the guy below me, almost below me, or that was below me, brings up some good points. If I grade using his system, cause after all this isn't English class, then Eragon gets 3.75 stars.I read it in a few days. That merits five stars, I suppose, but the lack of suspence and emotion detracted from the fact that I read it quickly. I have only read a handful of books faster, and they are, Harry Potter 5&6 and Hawksong, by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes. They all got five stars from me, but they had something Eragon didn't, and for the moment, I'll call that heart.Thank you for allowing me to bore you...but one more thing. If you grade this book as if in an English class, based on technicallities, then Eragon scrapes two stars...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon was my homework assenment","review":"Eragon was one of the best books I have ever read. It sarted with a farm boy living with his aunt and uncle. One day when Eragon was hunting a wounded deer a smooth rock fell out of the sky and scared the deer but Eragon picked up the smooth rock and brought it home. After a while he went to the traders to see how much the rock could be worth but the trader couldn't tell. Later that night he heard a story about dragon riders and how they would test rocks to see if they were Dragon eggs. To see if it was going to hach that night, Eragon tested the egg and heard a sound, and the rock hached. It was a dragon egg! Eragon raised the egg, but will he keep the secret for very long time, you must find out for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful Read","review":"I love this genre and I found this a very easy, yet delightful read.The novel is well written and crafted in the style of such books as the Pern series etc. I feel, however, it holds it own.It is also admirable that it is written in such a way that a wide audience could read it. I am almost 30 (and female) but thoroughly enjoyed. I also think my younger adults could read this book. There is violence but no over or excessive language or sexuality. In my opinion, depending on your specific child, I could have started this book around a 4th grade level.I am looking forward to the series continuing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"okay","review":"okay this book was... ok. I mean who likes a book that overly describes a freakin sunset and doesnt describe a action scene literally not at all? i mean come on. plus the writing wasnt as good as i was hoping it to be. i think christopher P. needed to wait a while and let his writng improve. the plot isnt that bad but the characters needed more depth. i dont recomend buying"},{"rating":"1","title":"If your ages 0-13 this might be a book for you","review":"First up let me tell you something about myself, I enjoy every book from page start to end. No matter what the book it will always appeal to me. But when the book's over, and I think about it, thats when my actual opinion of the book comes out. The same holds true for Eragon. I loved every page of it. A day after I read it, it seemed like crap! The plot is that of every single fantasy book every written. I know there are small differences, like the fact he rides the dragon around, and that the dragon is a large part of the story, but other then that you could switch the main characters name to Frodo and you'd have Lord of the Rings. I'd suggest this book to anyone from the ages 0-13 it might appeal to you, with your small minds."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with Ivy","review":"Okay. This kid can write. True. But...the incessant versions of things other than said (assured was one that irked me severely) was aggravating. And the story was SOO cliched, it was incredible. I really could barely stand it. It was just a jumble of every fantasy story you've ever read. And I don't think he \\"was inspired by\\" Tolkien. Get it right. He copied him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Confusing Mishmash","review":"Although I do give the author credit for being so young and publishing what must have been quite an undertaking, the end result is still a confusing mishmash of a fantasy story clearly written by a writer before his time. The main character expresses himself in some very illogical ways. Example: He gets \\"angry\\" at the blue stone he finds when it wakes him up one night. (????) If a blue stone was rolling around your bedroom, would your first reaction be anger at REM interruption or general surprise and shock? The rest is more of the same, added to an assembly of skin-deep characters and a propensity for utter, recurring, consistent, on-going, verbose adjective addiction in describing even the simplest thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon this, Eragon that, I don't see the point.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I think its well written. And almost every modern fantasy writer draws on LOTR alot. But they have the advantage of doing it more...subtley.But even that might have been excusable if it had been a bit more interesting with a slight hint of unique style. I also agree with everyone else in that it was predicdtable. But the thing that really annoyed me? The fact that Eragon did not seem real. Even Brom seemed more realistic than the main character. And the way that Paolini kept on dropping BIG hints that Eragon was going to have this romantic love affair. That has really put me off the next book. And I wonder who the lover is going to be? A beautiful elf. My advice is to read Terry Prattchet instead who at least uses characters who seem stereo-typical but really are as unpredictable as you can get."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantastic Fantasy","review":"This is the best book I have ever read; I am 10 years old, so reading a book with over five hundred pages seemed impossible at first. But, once I started reading, I just couldn't stop. It took me 5 weeks to read it, but it was worth it.In this story a farm boy becomes a skilled dragon rider. His teacher's name was Brom and his dragon's name was Sphira.There where at least ten battles and all where exciting.That wraps up my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"*** Check it Out! ***","review":"First this review is threefold...First 1/3 of the book: * to ** starsMiddle 1/3 of the book: *** starsLast 1/3 of the book: **** starsIt did get better despite my frustration with the blane 100 or so pages to start with. I was not going to finish it but I persevered and I was glad I did.It certainly got better!The end was especially good - loved the final battle scene.I am also a writer of fantasy, so i am familiar with this genre.

But it deserved more than my sarcasm in the end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Like many other reviewers said, please ignore the bad reviews and read this awesome book for yourself. This book was recommended to me by a person that didnt like reading as much as I did and I was grabbed by the book and read late into the night, every night, until I was finished. I enjoyed the storyline and how it made me want to read the next book.

It is a well written book told from the point of view of Eragon, the Dragon Rider.

It has waaaay too much dialogue and Paolini doesn't describe the setting or anything enough to picture it in your mind. I've heard many excuses for this book actually being good. Today at school before I wrote this, I told my friend that i was writing a review on Eragon (he has read Eragon and Eldest and loved them). I told him that i hated the book and Paolini copied some names in the books. My friend said, \\"Just because they sound almost the same, it doesn't mean he copied them.\\" Ok here's a little note to Matt(my friend): For one thing there were A LOT of names that Paolini copied.

It's been a long time since I was a teenager. but i like to hear the truth of a situation no matter how unpleasant.i give it a 2 star and probably would get a bit more as a children's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best For Teens","review":"While I agree with some of the responses from the \\"1 star\\" and \\"5 star\\" crowd the reality is that this book was written by a 15 year old and it DOES show in his writing. Nonetheless, younger, less critical readers will find this book rather enjoyable. I know I did when I was 15. Like the Harry Potter series, this is a series you are meant to start young and grow with.The story is interesting without being overly complicated, and the relationship aspects of the story keep the reader empathetic. Sometimes the language is awkward, but I see that as an addition to the tale rather than a detraction. It also makes sense for the main character, who is a young teenager, to be socially awkward when speaking with much older and more mature audiences. All in all this is a coming of age story sheathed in fantasy.Thus I give it 4 stars for \\"I like it\\" because when I was younger I loved the book and now that I am older I see some of the flaws that a mature author perhaps wouldn't make."},{"rating":"2","title":"have been told to read these books for a long time now","review":"my uncle and my cousins are super into these books, i hear they are awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"There are so many other books to read that are fantastic in scope.

The plot is often convenient, predictable, and obviously taken from other books. The ending does not satisfy the reader, and the lack of consistent character development becomes annoying as characters suddenly grow and then revert to earlier behaviors.I have to agree with everyone criticizing the book's writing style. I know the author is just beginning, but he needs several writing courses. His sentences lack variety and the book needs much more attention to editing.As a family published novel, the book is impressive; however, as a work in mainstream publication, the work suffers from a weak tone, bad grammar, and a standard plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Tell Me It Gets Better!","review":"I've not finished this book.

This book is pretty much a cauldron of books thrown together. Not only that, but the descriptions and dialogue are so boring and predictable, you could fall asleep. The main character is also supposed to be bright, but he is surprisingly stupid, and it does not help the story. I am a MAJOR fan of Tolkien and the similarities between that book and Eragon, and Eldest are astounding. I mean, just looking at the map, Furnost, Melian, Hadarac Desert umm I wonder where he got that from? LETS SEE!FORNOST, MELIAN THE MAIA, and HARAD!!! Its apalling at what this guy has written.

I agree with many points made by the other reviewers who were not pleased with Eragon. I might add to those comments that JK Rowling is a good example of an author who, although extremely derivative of all fantasy novels which came before her, weaved these old ideas in a new and fresh and fun way. The characters in Eragon are stock and do not exhibit realistic development. Rather they simply fit right into new and fantastic roles given to them with the greatest of ease (ie: Eragon changing from farm boy to magic-wielding dragon rider in what seems like no time at all). I believe that Mr. Paolino could one day be a very good writer, but he needs to look at the mistakes made, both creatively and dramatically, in this first endeavour."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"THIS IS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ (and I have read a lot of books)!

However, I was severely disappointed when I started reading the book. Sure, the cover's attractive, and sure, the author was a teenager when he wrote it -- the book seems to have become a bestseller on those two factors alone, because it definitely wasn't literary merit that's caused it to sell so well.I anticipated Murtagh's little secret from the moment he was introduced, I found the main character to be bland and boring, and the story was hackneyed and ripped from other writers.

People seem to give Paolini credit because he was a kid when he wrote it. But, he goes up and actually COMPARES his book to the greatness of other fantasy books like Beowulf and LOTR. If he wants to compare his book to books written by competent authors, his readers should grade Eragon with the same strictness. If Tolkien had written this, what would the reviews be? Much lower.

I was enthralled by the imagry of the book and the characters. The second book better come out really soon, because having to put this story off until it comes out is excruciating to me. Same as with the Harry Potter series, I don't want to have to wait three to four years before the next book comes out. When reading those books, I couldn't help but notice the similarities of Harry Potter to The worst witch.

The story smells like he's sprayed the whole thing with Tolkien perfume. All that would be acceptable if the kid could write. Being 18 years old myself, i am in a position to criticize. He doesn't go deeper than the surface on any of his characters or invesitgate their motives from more than one angle. His entire writing style is flat and childish. The words themselves are not intersting to read. As Stephen King said, they call is prose for a reason. People need to stop praising him just becuase he is a nineteen year old. Get real.

I really enjoy this book. If you are looking for a medieval-magic-epic novel then pick this up. You will have a blast reading it. It does have its flaws in some things but overall it is a fun read. A family book that every age can enjoy. If you are looking for a fiction book to read then try this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never trust an editor","review":"This is a great fantasy story. While it does obviously trod upon the well-worn fantasy themes of Tolkien and others, that is not altogether a bad thing. Epic fantasy is a narrow niche to work in as a writer, and there is no better path in which to travel than in that of the master's.Here is some advice for ENJOYING a fantasy story:Don't overthink the book. Don't try to critique it's flaws and inconsistancies. For heaven's sake don't blame the author for using Tolkien's themes and ideas, as Tolkien is the DNA of Fantasy itself, without whom the genre would not exist. Just enjoy the story and allow yourself to be taken to another world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aflight again","review":"I read all the time and this book has made number one on my favorite books list.

Thanks Chris, for you have given me another book to look foward to."},{"rating":"1","title":"He needs an editor . . .","review":". . . not a thesaurus. In the first few pages, I wanted to duck to avoid uninteresting flying adjectives. And you can't use the word \\"stuff\\" in a fantasy novel. And fantasy characters get sick. They do not throw up.I'm excited about the fact that this book was written by a teenager, but I don't think we should ignore the rules of style and usage (and plot) just because he's 19. There are some mature ideas in the book (e.g., Eragon's discovery of his own mortality), and some of the passages obviously thought-out (good description of a battle scene -- not easy to do), but the characters'actions are inexplicable (people show up in places with no explanation of why they are there; characters express strong emotions or sarcasm that has no connection to the content of a conversation) and the language is . . . what a 15 year old thinks a fantasy character would say. In general, the writing is distractingly unsophisticated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"Borrows HEAVILY from other fantasy novels, most notably the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey. Nothing original, but still entertaining. I enjoyed the book, but I don't feel it deserves all the credit and publicity it has been getting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good freshman start","review":"This is a good book for a first attempt. I enjoyed the overall story and hope the other books get better. Nothing is really original, but it was a nice spin on the arch-types. Chris uses a LOT of flowery language, but if you look at his website that appears to be the way he talks. I was mentally distressed at his description of the village ravaged by Urgals near the beginning involving a spear in a heap. When you read it, be prepared! The battle scene in the end is a bit silly, the \\"dragon armor\\" doesn't make much sense and the ending is abrupt. It is clear that he wanted this to be a much longer story, but cut it short and turned it into a trilogy. Or maybe for the economic reasons, he envisioned it as a trilogy from the beginning. In any case, the book does not live up to the hype and do not believe for a second it is in the same class as Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ BOOK","review":"I thought that Eragon was a very intriguing book. There was a lot of fantasy, adventure and mystery. The book was amazing for someone only fifteen years old to write.Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a blue stone in a forest called the Spine. The stone turns out to be a dragon egg. After the dragon hatches from the egg, Eragon secretly raises it. Eragon names the dragon Saphira. One day, the dragon goes crazy and takes Eragon deep into the Spine. When Eragon and the dragon return to their home, they find that it has been burnt down. Eragon's Uncle Garrow is found dead in the rumble. Eragon and Saphira set out in search of the people responsible for this tragedy.The plot makes you want to keep reading until the end of the book. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in science fiction and fantasy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounds familiar, but good","review":"Imagine a story of an orphaned boy on the cusp of manhood whose scar tells him of a magical destiny that awaits him. Sound familiar? Or what about an ongoing struggle against an evil empire led by an elderly sorcerer as a guide and assisted by a remarkable fighting human, a bearded dwarf who uses an ax, and an elf who is an archer. Ring any bells? All right, before you Eragon disciples lash out, I did like this book. I just couldn't help drawing the obvious parallels to Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I suppose Paolini didn't intend the similarities, but even the language he uses sounds so much like what I heard in the LOTR trilogy. The author is obviously brilliant and he tells a good story. And, I suppose one should expect some similarites among all fantasy creature tales. So that's why I still give it 4 stars and say, \\"Good job\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely book","review":"This was a lovely read for me. I like fantasy very much. It was a fairly easy read and very enjoyable. I do agree that it wasn't entirely original as I would have liked. I kept being reminded of Tolkien like the other readers have commented, the elves characteristics are the same, as are the dwarfs and many other things written in the book. Also, does anyone but me kind of feel a little bit of a starwars theme here? riders - jedi, evil empire - evil empire, old, powerful evil king - old, powerful evil emperor, ect. lol. But all the same, who cares. Artist and writers are always inspirated and have used the same flavor from other artist and writers for years. At least the author of ERAGON used the ideas with taste. And even though there is a lot of familiarity in his books, there is also much of his own ideas and style that are very different. I can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hear Ye! Hear Ye! This Book has Copied Star Wars","review":"I am for one an avid writter about dragons myself but when I got Eragon at the bookstore and took it home I was almost puking from reading it, my eyeballs hurt so bad they almost melted out of my head. This book clearly copies the beginning plots to the movie Star Wars character by character, heres an example.Eragon/Luke SkywalkerBrom/Obi WanEragons Sword (was his fathers sword) Lukes Lightsaber (his fathers lightsaber)Eragon lives on a farm/Luke lives on a farmEragons Farm Burns/Lukes farm burns (attacked)Eragon saves this elf princess. LUKE SAVES PRINCESS LEIA!In my opinion the book is nothing more than a rip-off of what came before it, Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.

It's a far cry from unique, set in a fantasy world like most others. While I was interested enough to find out what happens next, the plot was never really remarkable. Plot \\"twists\\" are encountered with a slight nod. The psychology behind the characters is loose and some developments are sketchy (a woman on one side of the world conveniently appears on the other side of the world, and got there before Eragon, though it took him a week). And the ending...wait...that's the ending? I am reminded of my early efforts with managing long plots. I had the beginnings down, but the ends rushed to an impatient resolution. I think this book is 90% hype, and I'm not impressed that he started writing when he was 15. So did I, and while my 500-pages of amateur effort commit many of the same sins as Paolini's published work, it's a better read, and unpublished (thank god!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but I couldn't turn off my intelligence...","review":"...because according to some reviewers, that's what I need to do to enjoy Eragon. Stop overanalyzing and enjoy the story, right? I could do that if the poor writing weren't so obvious. That way, I wouldn't be distracted by thinking \\"oh, that's so cliche\\" or \\"that's really predictable\\" or \\"every character talks and acts the same way\\".

I would accomadate for his flaws and agree with the five star people had he not said on his site, \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" Obviously, the publicity of this book has bloated his ego, because his writing is nowhere near that of the aformentioned authors. I can only hope that you will not fuel his vanity and purchase a copy of Eragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever read.","review":"Don't waste your time. As predictable and trite as most fantasy is nowadays, Eragon is the epitome of it. It has every fantasy cliche in existence and contains absolute NO original material whatsoever. It is a frankenstein of a book, with an arm from Tokien and a torso from Goodkind. All he did was tape it all together. If you've read ANY fantasy book before, you know exactly what will happen, just replace the names with other ones. Its the most unoriginal piece of crap I have ever seen. The only reason it was published was because his parents owned a publishing company and having a kid author is a great marketing angle. If anybody else had written that book, they would have been laughed into the street."},{"rating":"1","title":"AS ORIGINAL AS HELEN KELLER JOKES","review":"Eragon isn't so much an original novel as a compilation of bad fantasy cliches. The author has somehow managed to incorporate every single one of these into the space of a mere few hundred pages, from placing apostraphes in the middle of proper nouns (how exotic!!) to big firebreathing dragons, swords with MAGICAL DARK POWERS, and zombies bent on killing everything that moves. And this ugly amalgam is laudable because the author is 18? Give me a break. To make an analogy, if you took Brad Pitt's face, gave it Johnny Depp's ears, added Jackie Chan's chin, and finally appended Denzel Washington's nose, would the result be worth looking at?The only thing more depressing than this book is the fact that so many people imbibe this garbage with such voraciousness - indeed, at the time that I visit this page, Eragon is 279th on the Amazon.com sales list.

Cliches! Useless descriptions of /lamps/! An 'ancient language' that sounds like a dying furby!

I'm halfway through the story and have already lost interest. This is just my opinion and I don't mean to be harsh, but I feel that if I were to take transcripts of \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and \\"Star Wars\\" and shuffle them both together, I'd get \\"Eragon\\". I do believe that with proper schooling, this young author will have a bright career and I hope he'll consider a re-write of this novel. I'm sure that I would have enjoyed this attempt more if the characters spoke in traditional old-english OR new-modern dialect, as I found that blending the speaking styles was distracting. I also would have preferred less repetitive conversation and more action. The first 2 chapters were good, but after that became tedious.

Sure, I'll admit it had some exciting parts in it, sort of, but overall I do not beleive this is anything special.

Many will claim that this book is a ripoff of this or that, but really most fiction is a ripoff of something else. The key is can the writer pull it off. I think in this case the writer did pull it off, and at the age of 15 did it a lot better than most adult fantasy writers have attempted. Really I think most of the negative reviews are from those who are jealous of what this writer has done at such a young age. If this were my son I would be very proud of him, as would most of his critics if they were being honest with themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of art!!!!!!!","review":"This book is like a vaccum... it sucks you in for hours on end. Though its long, the storyline is perfect for anyone who loves fantasy.When Eragon finds a stone in a infamous mountain range, he hopes it would rake in a pretty penny. Unfortunatly for Eragon, no one would buy the stone and his hopes of buying food for the winter evaporate. When a group of henchmen for a tyranncial ruler set out to take what Eragon knows nothing about, Eragon's world is shattered. Only with the help of a mysterious old man, a mythical beast and unknown powers can he dethrone a traitor and restore peace to Alageasia...This book is a MUST read for anyone who is even moderatly interested in fantasy.

It's a good bet that most if not all of the Previous reviewers, who are giving a poor review of \\"Eragon\\", strange as it may seem, haven't any published books. However Chris Paolini, has. And rightly so. Is there is an artist, musician or writer who has not been inspired by others? What is often hailed as fresh is usually code for ....well, something unreadable. While Paolini's inexperience is apparent in some places it was impressive overall. Comparing to (or accused of stealing from) Tolkien/Mcaffery/Jordan/Rowling is unfair, setting the bar way too high.

The author cannot stage a dramatic exchange of dialog.Gah."},{"rating":"1","title":"holy crap","review":"This is one of the worst books i have ever read. I know the author is young(i'm still younger than him tho, but my god, the writing in this novel is disgusting. I almost threw up reading it, i seriously did. Maybe it's just because i'm used to the writings of Tolkien and George R.R. Martin, but this guy really needs to learn how to write. Hopefully he'll get better and at least become as competant as Robert Jordan, but that still isn't anything to brag about."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO NO NO","review":"Eragon is the worse book I ever read. It just a stupid awful book with no point. Read anything else!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"unoriginal","review":"Hmm, this is going to be a short review because there really isn't much to say and everyone else has already said it. If you want a more childish adventurous fantasy book then this is great. Its got all the archetypical plotlines, characters, magics, and creatures you could ever want. It just has a story that is fun to read, nothing more and therefore it gets no more than two stars. I can't believe at how popular this is and that it already has a movie, kinda sad. To unoriginal. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, but a fun read anyway","review":"\\"Derivative\\" is an understatement. Almost every element of this book was taken from someplace else. The setting is Middle Earth, even down to the different varieties of orc (err...urgal). The description of magic is from Earthsea. Much of the plot is Star Wars, from the destruction of Luke's uncle's farm to the apprenticeship with Obi-wan (err....Brom), but then reverts to Middle Earth (the seige of Gondor and the killing of the Lord of the Nazgul) at the end. And of course, the dragons and dragon-riders are straight from Pern.The descriptions are unbelievably overdone, from the \\"it was a dark and stormy night\\" school of literature.But despite all these faults, it was a fun read! My kids loved it, and I picked it up on a day that I was home sick and couldn't put it down. I got to know and like the characters, and I'm looking forward to reading Book 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throughly Disapointing","review":"While the first chapter clearly showed possibility, the rest of the book seems rushed - as if, having got his great idea, he didn't know where to go with it and shuffled together bits of every great fantasy book ever written. The title, even, is vertually indistinguishable from Aragorn of Lord of the Rings fame.Perhaps, if he'd spent more time thinking and ploting out the book, it would've been beter. Until that rewrite, however, avid readers of the genre should stick away for fear of disapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"HI!","review":"Lessee here, there's a big blue book. *read read read* Hmm, it has star wars, lotr, and even Dragon's Blood rip-offs!!!!

Chances are if you like fantasy literature you've already read this book--under a different title, written by a different author. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"copycat","review":"I read the first chapter and was not impressed. I think he copied J.R.R. Tolkien. Instead of orcs, he has Urgals. He even copied Arwen! The magic is too easy to cast and it works every time. The languages are inconsistent and sound like a caveman trying to talk. You should read Tolkien's books. They are waaaaaaay better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost 80 and loved it","review":"My 13-year-old granddaughter recommended the book and I'm glad she did. Yes - there are literary flaws - but I loved the story and couldn't put it down. Perhaps my second childhood, say you? Whatever - for me, this book fired my imagination and gave me hours of pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh.","review":"If you've read any fantasy at all, this book will put you to sleep.

How disappointed was I. This is, without an ounce of doubt, the most poorly written book I have ever regrettably paid money for. Shoddy characters, a splotchy story, and an over all plot that seems to pull from other fantasy writers that are much, much better than he is. Honestly, I cannot believe how many mistakes he made while writing his story. I just wanted to take a red pen and scribble out whole pieces of useless details.If you want to read an adolescent fantasy novel, go read The Golden Compass, or a Wrinkle in Time. Don't even bother touching trash like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Been there, done that","review":"I picked this book up and half way through it felt like I had read it before. After I found out it was written by a teenager I was no longer suprised by the poor dialogue. It felt very predicatable based on books I have already read. It was like Star Wars meets Lord of the Rings. I wont bother with the second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen material all the way through","review":"This whole book is nothing but a rip off of some of the best fantasy writers out there. It's a Starwars/LOTR/Belgarion/Elenium/Dragon Riders/ and about 15 others copy. Not only that but the texts itself is so poorly worded and done I barely made it throught the first chapter. The only reason I finished this book was so I could find out just how much stolen material this book contains. Well...I'm surprised it got published at all considering how poorly its written and how much of the context is ripped off other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it...why don't other people love it?","review":"I personally loved Eragon. I saw it and decided to get it, just to see what happened, AND I am a dragon maniac, so I couldn't resist! I knew I'd like it the second I started reading it. I couldn't seem to put it down when I started (then again, it happens all the time), and when I reached the finish, I was amazed at the world Paolini created. It's quite a notch above other books I've seen, and it's on a par with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series, which is my fave by far, next to Eragon.Why people put this book down is beyond me; maybe they don't appreciate how good this book is. Anyway, I'd suggest Eragon to any reader, or, if you're older, the Dragonriders of Pern series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but copied, and predictable story","review":"When i firstly glanced over the book I've already checked out it will be a Lord of the Rings copy. The map with the semi-known names, the language of the dwarves, etc. Then I started to read. The story itself was intresting (I like fantasy so I like this kind of story...), but usually very plain and predictable. Who hadn't know that Eragon will go for a long and lifechanging journey, he will save the elf and fall in love into her slowly, Brom is well-known in the far lands, Murtagh is the son of a great evil Rider, etc.Maybe if Paolini would create some own thing, he could be good writer...Now he remains fine fan-fiction writer, they use to write copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A reader who loves dragon books","review":"This book was the best book that I have ever read.

I commented to a friend after reading it that he should avoid it as it reads like it was written by a teenage kid, only then did I find out that it actually was. This book did not deserve my hard earned money and I am annoyed at all the praise it received which seems more aimed at the authors age than the actually quality of the book. I didn't get a discount for his age so he should not be getting kind praise for this trash merely for his age."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. TRULY terrible.","review":"Are all you people giving this book a five star review drunk, 11 years old or just stupid? This books is terrible. It's a cookie-cutter rehash of about a trillion other pulp fantasy novels that have been written over the last 20 years, and it's not even a very good one. Half the reviews I see trumpet how this was written by a teenager---I'd argue that's blindingly obvious, and perhaps the publisher should have kept that under wraps. This books is a disgrace. I wouldn't wipe my @$$ with it...All you kiddies writing in with 5 star reviews should go back to your D+D and Magic games and leave book reviewing to people who can actually drive cars.

That is why I said pre-teens will like this book. Even though it swears it was recommended to me by a friend and she is a total bookworm(so am i) plus she has good taste so i had to read it.

It left me lukewarm towards the characters, not really caring whether they lived or died. The plot was slow and predictable, with parts taken almost directly from other popular pieces of liturature.

It had all the classic qualities of the Lord of the Rings, without the same story. The evil characters in the book were convincing, and the fight scene's were great.

Paolini does not copy Tolkien's writing excessively, though, but Robert Jordan of the Wheel of Time. The similarities are unmistakable. Example: the mountain range called the Spine, similar to the exact same mountain range above and beyond coincidence. It's useless to point them all out. To Paolini's credit, though, while writing a pretty traditional fantasy book, he somehow manages to keep you reading. Read this book if you are looking for a nice story that will keep you immersed until you sadly reach the end. It is sitting infront of me right now, and I need to stop writing this review so I can enjoy it. In my mind, Paolini's book is very much worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Tolkienesque fantasy.","review":"I've been trying to find some rich, detailed fantasy lately. You know, with a good amount of magic, dwarves,elves, and dragons.This one, was wonderful. It was superbly original, taking the whole good and evil thing to a different step.On the other hand, it was wonderful that he added in dwarves and elves as well.Paolini has an excellent way of doing magic.He goes in the tradition of Terry Brooks, yet actually has spell names.Eragon , a young, unsuspecting boy, like most heroes, finds a sapphire while he's hunting on the plains. When he returns home,it hatches into a dragon.Then , the action picks up.His uncle is savagely attacked by the Ra'zac,Eragon goes to seek revenge, and also learns that he, Eragon, is destined to be the next Dragon Rider.Buy it.You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exciting story","review":"This book is the best book i have ever head. I couldn't put it down and I was sad when I finished but happy the second book of the Inheritaqnce Trilogy, Eldest, will be out soon.Eragon, is the main character of this story. He has a big heart and always thinks of others before himself. He becomes a dragon rider after he finds Saphira's egg. Saphira is the other main character of the story she is a dragon that was hatched after Eragon found her egg. She has a strong sense of humor. Eragon wanted to avenge his uncles death. While hunting down the killers he gets in a mess withh the empire too.I would highly recomend this book to any fantasy/adventure fan twelve and older. This ais a great book for anyone who injoyed The Lord Of The Ring Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Um actually, Eng's right","review":"Eragon does suck and Dragons: Lexicon Triumvirate is much better.

However, the imagination and originality of Eragon is lacking. It seems as if the plot is derived from a mixture of a number of past fantasy novels. Overall, the plot contains trite ideas and themes. Character development, and especially emotional development, are areas that are weak. It is a fairly good book, especially for younger readers, but there is not much substance and originality to make it memorable for older readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with B.

My 12-year-old son loved it, and that is to be expected. But where was Paolini's editor? For my part, I felt like the work jerked me back-and-forth, as the author would run deep for a bit, then shallow, then back and forth. While I enjoyed the story as a reflection -- as Capossere points out -- of greater fantasy writers, with some tighter editing, this could have been even better.Still, hurrah for Paolini for self-publishing and believing in his work enough to see it through! I'll look forward to reading his works in 10 years or so ...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon - BEST BOOK EVER","review":"I reccomend this book to all young adult readers.

This book took me about a month to read B/C it had a lot of unnecessary detail and probably could have been written much better in about 300 pages. I'm not surprised that lots of other kids like this book, it was sorta fun and exciting (key word: sorta). The other main reason I didn't enjoy this book was because so much of it was copied from LOTR, which I read also. I don't think Christopher Paolini meant to copy certain parts of the book, but that's not really much of an excuse.

Eragon's decisions will change the fate of his Kingdom.Eragon was amazing, though hard to get into in the first two chapters, ended up unfolding into the most amazing world of action, betrayals, friendships, and life defining decisions. Eragon's Allegaisia was not difficult to understand or too complicated to follow. Christopher's writing style is easily understood, and very engrossing.

A lot of reviewers have dissed Paolini becuase supposedly his parents \\"owned their own publishing company.\\" Well that is FALSE. His parents self published some books of their own, and they helped him self publish Eragon, but the key here is SELF-PUBLISHED. While I don't personally like the book (too cliche for me) I have to give him a hand for how he marketed it. Paolini did it the good old American way by publishing the book himself and then fighting tooth and nail to get people to buy it, by traveling the country, giving his own lectures in libraries and schools, and trying to sell it himself in bookstores. To make a long story short, he worked hard to get Eragon picked up by a traditional publishing company, so whether you liked the book or not, stop giving him a hard time for something that is not accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I expecting too much?

Two of the parts didn't make any sense. But still, everyone shouldn't be pointing ou every single mistake. After all, the author was only fifteen when he wrote ERAGON.The book is about a fifteen-year-old boy named Eragon who finds a mysterious blue stone in a mountain range called \\"The Spine\\".

He makes many friends & enemies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ergaon...uh oh","review":"Christoper Paolini graduated from high school at the age of 15 and in my opinion he should have waited a good deal longer to write Eragon. See, Eragon is not that bad of a idea just poorly executed. The writing falls flat on all facets and in my opinion cant compete with the likes of Robert Jordan, CS Lewis, and even JK Rowling. Considering how many people dislike his book I would not be suprised to find his next book, Eldest to be a real jaw dropper. Critiscm only makes you stronger and Paolini is gonna need alot of it to succeed in this biz. All told Eragon is Poor, unorginal with flat bordering on boring writing. If your new to the genre or 14 and younger I could reccomend it (but I wont). Bottom Line: Wait and see how Eldest is before you try Eragon."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING READ","review":"The book Eragon by Christopher Paolini is a beautifuly written story of action, fantasy and the coming of age. Its descriptive pages will have you glued to it for hours on end. Its story of a young boy and his dragon fighting evil at all costs will captivate readers of all ages. Mr. Paolini will quickley join the ranks of such fantasy authors as Tolkien and Lewis. This tale takes us from our world to that of the fantastic Alagaesia a land of wonder and of the extraordinary. Forever will this book reside as one of my favorite literary works. I cannot begin to express my eagerness to read the next two books in this sure to be monumental trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I agree with Dragon Quill","review":"Dragon Quill's the person that's like seven reviews below me. He targeted my views exactly. Eragon's not the best book, but if you have kids then get this book for them. Its awesome, and I'll tell you why...i suppose,Its fast paced and you keep turning the pages, wondering what happened next.Its kind of funny in some parts, especially Angela, who's the best character, though that maybe because she's based off of Paolini's sister...but it doesn't matter. authors take inspiration from real life all over the place......If you read deep, 'hard-core' fantasy and stick to it, this is not the book for you. Even for a young adult book, its only about medium deep to how much depth it could really have. To an adult book, its not deep at all, just a light rread to pass the time between sequels coming out.Check out Dragon Quill's review, its awesome......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cross between Lord/Rings and H.Potter...","review":"Excellent read, cant wait for the next one.

You can basically cross out the character names from synopses of those and replace them with the character names from Eragon. The story line is classic, but this book doesn't even bring any interesting twists to it.The characters are archetypes, with no personality quirks that would have made them actually interesting.If the author was given an assignment to write a book based on this classic story type, this would have been an admirable response. As it is, it's mind-numbingly boring.

Hope the next ones in the series keep to be this good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long winded any one","review":"When I was a little kid, I started and read this book, and I found it quite good, then I read decent fantasy novels. This book is so immensity long winded that if you cut it down to important details, it would have been maybe thirty pages. In addition to having a paper thin plot that anyone could guess the \\"twists\\" the author blatantly rips off other authors and works as opposed to creating his own ideas. The ancient language is Latin and dwarves speak german! Urgales are simply orcs. All of the characters are shallow and make nothing but one terrible decision after another. Also, the magic users in this book are super weak and whinny \\"oh, I can't heal him easily, it a paper cut, better draw on my magic reserves!\\" seriously, this book is nearly as bad as Harry Potter. Don't waste your time on this book if you can read above a third grade level."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good read","review":"Eragon was a very good story and I will definitely read part two when it comes out. I think that it is great that a sixteen year old wrote this but don't consider it children's fiction. It was a little too violent for kids. You can tell that he is a big fan of Tolkien and I like stories in that vein too. It is not as much of a Lord of the Rings rip off as say Sword of Shannara but there are similarities in his world and Tolkien's. I do like the relationship between the boy and the dragon. It is a great concept. I do hope that Christopher Paolini isn't too busy promoting Eragon that he hasn't started part two!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as Harry Potter","review":"I love Harry Potter Books and a lot more other teen novels such as the Bronze Bow.

This was said to be as good as harry potter but I think it is very poor work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Contagious Read","review":"If anything, this book could easily be described as impressive.

Many of them are in fact \\"young adults\\". I'm sixteen and I know a crappy, cliched book when I see it.Second, Paolini obviously didn't mean for Eragon to be as immature as you think it is. His own website shows his pretentiousness in quotes like \\"I strive for a lyrical beauty somewhere between Tolkien at his best and Seamus Heaney's translation of Beowulf.\\" He's comparing his own work to established classics, so why shouldn't we do the same? Face it. Eragon's not a decent children's book.

I finally got enough time to read the book. It took only one paragraph to get me hooked with the intricate details in which this story is told and the imaginative words created by the author and the creative plot line that gives twists that are desperatly needed for the dreary tv land that we now live in.

As a small child, I often lost myself in strange and enchanting worlds created by Lewis, MacDonald, L'Engle, and even the grandfather of fantasy himself, Tolkien. There was something magical about those stories that revealed the great wonder of adventure, and a sense of awe at the mysterious and unknown aspects of life. In Eragon, Mr. Paolini demonstrates the same ability to pull his reader in by weaving together a most thorough and captivating plot. All the classic elements of a fantasy are included: mystery, adventure, magic, swordsmanship, and a little romance. All this together, without adding too many extraneous details, results in a very grand adventure. Congratulations to Mr. Paolini on such a fine story; I am very anxious to read his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"You can tell this book was written by a kid. I've found it very dull reading, and can't imagine why it's sold so many copies. Maybe it's the novelty of it having been written by a home-schooled kid, because it certainly isn't the gripping narrative. Nothing happens in this book for pages and pages. And the emotions that Eragon expresses; well, as I said, you can tell it was written by a kid because there's just no sophistication to the language or story telling. You'd be better off reading the Artemis Fowl series (fun and funny), of if you're older, the His Dark Materials series (sophisticated and thoughtprovoking)."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"Christopher is trying to create an elabrate world of destiny, magic, and dragons, the cover and introduction looked cool but the text was the corniest thing ever! cornier than any sitcom i've ever seen!!! i mean it had unneccasary chapters and stupid magic, no offense chris i appreciate the effort.

The author didn't have to do very much description of his fantasy world because all the players were \\"borrowed\\" from other authors' worlds --- especially Tolkien's. Paolini didn't have to explain the relationship between elves & humans & dwarves, since Tolkien fans already know all that. Fine; it's fan-fiction. But I was very disappointed that Paolini didn't give Tolkien a mention in his Acknowledgements section.Paolini even tried to mimic LotR by including some \\"translated\\" elvish poetry. That was by far the most embarrassing part of this book. Prose was stilted (really needed some professional editing), but the poetry was just . . . awful. Glad it was only attempted once.Despite the book's flaws, I did enjoy the story line, and did read the book all the way through. I may even borrow a copy of \\"The Eldest\\" when it comes out. But I would not pay money for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.

I must say, it was an amazing, fantasitico, excellente, fantasy. It is not at all cookie cutter, as many of you say, but I found that this book is full of amazing characters, plots, twists, and concepts. This is one of the first book sI have ever read that introduced a new type of createure besides the usual ogre, giants, and witches. Saphira has a great personality and helps Eragon along in the best way possible. Though Eragon felt a little ddistant to me, he is not a very complex character that I think Paolini needs to work on. Other than that, a wonderful fantasy for all fantasy people. Other people, just hush your mouths before you write. I have seen people tell every single fantasy book that it is predictable and 'cookie cutter'. I ask you this, then what is an 'original' fantasy? Is Harry POtter and LOTR a common fantasy too?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Made the flu a bareable experience.","review":"I ended up with a bad case of the flu over my winter break and, much to my mother's delight, spent more of my time ensconced on our sofa reading instead of watching tv.

The characters are fantastic,it's a little complicated, but once you read the first couple of chapters you will be hooked.Usually dragons might be portrayed as evil, or very much so fantasy and childish, but this book is nothing like that. There is evil in it but what book nowadays doesn't have evil in it? The character Eragon and the dragon Saphira are fantastic and Christopher Paolini created them wonderfully.

What the boy finds resembles a rock, but is a dragon egg. The egg hatches and helps its new owner to make his way to the varden to start his long training with the elves. But first he has to dodge many obstacles to get to the varden with the evil Durza on his tail.The characters in this story are pretty good because I can relate them to my life. My favorite character is Brom he tries to keep something a secret up until his death. My second favorite character is Murtagh because he is good with a bow.I like this book for two reasons. One reason is because the whole purpose is to entertain. Two, I like the unusual characters. I recommend this book to anybody who likes magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good enough for light reading...plot was copied","review":"I enjoyed the book as a good lite read.

After reading the first page, one can guess immediately that it was not written by an adult. Some may argue that it's very good for the writing of a teenager, but I must disagree. Every idea is a cliche. Every creature is noticeably familiar. Every event is predictable. The character development, though present, seemed very forced, as did most other aspects of the novel. I quickly became weary of the overdone descriptions and awkward dialogue and phrases. The standard elementary school rules of \\"show, don't tell\\" are violated all too often. Worst of all, Mr. Paolini didn't make me \\"care\\" about the characters, so the plot itself was worthless to me. Even as an avid reader, I honestly had to push myself to finish reading this. I advise you to save yourself the time and boredom--don't bother reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"His age is no excuse...","review":"To be honest, criticisms of this book have already been voiced a hundred times before, and better than I could say. Derivative, unashamedly cliched and dull...sadly, it's all true. But one thing that keeps popping is the author's age. The fact is that blaming the poor quality of the writing on his youth is a bit of a cop out. If you can write well, you can write well no matter how old you are. Sure, you improve as you go along, but a novice writer who starts at the age of 30 can be just as bad as a novice who starts at 13.

With that in mind, I began reading yesterday.I doubt I will be able to finish it, though I have given it the great attempt.The plot is derivative, the characters have major mood swings and little continuity of characterization. The emotions are over the top - screaming because of minor slights, then back to normal within the same paragraph. The overuse of adjectives and descriptive tags is annoying.Sigh.Yes, it's impressive that a teenager wrote a large tome. It shouldn't have been published without major editing.

I don't see their books on the bestseller list!This book, I would also like to mention, is considered to be a young adult level book, so if you are an adult and believe that the ideas are childish, understand that it wasn't made for your reading level anyway. So don't blame the author. It's kind of like a thirteen year old reading the Berstein Bears. It doesn't make much sense.It is a good book that deserves much praise, no matter how old the author is.

Learning to use a sword in 3 days? How bout a new language! No problem. Important things that should take weeks and months are explained in one sentence, while breaking a limb in a stupid moment takes 3 pages.All of the cliches are here.

I couldn't connect with the hero of the story at all, and...well, I couldn't really connect with any of the characters. I don't want to sound rude, but the author himself seems a bit egocentric....If he wants to create the next 'big' fantasy series, then he could at least come up with some original ideas.

This shows. The writing style is immature, and the tone is inconsistant. At one point, he will speak in almost medieval syntax, in the tone of a story of knights and dragons, and in the next, in the tone of a fifteen year old boy speaking with his friends. In addition, the main character bears a remarkable to the author, and the novel frequently refers to how close he is to 'manhood'. His references to women are frequently demeaning. This is a teenage boy's published daydreams of heroism and beautiful women indebted to him, because he will never achieve what he writes. It is not epic or grand or even uniqe.

The other reviewer's sum it up nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"Awful doesn't begin to cover it. An avid reader, I've read 80 books already this year. I've been a fantasy reader for 40 years, and I've read almost every fantasy book ever written. I can't believe I was suckered into buying this by the glowing reviews. Originally this was self-published, and there's a reason for it. \\"Eragon\\" is the worst book ever written, even if you count \\"Eldest\\" which brings fantasy to a new low. This book is filled with awkword phrases, bad dialogue, and muddled plots. Why in the world anyone would write a review of this book I don't know. It's really that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I think the author should have invested more time in creative writing and life experience before writing this book (jacket indicates he was 15 when he started the novel). For me, it came down to this, there was no passion, no emotion, no complexity and character development. It read like a \\"What I did on my summer vacation\\" essay. I read it for book club, and only finished it for the ammunition to debate with the other members. Pass on this for more celebrated novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover Art Is Nice","review":"This book is just not very original. In fact, after reading it, I got so hungry for the dragons of Pern that I am rereading that whole series (and all the offshoots). Don't bother with Eragon. Read Anne McCaffrey's Dragons of Pern series and Tolkien's Lord of the Rings instead; both of these series are far, far more intriguing and imaginative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"Eragon is a wonderful book by Christopher Paolini. It is about a boy, Eragon, who finds a dragon egg and their destiny is to be together. Fate matches the dragon, Saphira. Together they join a rebellion against the evil king. This book is filled with adventure, magic, and fighting. It is also with mystical creatures. I have read that the author is coming out with two more books. I would definitely recommened this book and I am looking forward to the next two. Readers ten and up will find this easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written....","review":"This book is very well written, and very interesting, until you discover one thing: it's exactly the same as Star Wars. The plot is the same, characters have the same roles.

If you want to read good writing rather than a gimmick, try another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite Read!","review":"Eragon has undoubtedly snagged some of its main concepts from other books, but how is that stopping this book from being one of the best?Hunting in the Spine one day, Eragon stumbles upon a blue stone. Thinking nothing of it, he snatches the 'stone' up and attempts to haggle it off to Sloan, the town butcher, for meat. Unsuccesful at his attempts to haggle the 'stone' off, Eragon proceeds home. Arriving home, Eragon places the jewel on his shelf and thinks nothing of it...that is until the next morning. To his amazement, the stone \\"hatches\\" into a dragon.This is just the beginning in an action adventure plot based in magic-filled land. Eragon soon finds himself being fought over by the major powers (The Varden and the Empire).This is another great book that I would highly reccommend to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Captivated","review":"I loved the book and could not put it down. I am an Adult and the characters and story held me captive till I finished reading it. I had to go on to Book 2 and also finished that as well and anxiously await the third book's release. I am not a professional critic and I read some of the other reviews. All I can say is that both my husband and myself found this book very entertaining and will continue to read this saga. The Author did an excellent job for one so young and I have nothing bad to say at all. I give it 5 stars !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon: A Book of Adventure!","review":"I think this book is very interesting. It has mush to do with Dragons and such that you would fined in The Lord of the Rings. It starts with a 15 year old farm boy who finds a dragon egg on a hunt in the Spine. After much investigation of the so called stone it Hatched to reveal a dragon. After the Raz'ac Kill his Uncle and destroy his house he sets out on an adventure to catch them with a story teller Brom and his Dragon Saphira. The rest is in the Book Eragon, The First book of the Inheritence."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book.","review":"I am constantly amazed by those in the world who believe that everything has to be new and controversial. I love fantasy series and have read all of Tolkein, Brooks, McKiernan, and even Jordan (end the series Robert!!). I read the books because they are entertaining. Do I know what is going to happen? Yes. Is there going to be a completely new twist on the idea? Probably not in this genre, although the Runelords (David Farland) and Witch series (James Clemens) come close. It's rare.This book has a hero, villain, troubling times, and a noble goal of protecting the helpless. The fate of the world relies on the shoulders of a reluctant hero. What else do you want? It is written well. You can read it easily and although there are a lot of characters, it is easy to keep track of them.For people who are looking for an enjoyable read, pick this up. For people who are looking for an Earth-shattering revelation into the fantasy world, get a life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This book is just bad. If you are an eleven year old kid who's never experienced what true fantasy literature has to offer, I highly recommend it.

What a disappointment. It just goes to show that you need more than the stereotypical \`hero quest' parts to make a good story. This story is so obviously borrowed from the works of other writers (and movie-makers) before it; the author could not even come up with new creatures - instead falling back on dragons and elves. *Yawn* Frankly, I was not impressed with the writing, either. If I have to read a sentence three times before it makes sense, forget it. I couldn't even finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"characters","review":"The biggest problem in this book (though not the only one) are the characters.

It is about a boy who is 15 and a his dragon Saphira. It is great and very exciting. A must read book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"I bought this book after hearing all the buzz about it. Being a huge fantasy fan, I was really excited to read it. Imagine my surpirise when I realized how much this author had ripped off some of my favorite fantasy authors including J.R.R. Tolkien, and Ursula Le Guin. He had borrowed so much material that I am surprised he was not sued for copyright infringement. The book was extremey slow moving with just a few interesting moments. I would not recommend this book. Instead I would recommend Harry Potter, Chronicles of Narnia, Hobbit, Lord of the Rings, Wizard of Earthsea."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Game of Give and Take","review":"Eragon in my opinion is not as good as Eldest ( the second book in the trilogy). However to understand Eldest you have to read Eragon. It's a game of give and take.Eragon is a story about a Dragon Rider. Eragon has just found a dragon egg and has to flee or risk being arrested by the empire. Dragon Riders have unbeleivable amounts of Magic in them and are extremely powerful. Eragon now has the power to take down the Empire that rules his country and is corrupt. The Empire Killed many people and has sent many creatures into hiding. However will Eragon survive long enough to take down the empire and free his country. It is still unknown."},{"rating":"1","title":"A reader from High Ridge, MO","review":"I picked up a copy of \\"Eragon\\" after it received so much favorable press because it was written by some 19 year oldwunderkind, but I have to tell you: it's a clunker. I mean, it's a great effort for someone his age, but I found myself constantly thinking, \\"This isn't bad.....for a 15 year old.\\" I finally gave up after reading almost 100 pages. The writing is highly derivative and the characters are not well realized, but it's a story that a 10 or 12 year old might enjoy. I was irritated by cutesy affectations such as his referring at one point to a dragon named \\"Bid'Daum.\\" Anyone read \\"Dune\\" lately, and recognize that as Muad'Dib spelled backwards? I do not appreciate that kind of distraction when I'm reading, and I kept wondering what other references I might be missing. The author shows a great deal of talent and potential, however, and I will be interested to see what he does in about 10 or 20 years."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read worse","review":"I've certainly read worse stories, but the sheer amount of typos and grammatical mistakes and misuse of words alone turned me off to this book. I was barely a chapter in before I had a pencil in hand and was becoming more and more preoccupied with the mistakes than the plot. Shouldn't an editor have caught these? That alone was painful, and not to mention the dialogue and the awkward sentences themselves. I had hoped that this child \\"prodigy\\" book would actually be good, not a book that sounded like something I had written when I was fifteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!!!!!!!!","review":"It is one of the worst books I've ever read. It is so lame! I am so sorry that I paid for this book and am trying to return it. Whoever is hyping this garbage maskerading as a book should just stop!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Steer Clear","review":"Eragon was written for children. Laden with overdone cliches and unbelievable heroics straight out of a adolescent's imagination, it came as no surprise that the author is a young teenager. My suspension of disbelief cannot bear a sixteen year old boy becoming a master swordsman in six months time, without ever enduring a real fight. Or an ageless elven beauty falling in love with same boy. I was constantly asking myself where all the MEN in this book were hiding. Anyone looking for serious fantasy should avoid Eragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you give this tripe 5 stars?","review":"Anyone who gets to stay up later than 9 PM would recognize that this book stinks.

Started reading it, and the more I read the more I began to feel a sense of unreality that this particular book is getting so much marketing attention. It's nothing but a passably written string of cliches wandering through a maze of better writer's ideas. After reading 200 pages I gave up in disgust. The publishing industry created celebrity status in the young author because of his youth and got away with it. But I do know young people who are very original and profound, even wise in their thinking. This book is excruciatingly UNoriginal, lacking in depth, and the style of writing is immature at best. Bottom line, if you buy it you're only proving the marketers right--that the public can be led by marketing dollars, even turning a silly imitative book like Eragon into a bestseller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do yourself a favor. Read something better.","review":"As you look around at the other, glowing reviews of Eragon, I hope you realize one thing: They are wrong.Paolini somehow got a glorified fan-fiction published-by his parents-and then miraculously found a \\"big time\\" publisher who knew how many people could be duped into reading a \\"fresh and original fantasy\\"Paolini plagiarizes:Lord of the RingsStar WarsEarthseaThe BelgariadFreaking Jeremy Thatcher, Dragon Hatcher!He takes classics, rips them apart, and creates a Literary Frankenstine.

Tolkien: 'The time of the Elves has passed.\\" Christopher Paolini: \\"The time of the Riders has passed.\\" Hmmm. You may not agree with me, but I'd call that cheating in a big way. As a mother, I think it's too bad this author is getting so much press when what he did was quilt together patches from any fantasy source I can think of--books, movies, games--and the stitching isn't even very good. Since when is it 'classic' to take what others have done and call it your own? Although I didn't see anything truly original in this boo, having read other fantasy authors, I wonder how Paolini would feel if there had been something really original in his book and someone else had taken it and made a fortune off of it. Well you might not agree, but what should I say to my own kids about givin gcredit where credit is due?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Book Ever...","review":"I think I can honestly say this is one of the worst books I have ever read. If Paolini ever learns to stop manipulating his characters, come up with his own storylines, and cut out all annoying, irrelevent descriptive passages, he might become a decent writer. As it is...If you are unfamiliar with Tolkien, Lucas, and Mccaffrey, Paolini's blatent plagarism may not bother you. Who knows, you might actually enjoy the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better fan fiction","review":"OK if you read the one-star reviews of this book, you will get the picture. This is one big fat rip-off, and anyone who knows the fantasy genre could have told you that.

Character interaction feels forced, and there is no chemistry.The worst part is the pacing. This book is a terribly slow read. I cannot imagine the story needing to continue over a part II and part III.I will read the remainder of this book to see if it improves. But at this point, I have to admit, the positive reviews puzzle me. This book is not what those reviews promised it would be."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BOOK!","review":"Both this book and the second book are WONDERFULLY written!

Right from the beginning I wanted to know about the blue stone and it's magic. The story was fast-paced, well-balanced and beautifully descriptive.

The action and story telling make it a real page turner!

It is about a boy(Eragon) finds a dragon egg. He, though, thinking it as a rock, puts it in his room and wakes up to find a dragon hatchling. He then finds himself in an adventure battling an evil king. With new friends, he battles with a sword named Zar'roc and defeats harsh beasts.

Eragon protects the dragon until the attack. Some one close to Eragon is killed and he wants revenge. He sets out on a journey to kill the attackers. On his journey he is joined by Brom and Murtagh to help him receive victory. This book will make you rejoice and cry. This book is great if you are in to adventures. I recommend this book to middle school students who love to get caught in a book and never put it down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Close but no cigar...","review":"FINE...I admit it. It's a decent book. I have some squirmishes with the editing, but all in all, the story itself isn't bad. That isn't to say, of course, that the book is downright amazing. In fact, far from it. Paolini is hopelessly derivative of older and far better fantasy novels (Lord of the Rings anyone?) That isn't the major problem because a lot of fantasy novelists have done that, but the best and most successful of them (J.K Rowling for example) have at least used these old ideas and made them new and interesting. Paolini does not. The bottom line is: if you've never read a fantasy novel, you'll love it. If you have, then don't bother. There's nothing new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful :(","review":"This is a very bad imitation of Lord of the Rings. I bought it thinking that it was going to be a good and enjoyable book, but instead I've been reading counting the pages anxiously until I finished it.

How terrific! Only this falls flat. The plot was conventional and everything about it was mundane. There was nothing extraordinary to say about it. The boy goes on a quest to save the Empire but honestly I don't know how this exactly go to be a bestseller, not to say I have actually read the whole book! Fantasy books may probably be not my thing but this doesn't seem to offer enough lessons or interesting views on things you relate to. The plot is slow and there is something kind of odd in talking to a dragon who speaks through your mind. This book is a failure and this is just a journey on a fantasy adventure. Recommendations on improving is make your characters more stimulating or engaging, make them with character or a little humor. Also, it probably would help if they would meet recurring characters that would provide comic relief. This book simply falls behind expectations and was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"It is definately worth reading.

The characters fail to resonate (and why should they when they're carbon copies of other, earlier works) and never engaged my sympathy. The use of language was also a weak point, and especially the constant use of other words than \\"said.\\" when there is nothing wrong with \\"said.\\" Overly flowery and pretentious language was grating, with examples of \\"visage\\" and \\"raiment\\" and their like sprinkled throughout the book.Overall, considering the author's age, it's not bad as a first attempt, but there are any number of stories like it already out there by more experienced writers, not to mention on fanfiction.net. I would suggest readers interested in a good Fantasy book head towards the original texts instead of this derivative one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much time spent on this story.","review":"Very impressed with the writing and descriptive ability of young Mr. Paolini, however it took me forever to get through this story.

The same story with the same flavor could have been told on less paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This is an awesome book. I would definately recommend it to anyone who likes J.R.R.

It's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip-off or Homage?","review":"Mr Paolini's writing aside (it's serviceable, but unremarkable), I find it highly amusing that so many people accuse him or ripping off LOTR and Star Wars. LOTR owes much to Scandinavian Mythology (which Tolkien revered), and George Lucas took the plot for Star Wars directly from Akira Kurosawa's film \\"The Hidden Fortress\\".

I'm a big LOTR fan so maybe I expected too much I don't know but to me it seems like it's a 15 year old's version of Tolkien. Although I think he probably did have some help rephrasing some sentences here and there. There are just some expressions in the book that I wouldn't expect from a kid his age.

You certainly wrote a wonderful book!I first picked up Eragon because I liked the way the cover looked. I have never regreted that move, as soon as I finished the first chapter I was sold. He has a way of letting you know just enough that you don't get frustrated, but you are still curoius. He makes you feel as though you are there, the chapter in which he first flies was when I truly noticed how I felt I was riding Saphira, instead of Eragon.I will say this book gets a little slow at parts, a few times you just say \\"C'mon! Keep going!\\" But it always picks up quickly again. Mr. Paolini makes the whole book seem real, from the way he describes the snow and the mountains, to what is going on in the story I can only say pick it up, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Early","review":"When I first saw this book and what the title was, I thought, \\"Eragon?

Nevertheless, I read the book and I loved it for it's easy to understand writing and plot...I still think that with time and experience, Paolini could shine because he DOES have potential, but he shouldn't have written so early. Perhaps he needs to grow into his talent before he writes because although his writing showed promise, there were WAY~ too many similarities between his book and LOTR, SW Trilogy, etc...I felt like I was reading a fusion of the above mentioned fantasies (a quite MESSY fusion)...I'm quite sure you all know what I am talking about.

There seem to be only two characters, a multi-cloned heroic character type and a tri-cloned evil one.It is boring.Since the prose is so badly written, I tried speadreading to see if there is any interesting plot development or storyline to make up for the lack of style. Nope ... I got about half way through and I give up. Paolini wins. He outlasted me. The book goes into the recycle bin to be turned into a cerial box or something of some value to society.

At age 38, I am not yet at the close of this great classic, yet I am eagerly awaiting the next! I almost don't want to complete it...I don't want the story to end! My 12 and 14 year old sons are in line to read it next, since I rarely rave over a book. I want my sons to see what they can accomplish if they set their minds to it.

This opens up to a regular fantasy plot, they go off and fight good vs. evil. It was upsetting to read this book, partly because of all the unoriginal ideas that were smashed together. Eragon is pretty much the mixture between Star Wars and Lord of the Rings, most of the writing seems more copied than written itself.The List of Good things:1. Nicely Done Cover2. Some parts included colorful demonstration of writing.The List of Bad Things:1. Copied from Lord of the Rings. (see other reviews for lists)2. Copied from Star Wars. (see other reviews for facts and list)3. Poorly done dialogue.4. Biggest cliche a fantasy fan can ever see.Why this book has received publicity:1. Christopher Paolini and his family's ability to promote the book well by spending money for promotions, etc.2. Was written by a 15 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad book","review":"I am nine years old and I fonud some things in this book that I did't like. This kid copyed off of a lot of books. Eragon's sword is five foot one-handed sword that is heavy. Brom the wizard is a cheep imitation of Gandlf in the LOTR. And nobody knows why the battle happened but it just Happened. His story could have fit in one book. This kid did not know anything about swordsmenship. This book sould have never been published."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good book,really good author .","review":"I really like to read, its 1 of my hobbies. I wanted to take it slow but, after the 1-3 chapter I could'nt put it down. It was over in 4 days! Its about a boy who lives on a farm, one day he's walking through the woods where no one goes. He finds this saphire stone on the ground and thats when the story begins. Im really looking forward to the movie and the 2nd book. Also in a few months a year maybe the 3rd book will get published. I wish they would have gave Eragon a saphire sword like the color of Saphira, I would also make it longer so i could enjoy it for a longer amount of time! I also reccomend Baldur's gate and Baldur's gate 2 Shadows of Amn. Well i hope this review helped you and enjoy the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My advice: read this book","review":"I have read a few reviews that complain that this book is too much like some other story you might be familiar with that takes place in Middle Earth. I have two things to say in response to that...one, Tolkien was so exhaustive in his efforts to create a working alternate planet, that it is virtually impossible to write a fantasy novel without drawing comparisons; and two, so this book is similar to one of the greatest books ever, how can that be a bad thing?Eragon is a wonderful story. I think the best praise I can give to it is that the world seems to have been created first and the story almost an after thought, because jsuta few chapters in and you find yourself almost another citizen. The Spine seems like a real place.This book was so good that I withdrew my usual stipulation of not reading a series book until the entire series is published. If you consider yourself a fantasy fanatic, I think you owe it to yourself to read this story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hit","review":"I had never heard of author Christopher Paolini before but I had seen the book recommended on a list that included Robert Stanek's magnificent The Kingdoms and the Elves of the Reach as a great new fantasy. Based on the strength of that recommendation, and the fact I loved Stanek's books, I picked this up.When I first started reading the book, I wasn't too sure if I was going to enjoy it or not, but I stuck with it and I'm glad I did. The book really surprised me. Eragon is well thought out character and the book has a great plot. I definitely encourage anyone who likes fantasy books to try this one out. I recommend this book to people who like magic, fantasy and a moderate amount of action. Very highly recommended.

I admit I thought it was pretty bad, in fact it was some of the worst fantasy I have ever read. When a real editer would have helped this very weak writing come up to snuff, instead his parents went along with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dry story","review":"I won't bother rehashing old arguments. Eragon is derivative and there's nothing that can be done about that. I understand that fantasy usually is derivative. Star Wars and Lord of the Rings are also derivative of other sources. But what makes Eragon's derivativeness worse than that of Star Wars and LOTR? This book is dry. In SW and LOTR, there are interesting characters and action to mask the derivative elements. But Paolini says \\"characters are born out of necessity\\". The story has no soul; it has a plot but nothing else. That's why the cliches are more obvious in Eragon than in others books."},{"rating":"1","title":"-Yawn-","review":"Hmm well i have been reading through the other reviews posted by fellow fiction readers. Hve you noticed that all the reviews entitled 'kids review' have 5 star and similar comments? Perhaps they have not read Lord Of The Rings? Maybe not seen Star Wars. Or perhaps they are just yound and impressionable, but either way this book was a complete waste of my time. Which I could have spent reading something decent, perhaps His Dark Materials Trilogy. I only read this book to the end because my friend, who had read and enjoyed the book, pressed me too. Hoping the book would get better i finished it, up until the last page I found my eyes rolling into the back of my head, the book literaly sent me to sleep.Take my advice Mr Paolini, give up. Go to college get a job, and forget all about this bad, bad time in your life!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen much better","review":"Fantasy is a difficult genre to work with because, at this point, nothing can really be spectacularly original anymore. However, fantasy writers can still be successful is they are skilled in either prose or storytelling. And there lies the problem with this book.Paolini, gifted though he might be, has not developped a great writing style or a gusto for plot. What makes writers like J.K. Rowling or Cornelia Funke so distinguished as fantasy writers is that they are able to take convention and make the most of them. Paolini, however, writes with a plodding hand that reminds of a bad high school short story and his plot seems like it's been taped together from a collection of other work.If you're not familiar with fantasy, then go ahead and read it. If you are, you're not missing much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon is the best","review":"I just can't understand why people rate this book 2 or 1 stars. Some people say that the characters show no emotion. This, however, is not true. The characters show sorrow, anger, happiness, and affection. All the characters are unique and different from those in other books. One guy rated it only one star, but said he didn't even finish the third capter! I agree that it gets off to a slow start, but so do Harry Potter and C. S. Lewis books. My favorite part is when Eragon defeats the shade. All in all Eragon was a very good book, and Christopher Paolini was only 15 when he wrote it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a well written and carefully thought out book","review":"I am a great fan of Science Fantasy. This book delivers in such a charming way that I passed it on to my two daughters, aged 13 and 20, who also have enjoyed the book. This author has a long career ahead of him.

This is a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon by Christopher Paolini","review":"This is an amazing book that was written by a 15-year-old kid! i wish i could write that well. ha ha. anyways, this is probably the best fantasy book i've ever read. it's about a boy named Eragon who's only family is killed by evil beings and Eragon, along with his pet dragon, Saphira, and the town story teller Bram set off to find them. But along the way, there are lots of roadblocks in thier way, which ends up helping them in the end. I can't wait for the sequal to come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I bought this book on a whim. I started reading it the very first night I got it and didn't put it down until I was done. I really loved the thinking level that the main character went through. I was impressed by how much the author explained everything. It was brilliant! I only wish I could become as good a writer!

The ratio of made-up words is high, the name of the king is a mishmash of the lead Decepticon from Transformers and 'dominatrix,' words aren't used properly, and there's a huge amount of redundant language.

Based on some of the reviews from the other adults on this site I was hesitant to read it. However, I thought it was very well done and a great read and I'm 40+. Can there be comparisons to LOTR? Yes, most definitely. But then again, if you look at any fantasy book you can find comparisons to LOTR. Sure there are elves and dwarfs, but Stephen King even has Elves and Dwarfs in his book \\"Talisman\\", but I don't hear people comparing that to LOTR and there are no dragon riders in LOTR, that I can recall.Anyway, if you're like I was and are sitting on the fence about reading this book take the leap and give it a try.

Young Eragon sets out on a quest to avenge his uncles death with his dragon Saphira and his Teacher Brom. He later travels to the Varden to help them deafeat the evil king. This fantasy takes place in a mythical land during the middle ages. It is a very exciting book with lots of fighting and conflict between the two sides. Based on this Book I expect the sequel Eldest to be excellent. Christopher Paolini did a excellent job on this book especially for a 17 year old writer trying to please kids just younger then him. The advetures of Eragon and his companions are compelling, you won't be able to put this book down until you are done. Eragon will leave you itching to read Eldest; these are 544 pages that you will want to read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting sometimes, but not worth raving over","review":"I kind of liked this book at first. I mean, it was pretty exciting halfway through. But then I started to realize something... This is exactly like the Lord of the Rings! Almost every single aspect of this book can be compared to LOTR. Look at this:Eragon- AragornBrom- GandalfRa'zac- Black RidersArya- ArwenAnd that's only some of the things I recognised. I haven't seen that much Star Wars, but even I can see the whole Jedi thing going on here too. The book was well written and all but hardly any of it was original. Borrow from the library instead of buying this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"SURPRISING!","review":"I started this book with ok expectations. As I continued the book, I found that it had the same \\"something\\" that the Harry Potter series has. That \\"something\\" being defined as the inability to put the book down of your own accord. You find yourself reading for hours when you did not intend to, and you find yourself loving every bit of it. You find yourself feeling the emotions of the characters, you feel their anger, their sorrow and their need for vengeance. In the end, you find yourself buying the next book, \\"Eldest,\\" the same day you finish Eragon (as I did.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love dragons - love high fantasy - read this one!","review":"Truly enjoyed this book. This was the second time I have read it, but it has been a few years.

The empire will go to any lenghts to get the dragon and the dragon's rider on their side, and the varden wants the dragon and rider just as badly.

It's an amazing series and young adults should read it. -- Nathan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not entirely original, but fun just the same","review":"To everyone who keeps saying that the themes in this book have been done before, I do agree that there are many parallels between Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, The Chronicles of Narnia, and other fantasy series. However, as a book for young people, I still think it is well-written and enjoyable and very well done for a teen-age author. I don't think many kids his age could do as well. Most kids are not going to sit there and analyze the story and criticize it because it's too much like another book. Kids just enjoy a good story that keeps them engrossed, and these days I'm in favor of anything that will keep kids reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon is cubic zirconia","review":"After hearing this book built up as the next coming of Tolkien, I was disappointed and disturbed to actually read it. It was like being invited to a party and told that there would be an amazing diamond on display, only to find cubic zirconia. There's a little bit of sparkle here and there, but the sparkle is all easily recognizable as having been taken from elsewhere--WHEEL OF TIME, DRAGONRIDERS, and, of course, LOTR. Etc. It's kind of disturbing that so many people seem to be fine with that. I presume that many don't know because they haven't read Robert Jordan etc? What's good about this book is imitation, and what's so-so and even boring about it is the way it's written. Anyway, this is cubic zirconia being passed off as diamonds, and it isn't worth the hype it's been getting."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Read!","review":"In this book, Paolini richly develps both plot and characters. The storyline is easy to follow, and you can understand the characters. It takes the normal fantasy reads about dragons to an entirely new level, with a bunch of twists to make it interesting (I could go on and on about all the new looks at the old subject of dragons, but I don't want to spoil the story).Eragon, the main character, finds a dragon egg, and is cast into a world of suspense, danger, and most of all, MAGIC. You really get to know him and all of his feelings. You can symphasize (hope thats spelled right ;)) with all of his feelings and emotions, and feel like you're right there with him. Paolini has done a wonderful job on this book, and it's with out a doubt worth every cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nuff Said","review":"Okay...keeping this short and simple. Same old reused tired plot. Writting could be alot better and the story could have been stitched together probably much better. Characters do not have a good balance with each other. Not really suspenseful since we've all seen this story before (just with different characters). BUT it's a okay good book for kids to read if they really can't get into Lord of the Rings. I would say this would be a replacement book for kids that are around 10-16 who can't understand or get into Lord of the Rings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland!","review":"Paolini is a very talented author but the idea of his book is over-used. Oh my god, a kid finds a dragon and then must fight the forces of evil. That is so original. Paolini should stop wasting his time and write something worth reading. If you are looking for serious fantasy read Abarat. If you are into Sci-fi read Stars my Destination."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a winner - my son hasn't put it down...","review":"My son started reading this last night and made it about halfway through the book - he loved it so much, he just couldn't put it down!

The plot and characters are underdeveloped. The whole thing is a huge Tolkien ripoff (but so is most Fantasy). This book is for first time fantasy readers who are 8 to 12. But before reading this i would recomend reading Harry Potter and the Wheel Of Time so you have and idea of what good Fantasy is.i will admit it was entertaining but anyone who gives this 5 stars needs to read a Game of Thrones by George RR Martin and know what quality fantasy is.

For it was self published, for it was written by a teenager. It's obvious it was self published. It was written badly and there was alot of errors. The plot was copied, I doubt anyone wanted to publish it.'And wow, it's written by a teenager'. That doesn't mean it will be amazing.

Buy this book now, you will NOT be disappointed! :-D"},{"rating":"2","title":"No relation to LOTR whatsoever!","review":"Eragon has NOTHING to do with The Lord of the Rings! It is a different book! The story is completely different and has a much greater resemblance to Star Wars than it does LOTR. The use and definition of \\"magic\\" is the most obvious difference between Eragon and The Lord of the Rings, and anyone who knows anything about LOTR would know this. In Eragon, magic is a palpable, outwardly manipulated thing. In LOTR it is subtle... I can't explain it. Read both books and A. You are a complete and utter moron or B. The differences will be completely obvious.Eragon was a solid and enjoyable book and I am eagerly anticipating the sequel. It was well-written and fast-paced and drew me into a rich, complete, and cleverly spun world. The book would be five stars if not for the obvious parallels with Star Wars. No big.

Do not confuse this with what real fantasy should be. Try George R. R. Martin, Tad Williams or Robin Hobbs to name a few of the fantasy masters that can tell a story with originality and readability. This book had nothing to motivate me to finish it or even care how it ends. A good fantasy book should be a treat to read and should draw you into the story wishing it would never end. This book does not.

Without a sequel to turn through, I read through of the Harry Potter and forgot all about this book. This year, I came back to the sequel, Eldest, and couldn't force myself past two chapters before I became bored and returned it.What am I saying? To be to the point:-The book is great if you haven't experienced the genius of Rowling or require books that are lower on the intellectual scale.-I immediately missed the wide and strong vocabulary and structure of the Harry Potter series, Stephen King's masterpieces and the like.-After reading good books, I couldn't make myself read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"I was looking forward to this after being told by a few people how great it was. Three of those were my own teenage kids, and the other was someone who hasn't read much Fantasy. I even waited until the third one came out before starting, so that I could go through the whole series.Unfortunately, after forcing myself to finish the first book, I won't be bothering with the rest. As others have said, it is very same-ish to a lot of much-better books out there. The writing is good for a 15 year old, I suppose, but nothing special. In fact it is a little tedious. At the end of the book, I couldn't even bring myself to have any empathy for any of the characters. I didn't especially like Eragon, or Saphira (who I found very dull). And the villains aren't especially noteworthy either. Worse is that there wasn't a single original idea in the book. It really was a chore to read.Sorry. I wanted to like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I don't care!","review":"Don't pay attention to the bad reviews. This book is good. You may say he copied things from other amazing authors, but technically, he didn't. Everybody knows that a plot like this should always start in the countryside. If you didn't, now you do. Plus, we should be able to get good ideas like this from good authors, no matter how similar they may seem. Seriously, all he really copied was the small stuff. And, this book is NOT predictable. Go ahead, guess. Whatever you thought of was probably wrong. Trust me, I should know. I've read the whole series, including Inheritance. I knew about the similaries and was still surprised. The movie itself has you on a wild goose chase. But seriously, read this book. If you like Harry Potter, swordfighting, and/or similar, this is another book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars dipped in Fantasy?","review":"Of all the many reviews on this book, it needs to be restated that the main plot line looks like a fantasy reworking of Star Wars. Rent the first Star Wars movie (1977), and then read this book. You will see that the plot lines follow each other very closely. There are some who wondered if the story was plagiarized almost straight from Star Wars. I was not impressed with the story or author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Children will enjoy","review":"My son read Eragon when he was 11 and had a great time. I previewed the book and it is written pretty well, but I think most adults will find the story too predictable. However, younger people should enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid. That's all I can say.","review":"Well, not really. I hate the book for all the classic reasons.1. Ripoffs, of course2. I've seen better character development in Garfield3. The Old Language words sound like the gibberish that someone would make up when they're losing at Scrabble.4. Dialogue sucks. You can tell Paolini would sit and stare at the computer for long moments, trying to figure out what to say next.5. Too many chapters involve Eragon losing consciousness. The almighty Dragon Rider has never finished a fight!6. Eragon learns about swordsmanship and magic too quickly. Saphira becomes mature too quickly.7. I'd go on, but I've gotta go. C YA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISGUSTING","review":"AHHH, after reading the Dying Earth by Jack Vance isn't this a letdown!!!My grandma gave this to me on my 13th birthday, and i've barely finished half and it's about time i've finally gotten rid of this dumb thing.

Sometimes I have to ignore bad reviews because most every book has them. Well this book was a huge disappointment. The use of a thesaurus is so obvious that it makes me feel embarrassed. If you've ever seen that episode of \\"Friends\\" when Joey writes a recommendation letter for Monica and Chandler to adopt a baby, and every single word in his letter came from the thesaurus, THAT is was I was reminded of reading Eragon LOL. Besides that, the characters are worthless and the story is just not interesting at all. And like everyone else has said, none of it is original. There's no need to explain it all since it has been done plenty of times here. I just had to review it to give it 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a thesaurus...or maybe two.","review":"This book was one of the the most unoriginal pieces of fiction I have ever read. Granted, it's pretty long great for a 17 yr. old, but it pales in comparison against the originals. About 1.3 way into reading this, I was wondering if I was reading a kid proof version of LOTR with dragons mixed in for fun.This book had the potential to be great, but it fell flat. The movie could have given the book some positives as well, but it was worse than the book and that's saying something.I know that if I tried to write an epic adventure story, I wouldn't be able to. At least mine would have better grammar and word choice.This book also bothered me because he made no effort to make the writing interesting. I like reading about the character's reactions and emotions. That improves the story vastly. I'd rather have chraracters that are alive in a bad plot instead of flat characters in an unoriginal story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the hype would lead you to believe.","review":"Ugh...What can I say? The plotline is cliched and boring, the writing isn't memorable in the least, and yes, a lot of it is borrowed from other series.I think a lot of people give Eragon a good rating simply because the author is young--or at least, this influences their review. To tell the truth, I've seen 12-year-olds that write stories that are much more captivating and well-written, and original. They just never get 'em published, which is why a lot of adults are surprised to see a book with 'such good writing for someone his age'--they don't have enough basis for comparison.I don't want to sound like I'M being biased because of Paolini's young age, either (I'm several years younger than him, actually--13) :). Truly, it wouldn't make a difference if he was 5 or 50 to me. A bad book is a bad book... And, well, Eragon is a bad book.I didn't enjoy reading it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly interesting at best.","review":"This book is really just formula fantasy. There is nothing really new or original in this book. The language is stilted at times and forced. Similes are often \\"off.\\" The book is \\"unrealistic\\" at times - and by that I mean given its own frame of reference. For example, Eragon becomes a world class swordsman in a couple of months?! Saphira is depicted as a powerful dragon and displays this at times, yet cannot carry 3 people?! There are other little errors as well that just show the superficiality of the book; for example, the weather is described as cloudy then moments later, they are viewing the stars for navigation. Eragon himself is a superficial character: I never got to actually care what happens to him. I love fantasy so I read the entire book, but I have no interest in reading the subsequent books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon=Super Gooood!","review":"I loved this book. It is probably the best book that i have ever read. The plot is amazing for a kids writing and i really enjoyed this book. I recomend this book to people from 9-16 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Never-Ending Quest Has Just Begun","review":"The neverending quest has just erupted. Christopher's best book is unbelievably awesome.The story is about about a boy who's live is life is ultimately changed when Sapphira's egg hatched.The story will send you soaring.This sorrowfull yet adventerous story should stay in your collection for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've read hundreds of fantasy books and this is definitely the worst I've had the misfortune to read. Instead of reading this poorly conceived knock-off, I recommend that young readers check out Anne McCaffrey's Dragonsong trilogy, Ursula Le Guin's Earthsea series, Lloyd Alexander's Chronicles of Prydain series, Susan Cooper's The Dark is Rising series, or if you like SciFi, Orson Scott Card's Ender's Game series.I found Eragon to be a simplistic reworking of stories/themes. It is sad that the publisher's of the 21st century are playing it \\"safe\\", like most modern entertainment, and giving us nothing new. I was surprised that Anne McCaffrey endorsed this book. She writes \\"pulp fiction\\" fantasy too, but hers is much better. He even takes the name \\"Eragon\\", which is very similar to a character in her book, The Skies of Pern, named Erragon.I've never returned a book for my money back, so this was a first."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of favorite books ever","review":"I loved this book!!!! Easily 1 of my favorites. Riddled with adventure, swordplay and magic but with 1 character that really has depth: Murtagh. He is one of my favorite characters in the series. I owe it to Mr. Paolini because he inspired me to write my own fantasy book entitled The Paladin King, (still under construction, though)A big thank you to Paolini:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but painfully unoriginal","review":"I actually re-read this, and almost reached the end without realising I'd already read it a year or so before. It's that memorable.It \\"borrows\\" heavily from several well-known fantasy authors' work, with little (if any) original content, and the sources are painfully evident throughout. Although it's readable, the writing is shallow and immature. This isn't surprising, considering the author's age. Yes, it's impressive that he finished it, but that doesn't mean it automatically deserved to be published, let along adapted into a movie. Avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too long and unorginal...","review":"500 pages? It's no wonder how they were able to cut it into a 100 minute movie. The only semi exciting thing that ever happened was when the dragon hatched. It was also a rip-off of Lord of the Rings. Urgals were like Orcs. Raz'zac were like Ringwraiths. Brom was like Gandalf. Arya was like Arwen. Murtagh was like Aragorn. Galbatorix was like Sauron. And Eragon was like Frodo (except stupid).So if you're looking for an exciting and original read. Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't flow","review":"Eragon's got too many \\"tacked on\\" parts. For example, when Angela's explaining shades, she says \\"it's the most unholy magic...EXCEPT NECROMANCY\\" Where did the mention of necromancy come from? It is completely off topic. It's as if Paolini mentioned it simply for the sake of mentioning it.Another problem is the slave trade. Paolini tries to make it seem cruel, but the slave trade has no real part in the story. It exists for no reason other than making the Empire more dislikable.Too much of this book feels perfunctory, as if Paolini added it in simply because he thought he was supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clichés, yes but still good.","review":"The whole story is a cliché, I confess. Dragon Riders from Pern, elves and dwarves from LOTR, big nasty emperor from all sorts of places, poor kid whose relatives or mentor gets killed etc.It seems as if the book isn't worth all the clamor it is getting.But sometimes, there are exceptional cases where, even though there are clichés, the story is still a page turner, and I think Eragon is one.Although there is room for improvement, but for a young author, who wrote the book when he was 16, it's a great start and I am looking forward to his next book.Forget clichés, forget LOTR, just read and enjoy. Don't compare. Besides, if we were to critize every story just because it is similar to another one, why read then?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sucks you in.","review":"Eragon is in the woods when he finds a 'stone' that will change his life forever. He is 16 and has a quint life in the small town he grow up in.As he ( and you) will soon find out, he is ment for much bigger things.I think that this is a graet story, no matter who you are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting For More","review":"With the short amount of time I possessed the book I fell in love with it. It helped that I had a deep love of fantasy but this brings dragons to a new level. Once I started reading this it was impossible to read anything else. I repeatedly tried to put it down as I succumbed to sleep yet all I could think about was the hardship this young man was enduring.One of the main reasons that I could not give it the full five stars is because of the fact that it is a trilogy and I want t read the next one. I also noticed that time seemed to fly by with little detail; this is not necessarily a bad thing but should be clarified more.The detail that Paolini put into this book as a whole is monumental. His overall attention to detail was deeply appreciated along with the fact that he chose hi words carefully.I look forward to reading the sequel to this book and becoming friendlier with the story line."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get the hype!","review":"Okay, I know this book was written by a teenager and, yes, it's a pretty great accomplishment for a kid to write something that long and intricate. But if you just read the book for the book, it's so boring and long and chock full of endless, pointless description that nothing ever happens! I like some action in my fantasy novels, people!I was so bored and unenchanted I didn't finish it. And I can only say that about two other books I've read in my life. And I've read alot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone for Tolkien?","review":"Paolini obviously took a lot of this book from The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien created a masterpiece fifty years ago, but copies don't cut it. Tolkien was Tolkien, but the way Paolini writes Paolini is Tolkien. As far as teen writers go, this book was all right, but like the other reviews say: CLICHES AND LOTR! If you want some good fantasy take The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, The Silmarillion, The Eye of the World and ORIGINAL ideas, not an author taking credit for other author's works."},{"rating":"1","title":"amazingly bad","review":"considering all the hype this book is AMAZINGLY bad. Unoriginal and badly repped off prose. the only good parts are imitative and taken from other better authors. the bad parts are just bad: pooorly written and DULL. the female characters might as well not exist except as convenience for the overblown adolescent ego of the so-called hero.Another annoying thing: not even poalini claims to have written this book when he was fifteen. he STARTED IT when he was fiftenn--big deal, lots of people start lots of projects but it' when you FINISH trhat matters. this book was published when he was NINETEEN and anyone knows that means he finished it then. what a load of hype. stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"fanfiction rife with childish veneer","review":"I'm afraid it won't be long before we realize who Mister Paolini truly is. A hack, a scoundrel and a fanfiction writer who has gone way overboard. My true beef with the book wasn't stylistically, aesthetically, or phonetically (albeit it didn't score much at all on those counts). No...what damns the writer (and the book) is its slapped around, preconceived ideas that can be better had from the original sources whence they came. The old school writers, Fritz Leiber, Anne McCaffrey, J.R.R.

I can write circles around him, and so can so many people I know.Eragon is an embarassment to the world of Fantasy. It is nowhere near Lord of the Rings, nowhere near Dragonlance.And by the way, Eragon is a direct rip-off of an old, old video game for the SNES called Final Fantasy Mystic Quest. It is plagiarism."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have \\"A NEW HOPE\\" for your book Paolini","review":"Thats right, \\"A New Hope\\" from Star Wars. Paolini did little more than copy the plotline of Star Wars exactly. He is also the only one I know who uses 7,000 synonems for said. This is amatuer work. This book is not up to the game.

This book came highly recommended, but I was unable to get past the first chapter as I was continually distracted by punctuation errors.

I started reading it, found that the boy finds dragon, boy becomes valiant warrior cliched storyline is in this book. However, Paolini takes this cliched storyline, throws in some original things and makes an exciting and involving book that you won't be able to or want to put down.What amazes me most about this book is that Paolini wrote it when he was still in high school. A huge achievement for someone his age as most fantasy authors are at least in their 20s when they write their first novel. He certainly has a skill writing and I think that he will have a very successful carrer as an author.If you haven't read this book yet, shut off your computer and go buy it or check it out from the library. This is a masterpiece of fantasy, and I can't wait until the sequel, Eldest, in August."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good no Great Maybe The Best YEAH!!!!","review":"This book was so good! The story wasn't like other fantasy books where the people who get dragons just say,\\"Cool I got a dragon\\" and go on adventures with it. At first Eragon didn't want his dragon. Also Eragon is not like the Lord of the Rings because no one rides a dragon in Lord of the Rings. I promise you will love this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"100% Perfect!","review":"Eragon is my favorite book ever.

And I have absolutely no bias against the children's section; I love it, and think Harry Potter needs to be on the regular best-seller lists. Unfortunately, this one disappoints. Ugh. I struggled to finish.If you think this is a great read, then congratulations on finding the fantasy genre. You can definitely find better, everywhere. I don't mind the lack of originality that most people harp on. At least the tried-and-true plotlines make the story move (thus two stars). But the dialogue sounds like people talk in essay format. I get that Paolini is young, so let's wait until he learns to write and then praise him. After all, youth isn't a literary quality; it's an excuse for lack thereof."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plagiarism... almost.","review":"This story steals from many classics. I suppose it isn't an exact ripoff but the similarities between this and other classics such as Star Wars, Lord of the Rings and so on are so pitifully obvious. I read this to my kids and certainly they enjoyed it, not recognizing the plots, ideas and so on. I also don't think it was well written, there is never any doubt that Eragon will make it and be just fine. The dialogue is pretty bad.I can only give it two stars and that's because the kids did like it. Taken for what it is, a kids book, it is okay but just barely. It's the plagiarism that is so obvious and sickening. I think he made enough changes for it all to be legal, but it is still pretty pathetic.Kids read this instead :The Hobbit"},{"rating":"2","title":"What it's like","review":"If you aren't a busy person, you should definately read this fantasy novel. The beginning starts out a bit slow for my taste, but once you get past the descriptions, it's really quite interesting. Some parts weren't really needed, making the story longer than necessary. Still I enjoyed this book, and I think it's very inspiring to other young writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flat","review":"For a 16 year old author, this is an excellent beginning. Given time and experience I am sure Paolini will be someone to watch. However, there is a lack of maturity to the style of this novel which leaves its characters flat and often not very interesting. The main character too often follows advice because someone else \\"says so.\\" As a reader, it is too easy see where the story is headed, who the good/bad guys are and how each conflict is going to be resolved. Eragon, the main character, trusts those who give him advice, and that advice is generally always sound. There is little true suspense and the story is absolutely linear. \\"Go here, do this, see so and so, get next quest, do it, etc.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not especially original...no sparkle","review":"Was really looking forward to this, but am disappointed. Have been trying to finish it off and on for about six months but it never pulls me in.The writing plods and the storylines are derivative....not much original here.It's inoffensive--and certainly not awful--but nothing special. I imagine that the marketing prospects due to the author's young age drove the acquisition of this title by its publisher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but done before","review":"This book will probably be a favorite for years to come. Although, as others have stated, it has taken ideas from other authors. First off, the dragons, and dragon riders, just like the Pern series. Then all the characters and races are pretty much taken from Tolkien's LOTR series. And the magic, its entire basis seems to come word for word from Ursula K. Leguin's Wizard of Earthsea series. Although she probably based it on ancient myth's and legends of our world. Anyway, it is really a great book, and i suggest you read it, and the other series i've mentioned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I found this book most entertaining. There are several Spiritual Lessons contained in it if you have the eyes to see them."},{"rating":"1","title":"good writers borrow, greater writers steal proven wrong","review":"I give Paolini props for writing a long and relatively complex book at such a young age and his love of fantasy stories come through, but all he really does is steal and assemble concepts from better stories. An exiled mentor (Star Wars), Dragon/rider imprinting (Dragonriders of Pern), Elves (Lord of the Rings), Magic (The Wizard of Earthsea) are among several I can think of. Other than his one concept that a person should always make up their own mind, which I appreciated, I think he overall failed to add a different perspective, or unique vision to the realm of fantasy.What I find ironic is the indignance of reviewers who complain about the movie's failure in retelling the story. I will save the remaining books and the DVD for the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long, long ago in a galaxy far, far away... wait, wrong series","review":"I'm surprised that nobody was ever told to use the force."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantasy For Dummies","review":"I found Eragon to be a very basic, bare-bones fantasy story. The way I see it, the basic structure of a fantasy plot is like a skeleton and it is the author's job to give those bones flesh. However, Paolini failed to do this and his book is the perfect example of a stereotypical fantasy. It seems as if Paolini was writing Eragon the way he thought it SHOULD be written rather than letting himself write his own story. This book might be useful as a first-timer's introduction to fantasy but as an actual work of literature, it's just not good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fan-fiction.","review":"Not, however, a great novel. It's quality stuff that I'd expect to read on an Internet forum somewhere, but I'm unhappy that I paid money for it in book form.If I wanted to read Tolkien's and LeGuin's stories, I would have gone straight to their books. If I wanted to read an impressive book from a teenage author, I'd have opened up \\"The Neon Bible\\" by John Kennedy Toole again. \\"Eragon\\" isn't the first choice in any of these categories, though.I admire the young writer for his discipline in pumping out books of such length. My second star is for that talent. It's a sign that he has a long writing career ahead of him. Like other reviewers have said, I'll check him out again in a decade or so when he starts writing his own things instead of fan-fiction paeans to his favorite writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's passable, but just barely","review":"Eragon was entertaining enough, but that's the only thing it's got going for it. It's not the kind of book that people will remember for years. It's just the book you'd pull out of your backpack if you have some spare time at school.Eragon was okay, but it has no \\"soul.\\" What I'm saying is that there's nothing to make Eragon into a unique, individual book. It's just a combination of different books. I saw more Tokien, McCaffrey, and LeGuin than Paolini in this book. There is nothing of Paolini's own ideas in Eragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Conceited Attempt at Literature","review":"I tried to finish this book. I really did. But, as a lover of books, I decided that this story was not for me. The author is obviously an amateur, and would do very well in a high school English class. However, his home-school background shows through the flaking veneer of this unrelatable book. His sentence structure is amazingly halted, unable to flow like a quality piece of literature. Making my attempt to read this book all the less enjoyable is the author's precocious vocabulary, needless proper names and jargon, and endless simile and metaphor that fills the pages. This book is less than the quality literature that I would expect from Knoph Publishers and is merely a lengthy oddity, not an odyssey, written by a young but hardly gifted author.Robert Goodhue Woodruff"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"A very good read with adventure, comedy, mystery and sadness.

She is wiser than Eragon and more intersting.Also because the original cover art showed the title as Eragon and then showed a dragon's head, I keep forgetting that Eragon is not the dragon's name, but the name of the uber-youth.By the way, I am way way over the age of 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon The Inheritance","review":"Eragon is a great book for kids and adults to read. The reason that I thought that it was good is because of the action sequences. Christopher Paolini's choice of words made me want to read on. I really liked the creative names he used. Since he used uncommon names it made the story more interesting. For example: Eragon, Galbatorix, and Dras Leona were among my favorites. I also liked the different settings of Eragon because it made me want to go and visit. My favorite was the Hadarac Desert because of the challenges they faced. Some challenges the characters faced were thirst, heat and it was very tiring. The recurring theme in this story is good trying to overcome evil. If you enjoy intense action you should read Eragon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining novel by all standards","review":"While this book has many similarities to the the works of other writers, it maintains its own appeal. Readers of Tolkien will most definitely recognize some of the names, characterizations, and storylines located throughout the book. It is a realatively easy read and an enjoyable book despite its many refrences. I personally found it hard not to be strongly reminded of Tolkien constantly. It is certainly a book for those not quite ready to take up Tolkien's heavy volumes. I praise the work of Christopher Paolini and look forward to reading is next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a PUBLISHED WORK OF FICTION!","review":"I don't want to hear any more people defending Paolini because of his age. I don't want to hear anyone say \\"Could YOU write a book at age 15?\\". Any fifteen year old who read any work of fantasy could write something on par with this worse-than-mediocre book. What bothers me is that the Eragon fans' gushing praise is not towards the book but towards Paolini's ability to publish the book. If he had put this on fictionpress.com or some other amateur writers site, I would have praised it. But a published work of fiction should be good without taking an author's age into account."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kids hate it so why do adults try to love it?","review":"Wierd. This is a kids book clearly hated but lots of kids like me and all my friends so why do adults try to say such a horrible book is good? Paolini is 21 he's not a teen anymore so stop pretending he is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enjoyable","review":"They say that I should like this book. I love J.K Rowling and J.R.R. Tolkien - the perfect gift you'd expect. However, as I read the first chapters, I found myself being needled with the feeling that I had read something similiar before, and it was better then. As I read more, I became bored with the whole thing. The whole thing was so predictable and unoriginal. I thought it sounded like a English class fantasy assignment gone crazy. I have read books that definitely took ideas from other \\"original\\" fantasy authors and managed to like them a little. But in Eragon, it was so OBVIOUS. Overall, I thought it was something you'd praise on the fanfiction level, but it shouldn't of been published. Glad I borrowed it instead of buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Wars meets LOTR","review":"Star Wars with no technology and Tolkien with no wisdom. What could be better? Add some of McCaffrey's dragonriders and David Eddings special marks. . .if Paolini is 'new guard' and those original writers are 'old guard', why does the 'new guard' have to use the plots and ideas of the 'old guard'? Seems like the new guard would belong to the ones with the original ideas, past, present, and future.Fantasy readers are, by and large, pretty intelligent. We can put up with a lot of crossover from the authors we read, so long as there is an original twist. We can't be told that a book like Eragon is original and new, because we know better. Even the names are Tolkien's with some letters rearranged. Or should I say Tolkein."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal...dissappointing","review":"This was a dissapointing book. It was a rip-off of the lord of the rings--even the note at the end is like lord of the rings (\\"may your swords stay sharp\\") the language Paolini made up is unoriginal and is just like what the elves speak in the Hobbit. Every time Eragon got into a conflict, he went unconscious and appeared somewhere safe when he woke up. He goes unconscious in almost every chapter and there is only one main plot line--no mini twists or turns--altogether it was pretty predictable. And even the main character's name, Eragon, sounds just like Araghorn from LOTR."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissapointing read","review":"I bought this book before I knew it was written by a 15 year old. The story is a sorry hodge- podge of the favourite fantasy authors, but without the in- depth character creation or story , that one would expect. I'm sorry to say that mid-way I had started skipping pages ,to get through faster. Anyway it was not all bad, the beginning at least had promise, even if it didn't follow through. I will not be buying the sequel, but hopefully with time,maybe a decade or so, and a good editor, Paolini would be writer to watch for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shane Zaricki's review","review":"Eragon is a great fantasy novel .

For me, Eragon is a good fill in as my post-LOTR:RotK-high wanes, and I anxiously await the next installment in Jordan's Wheel of Time series. I've read Tolkien, McCaffery, Lackey, Tad Williams, and many others. The fact that many elements are obviously taken from these greater works didn't take any enjoyment away from my reading. Not an epic, I agree, but not a waste of time. For those people who have found books of a Tolkien-esque scale intimidating in their size and vocabulary, I think this is a good start to get into the genre. If you are well aquainted with fantasy novels, this is a nice Saturday afternoon read when you just want to read something for the fun of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure unadulterated trash","review":"This book is pure and unadulterated trash that would never have made it to the approved pile of a real publishing house. The editor would have taken one look at the gaping plot holes, painful dialog and pseudo-intelligent word choice and sent a kindly worded \\"Thank you for your submission but ...\\" letter. It's lucky the kid had indulgent parents with bundles of money to throw away on this massive turd of a story. The author should do a complete rewrite on the story and 1- fire his original editor for not catching all of the continuity errors in the original and 2- be prepared to still be turned down by editors that have better things to do with their time than wade through his awful prose.As for the movie well ... it doesn't matter how much you polish a turd it's still a turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"best book I have ever read","review":"this book I reconmend to young readers of all ages who loves fantasy and dragons. The first and only thing I heard about this was \\"it was written by a 17 year old kid!\\" As I dove into this novel, not only did I find it indeed gripping, put also extremely updated, as if Eragon was a boy at modern time. All his actions and emotions bears a reality to things I do on regular days. I absorbed every word and was lost in reality, being caried away to the virtual world that young master Paolini has written; I felt like I was Eragon, riding along side Brom and upon Saphira while waving the Zarrock. I praise Paolini for this novel and i hope for more series from him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't wait to read the next one in the series!","review":"A friend of mine had been recommending that I read this book for about a year before I broke down and read it. I read through the Lord of the Rings trilogy, and the Chronicles of Narnia series and came away unimpressed.This book however, changed my whole view of the genre. A slick, well-crafted novel from cover to cover. One of the best opening lines to a novel that I have ever come across, enchanting characters, and the promise of a journey grand in scope for the other two books in the series makes this a must-read for anyone who likes fantasy!I only give it a four-star rating because I save my five-star ratings for books that really make me think. But it's a fun read for anyone willing to pick it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfying, engrossing, inspiring.","review":"While I was a voracious reader of fiction through childhood and adolescence, adulthood has laid a guilty mantle of no-nonsense and practical responsibility on me. Fiction has been set aside along with fast food, tv, and too much ice cream. 99% of my book purchases have been non-fiction geared towards learning for the last five years.For some reason (maybe because the name reminds me of Aragorn?) I picked Eragon up while on my way to check-out at a popular store. It was cheap, I thought I would flip through it or who knows what. Well I read the first two pages, and then proceeded to get nothing useful done for the rest of my weekend! How wonderful to be reminded of my youthful summers lost in other worlds...In Summary: don't start reading this book if you are pressed for time to complete important chores, such as cleaning the house for visitors or studying for a test...you'll get nothing done for two days while engrossed in Eragon's story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paolini Power","review":"I loved this new novel.

My son just turned twelve, and has dyslexia, yet he finished this book in three days. Wow. I only had to read the first chapter to him, and then he was hooked!Everywhere we went, the book was with him - before school, in the car, at the store, in bed, everywhere.Few things are more important to me than for my child to have a love of reading. This book certainly reinforced that love. He is already on the list for the next book by Paolini.So, for any other parents who are endeavoring to keep their children's noses in the books, I recommend giving this book a look-see.This is what my son says about the book:It is about a boy named Eragon who finds a dragon egg. The dragon and Eragon embark on a life-changing adventure involving magic, sorcerery, swordfights and courage.The book was very exciting - I cant wait until the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"This soon to be epic novel in a series that could someday contend in the hall of fame in the fantasy world, is a great story of magic, swords, dragons, elves, dwarves, rebels and tyrants, and above all a teenage boy who sets out on a quest that will change his world. Eragon, a humble farm boy, is thrown into a whole new perspective when a large stone he found hatches into a dragon, a race of beasts long thought extinct. He befriends and companions the dragon, and sets out on a quest to interpret its meaning and how his new dragon-riding status fits in with the power struggle between the Varden, a group of rebels, and Galbatorix's Empire, a kingdom ruled by a fierce tyrant. This is only the first of better to come, and readers of all ages will benefit and enjoy this wondrous story. It is a must read, especially for those into fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young and Old will enjoy","review":"I gave this as a gift to my husband (38) nephew (8) and brother-in-law (40).

Just don't tell my husband or brother-in-law that I implied they are old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"This book caught my attention right away, I couldn't stop reading it! Christopher has taken the classic genre and twisted it to make it original. This book was very inspiring for me, as I am also a young writer. This author has given me more confidence in my own work. I don't think this book meaures up to Tolkien's writing, but a good yarn nonetheless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rip-off","review":"If there was a way of giving zero stars, I would!This is a total rip-off of all bland squee-High Fantasy there ever was, plus Tolkien, and a hint of Pern -(...).The only reason that book got published is that the kid's father owns the publishing company; otherwise, it would have remained unread in the depths of ff.net where it would by rights belong.The only thing I totally don't understand is why so many people actually like it - are they daft or what?? Can't they read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was edited?","review":"I won't echo the other comments about how the work is unoriginal or taken from other writers. I didn't care too much about that, mainly because I couldn't get past the horrible use of language. I think this book got caught up in the whole \\"the writer's 18 years old!\\" hype. Had this book been written by Robert Jordan and published as a Wheel of Time novel, it would have been flambayed.The use of the English language is absolutely horrible, for all the reasons described in the reviews below, and I blame this not on Paolini's education, but on his editors, who failed to clean up this book into something readable. Maybe some of you can get past it, but I couldn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Honest Review of Eragon/Eldest","review":"I read this a few years ago because it was the latest craze. A fifteen year old (who finished it when he was 19) wrote a 550 page book! Most teenagers aren't exactly great writers, so I felt I had to check this out.The book? 550 pages of derivativeness, pointless description (especially that of a certain elf's cleavage), and a carbon copy of Star Wars. For starters, 80% of the book is description of either the terrain or of hot elves, and yet I have no idea what the main character looks like. Not to mention the fact that Paolini obviously wrote it with a thesauras by his side. Machicolated?! We have no idea either. I'm not sure whether that was in Eragon, or Eldest, but what the hey?And then the plot. Yaargh. Take Star Wars, set it in medieval times, replace robots with dragons, and take out any originality. That's basically the plot. And as for Eldest, take everything I said here and multiply it by 5. Yup. It's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre and unoriginal.","review":"I give the author a bit of credit for his age, but other than that, this book does not deserve the press it has received. He takes from other works (Star Wars, Tolkien, etc) , almost to the point of embarrasment. The story becomes tedious after awhile, but does gain a bit of momentum at the end.Perhaps the second book is better than the first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"I thought this book was exiting, yet slow at times there was action, but the plot is fantastic.

One thing I do not like is how wide ranged Arya's looks are. In the book, she is absolutely beautiful, with black locks. But in the movie, her hair is golden and she somehow doesn't meet my expectations on how the beautiful elf would look like. for another thing, elves have pointy ears and she didn't...That would have been something to add in the movie. to credit Mr. Paolini, think he is very talented. He describes the scenes and its characters well, especially when Saphira's there. To finish, I say, Go Eragon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely Unoriginal","review":"Look, the writing style is pleasant enough and generally inoffensive but... Eragon is Star Wars in a fantasy setting in almost every regard. It's completely unoriginal and really not worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Coca-Cola Lite- make's you wish for the original","review":"Eragon, a fantasy tale of a boy who is destined to become the next dragon rider, is an amazingly told story- for a seventeen year old to tell. This story, while it has little inspired plot- shows that the young author will in a few years, become a really promising talent in his field.The problem now is really the problem of youth- he's obviously got so many inspirations which he idolizes, and he wants to put them together in one book, yet he never makes any his own or brings any new material to the story. To be honeset this book was a bit like regurgated material and there was a lack of character development, intersting characters, or good dialouge, but it does show a spark of genius in this young man. A commendable work for a 17 year old, a poor contribution overall to the fantasy genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon","review":"My two favorite books are Eragon and The Kingdoms and the Elves!

Isn't it rather obvious that Arya is Arwen(Even looks like her you know; just a little bit.), Brom is Gandalf, Eragon is Frodo or Aragorn, and Beorn is...Beorn. Oops!Damn! He forgot to change the name!It's nearly impossible to ignore his obvious plagiarism and carbon copying, so I don't know how his editors managed to ignore him. You don't have to waste time reading carbon copies of other books; just read Lord fo the Rings or see Star Wars. Just change a couple of names and a bit of the landscape and...Voila!

There are much finer books for the target age range to be enjoying than this hacked together bit of fluff. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A junk car","review":"I remember reading an interview with Paolini where he said that even positive reviews missed the point of his book. Dragon Quill is one of these reviewers. Unlike what Dragon Quill said earlier, Eragon WAS meant to be a literary classic. After all, Paolini compares his book to actual literary classics on his website. To use DQ's car metaphor, Eragon was meant to tear up the road but barely made it out of the garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...","review":"All I can see in this book is a rip off of several fantasies that I can name off the top of my head. It's very predictable and that made it rather unenjoyable. If he maybe put a few more years into it, he could have written it better. Well, by the end of the book we don't have any clue what the main character's hair color is, yet we know the ground is glistening white with snow. Right? It has no sense of location or time and is very poorly woven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eragon a great read for LOTR fans","review":"Readers who devoured the Lord of the Rings saga will find the plot and characters of this new fantasy very familiar--it follows the formula fairly closely, with an epic quest, a reluctant hero, a diabolical sorcerer villain, and a heroic stand against evil forces. There are even dwarves and elves. This is certainly an amazing debut by this young author, but it lacks the depth and richness of the Lord of the Rings. However, this series shows wonderful promise and is an excellent recommendation for LOTR fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most boring Fantasy novel in the whole world!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Mr. Paolini,I know this is your debut novel but...

It reads like it was written like a fifteen year old who has read way too much sci-fi/fantasy and not enough of anything else. Reading this book was kind of like driving a square-wheeled car. Ka-chunk Ka-chunk Ka-chunk. It was very slow in most places and the \\"made up language\\" distracted from the story rather than adding to it. (BTW Tolkien had a PhD in medieval languages, he kind of knew what he was doing).

All of his characters were simply copied from real masterpieces. Like The Lord of the Rings. I know not everyone can be as great as Tolkein, but if you're going to duplicate his work please try to at least put some of your own passion into the story.

Tolkien's plot without Tolkien's wisdom is kind of sad. McCaffrey's dragons without originality is sad, too. Jordan's mountains and creatures without Jordan's great writing is really sad.

It's not there.There isn't an original idea, a novel concept, a well-conceived plot line, or a nicely drawn character in the entire book. Lots of other reviewers have cited the author's various sources.

Even then, if the story was a page-turner, you might be OK but it drags most of the time. Goodness only knows how the author is going to keep it going for two more books.

THIS IS NOT A CONSCIEDENCE. Elves are spelled exactly the same, as are Dwarves, and their culture is the same too! Dwarves are great miners and craftsmen,they carry axes and chain mail, they're short, stocky, and strong, Elves are beautiful and good at forging swords, and they even have a horse lord, like Shadowfax!!

It is mind boggling how this book became #1 Bestseller. Good marketing, I guess. It is basically Star Wars during the time of the Lord of the Rings. Magic instead of the Force and Brom for Obi-Wan. Throw in the dragon-rider mindlink by McCaffery, you have Eragorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor.","review":"This was obviously written by an inexperienced author, without much grasp of anything beyond the obvious conventions of the fantasy genre.

I was watching MSNBC news when I saw Paolini being interviewed and just out of curiosity, I bought Eragon and Eldest at the same time. I felt as if I wasn't alone in writing novels and I was comforted. The first few chapters were OK but I was angry and disappointed when Brom died. As I read further I noted that there were some passages from LOTR and SW and Anne McCaffrey's, DragonRiders of Pern in the book and I became angry.It is insignificent that a fifteen year old wrote a novel. It doesn't matter the age of the person...what matters is the book and the words that filled the pages. I do not recommend this book to anybody. I would recommend J.R.R Tolkien's, The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings for those are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"An achievement.......although","review":"The fact that a 15 year old wrote this is impressive. However, I felt like I was reading the narration from a computer role playing game, without the fun of being able to direct the action myself. The book makes a fine first draft, but should have gotten alot more work before being published. It doesn't even come close to Harry Potter, much less Tolkien. The only character that really comes off is Saphira, all the others seem like stereotypes. I see a great future for Paolini as a designer of computer role playing games, but writing a novel takes more than just a bald description of the action."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should Have Put This One Away For A Few Years","review":"Unfortunately, there is nothing unique about this book. Characters are poorly drawn, action is predictable, language is overdone-ie what you would expect from an inexperienced author. Mr. Paolini should have put this one away on a shelf for a few years, then reexamined it. I'm sure he will agree in five or ten years that this was a good first effort, but not publishable material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hyped Stock Fantasy -- BEWWARE!","review":"Just read the whole book and wished that I had not.

I was expecting another great fantasy author, but I realize that Paloani still has a long way to go.I think it is clearly remarkable that someone Paloani's age could write a novel such as this, though I do not find the book as remarkable. I know that many people absolutely love this book, and indeed I can see why. I would like to encourage Paloani to keep on writing, and to develope his style and better himself through experience, as that is virtually all he is missing at the moment."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"I bought this for my teenage son so he would have something to read over Thanksgiving.

It didn't get any better than that. \\"Dad, I can't finish this book,\\" he said. \\"Just give it to the library.\\" I did, and consider it a donation.

He didn't think much of that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"Though I am a big fantasy person, I did not enjoy this book. The storyline was very unoriginal, and took so much from Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Even some of the names are similar.

He takes the plot line of star wars and throws it into a LOTR world and he add a hit of dragons. And guess what all of his \\"ideas\\" he stole it. He has nothing orgnal to add to the fansty world.

This book ranges from everything from slight romance, to epic battles with ferocious monsters, like urgals, and their giant realatives, kull. It has very intense moments, and anyone who thinks that it stinks obviously has no taste in a good book! Eragon has a dragon, saphira, and uses her to fight the king, Galbotrox's army. Shades, evil and powerful wizards, Raz'ak, deathly birds, and many other fiends challenge him, and his many companions in the book. It is full of tragety, and cheers of victory, and surprises at every turn!

Galbatorix. We do not feel any real hatred of him or his government, thus we cease to care about anything else in Eragon.One example is the slaughtered village with the speared baby. Galbatorix apparently has no reason for this massacre other than \\"Because he is evil.\\" This is the sort of inane randomness one would expect on Mad TV. Like the Urgals, we are TOLD that Galbatorix is evil but not SHOWN it.Another example is the slave trade. Maybe we could learn to hate the Alagaesian slave trade if we could figure out WHY THE HELL IT MATTERS! The slave trade is tacked onto the plot and could be removed without changing the story in any way. It doesn't matter to the plot, thus it doesn't matter to the reader.Galbatorix is like every other character in Eragon. You couldn't care less about his existance"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stephani","review":"This book kept me involved in the story from the first chapter to the last page and wanting more!

I then read the second book Eldest first which I enjoyed a great deal and recently read Eragon (Book 1). The movie was alright but I don't think it does the book justice.

I was extremely dissappointed. There is a reason that there are not many well renowned 18 year old authors out there. The writing is poor at best - definitely the work of someone who is just learning the art. The story is entertaining at times, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, it is entirely unoriginal. This book is fine for the younger child but is not in the class of Paul Park's Princess of Roumania, The Golden Compass trilogy or Harry Potter as books that transcend the line between children's and adult literature. I did not read the second book and have no intention of doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"A so-so fantasy tale.","review":"This story was a worthy effort for a 19-year old writer, but he should have worked for another year on the piece before its self-publication. The author utilizes many adjectives, a good tool for describing objects and scenery in a story, but when too many are inserted, especially dull adjectives like \\"big, large, round, etc.\\" a style suffers. Since Christopher is still a very young man and seems to be at a stage in life where writers use their initial success as learning blocks to mature as novelists, I feel we have yet to see the true capabilities of this promising author. Being only 22 years old and a self-published writer myself, I congratulate Christopher for his success in aquiring a book deal with a high paying publishing house. A dream like this comes only to those who persist for achievement in their dreams. Keep on writing, Christopher!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we choose NO stars for this book?","review":"C'mon people!! this book is terrible!!

And so, of course, I really don't know about the plagiarism, but I can tell you it was bad writing. Odd grammar, awkward flow (or rather, no flow), glaring holes in logic, some pretense at being descriptive, childish narration (not the good kind as told through a child's eyes, but something like 'The orange and brown cat drank some white milk and then went to happily to sleep'), and the list goes on. I don't see how anyone could've withstood this to the end.There are times when I don't like a book; I'll put the book down and never touch it again. And for these books, I'll even admit they have some merits and I can see how others could like them.

As a lot of people have said they won't be buying this and any future Ultimate Editions unless the Extended versions of each film are included and I agree with them. The first two HP films I purchased the Ultimate Editions mainly because the Extended Cuts were included along with the theatrical versions. Adding only a documentary is not reason enough to shell out 40 bucks or more for the same movie I already have on blu-ray.The first two Ultimate Editions are truly beautiful sets. The artwork and all the extras really make these collector's items for any fan of this series and I was looking forward to purchasing all the films (again) on blu-ray. However, as much as I'd love to have these now, without the Extended Cuts, makes all the difference.I hope someone at WB with enough clout sees this thread and hopefully some day soon we will be able to purchase THE truly ULTIMATE EDITIONS of ALL of the Harry Potter films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard version at ultimate price","review":"I purchased Years 1 and 2 and enjoyed the extended versions with the deleted material put back in to the movies. Years 3 and 4 are just the standard versions already released but at a much higher price. The deleted portions are added, just like the standard version on a separate disk but not in context, they should have been assembled into the movie.Save your money and get the standard versions as this is just a WB rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT the ULTIMATE EDITION like the first two...","review":"The reason I loved the first two ultimate editions was they included the \\"Extended Edition\\" of the films so that you could watch the movie with all the deleted scenes inserted into the film. I'm glad I didn't impulse buy these (both Year 3 and Year 4) before looking at the back. I can't believe WB thought they could release the first two with extended scenes and then skip out on the 2nd two. I won't be purchasing this to see the documentaries however tempting it might be. What a waste! Don't support WB until they add in the extra scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"SCENES ARE MISSING","review":"There are scenes missing from the dvd that were in the movie theater such as Harry falling asleep in divination class with the ladybug and how they explained about Barty Crouch. I hope they come out with a directors cut with the full movie version soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HARRY POTTER","review":"when i saw this movie in theatres, i loved it. i have been a huge harry potter fan since the books came out. i can understand that some people may be dissapointed at the lack of detail in the movie compared to the book, but what do you expect? a 5 hour movie? What i do suggest though is to read the book and then see the movie. i think its very interesting how they interperet the book onto film.so if you are on the fence about this DVD, i suggest that you go ahead and buy it. PLUS, ITS A GREAT DEAL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, awesome book.","review":"I really enjoyed this movie, but was really hoping for better. This book was the reason I became a fan of Harry Potter. This movie does not do it justice. The beginning is like an Attention Deficit person directing, cut to one scene, build up and then cut to another scene. That being said the actors were excellent. I get a little upset that the 2 disc used to be offered and now the studios are marketing to sell both the single disc and a double disc. The movie is okay but read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter Disc set","review":"I am thrilled with the quality of thisproduct. I love the harry potter movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another entertaining Harry Potter installment!!","review":"Another solid effort to bring to life the words of J.K. Rowling. This latest installment is much darker than the others. In this version in particular, there is a very real sense of danger and that Harry could be in trouble. The movie also reflects the growth of the three Potter buddies as they take on more mature life issues (eg. dating) when Hogwarts is infused with students from other schools of magic for the school year. Ralph Feinnes is brilliant as the evil Voltemort and the kids pull off solid performances with more difficult dramatic material and challenges than ever. This is definitely one you will want for the collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goblet of Fire in review","review":"I bought this two-disc DVD after having had the 1 disc DVD since it first came out. I think all Harry Potter fans should have this 2-disc edition as a part of their collection since it has all the deleted scenes and added features that the 1-disc DVD lacks.As for the movie itself, it's a great movie for its special effects and cinematography but if you are expecting it to be like the book, you will be disappointed. All in all, the movie is well worth your money especially if you get this 2-disc edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A big jump from the third movie!","review":"This movie is by far the best movie so far.After getting used to all the changes that were made in the 3rd movie, the fourth movie is a blast.The first thing I have to say is \\"VOLDEMORT RULES!!!\\" Whoever played Voldemort did an excellent job and you really learn to hate him (which is a good thing if you learn to hate the character and not the actor).The special effects rock and the acting is much better than I remember it being in the previous movies.I can't say much about the story because there's nothing new under the sun. As usual the director cut things, added things, and shortened things so as to make it not nearly as good as the books, but that's to be expected with all films that are based off of books.All in all this is a great movie that deserves to be bought off the shelf and watched over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry POtter and the Goblet of Fire","review":"I love Harry Potter.

On closer inspection, these turned out to be tiny pin-holes in the metal layer, which appears to be melting away. Disc 2 (special features) seemed perfectly fine.The disc still plays well, but I suspect that in the near future the holes will get big enough to defeat the error-correction function of the player. Needless to say, there is no legal way of creating a back-up copy of the disc while it still works - I seem to recall an offer to upgrade old DVDs to Blu-ray for a small fee, but it doesn't seem to be available now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"There are No additional scenes.

The progressive maturity of Harry and his friends hint at the struggles to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"HP","review":"Wish I'd caught on earlier. Everyone told me that the Harry Potter series was good. I my expectations were definitely exceeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, Romance!","review":"My family enjoyed Goblet of Fire--my 12 year old said it was the scariest HP yet. I thought that the director did well to abridge the Quidditch Cup. We've seen a lot of Quidditch over the course of the earlier movies. They did add some neat new effects with the magical fireworks and the card show supporting the Bulgarian team. Played nicely against teenage love was Hagrid's infatuation with the giant headmistress of Beauxbatons--a head taller than Hagrid, if that's possible. I think that Emma Watson will have the best career of the young stars of the cast--she's growing up to be a beautiful young woman--both my daughter and I thought her ball dress was stunning. Ron and Harry will have to fight not to be stereotyped after seven HP movies, if they go that far. One thought I had about Ms. Rowling's message was that it might be about the hell we put our young children through in the name of \\"healthy\\" competition. Then again, she might just be telling a story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Two-Disc Special Edition, All this has is the film.","review":"Contrary to what others may tell you, all this copy has is the Film itself, nothing more, nothing less. If you truely want a good copy, get the two-disc special edition. It has far more materieal, including Deleated Scenes!

The entire Qudditch World Cup took place in less than 2 minutes when in the book, it lasted chapters!!! In Sorcerer's Stone they spent hours on stupid details the moviegoer didn't need, but nooo. In Goblet, they can't even put in the veelas! (What's up with that? Fleur's 1/2 veela, come ON!) And they totally left out the sphenix in the maze.

It is not. The writing competes with the direction for the title of bad.They could have cut out a large portion of boring fluff. I literally fell asleep watching it. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful! What a disappointment!","review":"I was incredibly disappointed with this film! Goblet of Fire is my favorite book of the series, but the movie absolutely massacred the story! Most of Rita Skeeter's storyline was cut, the maze at the end was a joke, and the Dursleys' were left out altogether! This is a perfect example that a hastily slapped-together movie is simply no substitution for a fantastic book. Sadly, there were be tons of people who will see this film and skip the book, and will never experience how wonderful the book truly is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie.","review":"This is one heck of a great movie. I own this special 2-disc edition. Just don't get the movie, get the special features as well.Here is the plot: When Harry's name emerges from the Goblet of Fire, he becomes a competitor in a grueling battle for glory among 3 wizarding schools - the Triwizard Tournament. But since Harry never submitted his name for the the tournament, who did? Now Harry must confront a deadly dragon, fierce water demons and an enchanted maze only to find himself in the cruel grasp of Voldemort himself. In this fourth adaptation of Rowling's series, everything changes as Harry, Ron & Hermione leave childhood forever and take on challenges greater that anything they could've imagined.A Mike Newell Film.

They seems like really nice and down to earth people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything changes in this one...","review":"i recommend that diehard Harry Potter fans buy this film to complete their collection, and this film marks the rough transition of her three main characters (Harry, Ron and Hermione) from childhood into young adulthood, but i feel the plot makes too many twists and turns before the audience understands how these plot threads loosely build into the main story of Voldemort's return to the physical universe and his deeper connection to Harry.Steve Kloves is one of the best screenwriters to this date and he had the difficult job of turning a fun, exciting-but-sprawling story into a cohesive development; 5/5.Emma Watson is an absolute visual treasure, and watching Hermione blossom into a beautiful young woman is breathtaking; 5/5.'...Goblet of Fire' is really the difficult turning point for Harry in the series in so many ways, and Dan Radcliffe convinced me in this movie that he can make me forget about Dan and believe Harry; 5/5my rating: 4/5"},{"rating":"1","title":"Removal of the movie?!","review":"This was a great movie in the theatre, even though they left out about 30% of the book. My biggest beef with this Widescreen edition is the fact that they took out ANOTHER hour of the movie!! The DVD case states that the movie is 159 minutes. Well the credits end at closer to 99 minutes. The DVD case also states that the special features are not rated or closed captioned. There ARE no special features!!This is a terrible knockoff of the movie. My wife is on her way to take it back to the store so we can try and get the deluxe 2-disk edition in the hopes that they actually had the whole movie. I don't see why you would waste a dual-layer DVD with 99 minutes of content and 0 special features. Sad. Very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mutilation","review":"I'm very big fan of Harry Potter series (book) that's why my soul is in pain every time they choose horrible directors than seem not to have ever, ever touch a Harry Potter book in their life. The movie mutilates the book, I know they can't do a 4 hours movie, but they can do it in 2 parts of 2 hours so you do not loose important sub-plot, like the relationship, between Harry and Sirius, or the fact that in the movie Albus Dumbledore act as I thought the Albus Dumbledore would never in my wildest dreams would act, pushing Harry around, and I now that if you are a fan of this books you should have cry in that part too.In conclusion this movie was made for people who never read the book, never will read the book and do not care about it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"LOVE IT!

That said, this movie was a major improvement over the 3rd film. In Goblet of Fire, they at least followed the plot line reasonably well. However, the cutting out of most of the beginning of the book was rather disappointing. On the positive side, the characters (especially Harry Ron and Hermione) really developed in this movie. Also, the Triwizard tournement was just as good as in the book other than that they took out much of the 3rd task.

I spent most of the time whispering explanations to those who never read the books (though they had seen all the films at least ten times each).Apart from that the transitions were non-existent, making for a very choppy movie. It seemed that the movie tried to satisfy the fans by adding all the favorite scenes (the ferret!) but they failed. The scenes make little to no sense without the rest of the plot. They also tried to please someone with the hugely overdone dragon scene. It was idiotic. Where was the need for it? Couldn't they have just shortened that scene and a few other similarly overdone scenes, and instead, added a few transitions to make this movie run more smoothly? Would that have been too much work?I just home no.5 will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"it is exactly what was described would gladly buy it again if I needed it, am very happy with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire","review":"Our granddaughter requested this for Christmas, since it features one of her favorite young actors, as well as continues the saga of Harry Potter.

I like the dark and more grown-up way they are making these films. The first two where ok, but when the film Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban came out in summer 2004 it took the films to a new level and this one does the same thing. Seeing it on the big screen is much better then watching it on a TV no matter how big of a TV you might have, but I can not wait to get this one on 3-7-06! The film is not as good as Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban mostly due to the fact that Alfonso Cuarón made that film so perfectly but Mike Newell did a great job and I still give this film 5 stars! It is a must have and one of the best films of 2005!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the book","review":"I know you can't take a book as long as this one and include every single scene.But, they could have at least tried to make some attempt to preserve what was so good about the book in the first place.The story in the book is much more complicated and interesting than in the movie. It's as if they took an orange, scooped out all the pulp, poured in water, high fructose corn syrup and artificial orange flavour and said, here you go, here's an orange.They made too many cuts to the story that didn't add to the plot and added things that weren't in the book that did nothing to move the story along.Too many unnessasary changes just makes for a messy movie which is confusing to all who haven't read the book.I say, just skip this movie.

Other's have pointed out that it does not follow form to the book, however, as one who has never read one of the books, the film alone is very entertaining. Something had to be left out or this film would have probably passed the four hour mark.As usual, great visual effects. I loved the entry of the two rival schools. Sorry, I now know that they aren't private schools for boys or girls, but it was very entertaining the way it was presented...and isn't that the final point?It was also interesting how the characters have grown up and are recognizing their hormones.

I cant believe that Daniel radcliffe could even be asked to come back and continue to play his role in the movies. His acting is beyond amateur. He has no facial expressions, and he is just plain boring, his voice and his posture is atrocious. As for emma watson, what is with the constant angriness ? In almost every scene she seems to be shouting, or crying, or being angry. Well she needs to learn that harry potter is not some hollwyood blockbuster drama, but a childrens comedy, and by her acting in the movie, she just clarifies that she doesnt have the skills to do any other movies.

They sure wasted a lot on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visually great, muddy plot.","review":"This movie looks great, but I really had no idea what the plot was about. Who the heck is Barty Crouch Junior?Th weakest of the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cut out!","review":"Remember when you went to see this movie in the theater? It was almost three hours long, if my memory serves me. When you buy the DVD you would assume, unless told otherwise, that you are getting AT LEAST as much material as the film version. But not so with this movie! I was very disappointed to find that they had cut material throughout this movie to bring the viewing time under 2 hours. This was painfully obvious to me from the very first scene to the last, and I only saw the movie once in the theater; I can't imagine what a disappointment this is going to be to the REAL fans who may have seen it numerous times. I say save your money until they come out with the FULL movie... which I think they eventually will, after this sham of a version has gotten all the money out of the marketplace that it can. I feel so cheated with this DVD that I am compelled to write my first review, and I hope it helps you avoid wasting your money like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big fan of the book, but give me a break British Hollywood","review":"Harry Potter is getting too old, and I even think he is gaining weight (right along with the rest of the cast). I am not sure that I can handle 2 hours of the British accent, and the whole thing is totally predictable if you read the book, they hardly make any changes...nice try guys. But a big ZERO for me!One last thought for those considering whether to watch this movie, (and I am not trying to be critical here, just honest...every movie deserves at least three stars because someone worked very hard to get it on the big screen and then on DVD, and besides I don't think we should be judging everyone.) don't you think we have seen enough Harry Potter for awhile? Its getting stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best \\"Harry Potter\\" Movie Yet (As of 2005)","review":"The first film in the series to receive a PG-13 rating (instead of a PG), \\"Goblet of Fire\\" is definitely scarier than the first three (which were already scary to some extent), but it is also the best \\"Harry Potter\\" movie so far. It is very rare for a film franchise to improve with each subsequent installment, but as any fan of the books can tell you, author J.K. Rowling's storytelling abilities are consistently strong, and the characters of both the books and the films are continuing to evolve and deepen, making them easily relatable to readers and audiences. The now-teenaged actors who portray Harry, Ron, and Hermione have also improved in each film, and their performances in the new film are less amateurish than any of their previous ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goblet of Fire DVD","review":"As with the other reviewers, I am a HUGE fan of the Harry Potter book series. That said, I also Loved Goblet of Fire. However, I was a bit disappointed. Of course, the movie could not include every bit of the story. But, they did great jobs on Alastor Moody. OK job on Victor Krum. One big disappointment was Fleur Delacour. In the book, she was supposedly part-Veela. The Fleur in the movie wasn't even all that pretty. Her hair wasn't waist-length and wasn't silver blond. Correcting this would not have made the movie any longer. If they had made the dragon task, as it was in the book, they could have time to add the hilarious bit at the Dursleys. Probably the most disappointing task was the maze. No magic was necessary in at all. And magic is the name of the game in these movies. It wouldn't have taken very much more time to add a monster or two to the maze. We saw Harry use \\"Accio...\\" twice. I doubt there was any more magic used. I hope \\"Order of the Phoenix\\" follows the magic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another confusing product description","review":"So the two-disc set is supposed to have additonal scenes but the running time is still 157 minutes.

Some people think the movie was missing some important stuff like S.P.E.W. and such. But, that DOESN'T mean this movie can't be good. It would be best if you read the book before seeing the movie because the beginning is so fast paced that it can be confusing if you don't have background knowledge of J.K. Rowling's series, like the Portkey scene. They just huddle around and before you know what's going on, they're flying around in the air holding a shoe. Yeah. Confusing. But, the book was humongous and it will be hard to get everything in it. I did want to see Winky though. Anyway, the point is, if you read the book, you shouldn't be dissapointed.

Sadly, it came to my attention that the studio (WB) decided to release the pricey DVD's without them being extended. So we will get the continued documentary and a couple of extras that are pretty pointless and the same movie we have always had. No matter what the reason was for them releasing it this way, it is very disappointing because they advertised the entire series to be coming out as EXTENDED....I bought the first two (after already owning them on regular edition DVD) only to find out it was a waste of time because the rest of the series may not be extended... what's the point?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (Ultimate Edition)","review":"Do not fall into the trap that warner Brothers have set upif you have already purchessed the original reless do not botherbuying this one...this is not the version shown on ABC family.

It was so-so for the first fifty pages, but after that point I felt as if I was slogging through mud. Get to the friggin' mountain already, Bilbo!

Truly, you need to widen your reading experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsatisfying!","review":"This book is a shame because J.R.R. Tolkien writes very well; but the topic is not interesting at all.

It only works on ipad, iphone and ipod touch (after purchase and trying to make it work on my FIRE, I finally put it on my ipad). I guess that's okay (and listening to Tolkien's actual voice is really COOL!) but it seems RIDICULOUS that on the Kindle FIRE, built to play audio and video, you can't read this book. Seems like Amazon is shooting themselves in the foot by only having it play on Apple devices! I hope that they fixes this soon so I can have it on my FIRE too.

He is invited to share with them a journey as a burglar. At first Bilbo turns him down but soon 13 dwarves are in his house and convince him to reconsider. He decides to go with them and hurries to meet up with them. The party's goal is to journey to the Lonely Mountains to retain a treasure stolen from their ancestor from the evil dragon Smaug. Along the way they are attacked by various fairy tale creatures and meet a creature named Gollum. Scared by Gollum's odd ways and trickery, Bilbo uses the ring that he has stumbled upon in the tunnels. Gollum goes crazy and tries to get him but Bilbo narrowly escapes. The journey goes on and things change for Bilbo and he returns to his hobbit-hole a totally different person.

I decided that Fantasy is probably not my favorite genre, however, the the book was still good and I would recommend it.\\"The Hobbit\\" tells the story of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit, along with Gandalf the wizard and a band of dwarves taking a journey to try and reclaim treasure taken from the dwarves ancestors by an evil dragon.For someone used to reading books grounded closer to reality, the plot of this book may sound kind of funny.

The main characters were believable and down to earth, yet the story itself was epic. As a stand alone story it is a wonderful read, but when combined with the Lord of the Rings trilogy, it makes for what I consider to be one of the greatest fantasy stories of all time. I reread these stories at least every 2 years, and it never ceases to capture my interest and stimulate my imagination. If you've never read it, do so now. If you've tried it once and didn't like it, give it a try again. One thing this story requires is a little patience. But don't most things that enrich our lives?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit","review":"I read The Hobbit as a school literature group assignment. Before reading it I had never read any other books written by J.R.R Tolkien. The Hobbit story is a wonderful story about a hobbit named Bilbo and a great adventure he has. The way Tolkien made the characters was amazing and how each and everyone is different in many ways. I will definitly read the other sequels to the lord of the rings story. If you like a great fantasy adventure book this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Fantasy Prelude I've Ever Read","review":"I have read this book and I loved it. It is good almost from the start. I prefer it over the Narnia series prelude 'The Magicians Nephew' which I've also read. The Hobbit is better than most of the books in the Narnia series. It should be required reading, tying in adventure and fantasy and making a pretty little bow.Plus, with Houghton Mifflin, the Original Publisher, you can't go wrong. Happy Reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit","review":"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien is a beautifully written and a very original story. It is a great adventure book for all ages. The Hobbit is a timeless masterpiece, and it will thrill readers for years to come. The main character, Mr. Bilbo Baggins, is a quirky little hobbit on a rather remarkable quest. He takes the reader over mountains, across rivers, and through battles. This book is nonstop excitement from start to finish. I highly suggest this novel to anyone looking for an adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Open up your minds","review":"I have just read the reviews of this book, and I want to say to everyone, past and future, to practice what Samuel Taylor Coleridge called \\"a willing suspension of disbelief.\\" Forget about stylistic problems and tongue-twisting placenames, this is a story meant to be enjoyed at face value. Sheer delight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Going on an adventure!","review":"I read \\"The Hobbit\\" because I had already read \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy and adored it. Therefore, it's hard for me to think of The Hobbit without comparing and contrasting it to the trilogy. First off, The Hobbit bears all of Tolkien's genius: descriptive passages that are more like a painting than a paragraph, clever poetry and songs, and an imaginary world that has come to life with Tolkien's inventive language and culture of the characters. When one reads Tolkien, it's like reading about a real place. However, the one thing that I really did not like about \\"The Hobbit,\\" especially in comparison to LOTR, is that there is very little character development. I often had trouble keeping track of names because the characters just don't do much besides have adventures. On the whole, I give this book 4 stars for its creativity, originality, adventurous plot, and beautiful language."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't wait for the movie!","review":"This is the second time I've read The Hobbit.

The adventure Bilbo embarks is one to envy. The most outstanding detail about Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\" is the books natural flow, as it simply carries you along as you slowly and cheerfully deepen into the quest. One of my favorite characters is by far, Beorn. Sadly, if you haven't read Tolkien's \\"The Hobbit\\", I shan't be able to tell you more about him than he is a fascinating character. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-time favorite","review":"One of my favorite fantasy books of all time. Personally, I enjoyed The Hobbit much more than Lord of the Rings.

If you like adventure books you will love The Hobbit! The main character is a hobbit. Hobbits are small man-like creatures. Bilbo Baggins isn't looking for an adventure, but he ends up going on one. There are 13 dwarves, and a Wizard. They are trying to kill a dragon and get the stolen money from the dragon and give it to the owners. Bilbo has to fight goblin's, troll's, and on the way he finds a magic ring that makes him invisible when he puts it on.I like the Hobbit because the ring is so cool, and the book is so exciting when he's talking to a slimy character named Gollum while he risks his life in a riddle competition. The book is so exciting!You should read this book!Warning: The first two chapters are boring but at chapter three the adventure begins! If you like this book there is a second called \\"The Fellowship of the Rings\\" by J.R.R. Tolkien"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any avid reader!","review":"I paid the extra money and bought the hardback illustrated version of The Hobbit.

I highly recomend this book to anyone considering purchasing it. The illustrations are hand-painted and are of a very high quality. The book is printed on glossy paper, with very good binding.

It is a fabulous book of tales of wonder and courage. Tolkien really makes you understand the characters and their feelings.

I feel sorry for everyone that just doesn't understand fantasy and gave it a 1. I guess that is the real test of a book though: does it draw out peoples emotions. Almost all the reviews gave it a 10 or 9, then the next most given was 1. This is a big leap: form best book ever writen to worst, not even something in the middle, only extrems. Another way to tell if a book is good is by reading all the reviews of it and how manny: a bad and unremarkable book is unnoticed, while a good book is talked about. All the other reviews told about the plot and it's merrits, read them and this book. If you like it, read LotR."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neglected classic","review":"In the shadow of the Lord of the Rings, all too many have neglected the immensely creative, clever, exciting, and ultimately satisfying prequel, The Hobbit.

It is relatively short, yet plants the seeds for the huge trilogy that follows, as well as telling a ripping good tale.

Most of all you get to see how \\"the ring\\" comes into the hands of Bilbo.The book has some good conflicts that the characters get into to, but of course they always get out them with the help of some Gandalf or some of his enchanted friends.If you like the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" movies then your sure to like the prelude to all the exitment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright...","review":"With The Lord of the Rings comming out I picked up The Hobbit about three weeks ago and tried to read it.

However I'm just reaching page 250 in this book and though everyone promised me it would get interesting I'm still waiting.I find Bilbo an interesting character but quite frankly he didn't pull at me like characters such as Harry Potter and Novalee Nation.

Shame on all of the people who gave it 5 stars and encouraged me to read it. It was boring. There was no character development outside of Bilbo, and I despised his character.

I thought that once I'd finished it that I was through, but I wasn't so lucky. My teacher then forced us to read the first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy.

I like how the series is set up, so that each book is an adventure of it's own and reading the other books only helps one better understand the books as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit","review":"My grandaughter ordered this book and she is 8 years old.

At that time it was probably my favorite book (I was 9.) Here it is all these years later and I still really enjoy this great book. Not to long ago I read it to my children and I was again amazed at how well Tolkien takes his readers and actually brings them to Middle Earth.

The illustrations are absolutely beautiful and add so much to the reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the jaded or hardcore fantasy fan","review":"After browsing the other comments on this book, I'd like to point out three things. Firstly, do not read this book if you're a jaded individual with an inability or unwillingness to appreciate an innocent and charming tale. Secondly, stay away from it if you're a hardcore fantasy reader who began with more modern writers. You'll likely be disapointed (conversely, if you don't generally care for fantasy, you may just love this book, as I did). Finally, don't even attempt to read it if you consider the TV Guide listings to be a challenging read with a complex plot and too many characters. On a final note, I first read this book as an adult and did not find it to be \\"too childish\\" as some suggest and yes, I've read a few other books, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simplt the finest epic fiction ever crafted.","review":"The Hobbit is the introduction to the brilliance of Tolkien and the wonderful world of Middle Earth. The development of Bilbo, and his supporting cast, draw the reader into their lives and adventures like no other fantasy ever written. With the addition of the Lord of the Rings, often mistakenly listed as a trilogy (it was originally written as one book with three parts), the world of Middle Earth continues to evolve and grow, and fall into greater turmoil. Tolkien creates characters and societies with real prejudices, fears, mistrust, and needs that the perceptive reader can readily identify with and understand. If I was to own but two works of fiction, the Hobbit and the Lord of the Rings would comprise my collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny, a great long distance drive listen.","review":"Outstanding.

It is not a book that you read just for fun. This a book of lore, where everyone can find answers to all questions. This book gives you clear understanding of what is good and what is evil. Actually, it was not written by Tolkien - he just translated it fron The Red Book of Westmarch, the Cronicles of the Shire and the Middle-earth. Have you ever wondered how a small weak creture can change world's history? Read this book, which is just a foreword to the great epic of 'The Lord of the Rings' and'Silmarillion'"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read!","review":"Of all the fantasy books I've read, the Hobbit is one of the best.J.R.R. Tolkien takes a nice, quiet creature such as a hobbit and creates anexciting, enchanting, and all around enjoyable adventure,complete with horrible monsters, fire breathing dragons,dark forests, Elven castles, dwarves, giant spiders, and breath taking battles.And along the story you get to know the characters,as if its not a book but an adventure with friends.From the moment you start reading the book Tolkien's specialstyle captures the imagination,making you want to keep reading it to the very end.If you have any interest in fantasy or mythology,or if you just want to read a good book,The Hobbit or There and Back Again is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit (Collector's Edition)","review":"I found this novel to be well presented in the hardcover format. It is pleasant to look at, and the texture has also made it unique to itself. The print is a good size for the younger readers who are wishing to get into this form of writing.The story itself was great. It gave a lot of insight to how the events surrounding the Lord Of The Rings novels came about. Having read those novels first, 'The Hobbit' answered alot of questions I had. For example; how Bilbo got the ring from Gollum, how the red dragon was involved, the trolls and how they turned to stone. Confusion is gone, and there is more understanding about certain events and situations which take place.I feel it is a fantastic read for anyone who enjoyed the 'LOTR' novels and wish to discover more of the journeys which lead to those events taking place. It can be a little hard to get into, but once you are there, everything falls into place and you don't want to stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's The Hobbit Stupid!!!","review":"Well, is this better than any other trade paperback version of The Hobbit?

The truth is though that these are the most tacky and tasteless editions I've seen and the print and paper quality of both books is very poor. The colouring of the drawings in The Hobbit is a disgrace and numerous pages in my copy of the LOTR were so smudged they were unreadable.Don't buy them if you haven't already and if you've already made the mistake send them back with a complaint and write a scathing review to try and save someone else the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The actual audio for this audiobook is enjoyable (what I was able to listen to) but beware I've now purchased 2 sets of these only to find that the disks were damaged.

Sure it might not be a five star for you(which I thought to make mine)but you will know why teachers get kis to read this book.

After reading the book, I bought the cliff notes, as a last resort, and, they were even as bad as the book!! No help came from them!

The characters are so happy it's annoying. I like characters with a lot of back ground and I like many characters I can relate to. A bunch of identical dwarves don't do the job. They also don't fit the spirit of dwarves, but then again after time they evolved into the grumpy alchoholics fantasy tends to portray them as. All the characters were corny and annoying. Anyway, don't get me wrong about it. I understood it. I loved the Dragonlance chronicles and Wheel of Time which made this book look so childish. I've heard Lord of the Rings is much better so I might read that.

JRR Tolkien created an entire world, several languages and most importantly a story that will stand the test of time. Especially with the Lord of the Rings triology that followed Tolkien made Fantasy books what they are: an anology of our own history, both good and bad. The marshalling of the good powers against Mordor was nothing but WWII written in a fantasy style; superbley done. Most fantasy novels today are old reruns of Tolkiens work; I read some and give the books away; I still have The Hobbit, The Triology and The Simmerelian. The only modern fantasy novels that can compare (though the author is dragging things on a bit) is Robert Jordan's Wheel of Time series.

Highly recommend it if you are of the sort who loves a good adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The great children's book","review":"What some people don't seem to realize is that The Hobbit predates The Lord of the Rings. Tolkien didn't anticipate just what his larger work would be about, but he worked it around a lot of the elements in The Hobbit.This first book was not written as a prequel, but as a story in itself. It lacks the epic scale, being more of a children's bedtime story, and an incredible one at that. If you've read it after reading The Lord of the Rings, expecting something in the same vein, you're not going to find it. You'll get a rich tale with no peer in children's fiction, written for the sheer enjoyment. The complexities of Middle-Earth are absent, and the excitement of the quest is the focus.Growing up I had the good fortune of having The Hobbit read to me over and over. When I was old enough to take on the Ring trilogy, it was a joy to see the mysterious land of Tolkien's imagination grow into a whole history. I suppose this is the ideal way to experience The Hobbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobbit is endless....","review":"When I compare this story to those in the Harry Potter series, the Hobbit fails to impress. The Hobbit seems to be endless (I am still reading it) , but not in a way that holds my interest. I can't imagine reading another book in this series.I am not a kid, I am 78 and started reading Harry Potter when I was 68. I read a great deal and I have gone back and re-read books from my past including Silas Marner and others. I read War and Peace for the first time this past fall - it is a brilliant story.I recently read The Life of PI which was a good tale.Clearly, the Hobbit and other stories by Tolkien have wide appeal - it least the films - , but not for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Masterpiece","review":"This novel that the immortal Mr. Tolkien penned will abide in my heart forever. Yes, the reading level is probably 8th grade, this does not negate the fact that this book holds the title of \\"Timeless Masterpiece\\". Anyone that reads this book will be transported to an incredible land of magic and wonder. Mr. Baggins is comical yet completely lovable as the reluctant burglar. The scene with Bilbo and Thorin near the end still pulls at my heart after all these years. As a prelude to the fantasy epic \\"Lord of the Rings\\" books, it is an essential primer for them. I urge parents to encourage their children to read. This is one of my favorite books and will surely become one of yours and your child(ren)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best fantasy book ever","review":"A classic without age.

Going back and re-reading the Hobbit as a part of working my way through NPR's list of the Top 100 SciFi books of all times was a little disappointing. By comparison to the subsequent LOTR series, The Hobbit seemed to lack a cohesives story and had a less than complete ending. It falls short in comparison to LOTR in scope, somewhat in detail and in a unifying theme other than being a unique tale set in an imaginary world populated by strange beings.All that said, I would recommend that you certainly start with this book before reading the LOTR series as I think if you read The Hobbit after LOTR you may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Very adventurous and mysterious to conclude to be full of a burglar and the prelude to his great adventures!

It is a rambling adventure/story that is very interesting and light-hearted. It talks about the adventures of a certain hobbit who, possibly due to queer heritage, is persuaded to go on an Adventure, unlike most other hobbits who stay at home and are respectable. The wandering storytelling is delightful to read and illustrates the change of the hobbit, as well as providing the Ring that was the subject of the series ahead.I liked this book from the start to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit","review":"This book was boasting with the great imagination of J.R.R Tolkein.

Like all great art, I see and understand more with each successive foray into Middle Earth. Tolkien's talent is indeed rare, for he possesses that much-sought-after skill of transporting his audience into a world that seems to be quite independent of author and reader alike. Indeed, one's impression is that this world has been and will continue to be whether or not he continues to read, and his position is that of the privileged observer. It is in every regard the most enjoyable type of story.

I was excited to listen to the BBC Radio version of the Hobbit because not only do I love the story, I love listening to great stories while driving in my car, which is why I own several audio books. This version of The Hobbit was very poorly executed. The voices were sometimes whispers and sometimes too loud, the accents were unbearable, and the music was too loud during some points and just plain awful. I honestly could not force myself to listen to any more of it once I had gotten through the first two discs. I feel bad for anyone who listens to this and has not previously read The Hobbit. For anyone who does not already know the story, they would probably be confused story-wise and would have a bad impression of the book itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is a classic!

Sat down for a evening of reading pleasure before the fireplace and three chapters into the book I had to shut it off in disgust. The lines throughout those first chapters were often repeated, misplaced, or just plain missing. I could have found the One Ring faster than try to follow the bad editing mistakes from one page to the next. I do not know how the written work is transferred from book to e-book, but when they did the Hobbit, someone hit the mead a bit early. It is a shame to take any author's work and make this big of a mess of it. Stay with the RL books for this selection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good quality book in a protective case.

There are none except for what you see in the preview. The book has some illustrations by Tolkein but that's it.

But still, when I read this book I was at a point where I was reading four hundred-page novels per two to three days, but it took me hours to get through the first couple chapters.

For an adult to enjoy this novel is just beyond my belief. I am 14 myself and after reading it it was plainly ment for parents to read to their 6 or 7 year olds as they fall asleep.

There is so much to this story that is missed when you first read it for plot, which is typically what is done when you read something for your High School English class. This time, enjoy a slower pace and drink in the awesome details and background to one of the jewls of the English language literature. The increidible journey of 13 dwarves and one hobbit, which became the spark and foundation for the Lord of the Rings, is rich in detail that will only enhance your appreciation for these amazing stories.

But fear not, for there are people who try to defend Middle Earth from such things, such as the elves of Elrond, dwarves of Morlia and other men of Middle Earth.

Telling a story of how one small individual makes a BIG (especially in view of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\") impact on the world, this story is an inspiration as well as a captivating story.

Perhaps it gets better upon rereading many times? If I could ever make myself reread it.Now, I am a HUGE fantasy reader; if I'm not reading classic literature, I have a fantasy novel in my hand. Therefore, I should be predisposed to love The Hobbit, right? Not so, apparently. I've picked up and started the book three times. I just cannot get into it. The characters are flat and boring and their actions do not inspire or excite me. I had to make myself sit down and read it, which took a very long time with many books read in between. I am a great reader and love nothing more than to sit down with a book, so when there is a book that I must force myself to read (which haven't been all that many) then that says something to me.In some ways I envy all those who adore this book; what are you getting out of it that I am not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really???","review":"It's been nearly 3 weeks and it hasn't shipped yet.

You really feel as though you are on the journey with the characters. I gave it four stars because I am not quite finished with it but so far I am really enjoying it.

I personally could never get through it, but I've gotten about halfway various times, and I don't care for it. The reading level is about the same a Black Beauty, which I read in second grade. However, you never get to really like any characters, and there isn't any kind of theme. As Tolkein says, if you like there-and-back again kind of books, read the Hobbit. I would recommend it to middle school boys who enjoy action figures and role playing battle games. And people with no life and lots of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't an exciting book up until the very end","review":"This book didn't expand my imagination, like Harry Potter does. It was slow moving, and quite uneventful, until the very end. The book didn't become decent, until it was almost over. The ending was exciting. But every event up until then meant very little to me and did very little for me. I didn't even like the style in which the book was written. I actually give it 2 and half stars, because it wasn't horrible. At one point I did enjoy reading it. I just didn't think it was the great book every says it is.

It is a story that is wholesome as in you are happy for your children to read it and has adventure and excitement but leaves you feeling pretty good. I am always sorry when I get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit (a darn good book)","review":"The main character is Bilbo Baggins, This creature is a Hobbit. They are furry footed beings with a non-adventuress personality. Bilbo was no exception, At first he didn't even think about adventures. By the end Bilbo seemed like it was his personal destiny to be in adventures. He is a very funny and intresting charater with many good qualities. I like this book, this is because it is in a whole different world where anytyhing could happen. It is a story with many high points, and suspension. Many parts where victory seems hopeless but they always get out. The only problem I have with the book is the nearly 120 pages it took to develop the story for some action."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hobbit, a gem","review":"I have been told that i am sad for reading the Hobbit. That it is a childs book. My mum read it to me when i was young and i read it again when i was 13. Having just re read it at the age of 15 i would say read it.Do not shoot staright into the Lord Of The rings. Read this first. Become a child again. Tolkien writes this like a kids book. But i know many adults who love this book and have read it numerous times.Bilbo Baggins is just a normal Hobbit intill one day gandal and some mighty dwarves come along and they are take him onto a quest to kill a dragon. Sounds lame doesnt it? Well dont be stupid, read it with pleasure. Carry it around in the park. Read it before you go to bed.This is a very good read and i reccomend it to all fans of adventure and anybody who is interested in Tolkien. A nice, fluffy, light read"},{"rating":"2","title":"oldie but GOODIE","review":"Wonderful reading for any agegroup. While not required, it's a good introduction to the Ring Cycle.

I still wonder how J.R.R. Tolkiens thought of so many marvelous creatures, characters, and adventures, and weaved it in with wonderful writing and words. In The Hobbit, Bilbo Baggins is a very lovable Hobbit who goes on a very perilous adventure with a party of dwarves. It involves goblins, giant spiders, a dragon named Smaug, and many other spectacular things. If you love adventure you must read this book, or else you're missing out on a journey you'll never forget."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're a real fan, this is a must have","review":"It's great to finally have an unabridged version of this book. The narrator does all the voices, and even sings the songs. Some characters sound a little more pompous that I would have liked, but there you go. I have loaded the Nicol Williamson version of this onto iTunes, but it is heavily abridged, only 4 hours long. This one is 11 plus hours. If you (like me) are going to load these onto iTunes, get ready for many hours of work. The book is 16 disks long. And it seems that the data for each disk was written by a different person, so you will have to make many alterations. But it's all worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books ever","review":"I'm just going to say this is the second best book I have ever read (Lord of The Rings being the best).

I wasn't very familiar with fantasy books, so my teacher suggested to me the Hobbit, promising that I'd never want to put it down. Sure enough, she was right. As I read into the book, I was amazed at the descriptive words and adventurous plot! Because the beginning and closing dragged on quite a bit, I rated this book a four star.

Especially for those who have a leaning toward mythology and fantasy. The characters and adventures that Bilbo meets and gets involved with are truly portrayed by Tolkein in such a way as to become increasingly realistic and personal to you. And Gandalf, the wizard, always arrives just when Bilbo needs him. Golum, am unforgettable character, who 'hisses' the title of \\"my precious', is the keeper of one of the three rings that turns out to be the key factor in 'The Lord of the Rings' (a must read)! This ring, when worn on the finger, makes you invisible and was very helpful to Bilbo when meeting up with the dragon as well as in other crisis times of his adventure.The Trilogy is an awesome and stimulating fantasy that pulls you into its magical world and makes you feel as if you are there!A classic, unforgetable reading experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic Tale","review":"I have read the Hobbit, and I must say that I have truly enjoyed it very much.

I recommend everyone to read this book, young and old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rob Inglis is unabridged","review":"Paul Jones is referring to the BBC version. That one is abridged. The Rob Inglis version is unabridged and is 10 CD's long. If you loved the book, you'll likely love Rob Inglis' reading. If you didn't like the book, you probably won't like this. But what are you going to do while you're driving to work if you don't listen to this ;-)? I give it 4 stars because I don't like opera and Inglis sings the songs from the book. Wonder where he got the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful package for a classic story","review":"I won't go into how great this book is in this review -- if you're looking at the collector's edition, chances are you're either already a Tolkien fan, or you're considering this as a gift for someone who is. Suffice it to say that this and the accompanying trilogy are great for anyone's reading list. I bought this edition as a gift for my husband to replace the beat-up paperback copy he'd had for years.This particular edition of _The Hobbit_ is a very high quality, handsome book. It comes in a slipcase, and the spine of the book is embossed in gold and metallic red. The cover is a textured, leatherlike material -- I am not sure what it is made out of, but it feels nice. Inside, the paper is all good quality, the binding is strong, and the pictures (drawn by Tolkien) are beautiful, printed on glossy paper.This book would make an excellent gift for anyone who has read and enjoyed this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE HOBBIT IS FIRST CLASS READING!","review":"This is not the best book I have ever read, however it is impossible to put down once opened.

There are appendixes with A Chronology of the First Age, Genealogical Tables, and Conversion of page references to Houghton Mifflin Editions.Some may think this guide is geared towards those that already have a basic knowledge of Middle earth.

The Hobbit's fastidious and succulent detail overwhelmed my juvenile psyche and truly pulled back the veil of what was to me at the time a world of brilliant literature, ensconced within the lugubrious arcane words upon the pages of tomes I feared to open. This book is the perfect initiation for a young reader into the imaginative majesty that is literature and I cannot recommend this book enough. I just purchased the e-book and have read it to my 8 year old daughter and she has read it back to me with the fire of illumination smoldering within her voice and scintillating from her eyes.

I'm not too big into the fantasy genre--I still haven't read the Harry Potter books, and I stopped with Tolkien's works after I read The Hobbit. As I began to read the book, I felt myself drifting off and not thinking about the book. I just could not get into it. By the middle, I was forcing myself to pay attention, but still, I was unsuccessful. I finally managed to finish the book, and all I could think of, was that I was glad it was over with.

I then began the hobbit after seeing the movie and I couldn't stop reading it. It's a classic that I think everyone should be exposed to. The only reason I didn't give it a five is that it read like a children's story and although that may be how it was intended to come across I found it confusing at first.

In fact, if I were to meet a hobbit, I should hope it to be Bilbo.What Bilbo brings is boldness in the midst of genuine concern over the task at hand. He is afraid, but not so much that he doesn't rise to occasion.Delicious language. Images you can taste and smell. A story that matters, and is well-told.Read \\"The Hobbit\\" and be entranced.

Buy this edition if you want to keep it on a book shelf or display on your coffee table or night stand. Because the book is housed in a box that is equal in quality to the binding, the experience of handling and opening the book to read gives a surprizing addition to the pleasure of experincing the tale. The colored glossy illustrations (5) also add a dimension as well as non glossy green and black ones(7). There are maps on the inside covers of The Desolation of Smaug and Wilderland. Runes printed in gold go around the cover of the book. If you are a true Lord of the Rings afficionado or know one, it's time to upgrade that paperback to this superior edition.

The book was fun, Bilbo was an extremely reluctant hero. His adventures just came upon him and he survived in spite of or because of his own bumbling but pure heart. As Bilbo and the dwarves and Gandalf neared their goal of destroying Smaug in his Lonely Mountain lair, there were unintended consequences of their acts to other groups including the community of men down the river. I liked it that things were not so black and white. Certainly this book is a much better read than the movie which I found to be overly somber and incredibly violent with very hard to believe fighting sequences where nobody gets hurt.

It is a very wonderful gift to young \\"Harry Potter\\" fans, because it has the same wonder that captures the imagination. However, seasoned SF/fantasy readers (such as I) will probably see it as merely a stepping-stone for LoTR.

The movie to that particular novel has inspired many people to read the book and The Hobbit is a story related to that.

Fantasy fiction is not really my thing, however, now that I have finally gotten around to reading The Hobbit (many years after high school) I enjoyed it. The Hobbit is a well written, engaging, and oftentimes humorous work of fantasy.

The adventures of Bilbo Baggins, the main character, keep the reader interested and wanting to read more. This novel does a great job of keeping the reader interested. The plot has many small climaxes and resolutions that create a very exciting plot. This novel is also extremely easy to read. It reads quickly also, it can easily be read in a weekend.

In fact, my preoccupation with the language of the Dwarfs led me to decode the rather complicated letters of their alphabet.After reading the book once, I reread it. I spent days or weeks working on clues throughout the book because I was determined to read the messages beginning on Page I, the Author's Note.It was not until I learned the completed alphabet and read the language that I could be satisfied that I had read the entire book.The story is a work of art in the description and storyline of characters and places visited.

I didn't get to know anyone as well as I wanted to. Some people might want to lynch me for having this opinion as this book is almost holy to them on the same level as Lord of the Rings, but I just can't bring myself to give it a 5 star review as there are so many other books that have given me more.I read the Hobbit once as a kid and recently in Januray 2013, and I think that maybe I enjoyed it more as a kid as it feels more like a children's book to me.

The character development is top notch and the book is a very quick read. Tolkien's ingenuity in creating a time and place is surpassed by none. The one odd thing I noticed is that it appears that the Lord of the Rings was written for a more mature audience than the Hobbit.

WRONG! I found it to be extremely silly at the way that Bilbo got out of all the different situations he got himself into. Very very silly and why exactly did he have to be in this grand adventure that Gandalf insisted he be in. Nothing about Bilbo appealed to me and I absolutely found the style way to dry and dull to the point where I had to stop reading it for awhile just to get a refreshed feeling.The only part that was slightly good was with Gollum but I found a lot of the ways that Bilbo solved the riddles so really pathetic that I wondered what the point was. I meen afterall Bilbo is soooooo smart that why even ask a riddle at all? I found Gandalf extremely annoying as well.Sorry but I hardly think Tolkien is deserving of the title 'master of fantasy.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...Its creative but lacks in anything worthwhile","review":"You know, I was so excited to finally read the \\"legendary\\" Hobbit. It turns out that it is a fantasy book for a 3rd grade reading level and a 1st grade imagination. After reading literary masterpieces by Robert Jordan, and Aurther C.

All in all this is a poor piece of literature and I hope dearly that the Lord Of The Rings is a lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Maybe 1 star is a little low for this book...should have given it like...2, but there are just better books. how can this be the best if there is better? i reccomend a better book like Harry Potter(1-4)."},{"rating":"1","title":"STUPIDEST BOOK IN THE WORLD","review":"one day while sitting in my class at school, we watched a movie. instead i chose to read The Hobbit. it should have been good right? after all...it is so famous. i soon learned i was wrong. what a horrible book. do not read it. forget about all the other reviews. they just think bilbo the bimbo is hot. (however they could think that...) STUPID BOOK! id rather be forced to read the story of how grass was given the name grass."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"Yes, I had to read this book in school. It was very very boring. It was about a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins. He went on a big andventure with a bunch of dwarves and a wizard. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I didn't read this collector's edition, but I don't think there is much difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"After writing LotR Tolkien should have hunted all of his Hobbit books and burnt them in a giant bonfire.This book tells about the adventure of Bilbo Baggins, Gandalf and a number of Dwarves (I can't remember the actual number, because all the dwarves were so similar).This book is so silly, juvenile and ridiculously written that it is completely unprecedented.People are defending this book by saying that it's a childrens' book unlike LotR. Well here's some news for you. There are some actually good childrens' books out there.Not all would doom this 1 star, but no way would this book be receiving so many 5 star reviews unless it was written by Tolkien.I'm not saying someone couldn't like it, but from any sane point of view it just isn't *good*. Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Don't waste your time on this book!","review":"Warning: Don't read this book. It'll scare you from reading any other book The Hobbit stinks. The Hobbit is terrible. The Hobbit is down right boring. It's hard to follow and is extremely dumb. It faces in on Bilbo Baggins, a lonely hobbit. Suddenly, he is left with a band of dwarves, who take him on an adventure. All he worries about is that he left his handkerchief at home. While he faces evil orcs, goblins, and wolves, he gains the respect of the other dwarves with the help of a magic ring. He also ends up in mental challenges as well as physical, such as a riddle contest with Gollum, a creature from the sea. The last few chapters about facing the dragon Smaug, are very hard to follow. To tell the truth, I probably don't know how it ends. I strongly recommend that you do not read this book. I think that J. R. R. Tolkien did a terrible job of tying the book together. Unless you want to be bored to death, do not read the famous The Hobbit."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING.","review":"I read this book in my literatuure class and I fell asleep a lot.(If I wasn't sleeping then I wasn't paying attention).

This was a dread to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGET IT!","review":"Unfortunately, I was subjected to read the first twenty or so pages of this book because I got it as a christmas present from my aunty. Not only that, I also received a compendium with the rotten book, which was of no use to me as I was not planning on ever reading it. Feel free to email me if you want this huge waste of time for free, though I strongly recomend you don't! This is a dangerous book and is an extremely bad influence on adolescents. Not only that, it is also more boring than having tea with nan and the relatives.DO NOT, UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Generally I don't like fantasy, but I have always been intrigued by the tremendous reputation of The Hobbit, and read it merely out of curiousity. The book hasn't disappointed me, but hasn't overwhelmed me either. Tolkien's writing is charming, endearing and very enjoyable, but I couldn't really see why The Hobbit is considered one of the 20th century masterpieces. Unless I missed a whole different level of meaning, the book can hardly qualify as serious reading material that is supposed to evoke deep thought, but for what it appears to be, a harmless fantasy tale, it serves its purpose.If you have never read The Hobbit and have some free time on your hands - do read it, if only as a tribute to a classic. If you don't have too much free time - don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"For my money, the best of the Middle Earth books.

The man launched an entire genre of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"Some May have wanted a facimile of the first edition that was changed in later years to reflect the lord of the rings like printing the original riddles in the dark and so on.This has the same forward from the 1987 gold anniversary 50th edition. It is all intents and purposed the same as the 2004 Harper Collins, minus the paper quality and slipcase. The new corrections made i cannot place.The only difference really is the facimile dustjacket of what tolkien would have wanted for the first edition.The size of the illustrations inside and so on.The color tinted pages that i think are included for the first time in America. Not sure if this edition has the moon rune that appears when the map is put to light like the british edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic by Tolkien in hardcover","review":"Ever since I was first swept away by this book when I was in 4th grade, I've had a soft spot for Tolkien's works. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings inspired me to become an English instructor and travel the world in search of adventure. Now, with all the talk of a \\"prequel\\" movie based on The Hobbit, I decided to go back and read it again. For a children's book there is an amazing relevance and persistence of indelible imagery untouched by the decades. The story's moral lessons about the destructiveness of greed and avarice are needed in this era of Wall Street bail-outs and 21st century piracy. My used copy arrived in good condition, but without the charming dust jacket designed by Tolkien. My book just had a plain black cover with a big white inventory sticker that tore into the cover when I peeled it off! This rather disappointing experience has convinced me to avoid this seller in the future. Does anybody have a spare dust jacket they could send me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Th hobbit- a land of fantasy","review":"This book is phenomenal. There is lots of action and adventure. The author uses descriptive writing that helps you easily picture what's happening. They get through many situations with clever thinking and the help of Gandalf, a magical wizard. There are many exciting parts in this book. This book is great for people of all ages.The Notorious J.D.S."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Tolkien's most readable novel: outstanding tale, even if less lustrous than LoTR","review":"The Hobbit is a fantastic novel. The pages practically turn themselves in this tale of Bilbo and the Ring. Bilbo's journey is epic. Our humble hobbit faces up to great dangers, is morally and physically challenged. In the end Bilbo is transformed by the journey: he becomes more courageous, more generous, and more a complete living being. I read this as a twelve year old and absolutely relished every page: it's readability is outstanding. The far more imaginative Lord of the Rings trilogy is often badly written and overdrawn. The later work has obviously lit the fires of fifty million dreams, but this first book is the more taut. While many readers will dislike the trilogy and recoil from its complexities, nearly everyone can enjoy this wonderful story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The hobbit","review":"It was definitely different buy excitng I will reading more from this author it was better than expectedRecommend to all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic!","review":"Probably one of the most well written and complete stories I have ever read and I read daily.

The Hobbit was more amazing than I ever remembered and I loved revisiting this classic story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Tolkien","review":"Loved this book for my Kindle, so easy too! Right to my kindle, no plugging it in and doing anything extra. Just a simple click. Although, it would be nicer if there was a way to double check things with the whisper net thing before you buy it. I ended up buying another book first cause I didn't understand how simple it was. I LOVE my kindle and I love how easy it was to get this awesome book. It's a nice easy read, you don't have to know everything about the books because it's just the beginning. That and just a warning for the reader - you'll want to read the rest of the books!! Not to mention just more Tolkien!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was captivating and it almost addictive.READ IT!","review":"J.R.R. Tolkien has made his best work in The Hobbit. It was almost addictive how he sets the mood for the next chapter. I thoroughly enjoyed it. Bilbo is detailed so well it is just like a movie and his description of the characters is astounding. The story just hooks you from the time of the party at Bilbo's home. I loved it and would recommend it for anyone with a sense of magination and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"REALLY good","review":"Actually I want to give it four and a half stars. It isn't the best book Tolkien has written, but it still is a masterpiece. The best book(s) I think Tolkien has written are the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Still I recommend everyone to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books of all time!","review":"This book was what started the whole thing. The entire fantasy genre owes its roots to Tolkein. Without him, we wouldn't have silly but brave Hobbits, beautiful and wondrous Elves, stalwart dwarves or daughty and prideful Dunedain. Tolkein was the first (and probably the best) writer to fully create a fantasy world that draws you in with its detail, astounds you with the vividness of its characters, and surprise you with the fulness of its history. If you love fantasy, but haven't read this book, then you are definitely missing a classic. Tolkein is one of a very few fantasy authors whose work can be honestly called \\"literature\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST PIECE OF LITERATURE OF ALL TIME!!!!!","review":"This was perhaps the best book of all time second only to his other works.

Some discrepancy's in a few of the illustrations but I still love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Classic","review":"Read The Hobbit 35 years ago for the first time and many times since and throughout my life it has been a joy and a comfort. Knowing that Smaug will be defeated, that Gollum's ring will find it's way to safer pockets with brighter futures and that in the end the inhabitants of Middle Earth are not so different from ourselves. A children's book that grew into so much more. Professor Tolkien's written words are the true magic that the movies can never truely portray. Bought the Kindle version, my paperback is rather 'delicate' from being reread so many times, and illustrations and maps are clear and all included. Will continue on my quest to reread the Tolkien series on the Kindle, what better way to spend the afternoon than with old friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome book!!

Weird thing to complain about I know, but still would've liked it slightly more \\"loved\\" Get this book now, after the movie trilogy comes out evryone is gonna jack the prices on this. Bought this to read to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting and engrossing","review":"I just read The Hobbit for school. I liked it very much. Itis a wee bit childish, but I don't think adults can't appreciate it,too. Besides, it was based on bedtime stories Tolkien told his children, so why shouldn't it be childish? I skimmed over a lot of the descriptive passages at times because I was more interested in just getting it done (That isn't the book's fault, it's just that I wanted to get it done). But what I did read was very descriptive. The adventures were pretty exciting and the story was pretty engrossing. Interesting characters and lively plot, as well. I would like to read the Lord of the Rings books; no doubt they're just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"We were very well entertained by this book.

From start to end, the Hobbit never seases to amaze and delight. With a cast fo characters, ranging from Gandolf, a wizard to Smaug, a dragon, the reader is taken through the ups and downs of the adventure.I would have to say that my favorite part was where Gollum was challenging Bilbo, the hero of this book, to a game of riddles. Here is where the real story begins as Bilbo finds a ring, that Gollum refers to as his precious.This is the best written and thought of book of its kind. A must read for anyone. I give it four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most intriguing and wonderful.","review":"This book is about a hobbit (obviously) who reluctantly agrees to join a (group) of dwarfs who are travelling to the Lonely Mountain to re-claim their gold and jewels that were stolen by the dragon, Smaug. I have found this book most interesting and reccomend it to readers of medium to advanced reading levels, but I also believe that most other people can explore it, at least, to expand their horizons. I, personally, have read it at least four times and am now working on the rest of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-around wonderful novel, but should be read young.","review":"The Hobbit, which is the prelude to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, is an extremely entertaining book for something written so early in the twentieth century, and always gives the reader the impression of belonging to a larger world that is only hinted at in this first novel. Somewhat naive and innocent compared to the immense dark forces displayed in the rest of the trilogy, but if you plan on reading the other books, you absolutely must read The Hobbit."},{"rating":"2","title":"A genius creates a world.","review":"JRR Tolkien is the author of all authors.

That's just what he did until a band of dwarves led by a wizard came with an interesting proposition-stay home safe and happy or help kill a dragon and face certain death? What will Bilbo do? Will he accept? Of all the mysterious and adverturous things in this book there is one drawback. There are so many characters that it gets confusing. But do read the book. To help, write down the characters and a few personality traits to help understand them more. This book is enjoyable for all ages, but is suggested for teens and adults. The plot is amazing and keeps the readers eyes glued to the pages. The story pulls you into it as if you were helping Bilbo and marching off to fight the dragon. The details are magnificent and the adventure is enough to make your heart throb.

For instance, in the first chapter when Bilbo had his visitors and it was time to wash the dishes instead of saying the dishes the author chose to name every single solitary dish(the plates,pots, pans, glasses, cups,etc.) I feel that he lost a lot of interest like that.

The introduction is first rate, though mysteriously it uses end notes while the rest of the book uses annotation in the margin. The notes that delve into the possible sources and influences on Tolkien's thought and work are mostly interesting and informative. The main negative I find is how many marginal notes are devoted to textual variants between the various editions. For example, in the section where the company meets the trolls, a note explains one version has \\"they dropped him\\" while another version has \\"he dropped him.\\" Although the textual variant notes are usually more extensive than this, they are an uninteresting disappointment to me. The level of detail is high, but at times, almost to the point of being pedantic. Still, if you love the work of Tolkien, you will find this version enjoyable as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"12 year old girl hereI personally hated this book.

I read \\"Bilbo blah blah blah,\\" but think \\"Oh what am I gonna do today after school?\\" And then when it somes testing time, I cannot remember a thing I read, and the teacher thinks I didn't read it. I really, truly hate this book. This is the worst book I have ever read! It's even worse than the unabrigded version of \\"The Prince and The Pauper\\", which I was also forced to read against my will. I would have given this book zero stars, but the lowest you are allowed to go is one. DO NOT WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF WASTE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Hobbit","review":"I really did not like this book. There wasn't much interest in it and I did not enjoy this kind of book. There was only one part that was actually good. That was when 13 dwarves came to the service ofBilbo Baggins.

He then sees goblins but I can't tell you all of the book so you will have to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"YYYAAAAAWWWWWNNNN","review":"I think that this book is THE WORST BOOK THAT I HAVE EVER READ!

I almost burned the stupid book and would have if it were mine. I was looking through the reviews for Dragons of Autumn Twilight and someone rated it badly because it was no \\"Hobbit\\" of \\"J.R.R.

My school is forcing me to read it. It is just so boreing. I don't even think my teacher can take it anymore beacause we have been reading it for 3 monthes and we only got up to chapter 10.

Tolkein made me fall in love with his little hobbitt and even though the story telling style was different from the modern fantasy I've read, I became used to it and found myself enjoying it.The action and in this novel never ceased to amaze me. Some authors pack in too much, making the story seem like a disorganized whirlwind while other authors remain painfully stagnant throughout the book. Tolkein proves his talent with well paced action along with very good character development.Although \\"The Hobbitt\\" is written in a different vein from most books written today, it was refreshing and I found myself adapting to it with pleasure.

There are so many different ways you can read this book. Take note of how Bilbo's character changes over the course of the book. Enjoy some witty pieces of dialogue.You can read the book in an isolated, pre-LOTR way, taking into account only what is found in this book. Or you can read it with the Lord of the RIngs in mind.

It's also survived my overzealous seven-year-old, and that, in itself, is quite the feat.As for the actual book--it's content, I mean--there are plenty of reviews about what a wonderful, rich tale Tolkien's created. I can only add to what others have said by stating that this book meant enough to me, as a child (and now as an adult) to be one of those I couldn't wait to pass on to my own children (who, in turn, have embraced it fully)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful.","review":"I loved this book from beginning to end.

But, I have read it several times since then, too, including a refresher before seeing the movie adaptation, and I just want everyone to know that the book grows with you. Each of the 6 or so times I've read it, I've gleaned different aspects and more depth. Maybe as you age and mellow, you are better able to get the deeper content of the story. Now, after seeing the movie, I have been tracking through the book again to check up on what was done right and what wasn't. All in all, it is magnificent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must own literary classic. A great intro to","review":"Lord of the Rings. I remember reading this when I was a little boy.

I knew I would have to have this in hardcover because I would enjoy it forever. My family talked me into getting the illustrated version instead of the leather-bound \\"Collector's Edition\\" and I'm glad they did.

This is a great and classic story about a quest. It was great to see Bilbo's character evolve from beginning to end, as well as get introduced to all the great characters that populate Tolkien's world. I loved Beorn and wished he was more integral to the whole story, but maybe he's in The Lord of the Rings (I've forgotten!). My only gripe is Gandalf - I thought he was extremely underdeveloped and there was so much more we could have learned about him. As a stand alone story, The Hobbit is a classic, but it just felt like Tolkien was going through the motions and saving his best work for his later novels..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful...the second time too.","review":"What a joy to read the wonderful creations of Tolkien's fertile imagination.Now on to the Lord of The Rings!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed classic","review":"This was not an easy tale to read, and I have to admit that it took a few chapters read before I could truly delve in and appreciate the story. The story was well written, especially having been revised from the original 1937 writing.

R. Tolkien that follows the journey of hobbit Bilbo Baggins from his carefree and cheery residence at the Shire to more mysterious and often sinister lands beyond, in the hopes of sharing a treasure guarded by the fearsome Smaug, an ancient and legendary dragon that draws chills from almost everyone who hears his name.It is believed that Tolkien's own personal involvement in World War I had significantly influenced the formation of his novel, and his incorporation of adventure, wits, romance, personal growth, and self-discovery blends itself to deliver a captivating journey that explains the wide critical acclaim it received when first published in 1937. In addition to winning a prize from the New York Herald Tribune for best juvenile fiction, the novel was nominated for the Carnegie Medal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is great for people of all ages.

Since I have now entered Tokein's realm, I have enjoyed it ever so much, I fully plan to read the Lord of the Rings as well. The Hobbit would make a great bedtime story reading (not all at once, of course) as well as a good high school or even college literature class assignment.

They get damaged over time, are sometimes too bulky for my wrists to read for an extended period of time, etc. I did hesitate at first because I was not sure if the maps would be included in this digital version, but after downloading a sample, my question was answered. The digital version comes with all the maps and writings. Most importantly, the table of contents is pretty thorough that I could jump between chapters or go back to check the maps. The only problem with the Mac version is that I could not listen to the audio of Tolkien singing and narrating the chapters... That was a huge disappointment. I bought this particular version because of the promise of audio contents from Tolkien himself. Oh well, it was still less than $7.

It felt like I was listening to J.R.R. himself. The only objection I had was that the narrator sang the songs! I would have preferred him to read them as poetry rather than sing them.

Tolkien is an adventurous, fantasy tale that takes place in the land of the middle earth. However, even with many \\"nail-biting\\"/ action sequences, this story reveals tender and moving themes. Courage, trust, and friendship are the three most dominant themes projected in this tale of adventure. On their quest to restore the dwarves wealth and pride; Bilbo, Gandalf, and the 13 Dwarves encounter numerous challenges of both the emotional and physical nature. Bilbo's revelation from a timid, do-gooder hobbit to a daring thief is the most exciting transformation experienced. Though the story seems to take off at a slow pace, Tolkien's descriptions really pull the reader into the action. If you wish to read of battles with goblins, wargs, spiders, trolls, and the occasional dragon, then don't be turned off by what seems like unnecessary detail in the beginning.

J.R.R.

It was my favorite story that I would not go anywhere without. Sad to say that I annoyed everyone in my household and the book \\"disappeared\\". This was my first time reading this version and I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One book that I would recommend","review":"Excellent narration, epic story and it has all the elements that a reader who loves middle earth fantasies would expect! I recommend reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling surprise","review":"This book was a gift from a family friend who knew of my passion for reading (as a 9yr old kid). But my taste favored more romantic and classical novels and so this book sat neglected on my bookshelf for 10 yrs! Finally, one day I decided to give it a chance and to my surprise I couldn't put it down! I finished the book in a day and in the following 3 weeks devoured the entire Lord of the Rings series which had also been sitting on my bookshelf for years. I have never been a fantasy fan, and still don't consider myself one... which just goes to show how excellent an author J.R.R. Tolkien is to have captured my imagination. The Hobbit is altogether a most charming read, filled with endless moments of adventure, humour and suspense. It is hard not to fall in love with the characters and the fantasy. I recommend this book to any book-lover who would like to sample a master-piece of unsurpassed creativity and imagination. Take it from a convert! *grin*"},{"rating":"2","title":"buyer beware","review":"There are several sellers listed as having this book, but they will ship you the mass market paperback instead. When I tried to call amazon customer service, they were vastly unhelpful for a change. Best bet is to contact the seller BEFORE purchasing to ensure you will receive the GRAPHIC NOVEL instead of the MASS MARKET PAPERBACK.I own a copy of this graphic novel and my 6 year old ADORES this book. This is a wonderful way to get a young person interested in The Hobbit. Yes, it is abridged, but the core story line is intact and the illustrations are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"BeSt The Hobbit!","review":"This is the best The Hobbit book I could find.

I went and saw the midnight showing to the hobbits and thought it is pretty much like the book but some parts were questionable. I love this book and highly recommend it to everyone who is a j.r.r Tolkien fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and Original Edition","review":"Not going to review the story, here. If you want an opinion on that, look elsewhere. This edition is really beautiful. The binding is really elegant, with speckled page edges and gold/red embossing on the cover. Comes with a matching slip case also, which is also very nice.I like to pay particular attention to the page layouts and typesetting, and it's really beautiful. They don't make 'em like this these days. Pages have absolutely massive margins which is so nice to look at. There are a number of colour plates, and also many illustration pages which have a lovely pale green/yellow ink tint behind them. This same coloured ink is used on the chapter title pages which adds a real feel of quality and attention to detail.One of the prized possessions in my bookcase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bilbo Baggenses","review":"(paraphrased) You dont believe the propheses because you had a hand in making them?
