He's my idol. I love his other cd's also \\"Corazon Abierto\\" and his Mariachi CD's. He's awesome! This new cd of his, just isn't his style. I believe he's trying to get into the pop scene, but he's better with his balads and Mariachi music.

The arrangement for \\"The Windmills of Your Mind\\" is incredible as well.I found it to be the perfect accompaniment for a quiet dinner or a nice glass of wine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quack in Action","review":"Gale's book is split into two parts. The first half is a selective and biased history of the Industrial Revolution. The second half of the book is an incomplete analysis of global warming. She often overstates her case, and always leaps to the worst conclusions possible. She never informs the reader of the problems with the global warming analysis, such as satelites that were configured incorrectly. She never deals with the fact that our current instruments are more accurate, and that past figures are suspect. And she all but ignores nature's impact on what she is studying.If you're into Global Warming, you'll love this book.If believe Global Warming is a farse, you'll be annoyed by the book.If you're undecided, don't bother with this hysterical, biased, and poorly argued book. It includes nothing new to the debate, and often leaves the reader believing he knows facts, when they are only congecture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile conclusions","review":"The authors clearly care a great deal about how children are educated and evaluated. However, the conclusions that are drawn go too far. While these are steeped in much current literary theory, that theory itself is still very speculative with little firm research to support it. Furthermore, although the book roundly condems most current types of reading tests, no promising alternatives are put forth. The main mission of Fragile Evidence is not to reform standardized reading tests or tackle the difficult task of improving them, but rather to just get rid of them altogether. Still, there are a number of good points raised about test validity, reliability, and perhaps most importantly the poor uses to which tests are put."},{"rating":"1","title":"good story, but melodramtic and confusing at times","review":"The story seems interesting, however I found the story hard to follow. Dialogue is long like that of older fantastical fiction. It is long and there is little to find in the speach patterns to seperate characters. The book also lacks good character descriptions within the text. In order to understand the book, I figure you really have to study the appendixes first and then read the dialogue very carefully. This typically is not the type of reading I enjoy for leisure.Unlike Tolkien, Synder spends very little time describing the settings.

After I gave them to her, she said Callas, was not a sweet delicate singer, she was inspriational in the way she acted on stage, and the tones she used to evoke emotion in an opera. Maria was the frist to do that.The recordings are not the greatest, the positive emotion it brought my mother gives it a 4 star rating.I myself prefer the Paris Debut, Tosca portion, where I can see Maria take control of the stage, and Tito raising to her challenge.

People who dance with their cats have obviously left the sane world and have joined a sick world of feline-human relations. I thumbed through this book after laughing hysterically at the title, not knowing that I would nearly double over laughing at the absurdity of someone creating such a work. Whoever was sucked into funding this piece of garbage is an even bigger idiot than its creators. The absurdity of the book's concept is illustrated in one of many assinine photos, in which a man appears in a cat body paint costume with a giant cat tail strapped to his buttocks in what must be a repulsing attempt to seduce the cat into sexual relations. Truly disgusting!!! Both of them are in midair, but I must say it honestly appears as though the cat was thrown or kicked to reach its height (someone call PETA!).

This makes sense as the source data is low resolution.You can re-master VHS a million times and the resolution won't get any higher.

When we called the tech support, they didn't mention that the batteries were subject to recall; now I just found out, and Toshiba won't process the recall.

The booklet is confounding. It contains no lyrics and not a list of whom plays what. It does however contains liner notes written by some man called Simon Reynolds. They have also used a bunch of illustrations by some artist named Julian Ope. Mr Ope must be a friend of theirs since his artwork is quite unspectacular. Allmusic and Pitchford Media both wrote positive reviews giving the album high marks when it was released and I agree with this assessment. 4/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"An OBSCURE-DISK Commentary","review":"One hardly expects anything but ultra-selfconscious pastiche from these urbane Londoners, but even Julian Cope might have scratched his head at Saint Etienne's recent collaboration with Teutonic electro-minimalists To Rococo Rot and Stereollama Sean O'Hagan. Sound Of Water is, sonically at least, a note-perfect composite of the participants: verdant rushes of harpsichord and strings laid over beds of lightly percolating electronics. Sadly, SE neglected to write compelling songs to match the sonic setting, and most of the album drifts by elegantly on a cloud of sub-Bacharach meandering. The perma-underwhelming Sound of Water will bore newcomers and leave fans wondering about the wisdom of putting Krautrock in their Northern soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"Where did Saint Etienne go?

This album simply has too much instrumental experimentation (some might term it texture) for my taste. And though Sarah's voice is lovely, a little emotion would be welcome. Note to an earlier reviewer: if you have to hunt for the \\"hooks\\", they're not hooks--and there are almost none to be had here. Better to check out other albums, perhaps So Tough or Good Humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should I buy \\"Good Humour\\"?","review":"Recently, I bought Saint Etienne's 1993 offering \\"So Tough\\". I thought the album quite good. One grouse though was that the sound quality of the CD was not good. Furthermore, a found the snippets of movie extracts irritating. Now, I experimented with the latest SE album. Let me ask you--are you willing to fork out about twenty dollars just to hear 1 or 2 good songs? Because this album is what it is worth--just 1 or 2 good songs. Sarah's voice has lost her angelic, lifting qualities. Here, it is more jazzy. If u expect some up-tempo songs, you will be disappointed. I thought this new album would convert me into a fan. Now I'm wondering if I should buy their 1998 \\"Good Humour\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop sweetness, and love by Saint Etienne.","review":"All I can say is Sarah Cracknell of St.Etienne could be singing about the ingredients to a Macaroni salad, and still make that song sound like the sexiest, most beautiful song out there. She is so talented. Her voice is so melodic and sweet. The songs in this album are I think the mellowest I've heard from St.Etienne, but that doesn't mean they aren't being innovative. I love \\"Heart Failed\\", and \\"How We Used To Live\\", and basically the whole album. I gave it a 4 though, because I do miss the dance fun they exherted on \\"He's On The Phone\\" or \\"Tell Me Why\\"(their collaboration with Paul Van Dyke). They are all great people, and indeed they are getting better as time goes by. You won't find pop more pure than Saint Etienne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another import well worth the trouble...","review":"What is it about the 'tienne that has their loyal subjects foaming at the mouths at the thought of an exclusive, hard-to-find (and extremely pricey) mega-obscure release? Whatever, they're always willing to oglige, and this Japanese-only version of their latest album keeps up the tradition. All but the most die-hard (like myself) fans are unlikely to regard a single track which is unavailable elsewhere to be much of an incentive to buy this if you've got the standard European or U.S. release already. But guess what, the song in question, \\"Shoot out the lights\\" almost justifies the extravagance of the purchase. So, if you haven't got a copy yet, this is the version to go for, and if you have, well, go for it anyway...you know you want to."},{"rating":"2","title":"sound of water","review":"aAt first, I was dissapointed with this release...but day by day, week by week, this album continues to grow on you....Tiger Bay, Good Humour,..great albums!

Adding more acoustic elements and working with To Roccoco Rot and Sean O'Hagan has paid off with a consistent and beautiful album that expands the limits of both electronic and acoustic music to a create a new lushness. The new sounds are here. 'How We Used To Live' is the best single of 2000."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This is a great story, for the most part, by an excellent author. Problem is that there was a glitch in assembly and the middle of the book is from Fever, 1793. So Amazon replaced my book and the replacement was also faulty. They are pulling the copies they have so this won't happen again. I ended up buying a copy of Fever because the part I read in the middle of Turnabout was so good!

The Chapters are set up to rotate from 2001 to 2085 every other chapter. I also didn't like the end of the book, because there wasn't one. The story just stops and your looking for another page.

Now entering the year of 2085 the girls who were tested changed into teens. Seems fun at first but to them is it? As lucky as they are to be young ,again, the process won't end. Faster and faster time has past but their age has deccreased rapidly. Will anyone helo or wll it be too late to ask.This book at first was hard for me because the entry went from 2000, to the next entry at 2085.

The software/license must to be loaded on the platform (AutoCAD) but not on the AutoCAD itself.Once you install the drivers in AutoCAD works perfect, but its a little be tricky to tune up in order to navigate ALMOST the same way I navigate with my Microsoft 5 buttons using the AutoCAD orbit.I will wait for better software and best license schema.

The first course covered the liberal theories in Tullock's text but demonstrated their fatal flaws. Tullock does not follow that approach. He instead embraces the humanistic theories (seemingly ignorant of the flaws) and influences ignorant college students to distrust the Bible. I am keeping the book as an example of stupidity.

However, Professor Jackson makes incredible statements downgrading the importance of race in the making of the American suburbs. While he is undeniably correct that the impetus in American urban policy has been to spread out as far as technology will allow, he does not address to motive behind the no-holds-barred rush for the exits that has typified urban life since WWII. Any observer who credits his senses and not what he reads in a dusty census form in an archive knows that race was the reason for the postwar suburban boom.

We saw this band live with Jethro Tull and the next day had to buy this CD. It was not a disappointment. Highlights include the title song Bernie Taupin (Elton John's wordsmith) wrote for the band. Other highlights include \\"Neverending\\" and \\"What Do You Want From Me?\\" Too mature for the N'Sync audiences and too energetic for the sedated fans of most of today's \\"serious\\" rock, one wonders if THE YOUNG DUBLINERS will find any support on the radio. Too bad for listeners if they don't, this band cooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not enough new music","review":"I recently saw the Young Dubs and they played some of their new music. It's got the same energy as their old stuff. They still rock any venue they play. *But*, I was hoping this CD would have more new music on it.

This'll make you dance!","review":"I also just saw the Young Dubliners at a Jethro Tull concert, and they really rocked Ravinia Park! I was having so much fun bopping to the music I could hardly sit in my seat! They are a FANTASTIC Irish group. Neverending and Red are my two favorites. I just came back from Ireland, and sat in with some musicians at a pub. They sang a few of these songs, with almost as much energy.

(And even then, \\"Breathe\\" only edges it out by a nose.) \\"Neverending,\\" both versions, are moving and beautiful. The Waterboys's \\"Fisherman's Blues\\" is covered here with a jaunty tone; while it's very hard to screw up that song in the first place, the Dubs's more rock-flavored feel enhances it. (Traditionalists might do well by also looking for The Indulgers's excellent cover of the song, on their CD \\"Celtic Tiger;\\" in fact, everyone should go pick that up right this second.)My only criticism is that I felt \\"Apart\\" and \\"One and Only\\" were oddly-paced, and the lyrics seemed a little to suggestive of a rhyming dictionary. Fortunately, others like the energetic \\"What Do You Want From Me,\\" the powerful ballad \\"Don't You Worry,\\" and the Celtic instrumental \\"Bodhran\\" more than make up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Young Dubliners - Red","review":"I have seen The Dubs live many times, and must say this is their best work yet. \\"Neverending\\" and \\"Apart\\" are very moving, both in lyrics and music.

The tipoff is the 1992 copyright date on the back of the CD.The reason I'm giving it the lowest rating is Universal chucked this one out there without updating the audio mastering over the older (and still available) \\"45's\\" CD; the masters used for both discs date from the late 80's.All of the content of this CD exists in much better remastered form on many other Squeeze CD's.

I don't quite know who it's target audience is meant to be - people who make glass beads? or people who string them?Either way, it fails miserably. The cover promises that the artists inside will share inspiration and methods. There is precious little of the latter that I can see.The photography is dissapointing - many images are grainy or reproduced too small to be of any use. Each project featured shows you a photo and an illustration of the finished jewellery (usually necklaces) - but doesn't tell you how the beads are made or even anything much about stringing them, other than a list of what spacer beads the maker used.With such a promising front cover - this book was a dissapointment. This is no disrespect to the artists featured, just the book seemed to have no purpose and no real information to impart to the reader other than the feelings each artist has about their work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this book first . . .","review":"because it's strictly for people who don't yet know anything about lampworked glass beads. Once you've seen pretty much any other book on artists' lampwork beads, you'll find this one disappointing. It's obviously the author's collection of her favorite eBay sellers, some of whom are very accomplished beadmakers and some of whom are, well, less inspired. Even the beadmakers who are very good are represented by pieces that are not their best work. If you're looking for pure eye candy, hold out for the \\"500 Glass Beads\\" book that's coming out from Lark Books in fall 2004.

This is not a book for glass beadmakers interested in technique or \\"inspired\\" design, or even in reading about the more \\"famous\\" beadmakers original ideas. Although there are photos of glass beads used in jewelry, along with photos of the bead makers and a paragraph or two of autobiographical information related to how each got \\"hooked\\" on beadmaking, this is more of a pattern book for bead stringers. This would be a useful book for anyone needing a pattern to follow in order to \\"create\\" jewelry. There are photos, drawings and an explicit materials list for each project.

However w/ the dome cover, I can still cook/steam down the greens - the main reason to have a deeper pan.It can go straight into the oven after searing two pork tenderloins. The fond can be deglazed. No, I can't flip the food like one would w/ a skillet or wok BUT I couldn't flip a family amount anyway :)Why four not five stars?

I have coated the pan with oil and turned the heat down low as they suggest. The only way that things do not burn is if you have it on so low that nothing will cook thoroughly on the pan. Terrible!

With the aluminum core, we're enjoying our first pan that actually heats evenly! We use it for everything and I can not even believe that we got it for $25!! I went to purchase 2 more for my daughters, but I see that the price has gone up. I highly recommend this pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent pan for the price","review":"The pan is surprisingly lightweight which makes for easy handling & a very quick heating start-up. Nice wide cooking surface too - great for making a few silver dollar pancakes all at once or even just a general stir-fry. The lightweight cover is easy to lift, but this feature makes it hard to hold onto for more than a few seconds when it's been cooking for a while, even when you just want to open to stir your food around & place it back down - I find the cover to be too hot, so I end up putting the lid on the counter.

This pan is solidly and beautifully made. It does make a very nice presentation statement and should last forever. It cooks evenly and has a special lip which makes pouring easy and facilitates the sealing of the lid, which makes chicken and fish turn out wonderfully moist and delicious. However, no matter what method of oiling, preheating, closing the lid, etc., my food still always sticks to some extent - probably this is the downside for healthy stainless steel - but the pan is easy to clean after some hot-water and dish-washing-liquid soaking. Note: the lid is solid stainless steel so not 'see through', but a clear 12\\" universal frying pan lid fits just fine... This pan is way worth it: it's beautiful, cooks well, is healthy, and easy enough to clean. The price is unbelievable.

The pan is very thin, lightweight and \\"tinny\\" sounding. It was so thin, the edges felt sharp to the touch. It seemed it would bend easily and not last long. This pan didn't even look like stainless steel. Guess I should have known, by the low price, something was wrong.

Very easy to clean. If something sticks a bit, I just soak it for about 1/2 hour and just rinse it off. I don't put it in the dishwasher, it's much easier to wash and dry by hand.

My husband and I spend 3 hours putting it together, but not because it was all that difficult, it was because of the way it comes out of the box. The parts all come as a part of a mold and you have to cut each one of them out. This doesn't sound like a lot of work, but once you start you realize just what a daunting task it will become. MOST of the time spent putting this kitchen together was cutting the different pieces out of the molds.

It took me 3 hours to put it together, and then to top it off, it was so cheaply made that not worked smoothly. The doors don't close smoothly, the phone falls apart, and it is just a horrible mess. I will never buy anything from this company again. TRUST ME, DON\\"Y BUY THIS!!

It would have been an awful Christmas eve if I'd started it then, after the kids were a'bed.It was a nightmare to assemble. Not hard, really. Just WAY too many pieces, all in their little fabrication \\"clusters\\", that had to be located, snapped, screwed, etc. I have a Ph.D. in a science field, and it took me THREE HOURS to assemble this $50 toy. There's got to be a better way. And if it all falls apart in three days (which I expect it will), I'll be taking it back to the store.My advice....spend a little extra money and buy something better. Preferably, something made of wood or laminate, with fewer pieces.

But as I am assembling, I realize how much it would have been better if I had gotten my daughter something that will last a long time. this is soooo thin. The small parts are too tiny for the spots where it's supposed to go. I can go on and on but the bottom line is I bought something cheap and I regret it. If I can give 0 on it's quality I would. Now my daughter gets irritated everytime she tries to open the little doors because it just comes off. Poor thing tries to fix it on her own and when she can't she calls me.

After waiting for over a week for my replacement parts I called the company again 3 more times and didn't even get an answer!

I work for the government and bought this item for a needy child. I heard it might be difficult to put together so decided on the day the presents were due to open it before wrapping and put it together. To my sheer horror everything was little pieces that had to be twisted off of sheets. An engineer happened by and was amazed at the planning required to even make this kitchen so complex.

He said it was horrible to put together. A week after Christmas one of the handles fell off. The doors don't fit well. We had to duct tape the microwave in place. The sink falls out constantly. My son has enjoyed playing with it. We take it out of circulation every once in a while, so it hasn't been played with constantly for the last year. It actually was in the basement for about 6 months. It's not going to hold up much longer. For a little bit more money you can get something that you can pass on, or re-sell when your child outgrows it instead of tossing in the trash. Which this thing will probably last a few more months. It really is cheaply made. Very low quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just put it in the recycle bin","review":"I bought this product about a year or so ago for my niece, she did get some play out of it, but later walked away from it. The assembly was somewhat of a nightmare when compared to other play kitchens and it was not truly kid friendly. The plastic parts are difficult to assemble as well as move once the whole thing is put together. When you open the doors to the oven or the fridge, they tend to fall off and have to be snapped back into place, something which is not ideal when dealing with 3 year olds. Her mother ended up buying her a new kitchen, and we decided to put it into the recycle bin rather than donate, because so many parts fell off and/or went missing in its short use."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTTALY DISSATISFIED WITH THE.

As far as the sharp edges of the pieces. Just use a wire cutters and a pair of scissors to round off the edges. I have no rough edges on mine pot and pans. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles of more expensive kitchens, but the burners do make a boiling noise and a sizzling noise when you place the pots. It's lightweight and not to big and bulky.

Like everyone else said, the assembly was pretty much a nightmare. It took me 4 hours to put this together.

Since it was unstable, the cups and plates constantly fell off. I ended up leaning it against a wall to keep my child from tipping it over. If you are interested in a kitchen set for your child, keep looking. This is not the one you want: UNLESS: Hours of assembly is challenging and fun.... or you are really trying to save money.

I think it took me and the wife around 3-4 hrs to assemble it! She got it started and lasted about an hour. Fed up, she came and got me. I'm fairly handy and figured (smugly) it would be a piece of cake... It wasn't. Pretty tedious and time consuming. LOTS of parts and the directions are mainly pictographs. All in all it works as intended. Best for the price! But look out for sharp edges where the plastic molds were broken that could easily cut little hands.

As soon as you open the box, you will see sheets of plastic pieces that will need to be cut out, much like a model kit. Some of the edges were sharp so we had to sand them to smooth them out and some of the pieces (oven door, microwave door) were misshaped, so we had to improvise.After spending 3+ hours putting the kitchen set together, we were very pleased with the outcome.

I had to get out an exacto knife and shave off all of the VERY SHARP remnants from the frames- and there are a ton of pieces to this set.

They are able to sing full-out and create the energy displayed on the album. They sang and played full throttle.

Maybe if I'd been mindful in retaining the receipt, IOGEAR could have proved themselves reliable in replacing the unit, but as it stands, don't expect their stuff to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've had this hub for a year and one-by-one each of the ports stopped working. It is useless. The base is not effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"The base doesn't work. Who is Iogear trying to kid? I find it ridiculous that they sell a base that has no functional use once the cables are connected to the unit since the cables weigh more than the base itself. It is clear that the base is designed not for a functional use, but to sell the product packaging.It is not a wonder no one ever sees a demo image of the base in use with the cables connected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"First of all I read the reviews before buying, so I didn't have high hopes of it standing on end, it fits my desktop scheme better on its side anyway. Iogear could have included some stick on feet for the side, but that may give creedance to the poor design of the phony rubber stand..that could have worked if they had just made it a little bigger and heavier. I wanted a 7 port hub that had at two front ports to plug in a camera or jump drive, this and the Belkin seem to be the only ones available. I probably would have bought the Belkin if the price had been the same.The good: It works well and does what I want it to do. I don't notice any lack of performance with my Lexar lightning jump drive or my Canon i9900 printer although I don't print and transfer large files at the same time.Bottom line: Good device for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine this!","review":"Sick of the limitations of identity politics? I know I am. Kandice Chuh's work takes Asian American cultural studies to an entirely new level, thinking critically about issues of postcoloniality, queerness, and transnationality that rest outside of the simple center/margins debate of race and representation. Her prose is simultaneously eloquent and accessible as she pulls together very different discourses, from the historical to the legal to the literary, to make a compelling and theoretically rich critique of old paradigms; a must for ethnic studies, cultural studies, and literary scholars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've read several books on Astral Travel.

Supports playlists.3. Slim design.The disadvantages:1. Adaptor not included.2. Short headphone cord. Company is assuming you want to use the display adaptor, which is not always the case.3.

What a joke! Finally they were able to give me a price $9.00+ shipping (probably more than the battery)+ tax....I think this is a big rip off.Personally I'm thinking of replacing this product. Doesnt make sense to buy something and have to spend a forture on non-rechargeable batteries.

As one who declines red meat, and is gradually phasing out fish and fowl, I found the book accurate, but too preachy. Any reference book a student picks up \\"for fun\\" needs to be hip, interesting, eye-catching, and must, at all costs, avoid talking down to the reader.

According to the book, \\"Just follow Dr. Salter's plan and enjoy the healthier, slimmer you that will emerge.\\" This is sending completely the wrong message to teens. Vegetarianism is not a just a diet--it is a whole new lifestyle. I definetly do not recommend this book.

I could have just sprayed green paint on my reading glasses and gotten the same effect. Hasn't the sub been taken to more interesting waters?

I used to have a Sylvania that worked fine for 10 years, then it just crapped out on me, I thought this was going to be a fine replacement, man has VCR quality changed a lot in the last 8 or 9 years since I last bought one.

The picture only shows the front of the deck but if it showed the back you would see there are only 2 RCA connections--one for video and one for audio. Yes, ONE for audio! This is advertised as a HiFi and 4 head deck which makes the buyer automatically assume it has stereo output.I went ahead anyway and plugged in everything just to see if I could live with it and was appalled at how horrible the sound really was.

Accept it as a mistake and let's get the next product out there. I couldn't be more dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush League","review":"This album is Bush-league material. The songs are the worst written that I have heard in a while. The production on here is decent at best. Pharrel should stick to producing for other artists and even making a guest appearance once in a while. That's about it.TOP FIVE SONGS: N/A"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE","review":"Now, its probably not good to review an album without listening to the whole thing, but I just HAVE to say that I LOVE the song 'That Girl' with Snoop! Its that smooth, cool, sexy Pharrell sound that I LOVE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The beats are incredible!!!","review":"I have not yet purchased this cd but one of my friends has it and I listen to it over and over. I did not expect this kind of cd to come from P but like it says in the subject, the beats are incredible!!! I cant get enough of it. My favorite song is \\"Show you how to hustle\\" the beat is TOO sick. Keep it up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"And Pharrell Williams became a genius...","review":"I can't stop thinking Pharrell as the new music genius of our time, like Prince was (and maybe still is) in the 80's.It's not surprising to hear some refreshing tunes from a man like Pharrell but, once again, he throws a bomb, and gives a lesson to a lot of crappy rnb/hip/hop producers, famous or not...I think this man took time to learn and practice music, he did not improvise himself a producer...he can play instruments and certainly has a plethoric soul/funk/rock background.Apart 1 or 2 weak tracks, the album is so homogenic, so fresh and melodic that it's hard to drop the headphones...ALBUM OF 2006 without a doubt..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressed","review":"As an avid fan of N.E.R.D. and all things Pharrell I was very excited to hear that he would be releasing a solo album. \\"In My Mind\\" is a horrible representation of what this man can do. Pharrell is not \\"gangsta\\" and it's hard to listen to his bravado on most of these songs. This album includes the usual hip pop appearances and leaves nothing to the imagination.The reason why so many people gravitated towards Pharrell is because he made no apologies for who he is - a skate kids that loves to make beats. He followed no rules but his own. This album feels like he's trying really hard to accepted by the mainstream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Ever Take Us Into Your Mind Again","review":"This album shows what seperates the should-be rappers and the should-be producers. Pharrel should stick to producing only like a Scott Storch or something. He isn't like someone like Dr. Dre or Kanye West. But Pharrel's producing isn't very good to begin with so he as virtually no place in the hip hop game.Some albums that have come out recently that you should by instead of this one are: Obie Trice's Second Rounds On Me and/or DMX's Year of the Dog...Again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one is nice!","review":"This album is really nice. You have some really dope beats and decent lyrics. I say the lyrics are decent because they don't really have subject matter attached to them. But that is ok because this is a party album and it lives up to that name to the fullest. The guest appearances are really wack though. You have snoop on here talking about how he is a 50 year old crip and the ULTRA WACK Nelly. Nelly almost ruins the album for me. Thank god for the skip button on my cd player to skip that song. But overall this is a good album that you won't be disappointed in if you purchase it or burn it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a forgettable album","review":"Pharrell hasn't really ever moved me. but at least he was cleaver enough to have some beats for other artists. but this album shows that as a Solo Artist he just doesn't have what it takes. this album doesn't have a WInning song from the R&b Side nor the Hip-Hop side. it's just there. He has never moved me vocally at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Is This?","review":"I don't know. This new album by Pharrell isn't anything to write home about. There are a few songs on here that I like, but I had to listen to them more than once just to like them. Seriously, \\"In My Mind\\" could have been so much better, but it fell short. The lyrics and the synthesized beats could have been better. More emotion and more melody would've been great. Other than that, I prefer hearing Pharrell sing than rap. Try again, Pharrell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stick to producing","review":"Some people should not go solo, he is one. A few songs are just ok, but the REST is PAIN! to my ears...AKA PAIN STAIN.. he is out of his mind for this junk. I do know why i bught this CD. I am always willing to give a person a chance, but this is worst the the last project he did a few years back. Even some if the other artist stuff he produce is getting tired. Hope he saved up his money, cause guess what his time is up."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing effort","review":"A lot of the songs remind me of michael jackson and the jacksons in the late 70's and early 80's. Think destiny, off the wall and triumph. Also it reminds me of prince's music from that time when he was experimenting with trying to create a new sound. Definitely a hip hop classic that will live on."},{"rating":"1","title":"In My Mind is not in My Mind.","review":"In My Mind * 1/2Pharrell has produced some hot songs, but this album is a disaster, I Mean it does have two good songs, especially the one with kanye west, but the rest is so awful it's a shame, there is nothing else in this album to even recommend like this, it is a waste of time and my money and it's not even fun anymore, now I Love pharrell and the neptunes, but this cd really dissappointed me big time.A Real Dissappointment from PharrellThumbs Down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This album is terrible from start to finish. their literally is not a single good song on this CD. The only alright song on this CD is Number 1 but that's only because of Kanye's presence. Pharrel has proved with this album that he has nothing to say and has an annoying singing voice. This album deserves just 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to standards...","review":"I have to say that this is a terrible CD. There is no doubt that Pharell is extremely talented and is an incredible producer, but I don't think he's strong enough to carry on an entire album. He had some success with singing with other huge artists in the past, but to be frank, his voice isn't all that good.The beats speak for themselves and are incredible, but it's hard to enjoy a song when you have Pharell wailing in the back. The fact that he had to have so many other artists appear on his CD just shows that he's not yet ready to be a solo artist.Think twice before buying this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"what in the world...","review":"THIS WAS A WASTE OF MONEY AND I AM TAKING IT BACK TO TARGET...I LET IT PLAY WHILE I DID SOMETHING ELSE..DID NOT LIKE IT...GO BACK TO NERD LIKE ALBUMS PHARRELL"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good buy","review":"I am a huge fan of Pharell's work and this is definately a good buy. There are a few tracks that I skip over because it gets boring after the beat drops... But there are a handful of golden tracks on his album that makes it all worth while. I especially like \\"Our Father\\", his testimony about his personal relationship with God. Hot tracks throughout, Pharell has definately done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pharrell's In My Mind was worth the wait.","review":"After waiting nearly a year,Pharrell's solo CD finally arrives.The music and lyrics are both inovative.This CD could have easily been put out in the year 2012 and people would still love it.As a producer myself, I appreciate the freshness of the drums and the music. My only disappointment was there is no lyric sheet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I expected more from this release especially due to the fact the nice tracks were played on the radio but this album sucks. pharell makes hits for other artists, I don't understand why he can't make the wicked tracks for himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"good album","review":"This is an excellent album. It is well produced and very different! I know that there are a few of you that are hating on this album. If you are not a fan of Pharell's type of music, then you will most likely hate this album. If, on the other hand, you are a fan of innovative music that is the sound of the future, then listen to this album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not focused on the music","review":"Pharrel used to be a great producer back with the neptunes. I mean they really made great beats in the late 90s and early 00s.But it seems that since Pharrel has become some type of fashion icon, he's not about the music anymore. This is really bland, overproduced hip hop. He's all about his image now, this whole fashion thing him and kanye have going is just diluting the minds of the youth. I mean he performs with a backpack on...how corny is that?I guess he needs to keep making albums so his BBC line sells...oh well."},{"rating":"2","title":"History comes alive","review":"History can suffer at the hands of its practitioners, but that is certainly not the case here. Lytle can write and Forrest is the beneficiary of his talent. Lytle seeks to communicate the essence of the man and his time and largely succeeds. Although a vivid portrait of Forrest the man emerges, my one word impression of Forrest after reading this book is Warrior! I found it hard to put down. But I wouldn't want to run in to him in a dark alley wearing a Yankee uniform!"},{"rating":"2","title":"nice continuation of the series","review":"This one is a little longer than the previous ones, and it has quite a twist at the end. A fun read, like the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Sakura Taisen addition","review":"Sakura Taisen-Ecole De Paris is a fragments and lacking anime addition to the Sakura Taisen series. The show starts off by introducing the main character but then proceeds to assume that the viewer is already aware of the back ground or the characters. I am aware that the show is based on a game in Japan but as a free standing show it lacks any flow to it. I bought this DVD since I have all of the previous Sakura Taisen anime DVDs but if I were a new viewer I would skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, at best","review":"This book provides interesting history lessons regarding lingual development, and is moreso a great glossary of references (for the full-time linguistics student) than a handbook for actors as it purports to be. It's hard to read what he writes when he \\"spells\\" accents, as many of his phonetic symbols rely more on a presumed knowledge of the accents than examples. I've been all over the world, too, and don't find any of the accents on his CD to be convincing for the people I've met and places I've been to. Perhaps his \\"accents\\" would be a good representation for the way radio anouncers and news casters who try to minimize accents speak. But that is all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lopsided","review":"This book is great, if you want to learn a British accent -- Blumenfeld dedicates more than eight minutes on the CD to it. Unfortunately for me, I picked it up for Asian accents. Blumenfeld wrote a large paragraph, describing how 'The King & I' demonstrated a lousy Thai accent. Who cares? He then dedicated all of 17 seconds to Thailand on the CD. Many other 'chapters,' are similar. A complete waste of my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"his accents don't sound right at all","review":"If you listen to the audio CDs, his accents are just plain horrible.My Vietnamese friend doesn't think the guy's Vietnamese accent sounds right at all, I (Arab) don't think his Arabic accent sounds at all Arab.0/5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Use this.","review":"This is great for anyone interested in learning most any accent or dialect, not just actors. It gives you more than just pronunciation. It gives you the feel of an accent; even using some of the respective languages of certain accents to understand more complex aspects of an accent such as phrasing, rhythm, and word choice that an actual speaker of the accent would have. While the book can be on the complicated side to read, the CDs that accompany it typically clear up any misunderstanding. Lastly, a key trait of the CDs, is that it is Mr. Blumenfeld, the author, himself, who speaks for every accent. He is clearly proficient in all the accents he teaches. This is a well-researched and very effective book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thorough manual for accent learners.","review":"I'm not a native speaker and needed some book to improve my pronunciation - this books did the trick.

It is careful, complete, scholarly yet a thoroughly enjoyable read. Actors facing tough accents will breath a sigh of relief when they find the enclosed CD. I've been cast as Van Helsing, the dutch professor in \\"Dracula\\" at Fauquier Community Theater, in the foothills of the Blue Ridge, some 50 miles west of D.C. After absorbing the chapter on dutch accents, reviewing the CD and practicing diligently, I feel I mastered the accent at much the same pace as memorization of the script. That competence has translated to earlier-than-normal layering of character well before opening.I also found the author, Mr. Blumenfeld, very friendly and forthcoming with additional guidance. This is a gem, and I recommend it to friends in theatre. And to those who are convinced they have an accent \\"down pat,\\" compare yourself to the CD and prepare to be humbled and learn."},{"rating":"2","title":"an indispensable guide for working actors","review":"I am a New York theater actress and I use this guide ALL.

I am a college theater major and there is no accent missing from this book.

The first chapter was tough reading because it was difficult to reconcile that chapter with normal day to day living. Lucky for me I decided to read chapter two as the author put the book on a more personal level, dealing with his own life experiences in getting \\"glimpses of God\\" at work around him. The book rapidly became very relevant to me on this more fundamental level.

Don't you want those instant millionaire sims sometimes?? Well, I do. When I have searched up the cheats, they don't work! I have had everyone in my family try them, and I have tried them! DO NOT GET THIS GAME! It's fun to some extent, but you know, how you like to get that certain toy, but you don't have enough money. Just really, don't get this one! Get the others.4 stars MAX!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Happy","review":"I ordered the game for my daughter on 11/28/06 quite confident that her big item wish was bought and I could forget about it. I never recieved it and was never informed by Amazon that it was returned as undeliverable. So on Christmas day when she opened her presents, she asked where it was. I told her I ordered it and we started looking about the house as to where it was. After going on the computer to the website I then found out that it was returned and my credit card had been reimbursed. Shame on them. I will not use them again. I believe they got too big for their britches and the customers are the ones paying the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Let Down","review":"I loved the original SIMS. I had hoped that SIMS 2 Pets would be only an improvement. It was in that the graphics were better and the pets are wonderful; however, the building options were more limited and unlike SIMS 2 there wasn't a story mode, which I looked forward to playing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best sims game ever!","review":"This is theeeeeeeee best sims game on earth!I love to create the dogs the best.You can pick from hundreds of breeds encluding a mixed breed.Cats aren't as fun to make as dogs.This time you don't just click on something and they do it.You move them your self!Take my advice and get the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a fan of southern music","review":"I do not care for southern christian music. A lot of the titles on this cd are from the south. I want a cd with Hymns from the early protestant reformation days. Amazing Grace, A mighty fortress is our God, and Come thou Fount which were in the cd, but buried under a bunch of shallow southern hymns.Please come up with a cd with only early protestant reformation hymns which include the ones I already mentioned above, but also include And can it be, Holy, Holy, Holy, and Be thou My vision. Hymns from this time period have so much more depth and are so much more meaningful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lotion","review":"This Olay Sensitive Moisture Lotion is great. It is Not greasy at all. And for anyone that has facial breakouts, or any type of allergies this is a godsend of a product. I find by using this product that my skin is in better condition than when I used to use the Original Oil Of Olay Moisture Lotion due to Olay using less chemicals in this particular Olay product. Plus I look younger!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Moisture","review":"Usually wake up in the morning in radiant skin. Like it with no fragrance. The only downside is it is a bit stingy to put on after washing face with facial wash."},{"rating":"1","title":"sorta working","review":"I don't mind that it doesn't look exactly like the advertised pic.It does fit into the socket of the car I chose before buying this product.That's a plus.The minus: it can't be called \\"pop out\\" because it would not stay in.I tried it on the car, I had to push it in and held it there for a whileto light my cigarette.My decision: I will keep this and get used to it.It's now called \\"56442-push-and-hold-cigarette-lighter\\".I don't want to return because they might ask me to buy a new carto use this product the way it's supposed to be used. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crapped out after just a few months.","review":"It did work when I got it, and it did work for three, maybe four months after I got it. Then, one day, it not only quit working, but the heating element started coming uncoiled and caused a blown fuse.I wouldn't have thought that a replacement cigarette lighter for a car would be a science akin to building a space shuttle, as there is no real rocket science involved. However, it might be worth your while to spend a few extra bucks and go to your OEM for a replacement if you need one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Fit","review":"This does not fit my BMW 135I Convertible. Very disappointing. Now I will need to buy a BMW lighter that probably costs way too much :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"Made in China junk will not stay in at all must hold in to heat up. Not worth my time or money to return."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does'nt even fit!!!","review":"This lighter was so big it got stuck when we tried to put it in and now it wont come out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I ordered!","review":"I ordered the lighter because of the picture in the ad showing a ring at the end of the sleeve quite clearly. The lighter I received had the same number, but was not even close enough to be mistaken for the one pictured. Beware, all pop outs are not interchangable. Did not work for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work","review":"It is too small in diameter to work in my car, a 2005 Saturn ION, door.The price is great, delivery time very good but it isn't worth the time andmoney to return it for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful combination of Irish, bluegrass and \\"pop\\" beats","review":"This CD is an amazing combination of barn-burning Irish music, driven by wild violins and great beats. It also has some mellow tracks and great harmonies. The tracks on this album coalesce to form an upbeat celebration of music, life and good times, with innovative instrumentation and great tunes. The overall result: exceptional!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"I have always loved the art of Yuki Kaori and this book is a great collection of her work. Even if you're not a fan of Kaori's you're sure to enjoy this collection. Her artwork (as always) is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Kaori Yuki's artwork for Angel Sanctuary is just beautiful in a realistic, haunting sort of way. Angel Sanctuary is a wonderful manga that every manga and anime fan should read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not All That!!!","review":"I ordered this because I was looking for comedy I could enjoy with my whole family and based on the reviews already posted I thought this might be a good DVD to try. I have to say, outside of Lester Berry who was somewhat funny the rest was not really funny. I certainly wasn't rolling on the floor and won't rush to watch again and again. If you are looking for clean comedy that will have you laughing out loud and rolling on the floor a much better choice is Steve Harvey's \\"Don't trip he aint through with me yet\\". This just wasn't all that!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Clean Humor for the whole family!","review":"I came across this show on the Word Network, and absolutely fell out the bed cracking up. My husband was even cracking up and he's not into clean comedy. My mother, aunt, and uncle were crying they were laughing so hard. This is GOOD, CHRISTIAN, HILARIOUS COMEDY. I think even Jesus was looking down on them and laughing himself! You can watch this without hearing all those annoying beeps. GO OUT AND GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely amazing!!","review":"Even though this video is now out of print, for reasons I cannot fathom, it still remains one of my favorite all time performances and an engrossing behind the scenes look at the recording process of this fantastic music! Both Battle and Marsalis are at the peak of their powers! Are these the most authentic, period performances? No. But are they some of the most well thought out, soulful and inspired performances? Absolutely! Get it! And Sony, PLEASE reissue this on DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is Dancehall not Reggae but that is OK!","review":"This album is full of awesome songs. Maybe only a couple that are filler. Very good production, cool sounds and beats. Love it and we listened to it a LOT.To the negative reviewers who say it isnt reggae - you're right. It's dancehall [...] which of course came from Reggae. Reggae and dancehall also spawned reggaeton another great genre (But that isn't reggae either!).Too bad Collie Buddz website was last updated 2 years ago - the headline hasn't changed in 2+ years (\\"Collie Buddz Self-titled \\"Collie Buddz\\" in stores and online July 3, 2007!\\") It's almost 2010!It IS a great Album though."},{"rating":"2","title":"all hail collie buddz","review":"do hav much to say, this album is awsome... every single song mean a lot and it will take u to deep reggae tone! dnt hav to think twice jst take it then u'll realize its worth more than that"},{"rating":"2","title":"Suprise Surprise!!","review":"This CD was a pleasant surprise. I was expecting a few good hits, but the entire album is good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hip Hop lover loves this album","review":"This album stayed in my car's CD player for a few months in a row. I'm a hip hop fan with a taste for reggae, and this album is a perfect mix. \\"Blind to You\\" is my favorite song, but there are a few others that I still listen to regularly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes good reggae sound even better","review":"This is one of those albums that makes you realize what the difference between good and bad music is. In this case we're talking about reggae music which in my opinion has some of the best sounding music of all genres. Collie Buddz tries, but just plain fails. For any fan of reggae I can't and won't recommend this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"like some songs, unoriginal sound","review":"There are some songs on this album that I really enjoy and would be could for the club. \\"Blind to You\\" \\"Let me Know\\" \\"Mamacita\\" and \\"What a Feeling.\\" However, he sounds exactly like Wayne Wonder from six years ago from his album No Holding Back. I didn't know if Collie Buddz was an individual singer or a group, so I actually thought it was a group of Wayne Wonder's until I looked on his website to find out it was a guy named Colin Harper. Even some of the beats sound exactly like Wayne Wonder beats. I would estimate that I thought it was Wayne Wonder on more than half the songs before I looked. Some pretty good songs unfortunately I thought it was a huge rip off Wayne Wonder and I don't know if thats supposed to be good or bad?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing new artist","review":"Collie Buddz is a great toaster, and his production team is incredible. Buy this album, you will not regret it.Reggae Eminem!"},{"rating":"1","title":"wowww.....where the heck is this dude coming from.","review":"This CD is just plain awful. Can't believe anyone could produce such ugly reggae. This guy should be selling CD's at the local store in the Bermuda triangle and not international. The guy has no talent...plain and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucks...!","review":"This dude can't sing! Dam, those people who give this guy five stars must be high on dope.Sold it on ebay for $1.50, took a beating but that's life I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Hapless Half-Wits\\", eh?","review":"\\"Hapless Half-Wits\\" is clearly what Sony thinks of the people who would be interested in buying this atrocity... only four shorts, two of them on DVD already, and -- yes -- they're colorized. (I know you can \\"turn off the color\\", but that's a small consolation for being asked to pay $25 for only 2 shorts you don't already own on DVD.)Sony is coming close to getting a \\"Worst DVD Producer EVER\\" award for these Stooges monstrosities."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Three Stooges - Hapless Half-Wits","review":"These are Great Timeless Slapstick Comedy Shorts from the 1940s and well worth the 14 dollars for the Colorized versions. The titles are---Beer Barrel Polecats (1945) (with Curly)I'll Never Heil Again (1941) (with Curly)Dopey Dicks (1949) (with Shemp)Brideless Groom (1947) (with Shemp)These are a first for me to see the Shemp verions Colorized and they all look better being colorized. I know some extremists will be upset about the colorization, but they can view them in Black & white if they choose to.I really liked them all except for \\"I'll Never Heil Again\\" which I thought was a little boring. I'd like it if Columbia Pictures would colorize some more of these shorts in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"hapless halfwits indeed","review":"colorizing the stooges borders on like the perverse. i have not bought one of these \\"collections\\" in quite some time and really why would any true stooge fan waste his/her money on something he/she already has AND is colorized? its as if the knuckle heads in charge of the stooge shorts hold us in contempt. give them less, charge them more, edit with a hacksaw and then DEmaster the whole mess. my recomendation is to boycott this shameful nonsense. hapless and halfwited indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"boycott these piece-mealed offerings","review":"I don't know who's in charge of the stooge shorts but it is a scandal what they're doing, piece-mealing them out a few at a time and not even showing the whole show in its entirety. Why there is not a comprehensive, unedited, and remastered box set of these legends is beyond me. Be like me and boycott until they do it right. I actually like the coloring as an option, if it is able to be turned on or off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Three Stooges deserve much better respect than this DVD","review":"The Three Stooges made 190 short films. Rather than putting care into complete, chronological sequenced box sets, Sony keeps dumping a random 4 shorts on overpriced discs. Skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawn","review":"I don't mind the colorization because it looks great BUT how many versions of \\"Brideless Groom\\" do we need both in color or b&w? which leaves us with three shorts that haven't been colored yet,of curse which leaves us with only two shorts to not have released on dvd before,since two of these shorts have been released, so you're paying for two shorts...I like the idea of some shemp shorts but for pete's sake release some of his shorts that haven't seen the light of day on dvd not \\"Brideless Groom\\" which has been released over a thousand times since it's public domain (yes even in color a few times)also when will we see some shorts with larry moe and JOE in them ,it's better than getting the same stuff over and over again since there isn't one dvd that has anything to do with Joe..............."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"A Gift to be Cherished\\"","review":"This DVD allows you to experience the profound love, humor and wisdom of an enlightened being, as he shares the Three Principles uncovered at the moment of his enlightenment. It is a precious gift to the world; especially now that Mr. Banks is no longer with us in physical form. The feeling shared mysteriously quiets the mind, and guides one within, where all answers lie. This spiritual knowledge has already transformed thousands of lives; it is truly the hope for humanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"The video is a complete waste of time for people who are not already familiar with the 3 principles. Plus, even if you do know what he's talking about from prior knowledge of the subject, the video will not offer anything more. The video shows Syd Banks speaking about how the 3 principles will change your life, but because the audience members are already devotees of his philosophy, he barely mentions what the 3 principles are! Even though I like Syd Banks and I agree with his philosophy, the video was terrible and I would not recommend it to anyone.If you are interested in this kind of philosophy, I would recommend Joe Bailey's book \\"The Serenity Principle.\\" Even though it was written for people in recovery from addiction, it applies to all people. Joe's book explains his vision of Syd Banks' philosophy and principles very well. Joe's book can and does change people's lives!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work properly","review":"I purchased this brand and model of camera. It worked marginally well for a couple months and then wouldn't go off at all even if you walked right in front of it. I contacted Moultrie and they said it probably needed to be reprogrammed. I paid the shipping and sent it to them. When it came back it worked really well - like it should. That lasted for about a month and then it was back to the way it was before. You could walk directly in front of it and it would not go off. I didn't feel I needed to be sending it in every other month to get reprogrammed. I contacted Moultrie Customer Service again through their web site and told them of the problem. I received NO response what so ever from Moultrie. I believe there is something wrong with these cameras or some kind of bug in the electronics portion to begin with because why should then need to be reprogrammed all the time in order to work.My recommendation - if you want a camera that works properly buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moultrie Game Camera","review":"I have had the same problem with no help from Moultrie. Camera worked for a couple of weeks and then nothing.... stay away buy a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evaluate your needs carefully before buying this TV","review":"If you are planning to set this TV on the kitchen counter or put it in the infants bedroom, this little TV is probably just what the doctor or-dered, but if you need a compact unit that will let you connect that left-over DVD/VCR recorder, WITHOUT having a set of ugly cables hanging off ofthe front, I recommend that you look at something else. I most STRONGLY suggest that you read the reviews by \\"Pigumon\\" and \\"LotteryMan43\\". They,collectively, have identified the negative characteristics that make thisTV a \\"less than desireable\\" value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase","review":"Recieved product not working. Tried many, many, times to obtain return authorization. When somebody finally answered I was hung up on. I will never purchase from this company again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dino Rangers last DVD","review":"I would have given this a five star but the Disney company hasn't completed a Power Ranger Series EVER! I buy all the time collections of entire series on older TV shows than the Power Rangers, but they only produce a limited bunch of episodes. SPD 3/4, Dino Thunder 3/4, Mystic Force 2/4 (I think), Jungle Fury 1/4 (again I think, they only did two DVDs on this series). And they haven't even done any DVDs of the older series of Power Rangers; MMPR, Turbo, Zeo, Space, Lost Galaxy. Yeah they did some Lightspeed Rescue and Wild Force on VHS but they haven't brought those the DVDs. And until they do I won't be happy with purchasing the Power Rangers episodes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure power!","review":"This is a very rare DVD ,it was right before Chuck Shuldiner past away so it is one of the few dvd's out there of Death, The sound is raw and heavy ,you hear everything fine a must have for the fans of DEATH."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"Yes, the girls are pretty, but the acting, plot, and holes in the plot are laughable and pathetic. James Remar looks embarassed, and Baldwin looks stoned. Why did they even waste the film? Makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Words are Inadequate","review":"Since I never purchased this item, nor seen the film, I am unable to give this particular a higher rating. It may or may not deserve more stars than I have alloted to it but at this time I feel a rating of one star is sufficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipping it right back...","review":"What a piece of crap. I haven't even had it for 24 hours and it is going back to Amazon. The unit doesn't work at all, in either a PC or a Mac. Some of the lights came on, indicating things were plugged into them when clearly nothing was, and they also didn't include the firewire cable that was supposed to come with it. It is obvious from other reviews that IOGear makes an entirely inferior line of garbage products that no one likes.I wish I had not been so captivated by the idea of having such a nice hub and had read the other reviews, because it would have saved me the hassle of having to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work unless you already have firewire!","review":"Unless you already have a firewire port on your PC the firewire ports on this will not work. Per IOGEAR's tech support, this hub does not convert firewire to USB, it will only extend it to the hub if you plug firewire to firewire connections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Joke","review":"This product is a joke. Does not work!!! I totally trashed it after trying everything to get it to work. Please don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.","review":"The power source is worthless, as is IOGear's customer service department. It will be an utter waste of your time and money to buy this item or anything else from this company.--Lisa H."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died a quiet death","review":"I bought one of these to help me control the chaos of Firewire and USB wires on my desktop. I have had it about 4 months. It died. I am unable to return it to iogear since I no longer have the original packaging or receipt.My home office started to smell like burning electronics. The unit had overheated. Luckily it did not take anything that was plugged in to it with it. I think I will not be buying an off-brand again to save a few pennies.While it worked, it worked great (thus 2 stars vs 1)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, poor quality","review":"I really liked the design of this unit but it failed completely after about 90 days...just stopped working. Other types and brands of hubs connected to my iMac work just fine so I've no idea what happened to this one. Wish I could recommend it as I had high hopes, but I'd go with something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly","review":"I had reservations ordering this because it was very inexpensive but when it arrived, I immediately hooked it up to 4 external hard drives, both firewire and USB as well as my firewire digital video deck. Plugged it into the firewire and USB ports on my Macbook and bing bang boom, everything works, no drivers needed. The only negative thing I would say is that the rubber foot it comes with got thrown in the trash as it seemed useless. It didnt really attach firmly to the unit which is extremely light weight. With a bunch of cables hanging off this unit, it would get pulled off my desk. I just put a strip of velcro on the bottom of the unit and velcroed it to the corner of my desk and problem solved."},{"rating":"1","title":"not satisfied","review":"the firewire hub does not work at all but the usb do now i have to find a new way t connect firewire to a non firewire pc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works perfectly fine","review":"I'm amazed at the poor reviews. I've had this hub for nearly 2 years. I use it as a firewire extender. It works without issue. This item was cheaper than any plain firewire hub I could find. Since I only needed a single firewire connection, it fits my needs.I've also used it as a plain old USB hub (without having the firewire cable connected). It works without issue.Loses 1 start because the little base stand isn't very sturdy. I'm not sure why they chose to make this in such an odd shape. The hub is much larger than it needs to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"IOGEAR - Poor Product & Poor Customer Service","review":"While Amazon is great, especially with price, guarantee, returns, etc., I should have followed the advice I read prior to purchasing the IOGEAR 4-Port USB 2.0 and 3-Port FireWire Universal Hub GUH420. My previous hub, the same thing, didn't last more than a few years. The new one didn't work right out of the box. When I called IOGEAR, the troubleshooting tech was useless and told me the hub wouldn't work on my MAC. I know for a fact it does, however the 3 red lights told me immediately something was wrong. The tech couldn't tell me what each color indicated, nor did the directions. She was rude and told me to send it back to the store I purchased it to get me off the phone. To sum it up, really poor customer service and I wouldn't recommend the brand to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Firewire ports are unpowered","review":"Don't bother with this hub; the firewire ports are unpowered. Your iPod will drain its battery power; your firewire hard drive will not work unless it has its own AC power source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for iSight or iPod users","review":"In it's capacity as a USB hub the GUH420 appears to work as advertised and has 4 useable USB ports. In it's capacity as a firewire hub, it lacks bus power and only has 2 usable ports for consumer devices. The absence of bus power means the iSight does not work at all when connected through the hub and an iPod works until it's battery runs flat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I've been looking for a Firewire/USB combo hub to connect to my Mac Mini in our entertainment center, something to reduce the clutter. I needed a powered hub for some of my devices that I hook up to the Mini that require a powered hub. As soon as I got the IOGEAR 4-Port USB 2.0 and 3-Port FireWire Universal Hub (GUH420) I placed it in the entertainment center. I ran the power cable to the hub, but the adapter wouldn't fit, the adapter came with the hub and it doen't; no matter how hard I push, the adapter plug will not fit into the power port on the hub. There is a weird quirk with the FireWire port, when I plug my mac Mini into it 3 of the USB indicator lights light up. It looks really nice in my entertainment center. I can't believe this from Iogear, I've always been happy with thier products. This one is a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk!","review":"As with almost any hub this equipment was easily installed and used until about 15 days into use when it just quit...I don't expect simple hubs to just quit, so I had thrown the receipt and packing materials out. I have since purchased a 4 port belkin and a 4 port CyberPower hub and they are both working flawlessly. I opted for the two hubs because I wanted the reliability of the Belkin after the experience with the I/O gear garbage, but knew I needed something other than the Belkin to charge my iphone from the hub."},{"rating":"1","title":"IOGEAR 4-Port USB 2.0 Firewire hub","review":"I purchased this for my Mac and thought I could connect Firewire and USB.

Smooth, soultry love songs drifted out of my speakers all night. It made me want to just head out to a jazz club and sip on a latte and just enjoy the atmosphere. Although the CD is only 47 minutes long it is a great debut of a man with awesome talent. This CD is definitely a must have for anyone who can appreciate good contemporary jazz.***Update*** I still listen to this CD as much as when I first bought it.

His sound is authentic.You will be glad you invested in his soulful sounds. I can't wait for his next work of art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kem, No Thanks.","review":"Just as Glenn Lewis made me feel nostalgic for Stevie Wonder, Kem got my mouth all set for some Al Jarreau-type soul. I was sorely disappointed on both counts. Kem is bland and boring. Each song is equally as sominex as the last. Sure, the man can carry a tune and his lyrics are nice, but his voice is void of character and adventure. That one song they play on the radio, \\"Love Calls\\" is OK, but the rest of the CD is very smooth-jazz blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over the top","review":"How do I get my money back? I saw this advertised as Sade meets Steely Dan. Obviously the copywright guy didn't know about Sade's understated elegance. This CD is full of sappy lyrics about children are the flowers in the trees, etc. The singing is overdone with far too many of those vocal gymnastics that make Al Jarreau so unbearable. And the music might as well have come from a Casio. A terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-Blended \\"Kemistry\\"","review":"I heard \\"Love Calls\\" on Cablevision's Music Channel and fell in love with it right away. I went to my music store and picked up the CD and it is definitely \\"grown-folks\\" music! Sensual, smooth, classic R&B that makes you want to just kick back and be with the one you are with. Can't wait for the next CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent ,smooth and jazzy","review":"No one will be disappointed listening to this soul and jazzy cd.

I lite up my house with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kemistry - Artist Kem","review":"My husband and I greatly enjoy this CD. Kems' music is very mellow and relaxing. It's also jazzy and fresh. I believe that he cater's to a market age 30-60 or so that has been ignored. Kem's music is so refreshing considering what is in the market today. I so appreciate his subject matter it's as though at times it is our story. Thank you Kem and keep doing what your doing. We must admit that this CD has been worth every penny. God bless you KEM!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is HOT","review":"When I first heard \\"Love Calls\\" it caught my attention but I was kind of hesitant to buy the whole CD because a lot of the time when the first single is hot, the rest of the CD is garbage. This CD, however, is hot from start to finish. My favorite song on the album is \\"Say\\" but all the tracks are good. This is one of the best CDs to come out in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"zheart","review":"This is one of the best CDs I've listened to in a long, long, long while. I like every single cut on it. It's the smooth, mellow type of music that you can listen to over and over again and I have on many occasions. I like the CD so much I'm considering purchasing another one just to listen to in my car. It's too bad it's not getting the airtime it so truly deserves. And to all of you who have compared Kem to Al Jarreau and think he's a Al Jarreau knock off, I urge you to see him in concert. He closed with a Prince song and did a truly outstanding job! I was close to throwing my panties on the stage. This brutha's got layers and a tremendous range! So, to all those that think he's stuck in an Al Jarreau cookie cutter mode, do yourself a favor (and stop doing him a disservice) and check him out in concert."},{"rating":"2","title":"kem has the right kemistry for me!","review":"Now this brother is smooth. This is my chill out album. I have listened to some jazz or fusion or whatever you guys are calling it today. But this is a rare treat. He does have that Al Jarreau feel and flavor. I would swear that this was Al's son or his nephew, the sound is uncanny. If you listen closely you would be able to tell the difference. He can scat, dip and float above the music like this was his 50th album.People listen up here! There is not one bad track on this album. My only complaint was that there wasn't enough songs for me.This album is great for those quiet evenings at home or to drive in your car with. Excellent for meditation and at times you need an escape from the day to day grind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kemistry","review":"I recently attended an affair and hear what I thought was Al Jarreau's latest CD. This song resonated in my mind all night. I promptly went to the music store to purchase it. Much to my dismay, I was wrong. I repeated the lyrics to the sales person and was advised that it was a new guy name \\"Kem\\". I was in shock to know that it wasn't Al Jarreau. But off I went with my new CD. I haven't stopped playing it since. What a GEM !! I'm loving this. I generally play smooth jazz when I have clients in my car (I'm a Real Estate Agent) however, I've been playing this awesome CD. Everyone always ask....Who is that? It strikes up a nice conversation. This is truly a breathtaking CD. Kema is amazing. I understand that this is his first release. Be assured that I'm already in line for the many CD's to come !!! Keep up the good work. Kem is a remarkable, mind blowing talent !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"This is easily one of the best albums in the last few years. I have to put in the same class as Maxwell's first CD and Craig David's.Kem's words flow over the amazing instrumentals that accompany him.This CD is a must for anyone who loves R&B!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb 1st Album","review":"Upon listening to the CD the first time, I was taken back to Al Jarreaus' earlier work. I enjoy listing to Kemistry from beginning to end. It's very calming to me. Al Jarreau is the man, but I can still hear your spark!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AHMazing Kemistry","review":"I was introduced to Kem while listening to Liquid Radio at work - Love Calls was the tune and it had me swaying while I typed. I preordered the album because something told me how fantastic this man was going to be and I WAS RIGHT. From beginning to end his sultry, jazzy, funky, soulful melodic tunes - hypnotize and satisfy you. My musical soul welcomes KEM to the Neo Soul genre and look forward to hearing more and more and more and more from this very talented man. TRUST ME YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need","review":"With 127 pieces there is almost everything you need to drill or screw, and the quick connect feature works great for when you have to pre-drill before you screw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great for me","review":"I purchased this saucier a few weeks ago and used it quite a few times already. It's worked great and does not seem \\"tippy\\" to me at all. I recommend it if you need a small pan for melting butter, sauces, and gravy. It's not a pan that is a necessity in the kitchen, but a nice addition."},{"rating":"1","title":"pot tips over","review":"I got this pot hoping that it'd be perfect for reheating small amounts of food and melting butter, but discovered on my first use that the handle is so heavy that the pot tips over backwards, even when it has some liquid in it. A total nuisance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome pan","review":"I love the shape, design and quality of this sauce pan. I use it sometimes 2-3 times a day and it still looks brand new. I use it to cook soups for myself. The soups come out delicious and it cooks quickly. I got this because it is the perfect size for an individual serving of soup and I can just wash it right after I'm done ready for the next use. I don't use it to cook sauce so I can't really vouch for that. I love it so much that I am about to buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tippy Pot","review":"Heats great. looks great. Dangerous to use. Very poorly balanced. If not full it will tilt toward the handle. If it has just a bit of something in it, and it is not perfectly centered on gas stove grate it will tip and spill into the stove. Love the pour spout; it pours neatly. But it is unpredictable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cuisenart","review":"Every kitchen should have one of these. We use this pan on a daily basis. It is great for toppings etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a sauicer","review":"I read in one review that this pan would turn over and spill. I have a flat surface electric stove. This pan is wonderful, it heats evenly makes a perfect sauce just as it should."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent saucier for electric ranges","review":"I own two of these and I use them constantly. I am very happy with them. The heat is very even. You can use them as mixing bowls, then cook! The shape also makes it easier to fry in the bottom if you want to - I cooked myself a small steak in one this week.I think the complaints must be from people using gas ranges or who have tilted counters. These are clearly not meant for gas ranges. The sides are thin and as the shape would indicate they are a tippy if not on a flat surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does the trick","review":"Nice Saucier. We use it for buffalo wing sauce and buttered breadcrumbs and it pours beautifully. However after the first use it developed a couple of black spots which I can't seem to remove. The purpose nevertheless is as stated and it does the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cusinart Saucier","review":"This pan is a great pan for our two person household. Just the right size for just about anything. A saucier is so important when making anything that needs stiring, risotto, hot cereal and, yes, even sauces. I know it's not the best pan out there, but at this price it's the best for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great Little Pan at a Great Price!","review":"Bought this for myself & now for all my kids. Can't beat the price & the quality is superb!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very narrow base, wastes heat","review":"I ordered this saucepan because it looked decent enough to serve my purpose. The package arrived on time, but contained a return sticker. So I am not sure if this product was bought from a store and then shipped to me. Product-wise, this is an okay saucepan. Like many reviewers mentioned, the handle is very heavy. So the pan has a tendency to tip over when empty. It did not seem a problem when I have liquid in the pan though. The pan also gets stained very easily in my opinion. The main problem I have with this pan is that the base is really really small. Because of this incredibly small surface, most of the heat from the stove is wasted and it takes longer for the liquid to boil. I would not recommend this pan. you can find something better for similar or slightly higher price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"In addition to the \\"tippiness\\" observed by the other reviewer, part of which is just a side effect of the otherwise-desirable saucier shape, the problem with this pan is that the aluminum disk is simply too small to make this a good pan for sauces, particularly if you are cooking with gas. No matter how small your flame, you get hot spots on the thin lower walls of the pan. Had I thought more about the design before purchasing I would definitely have bought the anodized aluminum version.It is an attractive pan and pours well, so my initial thought after discovering the poor cooking performance was to use it on the table for serving gravies and sauces. Unfortunately, the tippiness makes that kind of an unwise idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this pan pass safety standards?","review":"When empty it's difficult to get this pot to stand up to pour in what ever it is we want to heat. If we are lucky, what ever we've managed to get into the pot doesn't tip over and pour out while cooking. And don't even think of half way emptying the thing or you will definitely spill hot liquid all over the place. How did this thing pass safety standards. It was definitely a waste of our money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saucier","review":"I should have heeded the reviews on this pan. I really don't like it. It is tippy, and there should be a pour spout on both sides. Would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tends to tip over","review":"I bought this saucier because of the price and am now sure I will have to replace it because it tends to tip over frequently. The handle is simply too heavy for the weight of the base and it is always tipping over, even when filled. I don't want to end up with scalding sauces all over me or make a huge mess on my stovetop, so I will be looking for a replacement soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too handle-heavy","review":"I like the size of this pan and the pouring spout, but it is not well-balanced. Even on a flat countertop, the pan is too handle-heavy and will tip over. On the grates of my gas stove, I'm not even sure I'm going to be able to use it; empty it completely tips over and since the plan had been to use it to reduce small quanities of sauces, I'm assuming it will tip unless it's pretty much filled. Bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan Tips Over","review":"I'm returning mine today. I took it out of the box and put it on the countertop. It tipped over immediately. I have a gas stove, and there's no way I could cook with it. It really does tip over easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordering an extra one","review":"This little pan was included in one of the Cuisinart sets previously purchased. It is the perfect size to boil 1/2 dozen eggs, make gravy, heat sauces, or heat up a can of soup. I really like the feature that allows you to pour liquids without it spilling all over the place or running down the sides as has been my experience with other small pots. This is the most used pot in my kitchen and I am completely satisfied with the quality and performance of this cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hideously stupid comedy","review":"Big waste of time for all the talent involved here. Liv Tyler gives a very sexy performance in the best tradition of film noir goddesses as a double-crossing vixen who always gets her way. Paul Reiser, Matt Dillon and John Goodman are the seemingly innocent men who cross her path and fall instantly for her. The plot weaves and weaves like a spider spinning a very complicated web, convincing you that it will end up in a very clever and surprising way. However, a very violent and simplistic ending that seems to have been written by a grade-schooler is the outcome, leaving the audience angry for having been cheated into such an empty experience. It is, however, the first film I've ever seen to mention the inherent value of a DVD player. Michael Douglas (who also co-produced) absolutely steals the show as the hired hit man with a walking carpet on his head."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved it...It is a funny movie","review":"I admit I wasn't looking forward to watching this movie. I thought great another \\"man\\" movie. But, It was funny. And it wasn't Liv Tylor that made the movie funny... she did her job as being the \\"easy freeloader\\" whom works everything into being her way. But the men in this movie were great. They picked the right actors to make it work. I laughed and giggled. It's just a fun movie. John Goodman and Micheal Douglas were great."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE NIGHT WASTED","review":"What was I thinking when I rented this piece of garbage? I already knew Liv Tyler is nowhere near a good actress. So, what was the point? Maybe I got \\"hooked\\" by this being the debut film of Michael Douglas company. Maybe because it had Goodman, Dillon and even Reiser in the cast. Maybe because I was searching for an easy and good laugh. In any case, I sure regret my choice. This movie is bad tasted. Liv's character is obnoxious. It's no the kind of \\"anti-hero villain\\". She is just unbearable. SO, you just don't care about her, if she had a background that turned her into that kind of person or whatever. When you have a screenplay where you simple don't care about the main character, the movie is doomed. The male characters attempt hard to be funny, but with mixed results. The general result is a fiasco, a real turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie","review":"It was so bad I fast-forwarded about 80% of it. That should tell you something... It's not even worth a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste of my time","review":"i have to say that this film was so awful that i simply had to tell someone about it. i was so appalled by this film that i felt confused when it had finished. this is meant to be a comedy? the only stand out joke was the village people sequence, but other than that i thought it was just a nearly-film. it could've been funny, but wasn't. i think it was just an excuse for liv tyler to prance about in short skirts and tight tops. exciting as some may find this, it is certainly not enough to save one of the most dismally awful films i have ever seen."},{"rating":"1","title":"another comedy falls flat","review":"This is another comedy that just doesn't seem to work. It could have been good. Good idea, great group of actors. It's the writing where it fell short. The jokes are juvenile and they fall short. The plot holes are huge. It just isn't funny. I finished watching it, just out of curiousity, but it really isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 stars out of 4","review":"The Bottom Line:A quirky, quickly-forgotten comedy, One Night at McCool's is certainly not a great film but it features a good deal of amusing material and humorous performances from Douglas and Goodman; it's sufficiently different to be worth seeking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slicker than your average poppa","review":"I remember the previews on T.V. when this movie was released and thinking \\"Wow, Liv Tyler is hot!\\". 3 years later I finally get round to watching the movie and discover that Liv Tyler is indeed very hot. However there's much more to this little movie than Liv Tyler's hotness. The movie retells the same story from 3 different points of view, the bartender, the banker and the cop. Each of these stories is slightly different with an enjoyable and entertaining subtlety that really doesn't come across in the preview that concentrates on Liv Tyler washing a car. The subtlety gets kinds lost at the end (losing the movie a star IMHO) but the set up and concept are intelligent enough, and the follow through done well enough that I'd even apply the rarefied term \\"Coen-esque\\" to the project. Top marks all around, I'd suggest buying over renting, as one picks up on more details the second time around. And besides, Liv Tyler is really hot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Douglas's Hair","review":"The funniest thing in this movie is Michael Douglas's hair. The second funniest thing in the movie is watching Paul Reiser run down the street in a bizarre leather S&M getup. The sad thing is, I can't even come up with a third funniest thing.This is a discouraging comment about a comedy.This is a strangely compelling movie though. I gave it only two stars because comedies are supposed to make you laugh, and this one didn't, but something about it stuck with me. I guess I identify with these guys who are being manipulated by a beautiful sex goddess. And I do hang out at a bar eerily similar to McCools, albeit a much smaller bar. I've met some sexy, manipulative women there too, now that I think about it.If you're looking for a movie with any depth, or any soul, you won't find it here. The movie tries to combine the best of the Farrelly brothers with the best of the Coen brothers and fails. Such stunning mediocrity is depressing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best book on evolution for kids or adults","review":"I was absolutely floored by how good this book was as both a biography and also an introduction to the basic arguments, counterarguments, challenges, and triumphs of the theory of evolution. Every major objection is touched on: half a wing, the divine watchmaker, the \\"lack\\" of transitional forms, \\"blending\\" of mutations back into the wild type. The book even covers the Scopes trial, the modern synthesis, and the issue of Social Darwinism. And the story of Darwin himself is compellingly and fairly told. The theory itself is explained in straightforward terms that are easily understood, and the objections are dealt with intellgently and rationally.Bravo, Kristan Lawson. This book is a tour de force of clear explanation and fascinating character study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book","review":"I was pleasantly surprised and amazed at the ensight the author has into our country and spirituality. The author obviously has a great love for Wales and also for his native America. Fortunately he has a great knowledge of Welsh Mythology which makes it easier for us English/Welsh citizens to understand him. I am embarrased to admit that I speak little Welsh and live near Hay-on-wye in Wales. But he really has the Welsh Extremists up in arms (They are the ones that don't want anything said about Wales, unless the OK it!)They are obviously becoming increasingly hostile towards him as positive reviews appear on these pages. They are even advertising a Hate Site, which I looked at yesterday. Terrible. These children need to get a life. But I did find the authors web site: http://www.tylwythteg.com look it over.

Later my spiritual path diverged and I ended up going more toward druidism. BUT I can say this abouthis books with no reservation. He is honest, considerate and (too) trusting of a teacher. He may not care whatothers say about him, but I say that all those who attack him and do not want you to read his books are falseprophets only concerned that people will call them liars if you read his books.This book tells a wonderful story of initiation.

She also shows you how to accessorize with flowers. Covered topics include proper walking technique with high heels on jungle trails, best approaches for posing and how to be in most if not all shots.The glow of Arenal volcano is definetely no match for Aria's lip gloss, those lips look more humid than the mangrove forest.All in all, if you're a big fan of Ms. Alexandra, don't miss this DVD. Oh, and she's like, in Costa Rica or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but an infomercial!","review":"This is nothing but an infomercial about 5 expensive hotels and the tours they can arrange for you. There is little or nothing about the history, culture, or points of local interest. Plenty of shots of the hotel rooms and swimming pools, and how to get a massage from a Parisian with a bad accent.It is narrated by some valley girl who is more interested in showing you her bikini than the country. Gushy dialog but at least she gets the pronunciation correct.This is not a travelogue, it is an embarrassing waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hotel and Restaurant Ads","review":"If you're looking for hotel and restaurant reccomendations, this is for you.

I was looking for something that would cover the different regions, wildlife, and people. I can find hotels, spas, etc. online. The host is even annoying; I think she was trying to make her modeling debut. This DVD covers very little of anything. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Costa \\"Richa\\"","review":"I am so disappointed that there isn't more on DVD about this neat country. We wanted to learn more about the country as a whole; people, different provinces and areas, the economy, etc. What we got was a host who is about ten minutes old, lounging in expensive resort spas and looking at rain forests and waterfalls. And I'm sorry guys, but she is NOT amazing. We kept waiting for the informative stuff to come, but it never happened. We are not backpackers, looking for $15 a night places, nor are we interested in spending as much as possible in a trendy European resort. (From that perspective, it DID feel like a promo for these resorts. Period.) We wanted to see more diverse everything, including common sense hotels, transportation, etc. If you are interested in learning more about Costa Rica, buy the books, not this video. If you're over twenty five years old, you'll be disappointed, I promise you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"Wow, what mixed reviews!! The BAD first: For a movie that was less than 60 minutes, it was too heavy on seeing the inside of a few posh resorts and the people who own them. Also, too much of the pretty host posing in her various bathing suits in front of her mirror, in the pool, by the falls, in the fountain, in the dining room, on the massage table, on a lounger......The GOOD: Some nice shots of the scenery as seen from the resorts, a quick glimpse of the volcano, a great boat ride mangrove tour, some quick glimpses of local towns from the car, a fishing trip, a cute sloth, a little shopping, dancing in nightclub, and nice waterfalls. I feel that I have to buy another video to see Costa Rica, the people, the land, the towns, and what to expect if I go there and can't afford the posh resort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good..!","review":"I have to disagree with the positive reviews of the DVD written here. In fact, I purchased this Costa Rica Traveler's Guide because everyone was so enthusiastic. It was just terrible. My friend and I are going in April, and are trying to figure out what to do and see. This was nothing more than an extended informercial - segments discussing very specific hotels, resorts, and tours. It just seemed like everyone had paid to have thier places shown..! No discussion of the regions, the options, the choices. Just an uncomfortable, terrible actress shilling for the producer's friend's resorts. Save your money and just tivo 'Costa Rica' and watch the Travel Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want those 52 minutes back...","review":"ok, well i guess ill list the positives first: The film is only 52 minutes long, and there's monkeys - that's about it. Anything else that may be somewhat entertaining/educational is due to the country itself, not the way it was shot. That annoying thing blocking the camera is the host, who also provides a pointless narration. About 20 minutes is wasted watching her eat something, blocking a nice sunset, or trying to pull off a personality. Another half hour is spent listening to ex-american hotel/resort owners babbling about the posh sense of style of their establishments.Once you get past the out-of-place host, shaky camera, infommercials, and tons of filler, there is some nice \\"stock footage\\".

Steve Roberts' ability to convey the simplicity of the human spirit is a breath of fresh air, especially in those moments when one feels as though they are gasping for a breath. This book will cause you to consider the vantage from which you view all life and begin to ask your own pointed and poignant questions about what motivates you to do the things you do. And above all else, this book will cause you to smile and laugh out loud!Kenda Stewart"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangilbe perspective","review":"At age 45, after considering I've been in the driver seat of my life for the last 14 years provided many opportunities to at the very least give up whining about my circumstances, and on the brighter side recognize my capacity to create, lovelier things. The essay's written by Steve Roberts, however, broadened my perspective even further. Distinguishing power as an ability to be resilient in the face of any eventuality opened my heart to endless possibilities. I have been most struck by the simplicity of experiencing \\"Love\\", & \\"Being Loving\\", as perhaps an ultimate goal along with listening to my heart. Moreover, owning that I am the knower in my life. With gratitude and deep appreciation I thank you Steve, for sharing your life and your wisdom.

Based on this experience, I would need to order a king-sized comforter set to fit my queen-sized bed. The matching shower curtain & window treatments look like they were made from old, poor quality pillowcases. The whole set looks like it was made in the 70's & is being recycled.

First, don't be fooled by the title. There ain't no Cannibals. It is a VooDoo sect in the Dominican Republic. Yep, the same place from which came Erotic Nights of the Living Dead. This is typical Joe and there is plenty of nudity. If rated it would probably get an \\"R\\". The editing was sloppy to say the least and it was grainy at times.

Charlie S."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I bought this book solely for the Bujold story about Miles' wedding, and was disappointed to find that Miles was a minor character, the wedding was background, and the main focus was a romance between Armsman Roic and Sergeant Taura. Worthy characters, yes, but not Miles. If you are a Bujold fan, you will probably want this story, but maybe it will appear in a later Vorkosigan collection.Reading the reviews, I can see that everyone bought this book based on one author they personally liked. Almost no one liked any of the other stories in the collection. This was true for me. Apparently, this collection afforded equal dissatisfaction for everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this for Winterfair Gifts, don't bother about the rest!","review":"Like other reviewers, I bought this anthology for one story - Lois McMaster Bujold's 'Winterfair Gifts' - and I'd give that story on it's own 5 stars. I'm not sure it's particularly accessible for a reader unfamiliar with the Vorkosiverse, but for Miles devotees it was deeply satisfying. While I understand another reviewer's disappointment that Miles and Ekaterin were peripheral characters in this story which centres on Roic and Taura, I don't really share that disapointment. Ms Bujold is always a 'thinking' and intelligent writer - the Vorkosigan books are mainly written from Miles' point of view and it was most illuminating (and alternately hysterically funny and deeply touching)to see him through other eyes.I must confess that I'm more an SF/Fantasy reader than a romance reader, which is probably why I found most of the rest of the book pretty unreadable, but I don't begrudge a cent of the purchase price - the Bujold story was worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth It For Bujold Fans","review":"I'm the kind of completist who'll buy an entire anthology for one story. In this case, that story was \\"Winterfair Gifts,\\" Lois McMaster Bujold's short story set in her Miles Vorkosigan universe.And I have to say, that one story was worth my eight bucks. It's a charming little piece that bridges the gap between Ms. Bujold's A CIVIL CAMPAIGN and DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY, with the wedding of Miles and Ekaterin as seen through the eyes of Roic, a minor supporting character from previous novels. Alongside that plot, Roic's tentative courtship of Sergeant Taura is a bit \\"romantic comedy\\" (easily avoidable misunderstandings, etc.), but it still manages to be subtly touching.I can't say the rest of the book interests me, but I'm nevertheless satisfied with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad stories from great writers","review":"Although Asaro is one of my favorites in terms of enjoying the world and people she invents, she's not a world-class writer in terms use of language. She's an idea-centered rather than word-centered, if that makes any sense to you. This collection proves she's also not a good managing editor. It seems like each author sent in a story from their drawer of stuff-I-wrote-that-never-sold. And unfortunately Asaro accepted these terribly weak contributions by great names rather than prodding them to do better. I gamely tried to read each story, then gave up in disgust and gave the book away to a local charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"What a disappointment! I was looking for a little romance in these stories but failed to find any. They are bland, trite, attempts at writing futuristic stories with unpronounceable names and places.

And almost no Miles! But I enjoyed it anyway. I do think new readers would be puzzled. You have to know the backstory to follow the action.As for the rest, I tried to read each one, but just couldn't engage. The worst was the Putney, with its cliches and its total lack of historical sense despite all the right names and places; the Stover had an interesting idea, as did the Roberson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bujold & the rest","review":"I bought this book in order to complete my collection of Miles Vorkosigan stories (his marriage to Ekaterina). Bujold is excellent as always and would merit 6 stars. The rest is standard sci-fi romance and should be regarded as packaging of the Miles story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better to buy Winterfair Gifts alone as a downloadable audiobook","review":"Bujold's WINTERFAIR GIFTS is fun, but the rest are lackluster. My solution made me happy--I got rid of this book and bought WINTERFAIR GIFTS alone as a downloadable audiobook through audible.com.It's a good story to hear read aloud, and the reader does a fine job. I've listened to it a couple times already.

A couple of nice exceptions: Jo Beverly's \\"The Trouble with Heroes,\\" which succeeds in creating a complex and potentially sinister hero; and Lois McMaster Bujold's \\"Winterfair Gifts,\\" which details a small but satisfying part of the Miles Vorkosigan saga. Vorkosigan fans may have missed this one (I did, for years) because it is not shelved with the Bs at local bookstores."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the trouble","review":"Six stories; the Bujold is all right, maybe even four stars in its own right, but the rest of them range from mediocre to dreck, with \\"Skin Deep\\" being a notably low point. Bad story--obvious storyline, unconvincing dialogue, nonsensical plotting, embarrassing attempts at humor, random \\"surprise!\\" elements. Full disclosure here: I like Bujold, and SF as a genre, and not romance as a genre. If you're a Vorokosigan completist, you might want the book for \\"Winterfair Gifts\\", but otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"O, gentle readers, please do resist!","review":"This book promises to bring Fantasy/Science Fiction and Romance together. Well, it does, but the result is less than satisfying. I bought this book as a SF/F fan and was disappointed, but I don't think Romance readers would have been satisfied with this shabby combination either.(And I do read enough romances) Authors tried to make one plus one two, and ended up with only one half. For other reviewers said enought, just let me complain about Deb Stover's _Skin Deep_. Frankly speaking, I don't think the author even knows what fantasy is. If you are a decent fantasy reader, skip this paranomal romance. I wouldn't be this harsh if this story was among the Harlequin collections....Simply put, it shouldn't be in a collection which claims to be a Fantasy/SF book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Carmen Jones CD","review":"A friend had an LP of this many years ago, I always loved it which was the reason I ordered it.

If you know Bizet's Carmen, you will immediately recognize the music on this CD... even if you don't know the opera you have probably heard some of the music. However, this adaption changes the libretto significantly. I personally am not a fan. If I want to hear Carmen I will listen to Carmen. If I want to hear Carmen in English, I could find a English translated recording. This doesn't fit. It sounds too much like the opera, even the singers are quite operatic. The new setting isn't different enough to give the listener something fascinatingly different. Whats the point? I don't suggest this, really, to anyone other than collectors. I don't even have a favorite song. Two stars and the only reason is it still uses Bizet's beautiful music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Closest up lens","review":"This is a minimum price maximum operation lens of our contemporary cameras.

(If taken within 2 minutes of each other).There are two memories, I guess M2 could be for spouse or loved one.In the morning, I clear the entire memory by erasing/deleting the Average or \\"A\\" reading.Then throughout the day, I take several readings (only the last 30 are retained).The readings are numbered 1 thru 30 with 1 being the most recent.The \\"A\\" reading is the average reading.Thus at night or first thing in the morning BEFORE erasing the memory, I record the \\"A\\" reading for that day.I also record if I had an irregular heart beat...note that the unit does NOT save the irregular heart beat if detected. You will have to remember that on your own.I was so pleased that I just ordered a second one for using at work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not accurate","review":"I wasn't impressed by this particular wrist BP monitor. We used it on several clients and didn't get consistent readings. Not even for a wrist monitor.

What a shame that what could have been the defining moment of alt-Christian music turned out just to be another sleepfest of spiritual songs. That said, there does exist 3 or 4 tracks worth a listen. Indeed, the Vigilantes of Love rendition of Bruce Cockburn's \\"Wondering Where the Lions Are,\\" the Over the Rhine song, and the Ashley Cleveland tune almost make this CD worth purchasing. The rest is just uninspiring filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Most reviewers mention how they eagerly anticipated this CD, since there are so many great artists contributing. I also had high hopes for it, since a few of the artists are among my favorites. So I was actually shocked at how mediocre it is, and how even the contributions of my favorite musicians seemed dull and lifeless. It is as if they asked some of the greatest Christian bands to give them the worst song they ever recorded, and then put them all into a compilation. This CD is not worth your time or money. If you want a good mix of contemporary Christian artists, a WOW mix would be a better choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different mix","review":"\\"Roaring Lambs\\" really caught my eye when I first saw it, with names like Jars of Clay, Delirious, Sixpence None the Richer. Some of the songs are really enjoyable too. (My personal faves include \\"Touch\\" by Delirious, \\"Daisies and Roses\\" by Burlap to Chashmere, and \\"Kingdom Come\\" by PFR.) And of course, I was anxious to see what a Steven Curtis Chapman and Michael W. Smith duet would sound like. ...But, a lot of the songs just didn't do it for me. Speaking for teens out there, I think \\"Roaring Lambs\\" is better suited for adults. It's definitely a variety of groups I know and love, and of artists I've never heard of, making a CD with a lot of great songs, and ones you gotta learn to like."},{"rating":"2","title":"How could it go wrong?","review":"With all these good artists, how could this CD go wrong?

I was dissappointed.A number of the reviews tend to be based on the artist roster or the lyrical content. That is a shame, because musically I felt this to be a very bland mish-mash. The inspiration is great, the roster of artists impressive, the end result...?I rarely listen to any track other than the Jars of Clay offering \\"Headstrong.\\" Consistent with other Jars of Clay material.\\"Christian music\\" tends to have a relative merit. It can often be good WITHIN its field, but not great in the grand scheme of musical achievement IMHO.Note: 1) The Delirious? track is a remix of a song previously found on a UK single2) The Sixpence None The Richer track is nothing like Kiss Me, or its parent album, again IMHO.There seems to be some dissappointed people giving this a large number of stars...Still, the variety of favourite tracks from revewiers shows that something worked very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even get","review":"The sound quality is horrendous, with the inability to correctly split up the different sound channels.Don't buy this.It's a generally miserable product.For example, I used the headphones once, then stashed them away.After looking for a piece of string for a few minutes, I realized I could use these cords as string to hang something up. I cut the headphone cord to use as string.That's how bad they are.So, basically, if you want expensive, cheap string, you probably should go with these.

I was disappointed. The movie drags, and while parts capture your attention, overall it completely lost mine. I cannot tell you how it ended.

I was interested to see the film, but I didn't know how the book could really be translated into a movie. Mangold and Ryder took a stab at it. I feel it was mutilated. (I don't blame it completly on them.) The acting was seriously lacking, other than that of Brittney Murphy. Yes, I DO NOT feel Angelina Jolie did a good job of acting. She was nothing like Lisa, however none of the characters were the same. There were many details of the story that were left out. All in all I was disappointed. It's also sad that the only attention the film recieved was Angelina Jolie's performance, which was not Oscar (or even Golden Globe!) worthy. (Brittney Murphy gets one star, every other aspect of the film- 0!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Susanna has a lot of spirit and courage","review":"I love this movie I gave it four stars instead of five because the acting was good but the story of her life did run flat like things in our life do.

I was expecting so much more..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Girl Interrupted has a great cast.","review":"The movie itself lacks quality and meaning. I can't fathom how bad it would be to sit through if it didn't star Angelina Jolie and Winona Ryder. If you're huge fans of either, than it's worth watching. However, if you want to see an excellent movie about psycho therapy and the mental ward, then see 'One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest' staring Jack Nicholson. I give Girl Interrupted two stars, one for Angelina and one for Winona."},{"rating":"2","title":"hits the right marks","review":"based on the real life events of susanna keyson's 18 month stay at a mental hospital, girl interrupted tells the story of susanna's stay, were she learns she has a borderline personality disorder, meets a colorful cast of people from a pathological liar, a burn victom, a few anorexics, and the local troublemaker, a sociopath. ryder and jolie give golden performences. ryder absolutly shines as susanna, bringing her raw emotion and some crackling humor. with all this, i was shocked when she didn't get a oscar nod. jolie really gives her best performence so far for me, she just chews up the scenes playing lisa and rightfully deserved that oscar. whoopi goldberg and vennesa redgrave also give great supporting roles as two workpeople and as for the patients played by brittany murphy, clea duvall, and others also shine. a great film in shades of 'one flew over the cuckoo's nest' a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"winona should have gotten an award!","review":"YEs, angelina did a good job but this film truly belongs to winona ryder who did an excellant job as a girl who gets put in a mental institution(but shes not really that crazy). along the way she runs into angelina(a nutcase), brittany murphy(who likes laxatives and chicken. and look for angela bettis(who is in may and carrie). she does a great job too. my favorite part was the ice cream parlor scene where angelina gets into it with mary kay place. recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Been there, done that","review":"I rated \\"Girl Interrupted\\" a 4 star not because it was so outstanding, with the exception of Jolie's performance, but because it was made at all.In the late 60's and early 70's in a time of political and social ambivalence, it was very popular and yes, fashionable to hospitalize teenagers and young adults. The movie, for me, was an incredibly disturbing flashback of a time I had pushed in the farthest reaches of my mind.\\"Girl\\" was true to the daily life, give or take the hospital, but became muttled. I plan to read the book for more clarity but wish more people would see this movie. They need to see \\"the other side\\" and remember that unfortunately some of these hospitals created adults, from children, whose NORMALITY IS INSTITUTIONS. They live, they work, they raise families but are not quite \\"in the swing\\" of society."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive Work.","review":"Girl, Interrupted starts unconvincingly, but it makes up for a boring start when Susanna Kaysen (Winona Ryder) arrives at Vannacutt Mental Institution when she is accused of killing herself.All the performances in Girl, Interrupted are downright amazing. Winona Ryder hasn't been this good in an extremely long amount of time, Angelina Jolie earned her Golden Globe undoubtely; her performance is strong and convincing. While those two leads got the most credit, other more un-known actors like Clea DuVall, Brittany Murphy and Elisabeth Moss also put in amazing effort in this impressive and satisfying drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disfunctional World","review":"The movie has a real, thoughtful plot, which is not an everyday occurrence in Hollywood. I liked it, because it tells a compelling story of real people, whose life brings them face to face with the realization that the real world is essentially disfunctional, and that the so-called \\"mental\\" people are just as part of this world, and in some respect more sane than the mainstream. Angelina Jolie rules. I would buy this one without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Cast, Intriguing Story","review":"Angelina Jolie won an Oscar for her role in this film, but the real star was Wynona Rider, who cemented her claim as one of the best actresses Hollywood has to offer. The film is worthwhile simply for the performances, but the story works well enough as well. While the \\"crazy\\" roles were somewhat cliche, especially as compared with \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest\\", the story behind Susanna kept me fascinated throughout the film. Much like \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley,\\" this is a character study. We watch her multiple transformations take place in the context of the story, but the story is just there to make her that much more interesting.This is a film I highly recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"borish fantasy","review":"I agree with the Amazon reviewers first two points. its a coocoo's nest setup and actors love to play loonies so they can get away with over blown performances.would you pay money to be locked in the room with a borderline personality? HELL NO!!! in real life borderlines are incurable. theyre damage too severe - their personalities too scrambled. fortunately this movie is very inconsistant - and plays fast and loose with the actual mental illness part of the story.really the story is about actresses. you get a borish depressed winona and an agressive bitchy angelina. you may find that entertaining. but i found it dull and annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will need time to re-adapt to real life","review":"Not bad, but after seeing crazy girls during so much time, and some becoming more and more crazy, you will need hours to re-adapt to real life.In fact, A.

Fun Viewing, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"This is a spectacular movie. Angelina Jolie giving an Oscar-winning performance. The then little known Brittany Murphy also stars a bulimic at the instituion. Winona Ryder plays Susanna Kaysen well.

Also, random, but I counted one day and they say the f-word about 30-something times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ryder & Jolie - At home at last","review":"Oh dear, oh dear... The young-woman-full-of-angst-thing had already gotten pretty tired by the time that this movie hit the screens. I'm afraid that I have little to nothing godd to say about this film. It's greatest shortcoming is it's failure to generate any sympathy for these young women struggling to overcome whatever it is they feel they must overcome... in my opinion they need to overcome overwhelming self-involvement. Drab, dull, tiresome, annoying - all words that come to mind remembering sitting in the multiple watching and hoping it would get better. It didn't.Appropraite casting - Ryder and Jolie seem right at home in a mental institution. Whoopi Goldberg bounces around the periphery of this film killing every moment of fun. Like any review this is my take... plenty of people enjoyed it and clearly found some redeeming qualities, but they were lost on me.This was one girl that deserved to be interrupted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mad in a good way","review":"At the same time that her contemporaries were heading off to college in 1967, 18-year-old Susanna Kaysen (Ryder) was signing herself into a psychiatric hospital after trying to cure a headache by downing a bottle of aspirin with a vodka chaser. Done that, bin there, one might say.Girl, Interruptedis based on a 1993 memoir of the same name by Kaysen about her years of living madly. The film heads into manic overdrive toward the end but is for the most part a well-acted, sensitive portrait of a troubled young woman's journey back to emotional well-being. In a role that makes perfect use of her edgy fragility, Ryder registers more strongly than she has in recent films. As a psychopathic pal, Jolie (The Bone Collector) again proves mesmerizing, while Goldberg nicely underplays her role as a sympathetic supervisor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ryder and Jolie a good pair","review":"Winona Ryder and Angelina Jolie worked well together in this movie. Both bring forth the energy of their parts. I did feel that there was some room for improvement in the story itself but overall it is worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overall a dull film","review":"Within five minutes of this movie I realized I had seen the whole thing. But I continued watching due to a demand from the woman on my arm. As a screenplay writer I guess I can gain a very different perspective on this movie than she can, it can be summed up in two words. 1.) Dull. 2.) Predictable The plot is definately substandard, hence the review thats below even an average 3 stars. Silly lines that I could say with Ryder's character as she said them like when shes confronted with the fact that she had a whole bottle of liquor and an entire bottle of aspirin, \\"I had a headache.\\" More like you used to have an excellent acting career, and now you're only making headaches. The movie actually seemed to end several times. After I had watched an hour and a half there was an actual conclusion to the movie, but then it seemed to start up again from about the middle of the plot, and this happened again fifteen minutes later. This film really isn't worth viewing, let alone buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't really follow the book, does it?","review":"Lots of extra stuff that wasn't in Kaysen's memoir--that bothers me. It just seemed like it was a chance for Winona Ryder to attempt \\"real\\" acting, and to gain respect as an actor. Instead, Jolie snagged the Oscar, and Ryder slipped into A Scanner Darkly.Ryder again showcases her highly over-emotive acting ability that has been overrated from day one, and Jolie gets to look crazy and beautiful at the same time for the umpteenth millionth time. YAWN.Read the book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"*Jaw drop*","review":"I went into this movie, with two of my better friends, one of their mothers, and one of their sisters. I was the ONLY GUY!Guys hate that situation, especially when the gals pick the movie, however as an openminded young chap *g* I willingly went along to see the most amazing movie!Wynona Rider, Angelina Jolie, and Clea DuVall all made me leave the theatre with thoughts about their characters and the such.The acting, the writing, the EVERYTHING was so amazing about this movie. It was great.And to boot it's one of the best movies I've ever seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie, Excellent","review":"\\"Girl, Interrupted\\" is the story of Susanna (Winona Ryder), a troubled teen who ends up in a mental institution following a botched suicide attempt. Based on a true story, this film is very similar to \\"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\\" expect for the fact that Susanna is self-committed and this movie has a relatively happy ending. There are a number of stellar performances in this film, and although Ryder was given top billing, Angelina Jolie steals the show as Lisa, a disturbed patient, the role which ultimately won Jolie an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It's intense, dramatic, and jarring, and the cast is superb, with the exception of Whoopi Goldberg, who is just sort of floating around the hospital playing a nurse. Still, \\"Girl, Interrupted\\" is definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Susanna Kaysen's darkest days","review":"Girl, Interrupted is an exceptionally superb film. The cast is superb and the story is done exceptionally well. Winona Ryder may be the star but Angelina Jolie steals the show. She's uncredible effective in every scene, making her performance all the more real.The movie details the time writer Susanna Kaysen spent in a mental hospital. It features her day to day ordeal and the many different people she encountered. It's a delight of a film.A shocking and well acted film. Not as good as the superiorOne Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (Two-Disc Special Edition)but a definite delight.The DVD features a commentary, a couple deleted scenes, a small featurette, and some trailers for Ryder and Jolie pictures.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sporadically engaging film","review":"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest did it much, much better. Girl Interrupted drags up too many cliches and only managed intermittently to retain interest for me. It begins well, and I was genuinely fascinated by the way the film pulled us into Winona Ryder's mind, but after an hour I found myself looking at my watch and praying for it to end: None of the characters managed to keep much more than a slender hold on my sympathy; and I got the uneasy impression that we were supposed to look up to Whoopi Goldberg as some sort of strong, admirable maternal figure simply because it WAS Whoopi Goldberg, in the absence of any real depth to her character. The central character's emergence from the brink of insanity into a mature, upstanding young role model of a woman at the end of the film was rather too sudden to be believable.A nice soundtrack helped, but ultimately Girl Interrupted was far too patchy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Girk Interrupted","review":"This movie is chock full of big name actresses. it is a good account of a person's journey through mental illness, Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"demanded subject line","review":"little depressing and simply didn't care for it what else is there to say except didn't like it so oh well"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different kind of movie","review":"Very surprised with Angelina 's character, Winona was very convinicing, Whoopie was very good in her role, over all a good movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"This movie is the best movie out there. It has a great story line to it and it is just awesome. Very funny but very sad at times, and Angelina Jolie is the best actress out there and she plays Lisa great. Been better if Nicole Kidman played Winona Ryders part and Catherine Zeta Jones as Clea Duvalls character. They all rock but Angelina and GI are best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible acting, and a depressing but realistic portayal","review":"This is a movie where Wynona Ryder interrupts her life to take a year stay at a mental clinic (set in the 1960s). Wynona has no friends, nor anything to live for, but she finds life and friends in the institution. Incredible acting from the entire cast, Ryder, Jolie, Whoopie Goldberg and a slew of others, however there is a downfall that this movie is extremely depressing, but that is what gets Oscars. Depressing because of the real problems that some have in their life or someone else's and certain racial slurs to get on the nerves of nurse Whoopie. If you are a happy or perfect person this movie is not for you, but if you want a story of human life and its problems this is a realistic portrayal. As for the DVD features, they are all great, a making of documentary, trailers, must see removed scenes. This is what a DVD is all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Flew over the Girl","review":"Of course any movie made about people in a psychiatric ward will resemble the classic 'One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest'. This we also do not know for sure if the leading character is sane or not.Winona Ryder is great in this movie, though a little too pretty. The best perfomance comes from Angelina Jolie, who is just amazing. The movie is sometimes a little sad, frightening, scary but also moving. The ending is a little sweet but not too sweet. A happy ending with a twist.The music is great since it plays in 1968, although the theme of the sixties is a little underplayed. It is still a great movie though."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I didn't get into this movie at all. It's not my type. Too much shouting and boring repetitious scenes. Some good acting.

A definite buy -- an excellent value for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pretty and sturdy tea set","review":"I initially bought this set for my niece and was very impressed by how sturdy it was, and even more so by how cute each of the pieces are. The color scheme and designs on each piece are so rich and make for a very pretty and fun tea set. This is truly a must have item. I will be buying another set soon for my own daughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"This is a great little item, but if the wind gets too strong it will blow away on you.

This was the MOST ridiculous of ALL Stone Barrington novels. It appears that Stuart Woods is getting lazier with his writing and expounding his moralistic, political bent in the guise of a bestselling novel. How in these volatile times he can even justify the path this novel took with that idiotic character, Stone Barrington, taking the side of a hired assassin/ terrorist is beyond all comprehension. Not to mention, he makes many of the folks who serve to protect us from terrorists and evil look like fools. The intelligence community really should speak out against this kind of defamation. There comes responsibility when exercising the 1st ammendment. No more of his novels for me, either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Barrington plots revisited.","review":"I have read every novel of Stuart Woods. I was looking forward to the next Stone Barrington saga. Unfortunately, when I read this book it was like reliving many of the same plots included in Woods other books.The plot of this book was totally unbelievable. I read the other reviews listed. I honestly did not have the same impression.One small point, Woods does not finish the storyline that the story begins with.From the size of the print and line spacing it appears that Woods had to really stretch to make his 300 pages.One of the teasers from the last book was not followed up on. The Arrington character does not appear in this book, even though she was moving to New York and Barrington was desperately trying to reach her in the Short Forever.This book was not worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters","review":"Stuart delivers one of his strongest plots. Good characters and, for a change, a smart criminal. Stuart also has found a good ending, seemingly so hard in book writing today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carpenter in New York?","review":"Stone is back in New York and who should appear \\"Carpenter\\". But, it seems that she is involved in a simple divorce case that Stone is working on. This simple case seems to have international intrigue written all over it.As usual the voice that I associate with Stone Barrington is Tony Roberts and he does a great job with all the other voices.While some of this book was predictable it was also interesting how Woods put a few twists and turns in which show how every day booboos can cause a big problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Work??? Try Sloppy Writing by S. Woods","review":"I eagerly anticipated this book but was so disappointed and angered by the obvious sexist slant. The characters were flat. Plus there were tons of typos and run on sentences. Woods is slipping fast into dementia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Ridiculous","review":"This is the first Stuart Woods book I have read (listened to) and it will be my last. I thought it was lame and unbelieveable. I was irritated by Stone's alternating levity at inappropriate times, and pompous moralizing. The British accents were very amateur, and the voices muffled. Toward the end, I just laughed at how stupid the plot had become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dirty Work","review":"I eagerly awaited another Stone Barrington novel, and was very disappointed in this one!! The characters (other than Stone and Dino) were very boring, and towards the end when I hoped for an explosive conclusion, I was even more disappointed. Hopefully the next Barrington story will lift my spirits about Stuart Woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stuart Woods at his best - and that is saying alot","review":"Brilliant dialogue, seamless plot transitions and Stone Barrington. What more could you want? Keep up this level of storytelling, Mr. Woods. With great writing like this you deserve to be the number one bestselling novelist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Disappointment","review":"I've always been fond of Stone Barrington. Well, after reading this little diddy, \\"appalled\\" would be a more appropriate feeling. I really can't believe Stuart Woods is the author of this giddy, illogical piece-of-fluff! Take some time off Stuart! This is not the kind of writing that will keep true admirers true!! I kept waiting for the book to get better. It didn't. After finishing it, I just sat in a dumb funk for a while, wondering why I had wasted my time reading the whole thing. Too bad............."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining and kept me turning pages.","review":"Somehow I missed this book in the Stone Barrington series, so I checked it out from the library. Even though this is the 5th or 6th book, I was still able to read it and not feel I missed anything in the series. I think that's a tribute to the author. In my opinion this was an easy, entertaining read, but it still kept me turning the pages. I found that Stone Barrington is back in NYC. My only problem with the story was that about midway the story got a little boring when \\"La Biche\\" kept changing her identity and it was hard to keep up on who she was at that moment. Overall it was an excellent, and not a serious read but still entertaining. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great introduction to medieval siege warfare techniques","review":"I bought this book since I am interested in medieval history, rather than a specific interest in medieval warfare. The book is quite short, but it is well illustrated both with drawings and color pictures which also include works done circa the period in question. The short book is very informative both from a general historical and military perspective. The book describes medieval castles and fortresses and how their design is based on military defensive needs. The book then discusses sieges as well as various machines created to overcome castle defences. Various artillery including canons and catapults are also covered. The book is well done, and though it is short, it wets the appetite for further reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly Uneven","review":"This is one of those books where a dictionary is essential if you are not very familiar with the terms used. Nice illustration but many poorly explained. Many illustration distant from explanatory text. I got this from a library.

That said, I have always loved Vampire films and this one is very different!***SPOILERS***It's about a family of vampires that survive in the modern world by living off of a blood bank that they own. One night one of the vampires is attacked in the street by a mugger and she kills him, drinks his blood and contracts AIDS. What followa is how the vampire family deals with the situation.This film is an original and fresh look at vampire lore and is acted amazingly well by Matt Locker, Deana Demko and Cathy Loch. I didn't care for the one or two sex scenes in this, but that is a minor complaint. The special effects were decent and there is a very large cast, multiple locations and it's all handled well by director John Orrichio. If you like his style check out Dreams of the Dead and Abduction too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A LOOK AT THE GRAY AREA","review":"This is a great book that not only documents the life of one of our importatnt leaders but it documents very clearly the thought process used by Casey to find and work his magic in the \\"gray\\" areas of politics, business and the law. The book provides insight into the real world of politics from Nixon to Reagan and right through Capitol Hill."},{"rating":"2","title":"An informative and balanced look at a controversial American","review":"Persico provides a balanced look at the deceased former Director of Central Intelligence. William Casey has served as both a lightning rod for criticism of the Reagan Administration's proactive foreign policy and as a right-wing hero. Unfortunately both of these views display an amazing inability to take into consideration all of the facts. The author presents Casey in an objective light, showing that the former OSS man often did what he felt was right for the country but in a fashion that just as often went outside the rule of law. Most importantly, Persico gives a more balanced and accurate view of Casey's role in the Iran-Contra scandal than the view presented in Bob Woodward's Secret Wars. Anyone interested in the career of one of the most respected and disrespected of America's former spy chiefs is encouraged to read Casey, from the OSS to the CIA."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'VE LEARNED MANY THINGS FROM IT.","review":"This book contains much information about my program in \\"Tehran University\\".I study on use of CO2 laser to remove white lesions of oral mucosa.I think chapters \\"2,5,6,7,8\\" are the best chapters of this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful for nails","review":"I really like how my nails look and feel after I use this treatment. I find I get the best results by removing my polish and using this nail balsam 2 or 3 times a day on the days that I don't work. I am a nurse, so my hands are in soap and water or alcohol based cleansers repeatedly on work days and my nails are in deplorable condition. I am endlessly searching for something to stop them from tearing and peeling. This product seems to help to moisturize them on the days that I don't work. I am still searching for a good strengthener/protector to wear on work days to protect my fragile nails.**Edited Jan 28, 2013** it was a short love affair. This product was nice for a few weeks, then my cuticles were becoming more and more dry. I finally found that my cuticles were better on the days I forgot to use this product. I have moved on to another product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work for someone else","review":"Last winter I realized that my nails might have been peeling and soft most of my life because they were dry. I've tried many products and thought I was doomed, but last winter I started to rub an eye cream that I'd purchased long ago into the nail and the cuticle. Kind of buffed the surface also. Figured that I didn't have anything to lose. Made a huge positive difference! Also my husband has been annoyed that a particular nail he needs for playing the guitar keeps chipping and splitting. So i searched for a fingernail moisturizer for both of us and was surprised to find such a thing. Unfortunately the Trind didn't didn't work for my spouse, and the jury is still out on me as i can't give up my eye cream trick ( DHC was better than Estee Lauder). Have been using the Butter London polish occasionally as well.... Will let you know later if this works well for me in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made my nails dryer!","review":"I did not buy it from Amazon. I tried to, but the seller was out of stock. So I looked elsewhere online, and was able to find it. I'm sorry I did. My nails felt HORRIBLE after applying this balsam. My nails felt more dry and brittle after applying it. So much so, that a couple of my nails literally broke off at the tips shortly after applying. And I did NOT break them. My nails had this \\"weird\\" feeling, almost as though this stuff drained the life out them, and were terribly dry. NO moisture at all. It seemed to do the exact opposite of what it was suppose to do. But to be fair, I bought another brand at another beauty store, and my nails felt the same way. So in reality, the nail balsam's dry your nails MORE! At least it's what it did to mine. My high hopes were shredded. I hope others have better results, but for me, I'm tossing this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for nails and cuticles","review":"This Trind nail balsam is a wonderful healthy treat for your nails. I have been using it for about a year. I have seen a difference in my nails and cuticles. It just soaks right into my nails and cuticles giving them the moisture they need. Highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"short lived fun","review":"This toy has been on and off the market for a few years. Two years ago my daughter had one. It worked well and was lots of fun. But one day upon pulling the cord, it broke and wound inside the toy. There was no way to pull it back out. She was heart broken, so we bought her another one. This one lights up, like the current one. She was able to launch the toy twice before the string broke! I contacted the company and was basically told \\"too bad too sad.\\" If you buy it, make sure it's somewhere you can return it to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I wasn't pleased with this costume at all. First of all, the \\"belt\\" it comes with is a thin piece of pleather that will likely have been folded during packaging. Once it's folded, you'll never get it to lay flat. Also, it doesn't go all the way around your waist, you have to attach a ribbon of fabric to it and tie that around your waist. The belt looks really awkward, but the costume looks horrible without it, fits like a potato sack. Also, the neckline isn't a true V-neck. It has a drawstring that ties in front and if you position it just so, you can make it look like a V-neck, but it won't stay that way for long. Also, the dress is very, very short on the sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"Africa's Big Five","review":"An excellent addition to any personal or library bookshelf!

Each piece is shown in full color, alongside a short story by the designer about the piece and a short biography of the designer.There are substantial and varying degrees of professionalism in these pieces. Some are great, others are ... not so great. Some are very detailed, others quite simplistic. Some of the color choices are, shall I say, interesting (but I wouldn't want them in my home!)

The reasons you should get this CD as as follows: CB the red caboose. The real villian of Starlight Express. He's mean, funny, and has a great funk song. No comeback: A song with a great tune that really shows how self centered Elektra (yup that's the original spelling) is. This is also the only CD with Call Me Rusty (a very good song).The low points of this CD: It's very dated. If you like 80s music then this isn't a proplem. Belle: The most annoying and pointless character in the show. She was better in the Broadway Production but still pointless so she finally got totally removed (Thank goodness)This is the cost complete of the English dialog CDs and tells the story the best.

Its also refreshing that Angie does her best to be supportive this time, and not as pushy, letting Paavo's character finally get a little development finally after 7 books. The Angie which doesn't have to be so forceful is definitely an improvement- too bad Pence couldn't hold Angie back for more then this book, as Angie emerges self-centered and shallow (except for random moments of lucidity coming from seemingly nowhere now and then) and the bizarre background story to make it \\"interesting\\" (but really just ridiculous) in the next book, Bell Cook and Candle.

To me that's just a big waste of time when you consider that there isn't anyone in Christian music today with their sound. For those of us who listen primarily (or exclusively) to Christian music, The Swift are a nice change of pace to what is typically being offered.Buy the albumn, enjoy the albumn, sing along with the albumn, give the albumn to a friend.It's obvious that the guys in the band don't take themselves too seriously, so maybe all those who would malign the band ought not to either.All in all, these are guys who love Jesus, and who play fun, energetic, enjoyable music."},{"rating":"1","title":"small characters","review":"The book itself is very interesting, but the characters are so small that I regreted that I ever bought this book.Next time please warn customer about this serious defect."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was expecting something interesting...","review":"Holly Valance isn't a bad singer, and her lush singles Kiss Kiss and Down Boy really backed that up, however, the resulting album Footprints is quite bluntly, boring and unoriginal.Once whacked into the CD player, your greeted by the sultry Kiss Kiss, followed by another middle-eastern flavoured groove called Tuck Your Shirt In, and then the very cool Down Boy. These songs are quite good...your starting to think that maybe the album will work and was worth buying, but from the moment the horrible chords for City Ain't Big Enough begin, you realise the mistake you made.The following tracks are typical, cheap, British pop...the kind you'd find in the reject pile of Britney Spears' earlier work.I was dissapointed by the lack of substance this album had, and am hoping Holly's next album is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull And Duller","review":"Unlike some former reviewers, I have no trouble with pop, or British pop.

I'd never heard a Holly Valance song but was under the impression it was a dancey kind of album.

Yes, all the songs apart from 2 or 3 were upbeat and easy to dance to but NO WAY could I play it on a high volume. I think her voice was tremendously awful and the music was your typical generic crappy modern pop. Songs 3, 4, 7, 8 , 9 and 12 were just about bearable on a low volume. The rest were just cringworthy. But to think this album is out there being offered for 30 dollars?

Unfortunately, despite having a pretty decent voice, Valance has produced a record that sounds like it was written by a drum programmer who started trying to write songs four weeks ago.Loops, loops and more loops -- that's the modus operandi of this record. With no sense of build to any of the songs, and not a single memorable lyrical or melodic hook, the songs off Footprints are just drum patterns married to basslines, with vocals that always seem to stay within a three-note range, repeating unmemorable \\"melodies\\" that get boring by the third time they repeat. Choruses repeat without build, drama or passion, and the lyrics are plainly embarrassing.Valance needs to find some real musicians to collaborate with."},{"rating":"2","title":"WTC with feeling","review":"I share the views of the first reviewer. There is something rich and beautiful about the sound of Korevaar's piano, and the sound of the recording is very natural.

Megaherz's music isn't as heavy as Rammstein's and the singer sings faster than Till. Some of the songs have rap stlye lyrics which sounds good. I do not like rap at all but for some odd reason it works in german. MY favorite song would have to be Hurra- Wir Leben Noch and the rest of the songs are good except Burn, Hanchenklein, Das Licht Am Ende Der Welt. The second disc has a bunch of remixes that I didn't care for at first because I don't like remixes but after some time they grew on me and now I like them.

Feminist re-readings of the Qur'an, hadith, and fiqh works are best done by people who can read the originals. Anyone can put forth fresh interpretations, and even limit those to available English translated materials, but they will never carry the weight needed for influence over a wide variety of the world's Muslims.

The perspective that women have always been oppressed through out history. The way she regards hadiths is that she rejects most of them and even critizes the narrators to be sexist. She also criticizes the four Imams ie. Shafii, instead of being more balanced in her writing about the contributions of these four Imams.There are indeed diverse interpretations within the views of Islamic scholars, both women and men, however, as human beings we can embrace them or if we do not agree with them, at least respect them and share our perspectives without degrading them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It fails the common sense test.","review":"I read this book and learnt a lot about the apologists arguments of the status of women in Islam.

The handle seems to be heavier than the pot! It is so thin... it took 25 minutes to boil water for macaroni. In all of my other cuisinart pots it takes maybe 5, 8 if I start from really cold water. Yes, I know how to use stainless... yes, I know how to use proper heat for the diameter of the pan--this thing is just well--crap.

UPS finally arrived for pick-up on third try and the exchange is done!I used the new pan and all is well!

It's easy to clean just keep some steel wool pads around for stubborn messes. The cover is a nice addition. It certainly isn't a high end pan like and All Clad but do you really need it?

I bought it to go with my Cuisinart Multiclad set, which is heavy and sturdy and handsome, because this handy all-purpose piece isn't made in that set. It's an attractive pan that works well, but personally I do much prefer the gleaming thickness of the Cuisinart Multiclad line (which looks a lot like the Calphalon stainless cookware). If you have the Cuisnart Chef's Classic line and like it, I think you'll be happy with this piece. If you're deciding between the two, I'd say watch for specials on sets (Amazon has great prices) and go for the slightly more expensive Multiclad line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ready-to-Use = Good for Me","review":"I'm about to student teach on the block schedule.

That can and has been done well, many times over, but not by means of lectures dressed up as Socratic dialogs. I admit, I got about 150 pages in and decided the book wasn't worth finishing. If something wonderful happens after that point, I apologize for any mis-impression caused by my incomplete information.

And as late as 1966. This is a 1940'-50's film,in my opinion, and outdated by the Sixties. But so many people seem to likeit. Sentimentality. Sob, sob, sob......You can have Madame X.

The movie opens with ex-salesgirl, newlywed Holly Anderson (Lana Turner) being welcome to the Anderson mansion and meeting her live-in mother-in-law. Her husband, Clay Anderson (John Forsythe), is a rich, politician-on-the-rise. They live the life of the socially prominent, always mindful of their public images. Soon, an heir is born and Holly is a perfect mother. But to be successful, Clay must, and does, travel extensively. Lonely and bored, Holly succumbs to friends' urgings and fullfills her social obligations on the arm of a single, male friend. This causes a series of tragedies, culminating in a surprise twist, and an ending that only a rock could get through without crying. In her role as Holly Anderson, Lana Turner exposes the depths of a woman's soul and the expesses the breadth of a woman's love.

Jet Li, Morgan Freedman combine a humanistic story with a violent action packed, thrill ride set in modern day London, England.Fearless is another good period movie. It is interesting to package these two movies together because this one is a mandarin language movie set hundreds of years ago discribing one man's journey to discovery and the true meaning of the martial arts. Excellent fighting scenes however this has more of a story line versus just pure action for action's sake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems Used","review":"Received cooler today 02/17/10 opened box and removed cooler, and it was covered in dirt and had no stickers on side like in photos on internet, also the handle had rust on it, the plug at the bottom of cooler leaked water bad .

I wanted to play the DVD in my Astronomy class but after going over the DVD I changed my mind for it would have been a nightmare to move between images and display the information for some of these images.

Just another poor sequel","review":"I really enjoy Stargaze and was anxious to order and watch the second installment with Stargaze II. Unfortunately, like most sequels, second parts, etc., Stargaze II falls significantly short of expanding on the photographic essay that Stargaze did; and in this respect, was a miserable disappointment.There is so much that the Hubble ST has given to us in the way of images, I find it hard to believe that there was a shortage of images that could be incorporated into this DVD. The overlay of images over a moving starfield in the first chapter should never have been allowed. It's a shame. Often times presentations like this are the inspiration and trigger for those who wonder if a life in astronomy might be their calling."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, terrible execution","review":"Have you ever looked at hubble deep space posters orfotos on their own website ?

I dropped the first one more than once, and it finally gave out. The second out wasn't dropped, but it wore out (I listen to the radio at work, walking the dog, getting ready in the morning...). I'm looking to replace my present one because although it will still get FM, for some reason it won't get AM anymore (and that's what I listen to -- go Randi and Stephanie!).But there is NO way this radio is worth the new price. It's shocking that it's suddenly 3 times the amount of my 1st and over twice the price of the one I bought last year.

Unfortunately, in the gym while on the step machine, the radio seems unable to bring in an AM station. It barely brings in a few FM stations.

That first radio was unbelievably pitiful in every way and actually cost the equivalent of much more than I paid for this one--a classic example of how the state-of-the-art is improving our quality of life. I see that most people are paying well over a hundred bucks for this radio which seems like a stretch even though it probably is the very best of it's type by a good margin.

It's truly a radio for minimalists, though, and not at all in a good way. For the comparatively steep price:-- there are virtually no features (presets and extra bass aren't enough);-- the construction is shockingly CHEAP (what I would expect from a no-name drugstore brand instead), which means it would get easily crushed in my backpack; and-- the reception is poor, poor, poor (as tested in spots all around NYC).I'm returning it to try for something better made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, could have more features for the price","review":"This is a nice little radio but reception in buildings is pretty shoddy. Outdoors, reception for both AM and FM is pretty good. For $60, you'd expect it to have some other features like voice recording to flash memory, or some limited flash MP3 storage (256mb or 512mb) but it lacks those features.This radio's optimal price would be $30, no more.

I wrote a polite e-mail to the Robert Sorby Company to explain the problem, and got nothing but rudeness and disbelief in response.

The book is enlightening to all members of the adoption triad, as well as professionals, family and friends. While not every adoptee may experience all the reactions, it is important to take note of the possibilities.The feeling of loss of control over one's life is a common issue. The question of why birth mom \\"didn't keep me\\" to how did I get these adoptive parents both deal with control, or lack of it. The natural reaction is to either feel powerless or to look elsewhere for power. Adotive parents willing to discuss and listen are one of the best supports an adoptee can have and what every adoptee deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept but way to religious!","review":"I liked Sherrie's first book much better.

I am a adoptee and have read a handful of books on adoption and liked that this dealt not only with the emotions you might encounter when searching for birth parents but the emotions you deal with just growing up adopted. Unfortunately I lost interest after the first 2 or 3 chapters. I would've found the author's voice more endearing if I were reading an online blog but as a book it just doesn't work. Too many chapters include moments like \\"here is a poem I wrote about the feelings I had on this subject\\" and it began to chaffe after a while. There is also quite a bit of a religious slant that isn't helpful to a non-christian. Overall, not a BAD book per se, just one I could easily put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A WARNING for those non-religious readers","review":"I had read Sherrie's first book and was blow away by how wonderful and informative it was. I learned so much about the adoption Triad and felt for the first time that I was not alone in my thinking, so when I found this book on Amazon I didn't think twice before downloading it to my Kindle.WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!!!! There is no warning, no hint that this book has barely anything to do with learning about the psychology of adoption or even the basics, it was all about god and giving yourself to jesus. If that's your cup of tea, fine, but there should be some sort of reference that this is a \\"spiritual\\" book and has NOTHING to do with adoption. Every page, every reference, even consistant references to Moses??? This should not be listed anywhere but spiritual reading or advice.I contacted the publisher and thankfully they stuck by their \\"satisfaction guarantee\\" and I was refunded my money.

It explores the dynamics of chemo without getting technical. Also show the need for a support group of some sort, not just fair weathered friends. Pretty good flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancer is a Comedy?","review":"A comedy? No. I turned this movie off after an hour. It has few laughs but seriously, who wants to watch the misery of someone young who has cancer and is probably going to die? It's a downer. The few funny moments don't change that. I'm sure that most of the glowing reviews on this page are written by studio-paid shills.Some of the writing is good, but the pervasive profanity is not real and is annoying. It doesn't add anything and one has to question why it's in there. The Seth Rogen character cares but is such a self-centered loudmouth (a foul one at that) that he negates his contribution to his friend and this movie.Joseph Gordon-Levitt is excellent and he made this into a movie instead of what otherwise would have been a series of predictable scenes.Overall, no more than two stars.

What can I say? This movie was absolutely phenomenal. Many of us have forgotten how bad life is for some, and this movie allows us to get humor despite the uncensored reality check it provides. Seth Rogan and Joseph Gordon Levitt (who is quickly becoming my favorite actor) are an unbeatable team, and they make us laugh even when we think that nothing in the movie can ever be funny. Warning: If you're like me and are easily affected by movies like this, grab a box of tissues. I cried a couple of times. I would recommend this movie to anyone. It really touched a part of my heart in a way that you rarely encounter these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a movie about cancer...","review":"...ok yes it is, but not to a degree that overpowers the entire experience. It certainly was not depressing by any means.I watched this movie on DVD with my wife. We both enjoyed this film despite having very different expectations going into the movie - mine high as I am a Joseph Gordon-Levitt fan and can tolerate Seth Rogen, my wife's low as she really did not want to watch a movie about cancer that will make her sad. Interesting, I won her over by mentioning Seth Rogen was in this film. We were both surprised with how well they handled the balance of cancer and comedy. Done wrong, this movie could have been a tragic failure. But, we felt they maintained an honest portrayal of the human aspect of cancer while still providing just enough sub plots, comedy, and character development to keep the viewers engaged without feeling overproduced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, but not a comedy!","review":"Good movie.

Well, I was expecting Denis Leary's No Cure For Cancer type of laughs since the topic was cancer. There are virtually no laughs in it. It's pretty depressing for much of this movie. The acting is fine and for once two of the supporting actors who usually drive me nuts (Seth Rogan and Dallas Bruce Harper) are tolerable. The problem is the pacing of the story is ponderously slow.Don't believe the hype such as \\"consistently, uproariously funny\\" on the DVD jacket. This is a B movie at best done by A list actors.There are tons of special features with it but I found myself fast-forwarding parts of the actual movie so, sorry, I just can't sit through all the extras to give anyone out there a better review of the whole DVD package."},{"rating":"1","title":"DEPRESSING!!! Cancer fun!","review":"This movie is about getting cancer and all the fun that goes with that. For some reason I thought this movie was a going to be a comedy before I went and saw it.

Gordon Levitt? He's hot, smart, talented, and has great taste in rolls.

Yes I laighed and cried at many times. I highly recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkably artful balance of comedy and drama","review":"This is one of the best movies I've seen recently. It was advertised as a comedy, which is accurate enough, but what the advertisement left out is that this is also a genuinely touching, heartfelt movie. Joseph Gordon-Levitt is outstanding in the lead role. He displays remarkable vulnerability and depth. Seth Rogan shows a range I wasn't aware he was capable of while also absolutely owning the better comic moments of the film. Anjelica Houston is also outstanding, and her relationship with her son (Gordon-Levitt) is absolutely heart wrenching, warm, imperfect and, in a word, human. The direction was well done, and the script clearly exceptional. It's extremely rare to find a movie that is both laugh out loud funny at times while also being capable of drawing a powerful emotional reaction out of even a jaded cynic such as myself. I highly recommend this movie to pretty much anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the 2011 Best Picture in my book....","review":"I have never laughed and cried in such close proximity. 50/50 will leave you with a profound understanding of the humor life possesses even when the odds are against you. Seth Rogen brought to this film the type of realistic comedy that I would wish for from my friends in such a situation. While crude, it is also heartfelt and honest. Joseph Gordon-Levitt simply nailed it! Bravo, sir!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than I Expected!","review":"Admitedly, I wasn't quite sure what to expect going into this movie...I figured there would be a little heart to it, but with Seth Rogen in it I figured it would probably be fairly crass...and it sorta was to a certain extent, but not overly so. In the end what my wife & I discovered is that it also head a lot of heartwarming humor in it, a lot of it was very touching and made you think about life & it's value, and there was some quality and convincing acting in it...even on Seth Rogen's part, though he does have his silly goofy moments like any movie he's in, but everyone was great in this movie! If you like comedy but also good drama...or a good comedrama as it were...then I highly recommend giving this movie a watch. No, scratch that...just go out & buy it when it releases! It would be a definite worth while purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"50/50........I'm tough on comedy/dramas","review":"It's been awhile since Ive had a real intelligent laugh at a dramady however this movie provided some genuine funny moments and some fairly serious drama so 4 stars frm me for this is saying a lot, this was a highly intertaining movie with good performances from the whole cast.

Yes, the movie is about a topic that is close to everyone's heart, but it's able to balance the seriousness of cancer with humor quite nicely.

When I switched to AAA batteries, those would last a day or two, then the mouse, despite having full power from AAAs, would not connect to my bluetooth connection.I am extremely disappointed in the way this mouse worked and I will never, ever buy another MacAlly product.I say avoid this product like the plague and purchase a Logitech or Microsoft Bluetooth Mouse.

Actually I thought this set was going to be like the videos of 10 years ago with basic self defense and all but it was so much more. The only bad thing I will say about this set is that he shows you a few moves that everyone already knows like standing headlock escape but still 90% of the stuff on here i didnt know and hadnt seen anywhere else.

No lightning bolts shooting from fingertips here, no fireballs or flashy stuff. In fact, one of the things I like best about this book is that it completely avoids all the cliches of most fantasy. I really like the bronze-age setting, and Bailey's research really shows. But most of all, I like the intensity of the building relationship between Innowen and Razkili.

I, like most people, had never heard of this film. Luckily, I came across it on a top 50 list of the best dystopian movies. The film has to walk a fine line between showing stupidity and yet not becoming too stupid itself. Whether or not it succeeds comes down to personal taste and the attitude with which it is viewed. The tone of this movie is cartoonish, and it's filled with over the top sexual and bathroom humor. This will turn many people off, but, unfortunately this is a necessary evil, because you can't lampoon these things without first displaying them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sticks with you","review":"When I watched this movie, I found it amusing. There were bits that made me laugh out loud, but I also felt at the time that it should have been funnier. I watched it again because my boyfriend wanted to see it, and noticed things I had not before. But now a few months later, things from the movie keep coming back to me and I realize they are absolutely hilarious. I am going to buy the movie because it truly is one that requires a number of watchings, and each time something new hits you. I also find myself thinking of the movie(in a funny, but frightening way) when I see something in the media or advertizing that almost seems to come from the movie, and not in a satirical way! Seriously, there are drink ads on TV that could easily be Brawndo (it has electrolytes!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"No laughs","review":"This movie may be amusing to the idiots it scornfully satirizes, but to most people, it is a giant bore. The social commentary is too heavyhanded and tedious. The action is silly and low-budget. Why does every black woman actress have to be cast as a ho?

It was a movie I knew nothing about, but on a whim I rented it several years ago and found it to be terrific. I bought a copy to own shortly after seeing it the first time.Hoping to recapture that terrific experience, I bought IDIOCRACY, knowing absolutely nothing about it -- other than it was like OFFICE SPACE, in that it didn't seem to get wide theatrical release (if any).Having now seen it, I can understand why it didn't get national distribution. It may have been a clever idea on the drawing board, and it does have it's share of satiric zingers, but overall it's just plain silly.

I liked the concept and there wasn't anything wrong with the acting, but this kind of silly corporate future has been done much better in movies like (albeit with much different plots) The 5th Element and The Running Man.It's very light entertainment best suited for a lazy Saturday night with popcorn in the living room.

This sophomoric effort plays like it was made by some high school film students, complete with the safety net of too many lame sex jokes. This is one of those movies that is destined to go from DVD to repeated Comedy Central showings in about a month. I recommend you wait for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting concept","review":"This movie is a litehearted fantasy depicting the ultimate result of the dumbing down of the human race. While the concept is fun, a more realistic prognostication would depict a small upper class of intellectual puppet masters directing a populace of stupid followers. Because I believe the subject is a real problem I had hoped for a more realistic presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid is as stupid does","review":"The premise seemed to implausable to be as it was described in the promotional information, so I was expecting some kind of ironic humor. Unfortunately, there was very little of either. This would have made a great \\"magoo\\" style cartoon (yeah, I'm old). It is good that some people actually found something to enjoy in this film.

The morons that Luke Wilson has to deal with in this movie gave me such a headache. It's scary to realize that this is not really fiction, regarding the state of our society and it's younger generation.I think I'll read a book right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"highly recommended!","review":"I recommend Idiocracy to everyone. Luke Wilson is very funny, the movie is insightful and made me laugh so hard I had tears running down my face several times.Keep an eye out for a cameo by the guy from the Mac commercials as Dr. Lexus. I found his performance Oscar-worthy, especially considering what Oscars have been handed out for in the last few years...besides, he's cute.In short, Idiocracy is a fatally funny glimpse into a possible future where people are named after product brand names (the president's middle name is Mountain Dew), hospital visits cost $5 billion dollars, there are mountains of garbage because no one is smart enough to figure out what to do with it all, and nobody cares about anything but money. All because only stupid people are breeding. Sounds familiar to me, somehow.Seriously, watch this movie. On a scale of 1 to 10, I give it a brilliant! Now pass the twinkies, scrote..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Hysterical with a side of Poignant and a big gulp of Brawndo","review":"Mike Judge really deserves heaping praise for this gem. In what is sure to be a timeless classic just like Office Space, he hits a home run square out of the park.It is amazing to me that such an instant classic could be dismissed so hard by the studio execs. I never heard of this movie, never saw any advertisements, trailers, etc. The first I heard of it was on Digg two days ago. I went out and bought it the very next day, sight unseen, simply because Mike Judge deserves our support for making such sidesplittingly meaningful and relevant comedies such as this.I can only hope that his next movie venture receives just a little more respect than Fox showed with this. You know, if they weren't as small minded as the people from the future depicted in this movie, the Fox execs could have made quite a bit of money with this one.If there was an Academy Award for Best Comedy, this would be it. Buy it today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hidden treasure","review":"This.Is.Genius.Isn't it strange that a movie studio would want to bury a movie that tells America that it'll get dumber if they don't do something about it? Hmmm...The fact is, this movie is smart enough to know that it can get the message across by only using the type of humour that appeals to everyone (everyone loves a kick in the nuts, whether they will admnit it or not.) Watch it, and think. And then read a book, watch some documentaries, engage in serious discussion. And then fart like a trooper, and laugh like a drain. You'll live longer.:P"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for repeated viewings","review":"This is one of my favorite movies ever. I think the future that's described in it is already substantially here. I have seen it at least 10 times, and every time I notice new things in the background. Plus, it's great for quotable lines. It's obvious why the movie was suppressed - it offends too many big businesses."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Futuristic Spoof!","review":"This tale reminded me somewhat of Woody Allen's Sleeper. Luke Owen is put into suspended animation and wakes up 500 years later to find that man has evolved to complete idiocy, leaving him the world's smartest man. Though the movie is mostly silly, it still works, mainly because of Luke's excellent \\"straight man\\" job as someone who is stubborn to not accept what is but tries to change things to what he knows (water makes plants grow, not Gatorade). Some of the parts are incredibly funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning: Don't eat while watching","review":"I love Mike Judge's Office Space, which I also own, so ordered Idiocracy, sight unseen. My kids had just arrived for a visit the day it arrived, so I put it on. I made the mistake of trying to eat while watching..not recommended as I nearly choked. Luke Wilson makes a great \\"normal guy\\" foil and I'm a fan of Maya Rudolph from SNL. I kept belly-laughing for a week afterward. Like Beavis and Butthead, it's more a Juvenalian (way harsh) than Horatian (witty and kindly) satireOh, yeah; if you have younger children around you might want to wait until they're in bed before you watch it..unless, of course, you also let them watch South Park"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of my Top Ten Worst","review":"One of the worst movies of all time.

I saw the trailer and the trailer was good but the trailer contained the best parts of the movie, the rest of the movie was not that great at all. I thought the movie was going to have some good meaning to it to get us all to evaluate our society and make it better but it failed at that. There are a few funny parts but definately not worth buying. I suggest that you rent this movie if you must see it.

I suppose the concept has some potential, but the execution is horrible.The plot is flimsy and drawn out and just seems to go on and on. It has many logical flaws that at a certain point become just too insulting to your intelligence to continue watching. For example, people in the future are portrayed as incredibly dumb, but they somehow manage to have televisions, cars and motorcycles, hospitals, Walmarts, a court system and a government.The humor is also very juvenile, with minimal cultural relevance. If you want to be entertained and come away not feeling like you just wasted two hours of your time, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfect Title","review":"I couldn't believe how awful this film was.

This movie will horrify you and do nothing but take precious time away from worthwhile endeavors. If I were Luke Wilson I'd be embarrassed to have my name on the cover of the DVD.

I ran across it accidentally, and now I'm on a mission to get friends to watch it. It's a super cheesy movie, but it stimulates great discussions on serious matters. I wish this had a pg-13 version so that I could show it to my students. I think it makes a lot of great points about how evolution works, (especially how it's not always about survival of the fittest- it's really about who's the most successful at passing on their DNA) and the dangers of a society that places entertainment above all other goals. It is way too vulgar to show in class, but it led to a great conversation with my teenage son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mocks American Pop Culture Well","review":"But I can't give it a perfect score, as no historic trend ever effects the world so evenly.

A scary, horrible genius with an insight that only Orwell would have appreciated.

This movie actually gives you a glimpse into the future, and it's coming sooner than you think! It takes place in the year 2505, but sadly, a quick look around what's happening in the world today will validate the notion that it's coming sooner than you think. Plus, it's funny.

With the McShame/Palin sideshow, we have already come to a scary place that allows us to look into a window with an even scarier future.This movie is hilarious and on target.

Mike Judge in top form. Absolutely hilarious - still laughing from seeing it last night. Might outdo Judge's 'Office Space' for #1 social commentary comedy classic. Maybe Judge needs to think about forming a separate distribution network with other big name independent-spirited film makers(Mel Gibson?), because Hollywood ain't doin it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dry irreverent humor ...

I won't tell you about them because that's part of the magic of watching a new movie.It was worth watching 1.5x. The half for catching small details missed the first time. The special features were funny. They were just deleted scenes that didn't add to the movie.

I loved Beavis and Butthead and Office Space was one of the greatest comedies in recent history. With that being said I thought Idiocracy would be hilarious. I was wrong!!! Yeah I laughed and chuckled, but I felt dumber after watching it. If movies like this continue to be made the world my just end up just like the world in Idiocracy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiocracy","review":"It was a great concept borrowed from Woody Allen's Sleeper ( 1973) but not well executed. The Director expected the viewing audience to be as stupid as the general theme of the movie. It made no sense to use a hooker as the female protagonist. The updated concept is promising, but the execution was just terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"this was awful","review":"if I could give it negative stars I would. The movie was not funny, I finally just turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad...","review":"I bought this movie not really knowing too much about it, trusting everyone that kept telling me how hilarious it was and that I needed to see it. Wow, this was shockingly bad. Like many have said, the basic premise is a great idea for a film and could have been hilarious, but after the first 15 minutes or so, it goes absolutely no where. Nothing but potty humor (fart jokes? seriously?), and dull acting. Avoid this one like the plague..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and dumbest","review":"Aside from a couple of genuinely funny scenes this movie misfires throughout, and even the likeable Luke Wilson is unable to save it from the garbage heap. Maybe I just misplaced my inner juvenile but for me the satire is so lacking in subtlety that it's like being hit over the head with a jumbo bucket of fried chicken. I understand what Judge is trying to say about dumbing down, and for that he deserves credit, but this movie itself is so dumbed-down that it's self-parodic. Thinking about it, it's almost certain to become a cult hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"The concept was interesting, but this movie could have been done in a five minute Saturday Night Live skit. Yes, it's meant to be absurd and the movie succeeds in that matter. But how many stupid, grunting, swearing idiots do they have to throw at us to make their point? It's like listening to Beavis and Butthead for an hour and a half. By then end I was glassy-eyed and drooling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, Horrible movie","review":"I don't usually write reviews but when I saw this film as being one of the most downloaded unbox purchases I couldn't help myself. Someone told me that this was the next 'Office Space' -- if you're talking cultish following, maybe, but not nearly as good.In fact I would venture to say that this is probably one of the worst movie's i've ever seen. The premise is cool and and it's a good idea for a movie, but man, the execution is just not there.Highly UNrecommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Paris Hilton could have written a better script......","review":"Avoid this like the plague, yes the \\"concept\\" of the movie is great but the acting was on par with the \\"Ernest goes to...\\" movies.I also have to say I LOVED Office Space....this movie doesn't even come close. It's not worth renting or watching, RUN!

He used to write, right? He drank his own coolaid on this one. Really, couldn't stand it. Couldn't even get twenty minutes into it. Awful. Lame. Pathetic. Some of the cartoon effects are mildly amusing. I want my stinkin 2.99 back. Really."},{"rating":"1","title":"A for effort, E for execution","review":"Not a single laugh in this whole movie. Brilliant premise but it falls so flat on so many levels. Acting is basically worse than B movie bad. The script is lame. I had high hopes for this after reading that it was some hidden gem that got overlooked when it came out. You can see why after watching it. Do not believe the hype. This is not a bust-a-gut sarcastic parody."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair And Balanced in 2505","review":"No wonder Fox lost interest in this film. The satire is the logical extension of the \\"fair and balanced\\" con job that FOX has been perpetrating the last few years. IDIOCRACY is the ultimate Red State, with corporate will the law of the land and stupidity bred into the population. it's Rush Limbaugh's wet dream. One of my students gave me this film because I am always lamenting the decline of the culture with nothing but \\"reality shows,\\" Dr. Phil, and cage fighting on free TV. We teach children to play poker and sell 6th graders thong underwear while we wonder why the population is becoming obese. IDIOCRACY is the the hilariously logical progression of our collective decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Liked Office Space and Beavis & Butthead","review":"as well as King of the Hill, you will love Idiocracy.

Great visual humor and it's kind of scary because it could happen. The first time I saw it, I laughed non-stop, it gets funnier every time I watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lead, follow, or get out of the way","review":"Idiocracy is a satirical look at the future of American culture and politics. What makes this funny is that it is grounded in contemporary reality, just pushed to an (even more) absurd level.In the Army, Joe Bowers was told to \\"lead, follow, or get out of the way.\\" He spent his military career pursuing the third option, doing as little as possible. He was tapped for a top-secret hibernation experiment in which he was supposed to be awoken in one year. Instead, the base is closed and he is forgotten. Five hundred years later when Joe wakes up, he is forced to lead.

At the time of reading Kortge's book I was recovering from a form of chronic fatigue syndrome and looking for an exercise that did not compromise my recovery. This was it! In the past I had turned my nose up at walking; I was after all a runner! But this book changed my ways. Each morning before I exercised I read a chapter and was able to apply all that I had learned on my walk. It is one of those books that I didn't want to end. Spending a 1/2 hour with Kortge in the morning was a great way to start my day. (By the way I am now back to running and the principles still apply.)What makes the book special is there is a fine mix of theory, stories, practice and it is written with an energy that is encouraging, motivational and spiritual. I highly recommend this book to the novice walker and seasoned exerciser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Finished Reading but happy with it","review":"This is a very well written book and I'm always interested in this subject especially how exercise plays out in the big picture with my health. I sort of stopped reading it in the middle but that's just me and I'll get back to it soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Plain Fun","review":"The only time I had ever seen Status Quo (or even heard them for that matter) was on the telecast of Live Aid in 1985. Their rousing performance was, in my opinion, one of, if not the highlight of the day. I decided if I ever came across a live Status Quo album, I'd grab it. Fifteen years later, I bought this based solely on the memory of their Live Aid performance. I wasn't disappointed!! They display the same energy & pure rock'n'roll spirit, mixing in a touch of up-tempo blues as well as Irish and/or Scottish instrumental pieces. The only negative is the totally out of place \\"Living on an Island\\", which interrupts the flow of the show. Fortunately, they keep it brief. Otherwise, the performance gallops along at a steady pace. Selections that may be familiar include the Doors' \\"Roadhouse Blues\\", John Fogerty's \\"Rockin' All Over the World\\", & \\"The Wanderer\\". I came very close to giving this one 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Punk as it was meant to be. Short,fast and furious.","review":"What more can you say when you preface a review with that title. Murder City Devils are pure old-school punk at its best, which is to say, three minute or less in-your-face, snotty, drunken, chaos fueled anthems.\\"In Name and Blood\\" is the latest release from the Seattle based six piece and the quality hasn't faltered a bit on any of them. The ever present rebel-rock attitude is still strong with them and in that respect is reminiscent of 50's rock and roll on a certain level while Leslie Hardy's work on Farfisa adds kind of a New Wave feel. All of this is wrapped up in Spencer's frantic rantings at the helm.The instrumentation is tight (as well as punk can be) on all three CD's by the Devils so one would be hard pressed to choose a favorite. My advice: don't try, just get them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired Seattle indie crap. <Yawn>","review":"Singer: whiny, out of key, shallow lyrics with uncreative vocal melodies.Rest of band: crappy equipment, bad tones, unimaginitive arrangements, poor mixing and engineering job, thoughtless.(why did they think the keyboards were a good idea?)For some reason the Seattle music scene thinks that making music as bad as possible is somehow an art statement. Let me tell you, this just sucks. Two years from now you will find this album in the $1 bin at your local used record store.

Jerry Norton has captured the world of youth football in his book. His stories of kids caught in the act of playing the greatest team sport ever, will warm your heart. As a football coach I was impressed with his grasp of the fundementals of football. As a parent and Youth League Executive I was impressed with his compassion for kids and the way they see the world. Jerry gets down on one knee and looks youth football in the eye,and the sport will be better for it. Anyone, in any youth sport should read and remember \\"Mom, can I play Football.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't enter youth sports without it!","review":"As a sports marketing professional and sports mom, I think this book should be required reading for all coaches and sports parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor book!!!","review":"The author makes a few valid points about coaches who want to win at all costs, but, his logic is flawed. Boys are naturally competitive and want to win. This book personifies exactly what is wrong with politically correct youth sports today. When the score is kept the object is to win. Certainly, not at all costs, but to win nevertheless. He left out the most important element of football and that is teaching life lessons, which if taught properly will stay with them forever. Life lessons such as never quiting, mental toughness, desire, teamwork, guts and pride. Its my experience that when these things are tought properly in a positive, fun environment kids will have fun and win. Norton thinks all kids should play equally. What does that teach the better kids, if you stink and give no effort you play the same as me, so why should I try harder. And to put the kids in who don't deserve the playing time it cheapens the reward. This book is way to MAMBY PAMBY. Dont waste the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"They're Pretty Good","review":"I purchased these ball head screwdrivers because I needed the smallest ones to work on R/C helicopters.

When I finished reading half way through, I just put it aside, and a few days later, read the last chapter and tossed it. I liked the heroine at the beginning, but I thought her innocence (personality wise) was written too \\"corny\\" and got tired of reading. Like Nigel was shallow, coward and irritating to extreme, heroine was nice and innocent to extreme, which resulted in making her sound too \\"coquettish\\" to me. Annoyingly coquettish Raina, Oh-so-extremely-manly Gunnar, way too foolish Nigel... I mean, it's like watching a cheap action movie, you know exactly how it ends, and you can just fast forward to make sure that your guess is right.Recently read Johanna Lindsey's viking family trilogy - The best read ever.I am glad this piece was only $0.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written!","review":"I don't usually like the Medieval time period, so when I began reading this book, I have to admit, I did so reluctantly - even grudgingly.

The wheels seem to be of decent quality. I was able to cut two 8X10 mirrors from a large panel with one wheel. The problem and the reason I gave this product a poor rating is because the mandrel stripped completely just as I finished cutting the second mirror. This was not operator error as I know the mandrel was tight before beginning to cut. As I said above though, the wheels are good quality, the mandrel, not so much.

The President had given the OSI investigative team consisting of the familiar characters Simon, Martin and Amanda, a very short one day time limit to confirm that the the apparently accidental death of the recently appointed Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was indeed an accident. Thus, the story develops at break neck speed. The deceased was the son of a powerful senator and had a very serious skeleton in his closet from his days as a combat pilot in Vietnam.

If you grew up in the USA, you probably missed out on this boogie explosion machine - but man, did they rock in concert. Fortunately for you, there is the 'Live' album which captured Status Quo in their full glory at the peak of their 'live' carreer. The first four songs just bring the house down before they slow it down a bit during 'Most of the Time'. But then they dish out their more than 10 minute gem '4500 times' which is even better than the version on 'Hello' (forget the poor re-take they put on their 'Rock 'til you Drop' CD in the nineties). And then it's full force head down rock'n'roll until the last note on 'Roadhouse Blues'. There are a couple of other live CDs from Status Quo ('Live at the NEC' or 'Live Alive Quo') but they don't even come close to this night at the Apollo in Glasgow. A true time capsule and a must buy for all you rockers out there !"},{"rating":"2","title":"quo live in Glasgow 1976","review":"My favorite cd:STATUS QUO AT THERE VERY BESTmaybe because i was at the apollo in glasgow when this was recorded and remember the balcony moving to the beat [not just the fans but the balcony]most of the songs on this double album are still played at their gigs today.great party album put this on and everyone will be on their feet.one you just cant stay still to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Saturday morning memories!","review":"I saw this DVD set advertised and just had to have.

I think it's asking a bit much to expect the older tunes to sound like the original LP versions. On some of the songs, Fagan sounds like he's rushing the vocals (Bhoditsatva come to mind). On the slower songs he has more time to do the lyrics justice. Contrary to what some others have written, Becker is a decent singer, I know of lot of 'better' singers who can't match his pitch, timing and expression. One might not like the sound of his voice, but he does a fine job with it.My issues with the record are that it often lacks a live feel. There's not enough crowd noise, the mix is two-dimensional (too much compression) and the band is just too perfect. It all sounds a bit mechanical when it should be more spontaneous. I don't mind the different arrangements, they add interest. Having said that, I'd kill to have either of the drummers in my own band, not to mention the backup singers, bassist, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great live collection for the Dan fan!","review":"I recently heard this CD mixed in with other non Steely Dan tunes at, of all places, a chinese restaurant.

With a new studio album on the way, \\"Alive In America\\" can qualify as an introduction to anyone who has never had the pleasure to easily digest the special mix of rock, jazz and soul with abstract lyrics. Donald Fagen's(Not Tom Scott) vocals are rougher and stronger than ever and even Walter Becker provides the best moments of guitar work especially with \\"Josie.\\" Becker's \\"Book of Liars\\" is a smooth step in the spotlight for the usually silent half of this legendary duo. The production and the quality of the music is near perfect and smooth as glass. I'm even surprised that it hasn't even gone gold yet. This ain't country or hip hop you're hearing. This is Steely Dan. Get used to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE ALIVE IN AMERICA!","review":"I don't know what these other reviewers were missing! I saw SD live in 93, loved them, and was so glad to find this live album later. Unlike a lot of bands making comebacks, they have not only not stagnated, but have kept growing musically, playing their old hits with new and exciting and dynamic rearrangements. Much more jazzy, much more dynamic. The new live version of \\"Bodhisattva\\" is to die for! The drummer and guitarist pump the band for all they're worth. All the performances are sterling!

The good news is: they can still RIP in concert -- as the current PBS broadcast of a live show reveals. They sure as hell haven't lost it... but \\"it\\" was clearly on hiatus during the performances on this disc.There's so little power in the performance that you almost have to wonder if this release had more to do with financial need or contract obligations than showing off their brilliance.

It was nice to finally hear their songs \\"air out\\" live in concert.My only problem with this record is that there are too many \\"deep cuts.\\" Indeed,I would have been OK with all the selections on this album if they would have added more familiar Steely Dan songs to make it a double or triple disc.

True, as a singer, he's an excellent... oh, wait, his guitar solos aren't too good either. Every time one of his solos come up, I just want to turn the volume down or \\"fast forward\\". But he'll always be there, because he can't get fired! What a great job to have. And no one will tell him, because I'm sure he's surrounded by sycophants.

Replace the guitar magic of Zakk Wylde form the soundtrack with a 12 year old kid playing an old Gorilla amplifier and you've got the Wait mix.

It provides a variety of different exercises that are consistently given throughout the book, including English-to-Latin, Latin-to-English, English vocabulary exercises (from Latin roots), declensions and conjugations, and Latin grammar reviews. The work might be rendered useless if one makes careful use of the review exercises now available at the back of the textbook itself, which are sort of a mini-workbook. This would save the need to carry around two sizable texts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very useful","review":"Bought this workbook along with the 6th edition revised textbook. I don't see this workbook adding more value. Exercises are not very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caveat emptor!","review":"While Comeau, LaFleur, and HarperCollins emphasize the usefulness of Wheelock's Latin for those learning the language independently, this Workbook does not make it easy for the independent learner. Although the book states that the answer key is available for free not only to educators but to those who verify independent study status, HarperCollins has continually refused my requests, as an independent student of Latin, for the answer key. Therefore, I am left with a book that seems to contain excellent excercises in Latin, but with no way of checking my work.

Like that reviewer, the workbook is useless to me without correct answers, as I don't want to practise unknown errors. I have gotten to chapter 5 of the excellent Wheelock textbook, using a key found on the internet which is for a previous edition but usable. However, I will probably return the workbook which is valuless if the exercises can't be corrected. I would surely advise other aspiring independent students to find any \\"teach-yourself\\" Latin book for extra practise, despite Wheeelock's brilliant textbook.

When I saw the Barbara Metzger and Edith Layton were included in this issue, I figured I was in for a treat. But I was diappointed. All 5 stories were just boring, no real standouts. Edith Layton's \\"Two Dancing Daughters\\" was the best of the 5 with the lame soldier Henry being hired to basically babysit 2 sisters who had unearthly beauty and beau's. \\"The Enchanted Earl\\" by Barbara Metzger had the typical lyrical writing of Ms. Metzger but the story also fell flat.

The author sets out to describe some of the early experiments that led to modern day genetic concepts. Unfortunately, we are not taken from the \\"characters\\" and \\"elements\\" of Mendel to the molecular nucleotide sequence within the genome as smoothly as one might expect. Eventhough we are told that the text will clarify, the author does little to clearly define the terms used in the book such as trait, factor, gene, allele, non-alleles, sets of factors, sets of alleles, etc. Many of these terms are overloaded and used interchangeably throughout, leaving the reader to determine the meaning on his own from within context. For the uninitiated, this terse book would be extremely confusing.

I also found the markings on the side of the blender to be useful, they tell you how much ice to liquid you should add.Then it broke.

Second, the film score was not at all ominous enough to invoke any type of fearful anticipation (Except for the end of the movie!)

It was my favorite bedtime story. I was surprised to find it still in print all these years later, but I guess I ought not to be. The stories are funny and timeless. A joy to kids and the parent reading will enjoy them too. And they always end with a cute line such as \\"If the rubber hose doesn't tie itself in a knot and rub molasses all over the postman's umbrella, I'll tell you the (next story.)\\" Since the copyrights have expired the price so low no parent ought to be without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"I purchased this book to go along with the game I gave my 7 yr old granddaughter.

The story switchs from being a happy-go-lucky tale of a girl lost in another world, and becames an epic of: love, betrayal, and revenge. Miaka and Yui take on entirely different dimensions, as their friendship is destroyed and replaced with hatred. The only thing that anyone whom watches this tape can do, is rush after the next tape to find out what's going to happen.Though there is a drastic turn in plot, the show still maintains that same quality in visual anime divinity and the music quality that is next to none. However, the mood takes on a level that is all of it's own.This series definately gets two thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Hilarious book, couldn't put it down.

The film is now available in a two disc collector's edition. THis movie is part Interview with a Vampire, An American Werewolf in London and a whole lot of HLA. It has the usual bad humor, off-the-wall-acting and the overall weirdness that you'll find in you typical Seduction Cinema production. An eastern european she-wolf bites Misty and curses her with lycanthropy. The werewolf decides to give a reporter the interview-of-a-lifetime.

''Special'' effects are awful and very cheap. Even in ''making out'' scenes they were cheating. A few times you could see they were making out with an air, not a partner. Only empty moves and moans, if you know what I mean. I can't write it in other words, because amazon don't let me post it. Like a last review. I have to change words on another ones, because they don't allow to use them in reviews. Werewolf scenes are repeating constantly. Yes, I mean it. They use the same scenes over ten times.

It is both a guide and is essential for the Flight Attendant interview. It is written clearly, is easy and fun to read, and is an inspiration for us that want to get into this career.

I have tried interviewing for a flight attendant position with various airlines off and on over a period of several years. I was never able to get past the first part of the group interviews. I was doing a lot of things right, but Kiki's book mentioned several things to do/not do which were different for what I had been doing.

Kiki was really nice, and answers your emails. I was bummed after my first interview, but Kiki reminded me that she didn't get hired on her first try. Every tid bit and advice from questions,preperation, what to expect at training and on the job was very helpful. Don't waste your $$ on other books or \\"we can train you to be a flight attendant\\" schools or websites. You can only be trained by the airline you will be working for!!

I 100% love this book and think you will too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for the beginning hunter or hunter educator.","review":"Posewitz has set down a reasoned approach to ethics and points the way for us all, novice or veteran hunter. This is a very short book, and can be read by the novice in a short time. Rather than give us long lists of rules, Posewitz has chosen to let our conscience guide us by explaining the basics. Well written, with several stories that illustrate differing attitudes. If we are to preserve wildlife, it will be the hunter who pays - as it has been for 100 years. This book deals with issues of respect, reverence and use of game animals. More importantly, it does so in the right tone, not preachy, just informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is.","review":"I used Beyond Fair Chase as a part of a hunter safety course I taught in Montana for several years. The content is an overview of the evolution of the hunter, and explains the phases of maturation a hunter goes through. It also teaches the young hunter to respect the wildlife and nature that s/he enjoys. It's a good book to begin the development of the philosophical/ethical side of the hunter. I believe it played an important role, alongside the teaching of firearm safety, survival skills, game identification, hunting laws, and respect for property owners and the law."},{"rating":"1","title":"WELL MEANING, BUT CONFUSED","review":"Posewitz, though well meaning, sets back our understanding of ethical hunting by confusing \\"difficulty of taking\\" an animal with ethics. He further does not seem to know that \\"fair chase\\" is a term created by the Boone & Crockett Club to describe their tournament rules for entering animals into their record books, much like golfing's rule that mechanized golf carts cannot be used by contestants. In spite of this, no one seriously suggests that it is unethical for recreational golfers to use golf carts, however. Ethical hunting is hunting that is: (1) Safe, (2) Conserves game populations for future generations, and (3) Respects the choices and rights of other hunters within the same boundaries. Whether I hunt with my bare hands, walking miles to get to the game, or select some easier way has nothing to do with ethics. Posewitz is entitled to hunt as he wishes, but he should not try to impose his views on others."},{"rating":"1","title":"heavy, cheap materials, did dry hair fast","review":"This hair drier worked wonderfully for the first few weeks. Then it started falling apart. The cord began working loose from the plug and the non-standard screws made that impossible to fix (not that you're legally allowed to do that). It is a heavy unit and its long cord was even heavier so it would drag itself off the counter with stunning regularity, threatening safety of toes and eventually breaking the rear filter cap. Within a few months it also developed an incessant and annoying whine (perhaps also from the falls). It does dry hair fast and shiny, if you can keep it from suicide jumping from the counter. Too expensive for shoddy workmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't we give 0 stars!!!","review":"Bought if for my husband, but didn't give it to him in the end. Sent it back for a refund.

It is honest and heart-felt. Told from many perspectives, the story surprisingly does not focus on the lives of Aerosmith but on what rotates and manipulates their lives. This can be quite difficult for non-hard core fans to get on with in the beginning but later it becomes intense, will be hard to put down. The last part is rather disappointing as it seems to be used for the promotion of the new album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the more amazing stories that I've ever read!!","review":"I found the history of the band to be absolutely fascinating. I've listened to zillions of live boots over the years and NO ONE rocks harder than Aerosmith.I was expecting to be amazed by the music/drugs part of the story (and I was!). However, I didn't anticipate being moved to tears by parts of the book, like when Liv realizes that Steven is her father.By the end of the book I really felt that these guys live in a state of grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"COULDN'T PUT IT DOWN UNTIL I'D FINISHED IT","review":"Having been into AEROSMITH since 1977 I did not expect any surprises. BOY WAS I WRONG, I mean, did you know that Joe and Toms JAM BAND had a live album pressed up(albeit a very limited pressing).

I was able to make such a vivid picture in my mind in such a way I could almost live vicariously through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is all rock & roll - no sex and drugs. The majority of the book takes place before 1980 so it has little meaning for those of us born after 1980. Many people compare this book to Nikki Sixx book. There is no comparison- Aerosmiths biography feels like a kids cartoon against The Heroin Diaries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Distasteful & Ill-Advised:Walk The Other Way","review":"Many hardcore Aerosmith fans concur that the group should not have put out this distasteful act of self-exploitation. You can't go to the well again and again asking followers to buy all your stories of really bad behavior and then tell them, \\"Hey, don't do it yourself!\\" Because then the real message becomes: we got away with truly terrible things and serious mistreatment of other people-and you can too. Real rock and roll is showing you're not afraid to care, instead of confirming to the world you don't care about anybody but yourselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Initial review","review":"I went through couple of pages of this book and form these couple of pages i can say that this book worth reading for all the true aficinados of aerosmith.

If you didn't understand the \\"toxic twins\\" tag then, you'll understand it now. A pull-no-punches chronical of how drugs influence music in a positive way sometimes (ala Toys In The Attic and Rocks) to how success leads to better drugs, and ultimately how that combination leads to failure.

I have been a huge fan for years, and I thought the life of a rock star would be perfect. Boy did this book change my mind!

It told the real life behide drugs and fame. They get so caught up in drugs they forgit about the music their first passion. And it has no holds they told it how it is and the way they were so open really made the book good. You would never think the things this band went through just to be at the top. After you read this book you won't believe how they lived trough it. And if you are a drug user you should read it and see what the band was put through and you'll change your mind about drugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"QUALITY!!","review":"I read this book when i was going through my 'mad about Aerosmith' stage. I still love their music. This book is a great read if you are interested in how they got where they are, what they got up to and the real things that rock stars get up to. If you just like them for their music, i cant see how it would interest you. I queued for 6 hours to meet the in London and woke at 4am to queue for 7hours before their concert in Wembley stadium, hence why i was interested in the book and found it very informing. But if its just quality music you are interested in, and not where its from and how it got there, then just stick to your nine lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Other Side","review":"I must admit as an Aerosmith die-hard I had to have the book, but have been wary due to the many trashy rip-offs from ex-wives and the like. What impressed me most about the book is that everyone had their say, for better or for worse. Ex-managers, ex-wives, ex-girlfriends, ex-dope dealers, you name it, they're in here. They add the part of the story the boys were too stoned to remember themselves. Steven Davis is to be commended for what had to be many thankless hours of talking to so many people, and piecing the story together so well. What I enjoyed most was that the band talked about the music a great deal, instead of as some minor detail among the ruins. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read if you're a fan","review":"I've been an Aerosmith fan for nearly twenty years. This is a fantastic book. Stories from the early days in the late 60s up through their rise, fall and resurrection in the nineties are told from perspectives of all the guys.It's amazing what these guys went through to make. What's more impressive is the fact that they actually cleaned up and are still rocking today.This is a great biography. Full of expletives and crazy stories. I loved it!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith Comes Full Circle","review":"This book is for every Aerosmith fan, whether they are 15 years old or 55 years old. It is a truthful (and somewhat cautionary) look inside the life of the most talented of American Rock and Roll Bands. No holds barred here, as told straight from the people who lived it, the truth about what it was like as a young rock band in the age of Drugs, Sex and Rock and Roll. There is no sugar coating, Stephen Davis and Aerosmith take us from the earliest beginnings of Aerosmith, through the drug years, the break up and the reunion. This is a must read for any Aerosmith fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rags to riches to rags to riches tale of rock n' roll excess","review":"Love em' or hate em', Aerosmith deserves its' props. Walk This Way is a rags to riches to rags to riches tale of rock n' roll excess, and if you were alive in the 70's, their music was probably a part of the soundtrack to your life. The book is funny, brutally honest, pensive, and sad - sometimes all at once. Its anecdote-city as Stephen Tyler, Joe Perry and the boys lay it out - drug addiction, groupies, management & record company tales of woe (& triumph). It's an unlikely story really, especially the way the band has risen back to prominence in the 1990's. Are all of these stories true? Who cares? I read it all in one sitting on a Sunday and wished I had left some for the week ahead. Proceed immediately to the check out bin..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just unreal.","review":"I have listened to Aerosmith's music since 1976 and won't stop until I die. This was the most incredible autobiography I have ever read. These guys are truly \\"Amazing\\" and I commend them on their survival. I felt as though I was in on the conversations throughout the book and cried my heart out during the confrontation part. I was so moved by this book having been a long time fan that I love and appreciate them even more now. They didn't have to share their lives in such a candid way, but now we can all appreciate their awesome work even more. They surpass any other band on this planet - and even other planets. Truly a great book to read over and over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino dino dino dino dino dino dino","review":"Was my title annoying? Then you'll probably find this book annoying.

He wanted me to read this to him one night and so I did and now I wish I hadn't. This book is a cute idea, with the dinosaurs, the boat, the same cute rhyming text and the illustrations, until about half way through and I was shocked. The dinocrew heaves-ho (gets sick) all over the boat and what is worse, is it is illustrated too. It was gross. I didn't think is was funny, I just couldn't believe I saw this in a Children's book. I am sending this book back and the only reason I am giving it two stars, is because we liked the dinotrain so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"I bought this book after my 3YO loves the dino-train book.

However Dino-Train is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been cuter, why go for the gross factor?","review":"I thought that dinosaurs and sailing would be a cute combination for my two year old and it's not an awful book but I think they do get a mite too technical on the sailing terminology. That would have been fine if they defined it or explained it better through pictures but they don't. The dino-repetition doesn't grate on me the way it seems to a lot of the other reviewers, it's part of the nature of childrens books. The main problem with it was the depiction of and references to vomiting. Yuck. I hate it every time I read it and then put the book away for several more weeks until I forget how much it bothers me. This would otherwise have been a three or four star book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read, pictures okay.","review":"I wanted to enjoy this book, but it is clumsy to read, difficult for a young child to have any idea what you are reading about. I just started making up my own story line. I think it has a good idea, even the kids didn't seem that interested and stopped paying attention.it does have some sailing vocab in it. If you enjoy working on vocabulary and the pictures help explain some of the sailing termonology.My biggest problem with the book is it promotes the next book, \\"dinotrainers\\". I think it bothered me, because I wasn't enjoying reading this book so much and then it talks about the next adventure for the dinosaurs and I am thinking I don't want to read another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Children's Book","review":"If your little ones loved \\"Dinotrain\\",they will enjoy this just as much!

The main joke is the idea that big dinosaurs are battling seasickness while sailing a boat at sea. They throw up and throw up and throw up--in copious amounts. Whether you think this is humorous or not, it is very little to stimulate a child's mind, let alone entertain the poor tiring mother who has to read it. We are generous and avid readers in this house, but this book was just a waste of good paper and a grandparent's money.Very disappointing. Don't let the bubbly colorful illustrations fool you. There are far better kids books out there, especially when it comes to dinosaurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino-disaster","review":"I am quite shocked to see so many good reviews of this book. My son just received this as a gift. It was awful. The use of \\"dino\\" in front of almost every term is annoying. The story line isn't that great and the 2 page spread of dinosaurs spewing green vomit larger than the boat is completely gross and not appropriate. I'm pretty open minded, but my toddler really doesn't need a book like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dino-disappointment","review":"I was sorely disappointed with the text of this book. The use of \\"dino\\" before numerous words does not a catchy story make. I'm a huge fan of the illustrator and my toddler is a huge fan of dinosaurs, so we were eager for the book to arrive. The story, though, is written in such a way that it could be anything -- bears, people, dogs, aliens. There's nothing uniquely DINOSAUR about the characters. I was really hoping for a clever story that married the nature of dinosaurs with the life of a sailor -- perhaps even *teaching* me something about dinosaurs or life at sea. No such luck. The rhythm feels stilted, many of the rhymes sound flat and the two-page spread of all the dinosaurs spewing green vomit off the sides of the ship really is too much. As alluring as the cover art is, I recommend you pass on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winner with great music & lyrics","review":"First a short history for those who are not familiar with Jeff Deyo. Jeff was the founding member and lead singer of Sonicflood for their first few albums. After selling a million albums and winning a Dove award Jeff left the band to pursue a solo career. This is Jeff's 3rd studio album and 4th album overall counting his live oriented album \\"Surrender\\".Unveil boats the rock factor that his previous work has lacked. With a rock beat and powerful, worshipful lyrics this is a definite treat.

It is actually one of the finest and impressive accounts I've come accross thus far.Written is short verses, and rendered line-by-line it speaks with a racy, contemporary and firey idiom. After comparing it to Richmond Lattimore's famous version (in long-lined verse), I have to say that Michael Reck's version is far superior and FAR more exciting....almost as exciting as Stanley Lombardo's!Reck's translation reminds me of Albert Cook's line-by-line (verse)tranlsation of the Odyssey, which is naturally poetic, exciting and true to Homer.Reck spent the last 20 years of his life on this translation, and died shortly after it's publication.

The compression is ridiculous, the bass can start a cut and as soon as the guitars kick in it all gets incredibly muddy and the top and bottom both disappear.

The vision of these parishes seems to be the key in making them so successful. I am grateful for all the time and effort Wilkes has put into such a project.

The parishes profiled in this book are run by laymen (to the delight of the pastors themselves) and the holding to and teaching Christian truth is not mentioned anywhere as the objective of a good Catholic parish.

Pita bread is used for Communion and,if you walked in to the Church, you'd never guess it was a Catholic Church. There is nothing adorning it's walls. No Stations of the Cross, no nothing.

I stopped weighing every week and just got busy with cooking all these wonderful meals for my family. I noticed my clothes were getting loose so I stepped on the scales yesterday and nearly shouted!! 13 lbs had literally \\"melted\\" off just like Suzanne said. To be honest, I was shocked because I felt like I was eating too much and made many mistakes along the way (like eating avacodos and nuts) until I realized they are Funky Foods.

There was a very interesting article about this diet on a diet web site that I found, and basically the reason that the weight comes off initially is because you're not eating any processed sugar on this diet, and your body compensates by releasing it's stored-up supply of sugar, which is stored in water in the body. So when the sugar is released, the body flushes out the excess water, hence the weight loss!

And I didn't follow it to the letter this time or the last time! ...Bottom line is: listen to your body.I still highly recommend this (4 stars!) and would rather see people follow this plan than Atkin's - the results are the same but healthier, more sensible, and easier!

However, her books with their beautiful pictures of her and her recipes are lovely to look at but she is giving women who are in their 50's and beyond false hope.

Our bodies are designed for fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. Food processing, additives, preservatives, and sugar are the roots to many of the health crises in this country, and the most recent research is proving this to be true. Suzanne advocates eating healthy foods in their purest forms, with enough lean protein to sustain active adults.

And exercise is key. After ending this diet, I adjusted my eating schedule and portions and have lost the weight. And it all goes back to sensible eating - we know when we are eating foods high in fat and calories. Don't deny these foods, eat them every now and then to satisfy your cravings. Don't eat late at night. Exercise at least three times per week (I exercise at least 5 days per week). I have been addicted to food for a long time.

The only stereo input is the Aux RCA input and it combines it into mono however the EQ does effect the channels separately. The digital effect is a one decent preset of echo with reverb.

It felt like I was fast-forwarding through the entire novel. The actors were fine, but the dialogue they were given was so trite that I found myself wincing through most of it. The script lost a lot of the novel's \\"punch\\" and intensity. This DVD is definitely going into the Salvation Army bin. I couldn't sit through it again.My favorite version of Jane Eyre is still the 1983 version with Timothy Dalton - good dialogue, fine acting, and great film score, plus at 311 minutes the original story remains pretty much in tact.I also love Timothy Dalton's version of Wuthering Heights - never a dry eye at the end of that one. Beautiful, haunting film score."},{"rating":"2","title":"The definative Rochester","review":"I first read Jane Eyre when I was in the 5th grade (too many years to mention!)and have seen every version of film adaptions. While I will always love Timothy Dalton's impassioned plea for Jane to stay better, Ciaran Hinds gave a masterful performance as Rochester. He embodied the essence of a man torn between heartbreak and hope. I loved him in this movie and loved this video because of him. I do wish that they went more in depth in many of the plot lines, but overall, I get wracked with emotion every time Rochester comes on the screen.Watch it for the story but re-watch for Ciaran Hinds!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing compared to the Orson Wells version","review":"This was a drab, nothing little piece of a movie.Why even try to capture the beauty of the original when you can do it so boringly in color?Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tragic","review":"Jane Eyre is a classic. On the depressing side, but if you are in love with Victorian books made into well-made films, this one is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money to either buy or rent","review":"When I found out that A&E had come out with a movie version of my favorite book I was overjoyed. I enjoyed their versions of Pride and Prejudice and Emma. I was very dissapointed in their production of Jane Eyre. Key scenes were either altered, removed, or just poorly done. The entire gypsy scene was gone. How this major scene could possibly been taken out with thoughts that it would not be missed is beyond me.This was a wonderful book but a bad movie when the two are compared. If you have not read the book then maybe you won't care about the \\"alterations\\", but I promise you that this is one of the greatest books ever written and will not be dissapointed by investing the extra time and effort of actually picking up a copy and reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a pity...","review":"I read the book and adored it. I decided to purchase the film (this version being the only one I was familiar with). What a mistake. Although the role of Jane is redeamable, Mr. Rochester is overplayed; he is total gruff and grumble; absent being his redeaming qualities so well portrayed in the novel. They cut out such important parts of the book; Jane's disturbed childhood was a mere footnote. All of the novel's Gothic flavour is watered-down entirely. I had such high hopes. Stay away from this version, or, if intent upon viewing this, please read the book first so this film doesn't put you off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Eyre (A&E, 1997)","review":"Not a great version. Both Jane and Edward come off as angry and hard instead of the sympathy inspiring characters they are in the book. The Timothy Dalton version is much better and truer not only to the book, but to the spirit of the book. Jane does not leave Thornfield because of her pride as intimated in this version, she leaves because it would be morally wrong to stay. The whole book is about doing the right thing despite the main character's own personal desires. That in the end is what brings her happiness. Check out the other version before you buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Okay If You Don't Love the Book","review":"While this production is worth renting, it is not faithful to the book because of its omissions, and I found Ciaran Hinds to be a very unsatisfactory Mr. Rochester. The script highlighted his unsavory features (he is a deceiving adulterer, after all) to such an extent that his romantic and heroic qualities were insufficient to overcome the detriment to his character and likeability. In the book, his evil deeds are swept away by the force of his personality and the depth of his love. I also felt that while Timothy Dalton looked too young in the part, Ciaran Hinds looked too old and a bit worse for wear. The Timothy Dalton version is the most satisfying in terms of completion of plot. It is indeed straight from the book, as someone noted, and what a book it is! I think it takes quite some nerve to edit Charlotte Bronte to this extent."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!","review":"If you loved the book, you'll hate this adaptation of the story. This particular version of Jane Eyre is one of the worst I've seen. It was a huge disappointment. Don't waste your money on this one, instead, go for the BBC VHS version with Timothy Dalton and Zella Clark, which is the most faithful adaptation of the book I've seen, and I've seen most of the movies made."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Jane Eyre\\"","review":"I didn't think any remake of \\"Jane Eyre\\" could possibly be better than the version starring Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine.

If you like the Bronte's books, I highly recommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed","review":"Ciaran Hinds, one of my favorite actors, portrayed Rochester as a hysterical bully.I was amazed that Jane, a sensible girl, would find anything admirable or lovable about the character."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jane Eyre w/ Cirran Hinds & Samantha Morton","review":"I saw this version as a girl. It has been a favorite.probably always will be.I have see just about every version out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A&E does it again?","review":"I am most certain that the dvd release is an A&E abridged version; which they usually broadcast in their reruns and for their Classroom series. There is a more complete version which had originally aired encompassing Jane's school experiences. I'd guess that approximately 30-45 minutes of material are missing from the beginning of the story and was replaced with quickly edited scenes with a voice-over. I've heard this before about other A&E releases I just wish the official description would clarify...I would not have purchased it if I knew this was the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Jane and Rochester","review":"A finely cast Jane (an early role for Samantha Morton) and Rochester (a gruff, wry Ciaran Hinds) make the difference in what is quite a short retelling of the story. In particular, the verbal fencing that goes on as they sound each other out in the early part of the film - an important element in the book - is played expertly. The 2006 version (Ruth Wilson) has more time to develop detail and a first-class Jane, but perhaps too civilised a Rochester."},{"rating":"1","title":"Other than the leading actress, this version is awful!","review":"She's the only good aspect of this rendition. Considering that there are so many other versions of this amazing story to enjoy DO NOT waste your time on this one. I'm not the type to lean on the melodramatic, I really am serious about how poopy I thought this version is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most entertaining adaptation for all ages","review":"This is the best version of the story we have seen, far better than the newest 2011 movie. And believe me, our family has seen them all. We often catch ourselves quoting the movie, especially, \\"We are one soul, Jane!\\" Yes, it may not follow the book as closely but it is definitely the most dramatic and interesting of all the versions. Hinds and Morton are top notch. The suspense and interplay are entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal favorite","review":"I received this DVD yesterday and watched it immediately. Having seen part of it on TV, my initial feelings were confirmed. This is the best movie rendition out of the 4 Jane Eyre movies I have seen. Ciaran Hinds is fantastic as Mr. Rochester; as I always pictured him, dark, loud, brash, demanding, but hurt and helpless with regard to his situation. Mr. Hinds's acting in this movie prompted me purchase Jane Austen's \\"Persuasion\\", starring him, and I find it excellent as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Rochester sooo miscast","review":"This would have been a very good version of Jane Eyre except for the terrible miscasting of Mr. Rochester. Mr. Hinds simply isn't a romantic lead in any way, shape or form and his Rochester is nowhere near adequate. Its so distracting that I just couldn't believe the relationship between them. Jane wasn't plain enough for the role. Excellent actress though. The role of Jane calls for an actress that can look really drab most of the time then glow with animation at other times which changes her whole face."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother","review":"okay, I an a blatant anglophile with a particular addiction to Austen/Bronte, etc. film. But this movie, it sucked big time! While I appreciated that the movie didn't get ridiculously beautiful people to portray the characters, Mr. Rochester was disgusting. Then, when Jane and him profess their love for each other, I think that was the most disgusting onscreen kiss that I've ever seen (with the exception of anytime that Kevin Costner kisses). The acting was so overdramatized at that point that I had to turn it off b/c I felt like gagging. Go for the older version of this film, it's much more gripping and enjoyable. When compared to such masterpieces as Pride and Prejudice and Wives and Daughters, it's almost laughable. Those are the great movies, more should be made like them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This version completely lost the passion and truths of the novel. Jane Eyre, above all, was a woman of character, and I couldn't help but feel disappointed in the way she was portrayed in this movie. There seemed to be an attempt to translate the novel into political correctness, and it would have been better left alone. Jane seemed reduced to a pitiful co-dependency and Rochester, my dear Rochester! What a disappointment!! I agree that the 1986 version was much, much better at capturing Jane's spirit. It is difficult to portray someone \\"poor, obscure, plain and little\\" but not make her \\"souless and heartless.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible rendition","review":"If you've seen the 1983 version on VHS with Timothy Dalton as Rochester (or read the book), you will be very disappointed with this version. Several crucial parts of the story are left out completely, such as Jane learning that she has been left a sizeable inheritance. Also, Rochester is overacted, and the growth of the relationship between he and Jane is unconvincing. I bought this because it was on DVD, and wish I hadn't. I'll wait for the 1983 version to be put on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely bad version of Jane Eyre","review":"This A&E production was a huge disappointment. It is not true to the novel in any way. And Ciaran Hinds is the worst Mr. Rochester ever. If you are a trully huge fun of Jane Eyre as I am, do no waste your money on this one. It is pathetic. Invest in the BBC production with Timothy Dalton as Mr. Rochester."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was clearly enjoyable.","review":"I read the book and couldn't put it down. When I saw the movie I was so moved by it. It is the greatest love story. I love history, so it was even more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this so good????","review":"This Jane Eyre movie is so good because the acting is great and the plot and dialog is also great and to me this is one of the best costume movies! Samantha Morton is a perfect Jane Eyre and I can totally picture her as the character from Charlotte Bronte's book and I can totally picture Ciaran Hinds as Edward Rockchester and I think his acting along with Samantha's was great, great, great! His Rockchester may be gruff and yelled a couple of times but he is hardly the snarling beast that some reviewers have made him out to be and lets face it his character is supsosed to be gruff and rough around the edges! I really loved this movie and I think if you give it a chance and stop comparing it to the older Jane Eyre movies that you just may like it too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Samantha Morton and A&E's Jane Eyre are the BEST!!!!!!","review":"We LOVE A&E's production of Jane Eyre the BEST, and we have seen four other Jane Eyre movies. A&E's Jane Eyre is so MOVING. You can FEEL the characters every emotion by their GREAT facial expressions and how they speak to each other. The Beautiful music and everything about this production is so WONDERFUL. This movie really Tugs at your Heart. It is truly UNFORGETTABLE!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book will always be better!","review":"Yes, there were a couple parts of this movie that were good, but after reading the book I believe they'll never come close to how Charlotte Bronte would have wanted it. 1. Why was little Jane smiling in the \\"Red Room\\" scene? 2. Miss Ingram was not that pretty. 3. Jane appeared quite snotty to Mr. Rochester in the beginning. 4. It didn't show a gradual enough transition from \\"Master and governess\\" to \\"in love\\", and they might as well have skipped the whole part on St. John and his family for the insignificance it seemed to the whole movie. Instead, they could have NOT skipped the scene where Mr. Rochester disguises himself as a gypsy (or whatever you call it.) Overall I was very disappointed but then it could have been that the whole time I was comparing it to the BOOK and how much more heart-wrenching the book was! I probably would have liked it more had I seen it first before the book. I recommend renting this BEFORE buying!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"Absolutely loved this version of Jane Eyre. The Timothy Dalton (1983) & William Hurt (1996) versions were very hard to sit through. This version was very good in conveying the chemistry between Jane Eyre & Mr. Rochester which the other two versions completely failed to portray. However this version is not faithful to the book at all. But it is forgivable considering they are trying to explain the passionate relationship of Jane & Rochester in less than 2hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvellous acting!","review":"Ciarin Hinds did the best portrayal of Rochester that I have seen...he somehow managed to capture the passion of the character, without making him into a depressed milksop (if you want that kind of thing see the version with William Hurt). In this portrayal Rochester is vigorous and abrupt and changeful but with a deep and tender heart. The movie, while not correct in all the particulars of Bronte's book, somehow manages to capture the spirit of it. The necessary omissions aren't quite so glaring as they are in other versions where character development is totally lacking. On the down side, Jane could have been a little better, but on the whole this a great movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I already reviewed this but forgot to adjust the star rating","review":"I already submitted a review, but forgot to adjust the star rating. So my tepid review has five stars -- very confusing. Please correct! Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful cast, beautiful movie","review":"After seeing this production of Jane Eyre by A&E how could you EVER need or want to see another? The movie itself is beautiful~ it really catches the dark textured landscapes of the book. But above that, the cast is simply brilliant. Samantha Morton as Jane can say about sixty contrasting things at once by turning her head. Rochester is perfect as well~ he's really quite funny in some scenes. While the whole cast is great (and the little girl Jane is wonderfully cute as well as talented) the two main actors just stand out and completely carry the film. A truly wonderful adaption of such a great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, the passion...","review":"Oh, is this a good film! First of all, the actors are outstanding. It's no accident that Samantha Morton was nominated for an Oscar this last year; I only wonder when Ciar��n Hinds will have the same honor. His work in this film is so incredible it defies description, especially at the end. Those ladies that have come to swoon over him will find him perhaps not as handsome as he was in Persuasion (my personal favorite CH film), but they won't be disappointed either. In all honesty, I would give the film four-and-a-half stars if I could, for there are a few scenes that I find a bit annoying. And it isn't completely faithful to the novel, but then, what two-hour adaptations ever are? And those of you with romantic tendencies will want to watch it over and over and over again (and yes, I am an Austenite but I love the Bronts too). I can't wait to buy it on DVD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful. Just Awful!","review":"This is the worst version of this movie that I've ever seen. Mr. Rochester was a disaster. Not only did he not fit the part physically, he didn't emotionally or spiritually either. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars, was that I thought the beginning was very good, it definately portrayed the felling of the book, but the rest of the movie went downhill from there. Jane wasn't too bad, but they producer and director could have done so much more with this movie. It's such a good book, that it's a big disappointment that people think they have to improve onsomething that would be better left alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so,depending on one's previous experience with Jane Eyre.","review":"For those who have not viewed any other movie versions of this wonderful book, this movie would suffice--unless, of course they have read the book. In that case, one would find this movie quite lacking in comparison. For those who HAVE viewed one or another of the other movies, particularly the Timothy Dalton version, this movie would be like eating peanut butter rather than accepting prime rib!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Who?","review":"The screenwriting for this particular adaptation took extreme liberties, not with the events (which is to be expected) but the characterization of both Jane and Mr. Rochester. I assume the liberties were taken in order to make the characters more palatable to modern tastes and philosophies. A pity the writer could not trust the original material to convey the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"The second worse verse of Jane Eyre","review":"I am a Jane Eyre fanatic, so it is with experience that I can say. . . this movie is not worth the time. I own the BBC and 1997 verse and those are the only two I could ever recommend(the BBC verse is the best). There is NOTHING about Mr Rochester's character that is appealing. In fact, they make him far to angry and unpleasent than he should be. The book portrays a broken man. For that reason, women are drawn to him. Not even in the most climaxtic scene am I convinced that he is truely in need of love. The whole movie felt cold and unfeeling!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate but mildly enjoyable","review":"More Harlequin romance than Charlotte Bronte novel, this is an agreeable enough production. The acting is decent but the script! Trite and overly dramatic, it made me wince every time. By all means get this for the light romance but don't mistake this for anything even close to Bronte's vision. The last two versions were much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this version","review":"Gentle reader,I hated this version. I usually enjoy Samantha Morton's work, but she declined to act in this film...and Ciaran Hinds chewed the scenery so much, I'm surprised that there were walls left standing at Thornfield...even after the fire!There is very little character development in this script and I found myself not caring about Jane or Rochester, which is a problem when presenting \\"Jane Eyre.\\"For my money, there hasn't been a better, more fully-realized Rochester than Orson Welles."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST","review":"THIS A&E VERSION OF JANE EYRE IS EXCELLENT. THE STORYLINE IS TRUE TO THE NOVEL, THOUGH ABBREVIATED. HINDS AS ROCHESTER IS AS GOOD AS ORSON WELLES, THOUGH NOT QUITE UP TO TIMOTHY DALTON'S PERFORMANCE. SAMANTHA MORTON IS WONDERFUL AS JANE EYRE, AT TIMES SURPASSING ZELAH CLARKE, WHO WAS NEARLY THE PERFECT JANE EYRE, AND JOAN FONTAINE, WHOSE FACIAL EXPRESSIONS ALONE WERE SUFFICIENT TELL THE STORY. IN SAMANTHA MORTON WE SEE THE YOUTH AND NAIVET�� OF JANE, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPING PASSION AND INNER STRENGTH. THIS VERSION TELLS THE STORY MORE COMPLETELY AND ACCURATELY THAN THE HOLLYWOOD CLASSIC, AND TELLS IT AS WELL, BUT IS NOT QUITE THE EQUAL OF THE PRODUCTION FEATURING TIMOTHY DALTON AND ZELAH CLARKE."},{"rating":"1","title":"lost passion","review":"Having read Bronte's book Jane Eyre many times I'm aware of its strengths and weaknesses. The screen adaptation used in this particular version of the story has deleted all the charm of the novel and has over-played the dysfunction of both Mr. Rochester and Jane Eyre. Hinds rants, roars, and grimaces entirely too much. Morton seems to be made of wax. In the scene where Bertha sets fire to Rochester's bed I truly expect Morton's Eyre to melt. I hope no one uses this movie as a measure of the story--it will put them off Charlotte Bronte's work forever. If you must watch a movie production of the novel try the Timothy Dalton version--though Dalton is too handsome to be true to the author's physical description of Rochester he manages to capture the man's spirit and one can understand why Jane loves him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best ever Jane Eyre adaptation; magnificent casting!","review":"After reading the book and watching several adaptations, I found this version to be far superior to the others. Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds are absolutely perfect. I find myself compelled to watch it over and over! The only objection I have is the length--it is a shame it couldn't have been a 4 hour miniseries and included more details from the novel, especially interaction between Jane and Mr. Rochester. I was happy to find out the actual video did have added footage from the A&E TV version, but still not enough. Hats off to the two lead actors for superb performances! I look forward to seeing them in future productions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soooooooo disappointing","review":"Do not waste your money on this version - get it at the library if you absoultely want to see it - it is too short and moves too fast - the actors are actually all very good, especially \\"Mrs. Fairfax\\" - if you love the book don't even bother watching this, unless you want to see how a classic can be ruined!! Alot of things are changed or omitted as other reviewers have said - not enough scenes of her childhood life, and not enough of her time with her new found relatives after she leaves Thornfield, etc. etc. Again, very disappointing!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense and Truthful","review":"I love this version of \\"Jane Eyre\\". The script was intelligently written. It remained faithful to the central issue of the novel: how Jane Eyre's unique caracter and personality ensure her a sincere and passionate love. That is why the oblivion of other story lines, such us those of her sufferings at her aunts house and the discovery of her cousings, is not at all cuestionable. Their non-appearance concentrate the love story, which, without a doubt, is the main interest of the writer and the director. Even the dialogue, most of which does not proceed from the novel, has been created to enhance the sensually intense feelings that Jane Eyre and Edward Rochester have for each other.I consider this film an excellent adaptation, hence it captures the spirit of the novel even when it does not depict all of it's actions or gather most of it's dialogue from the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"How could any Jane Eyre fan love this movie??!!","review":"I've read the book (10 times) and seen all the movie versions. The \\"Jane\\" in this video was unbelievably haughty and unattractive. How in the world did Rochester ever fall in love with her? When they kiss in the movie there is the \\"chemistry\\" (mentioned in other reviews), but lust isn't what the book is all about. All my favorite passages were cut out or adulterated beyond recognition. This would be a terrific disappointment to any one who really loves the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely the worst Jane Eyre version!","review":"The characters have the same names as the novel but that is about as far as this version goes to stay true to the characters in Bronte's Jane Eyre. I've watched many versions of this classic novel, and this is by far the worst. Ciar��n Hinds, who I usually love, plays Mr. Rochester as a raving lunatic, not a tortured man who's life has been turned upside down by an unfortunate mistake as a young man. There is no chemistry between the characters and the dialogue/plot differs so much from the novel it is a travesty to call this 'Jane Eyre.' I threw away this DVD after watching it. A waste of $$$. Buy the Timothy Dalton version for a true 'Mr. Rochester.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous Rochester","review":"I love the book and the 1983 adaptation with Dalton and Clarke is my favorite. I told my husband years back (then just a bf) how much I love the book and movie and he gifted me this without knowing anything about different versions out there. I was not even aware of this adaptation myself back then and was curious to see what this Jane Eyre had to offer. I was horried to witness Ciaran Hinds screeching and screaming all the time like he was having a never-ending PMS. And let me just say I love Ciaran Hinds. He is a truly talented actor, amazing in Persuasion and Phantom of the Opera, not a one-note actor by any means. I dont understand what could possibly happen here. Did he so grossly misunderstood the character? I cannot beleive it. I am blaming the director (and maybe editors?) for misguiding him into making such a travesty out of Mr. Rochester."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best film rendition of this classic novel","review":"This version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" with Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds is truly the absolute best, most heart-wrenching one I have seen. The William Hurt and Timothy Dalton versions bored me to tears. This was the first \\"Jane Eyre\\" film I have seen where I was weeping at the end.

Still it is quite entertaining. Music was very good, much better than the BBC 1983 version. This Jane is the BEST Jane I have seen so far. She is an incredible actress who portrays all of Jane's emotions. I am disturbed by so much change in the wordings though. Also I found myself disliking this Mr. Rochester because he SCREAMS all the times. ICK! He definitely looks over 20 years older than Jane. The best Rochester is the PBS version. This movies is still worth a look for its entertaining value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst version extant.","review":"I read Jane Eyre for the first time at the age of 15. Over the years I have eagerly watched every filmed version as they appeared. I previously thought the Orson Welles version was the worst, but I changed my mind once I saw this. The BEST film of Jane Eyre is the Susannah York/George C. Scott version, done in the early 1970's for Hallmark Hall of Fame. Wonderful in every way!! Unfortunately, not available yet on video. AVOID this version from A&E, it is truly terrible. Ciaran Hinds plays Mr. Rochester as a loud, bullying, scenery-chewing lout, and I have seldom seen a shallower, more pallid performance as Jane. Skip this movie and re-read the novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good For Insomniacs, At Least...","review":"About all this movie did was put me to sleep. I have seen every major version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" around, and this is just about the worst. The screenwriters have cut and pasted the the story into something that shares nothing but a title with Bronte's novel. But it's not just the butchery. The actors in this movie show little emotion-they spend the whole movie mumbling to each other in drab, monotone voices. It's like watching Jane Eyre performed by the cast of the X-Files. Sigh. If you want to see what the real \\"Jane Eyre\\" is like, try the BBC version with Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. This movie is just weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I loved the book, but this adaptation is my least favorite. Mr. Rochester is so unappealing in every way.

Unfortunately, there is nothing in the Amazon information to indicate that the book was actually published in 1919. (My first clue was the passage saying that something that happened in 1805 or thereabouts was \\"a hundred years\\" ago.) The book sounds amazingly modern and it's remarkable that much of the discussion about separation of powers and the history of the Constitution seems so contemporary. Of course, the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have radically changed the interpretation of the Constitution's stance on \\"state sovereignty,\\" so the portions on Marshall's great later opinions on states and the Constitution do seem different from current understandings. Very interesting to read the views of a major scholar from nearly 100 years ago on the events of the early Republic."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE MONEY","review":"I bought this for my daughter's birthday and I am terribly disappointed. After reading the directions I tried to make the baby do what it was supposed to do. She peed all over me because you have to hold her a certain angles.

You have to squeeze her arm pretty hard to get her to cry and you have to shove the bottle in her mouth so hard so it won't leak out.

My 8 year old is a doll lover, and was very excited and surprised to receive this doll as a Christmas gift. On Christmas Day we spent several hours trying to make this doll live up to expectations, and that NEVER happened. The tedious directions on holding the doll at certain angles and trying to make her work takes ALL of the fun out of the doll. Honestly, after about 3 hours, she gave up and tossed it aside.

Though the stories in it are undoubtedly true and it does describe how difficult Jewel's road to stardom was, it seemed to read more like a chronology of events than an in-depth look at her career.

You could easily find much of the factual information online for free and if you know what EDA stands for, you probably know most of it already anyway.If you are looking for more insight into Jewel's life and career, I would suggest her autobiography \\"Chasing Down the Dawn\\".

Chapter headings such as \\"Power, Politics and the Law\\" and \\"Having and Enjoying\\" give you an idea of the wide scope of the book.The reader will find more enjoyment in reading 18th century works (novels, biography and non-fiction) after being educated by this book.I oftentimes read, then sell my books.

Lanphier almost caused a major security breach by going around the country while the war was still going on, telling people his mission knew they were after Yamamota, which could have tipped off the Japanese that their codes were broken.

Glines (Aug. 4, 2001)","review":"Glines reports on every aspect of the Yamamoto mission in painstaking detail, particularly on the decades-long debate regarding who actually shot down the admiral's plane. Indeed, barely half of the book covers the mission's planning and execution; the rest consists of in-depth analysis of every conceivable piece of information and speculation on the buring question as to who should get credit for the kill. If the reader just wants a comprehensive, overall history of the mission and its background, there may be better choices. \\"Get Yamamoto,\\" by Burke Davis fills that bill nicely.

It contains 3 of the very worst Rod Stewart written songs ever, \\"Move Me,\\" \\"Ghetto Blaster\\" and the title track (\\"Somebody's cherries need picking\\" PUhlllease Rod,.....). As for \\"Sweet Surrender,\\" it has a nice country groove but listen to the lyrics and the song becomes pointless.

While I generally like Merton, this is nothing like Merton's typical style. It is in the literary format of a \\"life of a holy person\\" or hagiography. It emphasizes the holy and selfless behavior of the nun and the religious effect on the community. I read it as part of academic work on Merton.It tells you a lot that even Merton did not particularly like this book (but Merton disliked much of his own work).If you have a specific reason for buying this, it's a good example both of early Merton (just after his admission to the Abbey of Gethsemani) or of religious biography. If not, try one of Merton's other works.

If you are interested in the man, or the story of how a young man overcame tragedy, definitely pick this book up. I had the pleasure of meeting the author at a book signing, and it was an honor.

The author quite obviously knows her stuff and is an adept at both Wicca and Umbanda. She makes this primer on the submject of Brazilian folk religions intelligible and fascinating.

Comparing the two sets, the advantage of this one is that the episodes seem more clear than the grain in the original set. While not blu-ray quality the video seems better, which is an advantage if you have a large screen and are buying this partially for the opportunity to see distant lands. Another advantage is that these cases are slim cases, less bulky than the original set.

Unfortunately, it's not. The story, which combines a Gothic love triangle, lazy jokes about 1970s pop culture, and 200-year-old vampire Barnabas Collins's struggle to break a curse set on his house by the witch whose love he rejected in the 18th century and restore his family's fortunes, never comes together in any meaningful way. The movie is overpopulated, and we are given little reason to care about any of the characters.I didn't hate \\"Dark Shadows,\\" but I couldn't shake the feeling that this was a movie in search of a reason to have been made. It wasn't played straight enough to be taken on its own terms, and it wasn't played over-the-top enough to be campy fun. Burton's always-enjoyable visual style is wasted on this overlong, dull film."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK","review":"It was a little too campy for me.

I was really excited to see how Burton and Depp treated this as fans. But it was obvious from the get that they were trying too hard to make it their own and they just couldn't decide if they were going to go with comedy or camp. I would have enjoyed a really dark campy movie that would have bitten off the first say two to three seasons of Dark Shadows. They're eyes were too big and they over-extended themselves. Not to mention that their attempts at comedy and camp just ended up looking like bad writing and over production. I was not impressed. I did like Depp's look. That's one star and another star for including Alice Cooper (I won't spoil the surprise). But everything else is just blah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Much Shadow","review":"\\"Dark Shadows\\" was a soap opera back in the late 1960's whose characters had skeletons in their closet, literally. The original show had one of the first sympathetic portrayals of a vampire who wasn't all bad. The movie had promise with the campy acting, good atmosphere background music, and nice visuals. BUT, the characters were not treated well - the witch became a Superman arch-villain, the doctor (my favorite from the original TV show) was treated shabbily and opportunities for a real plot were just wasted. Changes from the original storyline didn't make sense and the ending of the movie was utterly forgettable. The filmmakers could have had a lot of fun with Barnabas' angst in not wanting to kill people and the whole haunted, dysfunctional family. Too bad, if they had done it right, they could have made more movies starring the Collins Family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Funny modern spin off dark shadows soap opera and twilight.

And Johnny Depp has always been a pleasure to watch in action. This movie however was horrid. The storyline was muddled, Johnny is a caricature of his Capt Jack Sparrow character, Chloe Moretz can't stop pushing her huge top lip out the entire time and does little \\"acting\\". The only saving grace to the movie is Michelle Pfieffer.

Very disconnected from the original series, not the same mood or tone, characters totally different from the series. Didn't mind it being up dated or re-imagined, but this mess of a film that did everything wrong. Did the creator's ever see the original series? The music from the series is iconic, but there was not a single refrain in the score. Over the past 50 years Bond films, while being updated, retain something of the original. This film was more of a parody, more Saturday Night Live skit, than a new vision of Dark Shadows. Complete waste of time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Perfect movie for date night.

Barnabas thru pure butchery destroyed his own descendants in his attempts to find his Josette. Running time about 95Minutes a little longer then your film and even with 10 minutes that never made it to the film and that Curtis destroyed.

I now own the entire original series. I almost walked out in the first ten minutes. My spouse said I had this look of pure disgust through-out the whole thing... except when I managed a giggle at Alice Coopers expense. The fact that all Tim Burton did for the original cast was to give them a walk-on, was so disrespectful and half-assed! I often wonder if the screening of this film killed the good and great Jonathan Frid!? It was an insult!!! The only thing that Burton got right was hiring Danny.

I don't think they could all settle on what the film wanted to be so it was \\"kinda\\" several things, never being successful in one direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp fan","review":"I like all of his movies, it's a must see. the price was just right. he is a great actor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good if you like the actors.","review":"If you like the actors its an ok movie.You can see some of the quality direction and acting you would expect in a Burton film but at the same time you feel like its a bit disjointed.Disjointed I can overlook if I like who I am watching but it is noteworthy in a film with high potential.So I like it and it was \\"ok\\". But not a block buster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Shadows great ride","review":"Loved this movie, we thought Johnny Depp once again did a great job with wonderful supporting cast. This movie had a couple surprise twists that surprised us. Great fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly Bad","review":"One would think Dark Shadows with Johnny Depp directed by Tim Burton would be thoroughly entertaining, but it just doesn't turn out that way. The movie starts out as a campy, nostalgic and fun comedy, but it runs out of humor after about the first 15 or 20 minutes. After the charming introduction is over, the movie proceeds to laboriously suck the life out of anyone watching it and everyone in it. The weak script relies on way too much gratuitous action that seems meaningless and boring. If you are planning on watching this movie, prepare to be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz","review":"Terrible disappointment!

The end result is that the DVD case was pushed in and now it's unsuitable as a gift as I had originally intended. WHoever packaged this did a piss-poor job and obviously didn't care about what they were doing. As a fan of the origianl series and having seen the movie already, I liked the movie but my complaint is with the way it was sent. It's not worth my having to pay for the return postage just to have anyther sent in its place. You all usually do a great job, but you missed the boat on this one!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could have seen it!","review":"I was traveling and had downloaded but was having many problems with wifi-roamingand never was able to complete the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So boring!","review":"As a huge Depp fan I was so disappointed in this movie.

I would have givin it 5 stars but I though it could have been funnier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I so wanted to like this movie. But it was so slow and boring.

And this is coming from a girl who will watch practically any bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't love it","review":"I stayed awake for the whole movie, but if I didn't pay for it I probably would have fell asleep.

Don't waste your money.

In a why-did-I-pay-$10-to-see-this kind of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD is literally dark","review":"I watched this movie at the theatre and really enjoyed it. I bought it to share with my family. However, the DVD was really dark as in half the picture was so dark you could not see any details. True we did not watch the movie at night with no lights. Maybe that would have helped. But we did have all the drapes pulled so it was semi-dark in the room. And during much of the movie it was so dark that we could not see any detail at all. So....started at 5 stars for content and subtracted one star for quality of DVD. I would recommend viewing this at night with no lights."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Best","review":"This movie was dark and not nearly as funny as I thought it would be.

I didn't even find a whole lot of humor. I don't recommend this for purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny Depp wows again!","review":"I loved the story line of a classic vampire and all of the actors in this film. Not only was Johnny Depp up to par as usual, it was nice to see Michelle Pfeiffer on the big screen once again, and nice to see Helena Bonham carter in a role so different than the Harry Potter series. The subtle humor made this film a gem for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta' love Depp!!","review":"Funny, entertaining and I like Depp as an actor; can't go wrong in my eyes.There were some pretty unreal parts but it was all in fun and a great Halloween movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Johnny Depp","review":"The movie was alot of fun and really enjoyed what I got to see.

(or that less than wonderful Alice in Wonderland?). He used to be amazeballs! Dark Shadows was just dreadful and worse, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I'm a fan of Johnny Depp but I was disappointed with this movie.

Did not think too much of the series. However the Johnny Depp Dark Shadows was an enjoyable movie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth seeing","review":"This film was not good. I love seeing movies. I also really enjoy fun-bad movies and had high hopes for this. Unfortunately this film was just bad. The storyline was weak, the acting wooden (which is odd because the cast has a lot of great actors). The fish out of water scenes have been done far better elsewhere. The McDonald's joke fell completely flat. the movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a comedy or a drama. There is such thing as a dramedy but it didn't have the chops to pull it off. And then the ending became a 'throw everything including the kitchen sink at it' and hope something makes sense. Which it did not. I want my two hours back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb","review":"I am a big fan of Johnny Depp but this movie is terrible. they even left room for there to be a sequel for some stupid reason!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I though the preview was hilarious and was really looking forward to watching this movie.

It left a lot to be desired, the character development, plot, and ending all needed a bit of help and energy...basically, don't waste your money on this one, you will regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Depp Shadows\\" Wears Clown Shoes","review":"As a die-hard fan of the original '60s version of \\"Dark Shadows\\" and the 1991 NBC version of the series, I waited anxiously ever since this movie was first announced in 2007. What Burton and Depp created five years later was comedic trash. They could've produced a gothic-horror classic, instead they went for the juvenile comedy route instead. EPIC FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"huge letdown","review":"as a huge johnny depp fan i was really looking forward to this movie. but unfortunately its awful. the acting is horrible, the plot is confusing, and depps talents are wasted. i wont spoil the ending for people but be warned, ITS CREEPY."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIDICULOUS","review":"this is the worst movie ever. **spoiler** All of a sudden at the end the girl in the movie becomes a warewolf. WHAT!!!!!!! It was so out of left field. That is what made me decide that the movie was defenitely rediculous. The movie starts off really funny and entertaining. Then when DEEP wakes up its still funny. It isnt until after 15 min. after he wakes up that the movie gets boring and ridiculous. The ridiculousness gets bigger as the movie rolls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie!","review":"A little bit of everything... funny, spooky, quirky and all around entertaining flick. People thought it was going to be some rolled out modern day version of Dark Shadows the cheesy TV show ...its not, it was its own creation based on existing characters. It is its own entity and very amusing! We all enjoyed it and recommend it if you want a few laughs. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Absolutely don't bother wasting your time!! If you want to enjoy your evening, then pick another movie. It was not worthy of Johnny Depp!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S A DIFFERENT APPROACH","review":"I'm a Dark Shadows fan from the soap opera days of yesteryear. I also loved the remake starring Ben Cross, which was closer to the original but still a different approach in it's own right. If you can just forget the story we all know and accept this movie on it's own terms, it's quite entertaining. I think we all have had our fill of remakes with no creativity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burton is hit or miss but what a waste of a cast","review":"Burton has done stuff I've loved, he's done stuff I've hated, this just disappoints.Some of the funny bits would have been better with better timing or if something else had come next, but he would deliver a nice bit and let it lay there. They could have boiled this whole movie down to three minutes of very clever stuff, wait they did! The trailer.Glad I didn't spend the dough to see this at the theater."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saw it twice in the theater","review":"It's campy, shticky, deadpan. I loved it. If you're expecting a serious drama, or mainly a love story, you'll be disappointed. I was expecting more of a love story (I grew up watching the Dark Shadows remake of the 90s), but when I figured out what the movie was meant to be, I dropped my expectations and just went with it. Burton and Depp give a nod to the overacting and over-makeup of the silent film era and a nod to the kitschy 60s and 70s era with a subtly twisted humor. Vampires, lava lamps, funky 70s earrings, an exploding fish cannery, and Alice Cooper... what's not to like, lol?"},{"rating":"2","title":"very fun movie","review":"Loved the whole atmosphere of this movie. Johnny Depp was fantastic as a vampire. The whole cast was great. It makes me want to go check out the original series as I have never seen it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark shadows","review":"Great film with a lot of laughs!

Not real sure what the daughter ended up being at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"dark shadows","review":"It put in perspective most of the various demons mankind knows of and was worth the watch.

A must see if you are a fan of the original with a sense of humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lot's of fun that feels like classic Tim Burton!","review":"What I love most about this film is that it reminds me of the classic Tim Burton films like Pee Wee's Big Adventure, Beetlejuice, Edward Scissor Hands and the film he produced Nightmare Before Christmas. If you miss classic Burton than this film is for you! I saw this not knowing anything about the source material (Dark Shadows soap opera) and didn't know it was based on the old an TV show until after seeing it. I'd say it's like Austin Powers meets the Adams Family with sexy/gothic art direction and wardrobe. Just when you thought Johnny Depp was out of tricks he manages to deliver a fresh performance and give Banabus Collins (main character) a life of his own. This movie was a great summer flick that didn't get the attention it deserved. Recommended!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"When I found out that a movie Dark Shadows was coming out , I was thrilled. The horror was attending this awful garbage movie.

I was not impressed. I thought it was a serious vampire movie. I enjoyed the first 15 minutes of this movie until it started to turn very flakey, dry and dull. The movie loses all credibility; it's like some retarded version of the Adams family! Please do NOT waste your time buying this trash. This is a warning. I was so angry and disappointed, that I actually threw my blue ray copy in the trash...but I did keep the jacket! Sorry guys but it's not a hardcore vampire movie...it's a joke is what it is.

Failed to meet expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Shadows the new movie","review":"I loved the show dark shadows as a kid and had been re-watching old episodes in anticipation of the movie - what a disappointment!Although I thought all the actors were great the plot was terrible! Way too much screen time was spent on poking fun at the 70's rather than developing good characters and interesting plots.This was such a missed opportunity - how could anyone lack for plot ideas with all the multiple story arcs that went on during the shows time on day time TV - Dan Curtis must be rolling in his grave - with the appropriate music no doubt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultra violet service sucks","review":"Great movie but I couldn't down load the digital version from Ultra violet.

I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie from an awesome show...","review":"People have complained that the movie is a parody of the original show, but I don't agree...certainly it has a lot of humorous moments, but it also has its share of dramatic scenes. I would term this as a 'dramedy.'The cast is great, especially Johnny Depp as Barnabas and Michelle Pfeiffer as Elizabeth, and especially considering they both had some really big shoes to fill from Jonathan Frid and Joan Bennett, the original Barnabas and Elizabeth from the show.Eva Green is deliciously nasty as Angelique, but she also shows she still has a soft spot in her 'love' for Barnabas despite the fact she has managed to ruin his family for generations in revenge for his rejecting her.This is a wonderful tribute to an iconic show at least in my opinion. I can watch it over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Shadows","review":"Awful film, thoroughly disappointed given its fantastic cast.Not worth paying to see, I'd wait until its free on prime :("},{"rating":"1","title":"ok.","review":"poor story line. a little comedy here and there, but with not much quallity inbetween. my kids ages 8-14 thought it was ok, the younger ones were almost as bored as I was. My two boys found more humor in it than the rest of us, they are 14 and 13."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I'm a long time Tim Burton fan, and not to mention Johnny Depp fan, so I obviously jumped at seeing this movie. I went and saw it with my wife after it's release and we both really enjoyed it. It's, in my opinion, not one of Tim Burton or even Johnny Depp's best roles, but it's still pretty good and worthy of watching, if not purchase.How closely this really compares to the old Dark Shadows series or the characters contained within, I have no idea, for I have never actually seen it. However, however close it was or was not, there is no denying that this was an enjoyable movie none the less...and it has Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's signature style, which is something I really enjoy. Some people say that particular style is getting old, but I say poppycock...I love it!If you're a Tim Burton and/or Johnny Depp fan, and/or just enjoy a good comical work of fantasy/horror type stuff, I suggest giving this a watch if you have not yet seen it...it's pretty entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good","review":"I thought this movie was awesome and funny! it was refreshing to see a funny dark movie. I loved Johnny Depp in this role! I'm not to fond of these kinds of movies but it was def. awesome! I have never written a review about a movie on here before...so what does that tell u? lol love it! buy it! Johnny is adorable in it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better each time you watch it.","review":"I originally saw the film at the theatre and was kind of indifferent about it. But I got such a deal on the Blu-ray I couldn't pass it up. Watching it a second time, even knowing what would happen, was much better than the first time. Odd, but maybe the anticipation added to it. It's a fun flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on....","review":"Johnny Depp and Michelle Pfeiffer must have had a mortgage payment due, to agree to star in this drivel. Corny beyond belief. All the good lines (and there were only a few) were all shown in the trailer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring Tim Burton movie?","review":"Whoever heard of such a thing?

I am super excited that I also got the digital copy, so one day I plan to check it out that way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depp = Crapp","review":"Library rental. Subtley ironic and really bad soap opera? Definitely not comedy, supernatural, horror or romance. Nothing at all like the movie trailer would suggest.Lacks the love or revenge or any plot element of most vampire stories, or any real emotional connection period. Pretty boring actually. Oh yeah, he's a vampire, he's just pale, I sorta forgot.Depp's deadpanning is as if William Hung (American Idol super-reject) were playing the character of Charie Harper. But without the good hair and charming self-depreciation, or any talent, or supporting comedic actor.And the daughter... a half-second reveal at the end \\"wait, I'm really werewolf\\"' and zero followup? WTH?I was once forced to watched Finding Nemo, which was completely sappy, and it was far far superior to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Denise Adkins","review":"This movie was a little different from the Dark Shadows soap opera I watched as a kid. It was scary and funny, good for kids, especially young teens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Shadow falls flat","review":"The movie lacked depth and cohesion. Dark Shadows tries hard to be something it's not, entertaining. The one liner jokes miss, the plot is muddy, overall just another disappointing Tim Burton fizzle."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Shadow","review":"Johnny Depp was worth the rental. Found his role amusing but not enough \\"camp\\" to save this movie. Watch the original to enjoy the drama and humor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated this movie","review":"Not because it is a shallow remake of a remake... but because it simply sucks. Johnny Depp is good but in all honest- when they don't have him doing a \\"Captain Jack\\" impression of whatever character he is playing- he's decent. He knows how to poke fun at himself and how to be completely silly. and that is all there needs to be side about it... avoid- if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad plot","review":"It was not funny, it was weirdly sexual, and the story line was not good. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the time to watch.","review":"First, the bad, Not a lot of substance to this movie, but that may be in line with the old series. I've never seen it so can't be sure. It does have a good plot, excellent acting and direction and the SFX are excellent (possibly the best I've seen). Perhaps a second watch will make it better now that I have an idea of what's going on, but that may be a while, I have other new stuff to watch first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good choice for day time Dark Shadows fans.","review":"An entertaining movie with an interesting take on the original Dark Shadows.

If thats what you were thinking to do, think again, and as funny as it was at times, the movie was kinda dark too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just don't.","review":"Someone needs to tell Johnny Depp to stop taking these films.

Put a comedic face on a dull script. The story was a little weak. Special effect were good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad","review":"We knew when we rented this show it really had nothing in common with the original Dark Shadows, of which we are great fans. In fact, it really had nothing in common but the name. Burton's character development was very poor and the show really amounted to a slapstick version of what was really a serious show. A pity for Depp -- at times he can be a great actor. I pretty much knew all this from watching the trailers, but my family wanted to see it so I caved in and watched it. None of the actors bear any relationship to the original characters.Really a shame, IMHO. The original series is ripe for a retro movie and it could be done really well by a competent team of producers. One star for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious dialogue...","review":"Johnny Depp has done it again.

Remember how the trailer had 2 or 3 jokes, so did the movie. It literally had 3 jokes. When I was watching it with friends, I fell asleep about halfway through and woke up during the scene [SPOILER ALERT] where the little girl (don't remember her name) turned into a werewolf or something.

Dark Shadowns could have been a comedy if it had been funny, I'm not sure what they were aiming for but they missed the mark.We all know Johnny Depp loves his make up but this was so over the top, the only thing it had in common with the TV version of Dark Shadows was the name of the caracters. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its for Dark Shadows, Burton, and Depp Fans","review":"We love this movie. A couple of years ago, we watched every episode of the original Dark Shadows series, then everything \\"Dark Shadows\\" we could get our hands on.

Save yourself the money and watch The nightmare before Christmas, back when entertainment meant something more.I realized 45 mins in, that this movie had no plot.

I heard that both Depp and Burton were fans of the original. Really? Were they paying attention? Dark Shadows is more a Shakespearean Tragedy with all the themes of terrible jealousy, revenge and murder. They could have made something really dark and amazing and instead took the easy road to box office dollars by camping it up with humour (which really isn't even funny). I am afraid that this version has also effectively destroyed any hopes of a real remake of the franchise. Guess its back to reruns and a little 1990's revival on the side for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sniff sniff","review":"I was really disappointed in this film.

The script was loosely wooven and the plot was rushed not allowing any time for humor or theme to develop. Johnny Depp could not save the lack of well written comedy/drama. The movie gave the appearance of being thrown together hoping that star quality would save it. Worst direction I have seen, really murdered Dark Shadows without any farse relief in sight. It goes to show that doing it for the money can do you in. I guess Johnny has lost his feel for art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant Surprise - Depp and Eva Green Romp","review":"While others have offered the storyline aplenty, I wanted to add how Eva Green (remember her skewering of 007 in Casino Royale when they first meet on the train?) demonstrates how a beautiful woman can still be sexy even with her clothes kept on. Her chemistry with Johnny Depp is great, and the two of them are just pure entertainment - she as the witch (Angelique) who still wants to have sex with Barnabas: the man she's been tormenting for 200 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very well done movie","review":"I was at first skeptical expecting only a few laughs from a movie that when looking at the artwork gave me the impression that I could expect it to be a spin off of the Munsters or the Adams Family, but there are so many great scenes & story \\"gotchas\\" that I would even consider watching it many more times just because of how well it is done, the effects are great & the laughs can give you cramps if you have any sense of humor.Kudos!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"I THOUGHT THAT THIS MOVIE WAS TERRIBLY FUNNY AND WOULD RECCOMEND IT TO ANYONE.

I don't think it will ever become the icon that the series has, but it's quirky, interesting and funny at times, and Johnny Depp has proven once again that there really isn't any role that he can't do well.

Nobody really expects much from it. This remake has much better production values (how could it not?) but the writers for the remake have actually come up with a very enjoyable tail about characters that you come to truly care about by the end of the movie. Treat yourself and give it a spin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Tim Burton Film of all time.","review":"When I saw the previews for this I thought it was going to amazingly good, as all of Burton's films are. Yes, I expected the film to be quirky and dark, as they usually are...but this movie was so boring I was actually waiting for it to end. I don't care what anyone says; I grew up watching the Burton movies but this was not one I'll ever be watching again. Not to mention that the plot was everywhere! Also, took my little brother to see this, he's twelve, and there was far too much sexuality in this film for children. If you must watch this with your kids, prepare for some awkward moments."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOOOOOWWWWWWW!","review":"I found myself wondering when the story was going to get going only to realize it was an hour in.

Poorly done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than Expected","review":"I have been really disappointed with the last few Depp/Burton movies.

It starts out very dark and serious, which had me a bit worried. Once the backstory has been told, however, it transformed into an entertaining commedy with an interesting mix of characters. The humor is rather 'dark' (no pun intended), so IMHO this isn't a good movie for kids under 10.

All of the funny lines were used in the movie trailer, so don't expect anything else if you rent it. A lot more could have been done with the plot of this movie; it's a shame they didn't do more with it.

I am a major Dark Shadows (original TV series) fan. The trailer of this looked like it was a total spoof so I've avoided it like the plague. I LOVE Johnny Depp and like a lot of Tim Burton's films. Not all, but, many. This one totally blew my mind. The trailer was a TERRIBLE depiction of the film. It depicted it as an all out comedy which it really doesn't have much comedic elements when you watch the film. I bet the studio decided to package it that way in hopes of selling it as a comedy. The dodos don't get it. Dark Shadows fans are many and true. All they succeeded in doing was warding off the die hard fans, like myself, until fate steps in and they see it as it really is. A tribute to a beloved TV classic. Now it isn't exactly like Dark Shadows either but it is a Dark Shadows I could like and even learn to love. So if you've not given it a try do so, you may be pleasantly surprised!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad.","review":"Got this for my teenage daughter because she is a HUGE fan of Johnny Depp. The movie itself was cute.

We were wrong. The cast is totally wasted here and they all appear to be sleep-walking through their roles. The only one who looks like he's having any fun is Alice Cooper, but he's not on screen for long enough to make any difference.

He returns to his family estate and attempts to free his descendants from the curse set upon his house by his spurned lover (who happened to be a witch).Barnabas encounters all of the new technology as \\"magic,\\" with the expected humorous outcomes. Dark and yet quirky, the film is quite fun, and you develop a sympathy for the vampire and his relatives in escaping the evil punishment.If you are a fan of Tim Burton films, especially those with dark humor like Beetlejuice or the more recent Frankenweenie, you will definitely want to check this film out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Johnny does it again !!!","review":"I guess i could nitpick and find all sorts of things \\"wrong\\" with \\"Dark Shadows\\", but i'll leave that to the hyper-critical, self-appointed \\"authorities\\" on film making, who think they know what the rest will, and should, enjoy. Personally ..... i loved every minute of it. A fresh take on an old favorite, maintaining all the fun and charm of the original.

Not even sure I would be happy to have spent $1.00 at Redbox on it.Based on the previews I was expecting a comedy. While there were a few lines that I didn't see in the previews it definitely wasn't a comedy. It wasn't even frightening. Honestly don't know what to call it except boring. I am reminded of a Brad Paisley video where Shatner comments after Brad questions what he (Shatner) thought of the video. Shatner said \\"I liked the end... when the music stopped.\\". Well I never have seen a movie where I was glad to see the credits. Sadly I had to wake myself up a little just to realize the movie had ended.

I'm a special effect!\\".I found it true to the spirit of the original TV show (which I watched as a kid against my mother's orders) and yet its own creation.The only item I went back and forth upon was Depp's make-up as it was both a send-up of Nosferatu and a bit jarring to the suspension of disbelief.All in all, a good evening's viewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead On Arriival","review":"Will someone tell the folks at Ultraviolet that their format is dead on arrival.

It also was not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated it. :(","review":"I really disliked this movie. I thought it was supposed to be a spoof of the original show. It wasn't funny. It wasn't scary.

Sadly tim burton got a hold of it and make it a sad joke. I was so disappointed. Like Johnny dep but this was bad. ugh... this show was made to be melodrama, little humor sure would be ok. But tim burton is pretty much a joke and shouldnt be doing movies if he is going to cause a show that wasnt made for joking with. Thats what spoof movies are for. He made this into a spoof and thats not what this was supposed to be. Oh that guy needs to do something else. Bad judgment on this movie and someone I talked to expected it to be bad cause of Tim Burton. Owell..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dark shadows","review":"Light and silly but not really funny.

Johnny Depp makes an awesome and quite comical Barnabas. The only downers were that Dr. Julia was not as I remembered her although the new Julia was amusing. One original character left out was Quentin and he was one of my favorites.

Brought current with modern day situations and added a bit more humor; nice touch. There were a few lags but made up for with next dramatic scenes.

Honor the memory of the late Jonathon Frid & buy or rent the original series ( & see the night & day difference in quality compared with Burton's hack job ), the ONE & ONLY Dark Shadows series.

I really like this movie a lot, and will probably buy it. After reading the bad reviews I was hesitant. However, I watched the trailer twice and my gut feeling was that it was right up my alley regardless of what everyone else said. I'm so glad I listened to my gut. I really don't know what people were expecting. The trailer spells it out pretty clearly what kind of movie you're going to be watching, so I don't know how one could be disappointed. The acting was top knotch, and it was very amusing. I guess everyone is so used to the \\"campy\\" movies fad that it either has to be ALL campy or NONE at all to please those people. Oh well, guess there is something for everyone...and this was definitely for me!! Loads of fun...Go on, give it a try :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor story","review":"The movie lacked a plot or at least the execution. It failed to capture my imagination and full attention.

We don't mind campy or less-than-perfect films, as long as they have something to offer. The kindest thing I can say about this disaster is that some of the cinematography was nice. Otherwise, it was a trainwreck. Stay away, even if it's free.

Being a Tim Burton film it had its moments--some interesting visuals, a few fun and/or dark moments--but on the whole it was poorly written and entirely forgettable. Ultra-loyal, die hard Burton fans might find this worth watching. If you're one of those, you know you have to see it. For your average fan like me who's grown up loving most of his films but still doesn't want to waste his time or money on a bad movie, you've been forewarned.

I didn't have high hopes for it but it was a nice story with great actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should we expect more...","review":"Or should Burton have delivered more? The story line is haphazard. The writing is uneven - rarely witty, usually mundane, occasionally just silly. The actors are so terribly self-conscious: \\"Oh, we are cute. Oh, we have diddle-dee-dee cutesy makeup. Oh, we are actually getting paid for this and we'll have a nice party soon as it's over.\\" And worst of all (since I really do think Burton is a very thoughtful film maker), the directing is purposeless. Burton, a talented cast is a terrible thing to waste. But so is an audience.Well, it's not likely Tim Burton will read this, but you might. Save yourself the few dollars.Two stars because it takes place in New England, which I miss more and more as winter approaches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie","review":"This was an excellent movie... at first I was bored but then It got better.

The premise was a fairly funny one at the beginningbut then Barton stuck it in a blender and it became a disjointed mess.Also. All the lady leads could handle a film on there own, But this was estrogenoverload. Plus the only lady who wasn't fawning over Johnny's gentitals was michellepheiffer.

Worth the watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Sleeping Vampires Lie","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the original TV soap opera Dark Shadows. It aired from 1966 to 1971 and was groundbreaking for daytime television. I used to hurry home from school to watch Dark Shadows. It was American Gothic with brooding atmosphere and that famous spooky music. It was not played for laughs.Fast forward to this lame attempt to cash in on Dark Shadow's good name. It should never have happened. Johnny Depp's Barnabus Collins was ridiculous in the white pancake makeup. It was not funny, even though it tried to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than I imagined it would be","review":"The first ten minutes or so of this movie that are set in the 18th century do manage to create some atmosphere. From there it all goes downhill. This movie is worse than I imagined it would be. The humor in it is for the most part dumb and the storyline is lame. For much of the movie it seems like the plot is centered around the rivalry between two fish canneries. Supposedly Tim Burton is a fan of the original show but it sure isn't evident in the way he parodies the characters. The writing is sloppy, one character out of nowhere is revealed in the last 10 minutes to have been a werewolf all along. It comes way out of left field and makes no sense. I found most of this movie boring and uninteresting. A good cast completely wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Shadows","review":"Another great performance by Johnny Depp. Included Depp's humor.

Had high expectations but was hugely disappointed. Very boring storyline that didn't make sense and wasn't the least bit funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this movie. Unimpressive cast including Johnny Depp. It was like he was just walking through the part to just collect a pay check. Maybe I was just expecting too much based on my memories of the original series. Another issue I had was with the quality of download. It kept freezing up and going to a blank screen. I would have to start the movie from the beginning, running it forward and then having to reload again. Over all it was very annoying, a waste of money and a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"So, so BAD","review":"Like a few others, I feel misled by the trailers -- I thought this was going to be a creepy but funny movie, maybe along the thread of Edward Scissorhands. I know nothing of the original TV series, so I have nothing to compare it to and really had no expectations other than that I wanted to enjoy the movie. Unfortunately, this is one of the worst movies I've seen in some time -- we gave it over an hour and could not stand to watch any more of it. It's spooky, but too dull to make it thrilling, and the humor was nothing but a few poor attempts to get a chuckle from the audience. Depp is usually able to disappear into a role, but here I felt like he was just playing dress-up as a vampire. The Depp-Burton combo failed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This film has a great cast, fine locations and the sets are well done.1. This has NOTHING to do with the original TV series except in name. Just a tawdry attempt at attracting viewers.2. The writing is stale. There is nothing original nor funny. Did they spend all their budget on the cast?3. There is little to laugh at. Even Johnny couldn't save this travesty.4. There are more times the audience feels sorry for the actors than they do for the characters.5. Even a laugh track couldn't save this. And if they do add one, RUN!6. The true horror is the waste of one's time watching this mess. Such a lost opportunity and a waste of talent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Flick","review":"Johnny Depp is a perfect Barnabas Collins. Very entertaining with nice throwbacks to the original series. This movie continues the tongue-in-cheek melodrama that was always present in the series: The talk Barnabas has to learn updated \\"courting\\", the gravity-defying love scene, the party with Alice Cooper. This movie won't win awards but is a great way to spend an evening and I definitely got more out of it the second time through. CGI beasties a little off but otherwise great banter and cast chemistry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought","review":"Not as good as I thought it it would be a waste of money I should of just rented it"},{"rating":"1","title":"The best parts were in the previews.","review":"This was not one of Tim Burton's best. Admittedly, I'm not a fan of recent revivals of old films and series that are basically comedic takes on the original subjects. A revived \\"Dark Shadows\\" could be a great series, or even a mini-series (heck, there was a good mini-series a few years back), but you simply can't squeeze anything of consequence from the hundreds of hours of the series into a sub-two-hour movie. Whole parts of the story line just don't make sense. Admittedly, there are a few well delivered lines that will make you chuckle (with Johnny Depp, how could you expect otherwise), but over all, as said in the header of the review, the best parts were in the previews. Stream it for a couple bucks if you're simply curious, but don't expect much. It won't be added to my collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I really wanted to like this movie but I couldn't. Unfortunately, the comedy leaves much to be desired.

I myself, after seeing the trailer for this movie, will never watch it! I was shocked at the way Johnny Depp treated this movie after he professed to have been a fan of the original.

Johnny Depp's Barnabas Collins is hilarious, but still a very sympathetic character. His need to kill seems a sad, little foible. I found myself dismayed and amused by my lack of sympathy for his victims. Sorry, Tim, but I found the only disappointing casting decision (or character concept) to be your usually note perfect spouse, Helena Bonham Carter as Dr. Hoffman, She was frequently humorous, but totally unconvincing.Eve Green was spot on as the evil Angelique, who was always my fav in the original show. She's more beautiful as a brunette, but just as talented as a blonde.I just wish there were a commentary with Tim & Johnny. Since I'm not getting it, I'll throw in Danny Elfman, who did his usual marvelous job on the score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"Funny movie!

Afterwards she complained that it wasn't a good movie. :-/ Sometimes Johnny Depp is great (i.e. Pirates of the Caribbean) - this isn't one of those time. If you are looking for a film that you can zone out to (or watch while reading a more interesting book) and maybe get a couple of mild laughs out of, this is it.

Performances? Meh, okay. Great actors? Yes, most certainly. Storyline that allowed the movie goer something, anything that would make the characters something to care about?

But still a good movie and Johnny Depp's portrayal of Barnabas Collins was really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of nuances to look for","review":"I had no desire to see this when it came out, but on Amazon Prime I watched it 4 times just to catch all the nuances and really enjoyed it overall. The music (70's) and acting were good, but there are several instances of subtle adult humor, so be careful watching with the younger ones or questions may abound. Adults and fans of the \\"Dark Shadows\\" TV series will get a kick out of it, but don't make the mistake of comparing the two. While there are a few overlaps and carry-overs from the series, the movie is a stand-alone interpretation. Tim Burton and Johnny Depp make interesting twists and they've delivered another witty 're-imagining' with \\"Dark Shadows\\". Michelle Pfeiffer, Eva Green, and Helen Bonham Carter play their parts well, too. Watch with an open mind expecting nothing and you won't be disappointed...you may even enjoy it like I did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Movie Sucks.","review":"This Movie Sucks.

I thought it was unncessisarily gory."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Luck Next Time","review":"It's ok but a little disappointing. Tim Burton has a tendency to go too far from the original product on remakes. He did so with Planet of The Apes, which was even a greater disappointment. In his treatment of Dark Shadows, it was too obvious that Barnabas Collins was a creature of the night and no mystery that he was a vampire. Johnny's makeup from the get go was pasty white. Johnny has always picked parts that are off color. That is why I like him, but I was hoping he would have been a little more enigmatic with the character as Jonathan Frid was in the sixties TV soap opera. And maybe that was what was missing from the film. It should have retained a \\"soap opera\\" trait about it. It does seem to be left open for a sequel. Let's just hope if there is one, that it will be more exciting to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"okay","review":"This was a good movie, it was different and we watched it a couple of times and that was enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This a perfect johnny and burton cross!

Mr. Burton,please Try making an original movie with no big actors,especially Johnny Depp(it's enough already!) next time & I might just check it out but I'll pass on anymore of these big,slick overblown Burton ego extravaganzas that have no heart & soul at all,Even if it was just $1.20 @ the redbox."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"Saw this at the theater and wasn't too thrilled. I loved the original show. But this was just okay. I couldn't decide if this was supposed to be a comedy or drama. More comedy would have been great. Or all drama would have been great. But the mixture of the two was not so well done in this movie.

I don't care that they've started to suck of late because I know they were pretty special at one time so I'll forgive them, but maybe this is the closest thing you'll get to seeing Against Me! as what they were because lets face it, if you go to one of their shows these days it'll be in a big venue full of sycophantic faddy kids.

Contrary to the picture, the low relief portions of the seal have been filled with some type of dark enamel to increase contrast. This enamel sticks STRONGLY to wax, resulting in either the enamel coming out on the seal or the wax adhering to seal. Either way it is impossible to get a good impression.2.) The metal used for this seal softens in hot wax, causing the design to distort.This might be a nice piece of costume jewelry, but it is not a wax seal by any stretch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for what it needs to be","review":"This works for me as a pendant, due to it's size and general durability.

You move from task to task with zero exploration of the world. Weapons are gained in an easy and predictable fashion-the graphics are fairly decent, which is why I gave it 2 stars and not 1.....that and it has a fairly amusing story line with cool anime.I would recommend this game to children grades 1 through 6.

They kept the annoying random encounters and made the dungeons even more tedious. Then, they removed any humor or uniqueness in the dialog. They also removed the good music, animated cutscenes and voice acting but I can understand that because of size limits on the GBA.AS a RPG for the DS, it is fine, maybe even above average but if you are looking to pick this up to relive some Lunar nostalgia, DO NOT DO IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jury duty saver","review":"I got this game to try to entertain me while serving on jury duty.

It took me about 17 hours to beat it without any difficulty at all! This is coming for someone who isn't too good at RPGs and immensely struggles completing a Final Fantasy game. Most players won't have any difficulty progressing through the game and you've beaten it before you know it. Some of the nice aspects of this game is that it has a nice plot and good graphics for the GBA. I'd recommend this game for people who are just starting out with RPGs and could pick up this game to gain some confidence in playing this genre. It retails a little lower than an average GBA game so if you're a little low on cash and need an RPG to play, then you might want to consider getting this.

It does not provide a clear method to run in the way they say is best. For example, if you want to learn to swim freestyle, the video \\"Fishlike Freestyle\\" provides a sequence of drills that get you from the point of being a sloppy swimmer to swimming a very nice freestyle. However, if you are a heel strike runner, this video does not provide a realistic way to become a toe strike runner. The only male examples in the video that run \\"correctly\\" are super lean, super fit, top athletes who probably run that way naturally. I would have like to see the video take a normal person who is maybe 15 pound overweight and who is naturally a heel strike runner and effectively turn them into a toe strike runner.

Walters pays attention to science, regarding fuel usage, orbits, orbital mechanics, etc, and doesn't get boring while doing so.At Pluto, the astronauts discover a small natural(?) satellite. It's tidally locked to Pluto, is in a decaying orbit, and has an outrageous gravity gradient. This and other problems affect their mission and return, and the story is quite gripping.My only complaint would be that he leaves us totally hanging, not even having the characters speculate as to the nature of this satellite. A chunk of neutron star? An artificial construct? Either is plausible for the story, but we're left not knowing. Still, for the educated juvenile SF fan, it's a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Life Has Drama, Why Watch on TV?","review":"By chance, all the characters are well-off, attractive people who suffer through drama, immaturity, irresponsibility, and one dimensional personalities. They appear ungrateful and make a big deal about the little things. How can the average young man and woman truly accept these people? The characters of 90210 don't suffer the realities of most Americans. Are they trying to mock the rest of society with their luxurious, CA lives. The apathy and vanity in our society has to end somewhere. You mistakenly slept with him or her, fine, confess and MOVE ON.

There is no chemistry between Zellweger and any of the men she tries to woo, including Kevin Bacon, the bandleader scallawag husband she leaves in a huff.

Jaganmohan - retired Professor from Indian Institute of Technology, Mumbai, India. The English translation flows very smoothly and, so makes the reading very easy. The book mainly describes Russian practises in designing and building steam turbines that was being followed during late 1950s and 1960s. The units used in the book are Metric (and not SI). The book describes both the theoretical principles and the construction details. But, let us be realistic - the fundamental principles of steam turbines have not really changed since the time of writing the book. So, the book is still relevant even today. The book is quite well illustrated. The book used to be used as a textbook for Graduate classes on Turbomachinery at IIT Mumbai. But, I am of the opinion that the book will be more useful for a practising Engineer than for a College Graduate student."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good book.

I had paid $7 in shipping when I ordered this item, I then got a postcard from the post office the shipping is due, apparently, the vendor did not pay the proper amount of shipping, so I had to pay an extra $7 to pick up the item. I emailed the vendor and they said they will reimburse me for the shipping, but I never saw the money.The item did not work out and I ended up paying $11 to ship it back. The vendor refunded me the $$, less the shipping I paid and they didn't. So, I'm out $25 for shipping and the item was $24. It's not worth the hassle for me to get my $7 back.

It will still charge my iPod if I plug it in, but will not turn on to play music whether plugged into the wall or running off of batteries. While it was working, it sounded good (although I had a popping noise in-between songs with the video 30) and was so easy to take to work on casual day for tunes. I am disappointed it stopped working so quickly though. It isn't like it was carried everywhere or abused. It was transported in it's carrying case within a totebag once a week.

Not much bass at higher volumes, but what do you expect. The one star, however, is for the ridiculous price hike on this item. I bought this exact item three months ago for $36. And no, I'm not mixing up models; I got to this page by clicking the item name in the old order after I went to check the price. At $36, this was a fantastic deal, and an absolute no-brainer best available for the price. Up near $100, it starts to have a lot of company.

I'm sorry to say that these speakers have an annoying hiss that can be heard between songs, and if you are listening to music quietly it can be heard over the music.

Most of the time these concert DVD's are not particularly well filmed, but this one is. There is some startling split screen effects and excellent camera work, which is something one doesn't normally associate with stuff like this. The crowd is really appreciative of the band (Strapping Young Lad recorded this in Vancouver, their home base), and their drummer is phenomenal. He's a really big guy, yet he has incredible dexterity for a man of his size. He also mugs a bit for the camera, and it's very funny. This was my first experience with Canadian thrash metal.

Both the fundamental problematic of the Scholastic--to unite the deliverances of faith and reason, in accordance with the motto \\"Credo ut intelligam\\"--and the attempts of different philosophers to carry out this project are detailed and explained clearly and in simple language.

For one thing, Margaret does not appear until Chapter 9, and the beginning chapters could be condensed into 2 or 3 snappy chapters. Margaret has no redeeming qualitites to engage a reader much less an animal family, and the description of her selfish, slovenly habits becomes tedious rather than funny. One wonders why her human family would miss her and, further yet, change for the better as a result of her absence. Although Margaret redeems herself slightly in the next to last chapter, by then it is hard to care. The one totally delightful aspect of this book is the art work of Jon Agee. However, the charming art cannot atone for the disappointment of a book purchased with high hopes as a read-aloud to second and third graders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an 'hour' glass","review":"Mine takes a little over 4 minutes for the sand to run through.

It's also good to have all the songs from both versions of \\"Bedsitter Images\\", which at some point was reisssued with a few tracks changed.BUT...

Bad isn't quite the right word, since the animation's cool -- but the storytelling is often really cheesy, verging into the preposterous (look, a rice farmer might attack an ordinary bandit with a sickle; he probably wouldn't attack one of three 50-foot-tall mecha bandits standing in his field, who kills him with a GIANT SWORD instead of a gun [the robot might, admittedly, \\"not want to waste the powder\\"]).

They ship in a cheap clear vinyl divided pouch and with the black plastic stand shown in the photo. The stand is riveted to the clear vinyl pouch where you are supposed to use screws to screw the stand to a bench or shelf. When I tried to remove it, one of the posts on the black plastic stand broke so I can only mount the stand with one screw. I could blame myself for that breakage, but the posts are pretty flimsy, and the rivets used were crazy strong.The stand itself is not in the same class as the wrenches. Pretty thin plastic. Also, the stand is pretty large, I'd estimate 6 inches wide and 10 inches deep. Certainly larger than I expected.Overall love the wrenches, hate the stand.

So, when his book on myth and language came to my attention, I was familiar with the author and his reputation. I have not read the professional critiques on this work, but my personal opinion is that it is unique in every respect. I have not seen anything else that parallels the growth of myth (religion) and language as this does, nor have I seen anything that deals as effectively with the idea of epistemology that is quite apart from that of science and inductive probabilities.

One criticism is that recruiting is too hard, players will say they are going to play with your team and ten sign for Duke or someone else like that. For sheer sports management simulation this is the best game in the basketball genre!! Although as management sims go not in the same league as CHamp Manager, or even High heat baseball.I haven't played many basketball games to compare with but NCAA 2k3 looks to hold up with most of the best ones although the graphics are a little generic as they are not allowed ot use real likenesses"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I havn't watched the The Upturned Glass yet.

This story is the first in which the Doctor appears without a regular companion, and it goes a long way to establish what we know about the Doctor's home planet. For some people, this made the Time Lords real, for others it ruined the concept.The story depicts the Time Lords as a very political, short-sited group. Their President is assassinated, and it appears that the Doctor is responsible. The Doctor is, more or less, assisted by his old teacher, Cardinal Borusa, who plays a substantial role in the background. This relationship between former teacher and pupil is central to several later stories.This story also sees the return of...

The rivets on the acrylic windows gave out and they have to be glued sometimes, but make sure you don't use superglue if they do because it leaves a white chalky looking mark. Use locktite flexible waterproof stuff...very good and still cheap glue. Don't trust the handle to hold your PC when you have it completed. It will bow and that scared me, lol. I supported it with my hand when I used it. Otherwise, good price, and trick case!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what I wanted it for","review":"I wanted this chassis as a demo chassis to show how the device looks on the inside, and even bought glow-cables for the SATA drives and internal LEDS in red, green, and blue to make it look festive, kinda like gamers light up their chassis. The construction is a little flimsy, and a little hard to install the drives (it can hold up to 5). It allows for extra fans (I installed two) and the front panel LCD indicator is a little hard to read, but it does the job. I am planning another device soon, maybe with a different form factor to take more drives. This one may end up being converted to a carry-around system (the chassis has a handle!) for on-site development where a laptop is not suitable. Still, it presented interesting possibilities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this case","review":"Terrible product. Shoddy construction, badly fitting. It looks good, but then what do a lot of bad deals use to reel you in? I never used the handle, too flimsy. A fully loaded mobo, a hd, and a light drive seemed to weigh much more than that thin little handle could deal with in my opinion. And the see thru plastic sides are just pinned to the frames with thin plastic \\"bolts\\", or pins, whatever. One good jolt and one of them came right apart. I bought this thinking it would make a decent gaming rig- NOT HARDLY. It was just one step above paper mache in strength. If you just want a static machine and don't mind rather badly fitting framing & hardware, then I guess this is the case for you. If you like durability in a SFF, get a Lian Li."},{"rating":"2","title":"great PC case.","review":"I purchased this when I wanted to build a home DVR system.

What remains, making up about half the book, are snippets of wisdom collected from Nouwen's corpus.

Its theme of a mother of three who expresses her happy and her depressed side is brilliant. Its twists and turns arise as those closest to her change her life; some for the better, some for the worse. Such unique theme offers higher entertainment value to the audience. Its combination of free spirit and destruction keeps every scene interesting. Its every risque scene earns the producers tremendous repect despite difference in nudity opinions between the US and Italy. Valeria Golino(\\"Frida\\") shines in her lead role as the mother of three. Her heart and soul poured into this movie fits the movie theme perfectly. So far, this is one of her career bests. She proves in this movie that she'll be a big-name actress in the near future.

We don't do that with another knife (regretted it when we have), but these can take it. The knives are well-designed for function, comfortable to handle, strong, & sharp.We love them and gave sets to our adult kids who always are commenting on how useful they are.

The talent in his versitility and determination makes me happy. The songs touch my heart and it makes me want to dance (which you don't want to see, I'm a pathetic dancer). I say we go into every house in America, rip out any music that isn't rock and put in this Elvis album. If we did this, everyone would realize that this is the greatest music there ever was. All music started going down hill when rap started becming popular. Rock never died, it just hid for a while, I say we need more rock bands, but it may not happen.

You also get JXL's remix of \\"A Little Less Conversation,\\" which hit #1 in the U.K. this summer. The booklet insert talks about each song and when it was released. And then in the back, it lists facts about the songs, saying it's peak position in the United States & Britain and when it was recorded.\\"Elv1s 30 #1 Hits\\" covers Elvis Presley's career wonderfully and is a great album to own if you've been a long time fan of his, or are a new lover of the King of Rock 'n Roll, like myself.

So how did the label come up with 13 additional songs? The 1987 compilation only featured the famous songs. The new compilers have used the major pop charts in both the U.S and U.K. to determine inclusions. The tracks have all been remixed from original masters. Elvis has never sounded better. The voice is crisp and clear, not the distorted version. One can hear the little details in the songs, such as a guitar lick or a piano sound that are more prominent than before.

And being an audio DVD (with no video and no menu) it won't play in ANY of my CD players - not my home CD players and not my car CD player. So I get to listen to Elvis through my tinny TV speakers with no way to select certain songs. Also there are two songs that the audio drops on for about 30 seconds. I ONLY give it two stars because it's Elvis. Sorry Amazon, you dropped the ball on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoever remixed this should be shot!","review":"The music is great, it's what's been done to it I take issue with. All the latest technology has been used to \\"improve\\" the original tapes. Unfortunately they've been digitized, remixed and doused in noise reduction. So, now it all sounds sanitized, sterile and has been rendered inert and lifeless. \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" is yet another attempt to \\"modernize\\" Elvis. The first time was on the early '80's release \\"I Was The One\\" where some of his greatest rockabilly performances were defaced by modern overdubs to make them sound \\"contemporary\\". I don't want Elvis transported to the 21st century. When I listen to Elvis I want to be transported to '56-7 or '60 or '69. If you want good sounding Elvis, try to track down DCC's \\"24 Karat Hits\\". No \\"modern\\" studio trickery, just good old fashioned tube mojo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where is, I want you, I need you, I love you?","review":"On June 2nd 1956 Billboard top 40 hits listed I want you, I need you, I love you as Number One.

These are all great songs, but if you are going to call it #1's. You should at the very least have all of the number 1's first. Then add the others. Don't Y'all think so?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Solid Compliation of Elvis's Hits..........","review":"I bought this CD last week and I was very impressed with the selection of songs as well as the sequence. Its very well put together in terms of fast, slow, mid tempo and all kinds of numbers that showcased Elvis eclectic style. I wont say its the absolute definitive Elvis Album because it doesnt include most of his very early work from Sun Studios. However, this has all the best known and best loved Elvis songs put together in a very fine package. The bonus track at the end: \\"A little less conversation\\", adds flavor and shows that Elvis's is a timeless voice that will last forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ELVIS COLLECTION!!","review":"I absolutely love this collection of Elvis songs!

Since that, I've played little else at home. All of the songs are remastered so clearly that they sound as if they were recorded today!

I bought the CD for the \\"A little less conversation mix\\" which I had heard on the Nike TV soccer commercial, but the quality of the work they did to the recording of this CD is great, you can't help feel like dancing, \\"heartbreak hotel\\", \\"don't be cruel\\", and some many other great songs, with great CD quality. On top of that is a selection of 30 of the greatest songs from the King. But it, you won't regret it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Elvis Collection Ever!","review":"Elvis 30 #1 Hits is quite simply the greatest Elvis collection ever. The sound quality is startling, and especially so when you listen to his early hits. This collection, which is in chronological order, begins with \\"Heartbreak Hotel, and ends with the surprise hit \\"A Little Less Conversation\\", which was actually recorded by Elvis in 1968, but was re-mixed. The last song here, which was recorded by Elvis just 8 months before his death, is \\"Way Down\\" and shows The King still \\"had it\\" even near the end. In an era of so-so music, \\"Elvis 30 #1 Hits\\" is a breath of fresh air, and reminds us of what real talent is. I would highly recommend this to even the most casual Elvis fan.

It sounds tinny and hollow to me. It seems they put \\"the King\\" front and center, and left the band behind. His voice is clear and loud, but the music is way in the background, and in some places you can barely hear the band. I'm no re-master expert, but I can tell when something sounds out of proportion. Pass on this one. I would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice quick fix","review":"This CD, like The Beatles 1, is a nice quick fix for Elvis fans who are in the mood for some good music from Elvis. If you're looking for 1 CD that has a lot of favorite hits and 1 new remix of an old song of his, then this is definitely the CD for you. I like to pull this CD out when I'm in the mood for some Elvis with out a lot of the movie tunes, and more of just the hits. If you like The Beatles and Elvis, and occasionally want to only hear the hits, then this CD is for your Elvis fix and above mentioned Beatles CD is your quick fix for them. Both CD's are very similar in the way they were put together to allow the fan to hear the number 1's and top 10's of these 2 pioneers in R&R."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Re-Mastering ever done","review":"This CD is the absolute best remastering of an Elvis CD that I've ever heard.

But his decisive step to the great screen allowed him even to get a major audience overseas.His status as star reached a coveted place into we might say the popular imagination and an undeniable icon of the popular mythology.This is a well deserved homage and heartfelt tribute to his memory precisely today, when we remind him thirty years before his sad departure."},{"rating":"2","title":"HUH?","review":"I guess every one is entitled to his own opinion. Whether it's Chuck Berry or Carl Perkins or whoever?? Elvis brought the music to the mainstream audience. Without Elvis, Little Richard and Chuck Berry would be underground legends and we'd be praising Pat Boone's 30 greatest hits right now. As far as the CD goes, yes these tunes can be found on other CD's, but they are not mixed on other CD's as well, or as hot as they are on here. New life has been given to every single song and it's actually a pleasure to hear Hound Dog all over again. I am a Beatles fan as well. I'd have to say that this compilation by far blows away Beatles 1. It is obvious in listening to both CD's which one was given the treatment that only a King should have. This CD will someday be called the greatest Rock and Roll album of our time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish and dated","review":"Elvis was never the king of rock and roll.

As a literary work it is probably only worth 3 and 1/2 stars, at best. But I think its real importance is in how it reflects the military's view of the war through the Tet offensive. Its importance becomes clear about when you compare the overall tone of the book towards the Vietnam war with Stephen Coonts' book Flight of the Intruder. The aviators in that book hold a very different attitude towards the war.From what I learned during the late 70's and early 80's while working with Naval Officers, both books are authentic, especially in the attitudes reflected by the military. For people who want to understand the Vietnam war and the effect of the civilian leadership on the military during this time, I strongly encourage you to read both books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"I first read this book when I was sixteen and it was one the big things that helped me decide to join the military.

When pointing at bright things however, more glare shows up than usual. Little advice, pick up a microfiber cloth for the lens.

For a reference piece it's a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Just like a recent reviewer, I am not happy about this book. It is far too wordy for its own good. And I find it very annoying that all examples use UK Imperial measures. Often the metric equivalent is provided as well, but typically not for the constants. The author does not even know the metric system. He claims that the unit of measure is centimetre and not metre."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best calculus book.","review":"Very thorough and extremely well worded and as an added bonus I think it's typeset very elegantly with beautiful diagrams. This is unquestionably the best book on Calculus I've ever come across, Morris Kline was a master teacher. I'd pay $200 for it and yet it's only $16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Execellent, [Affordable] and really teaches calculus","review":"This book doesn't have all those eye catching color visuals, but what makes this book great is its content and way of explaining concepts of calculus. There's a lot of reading which might seem cumbersome at first glance, but ultimately it's worth every second spent on reading. In many calculus book I've seen, there's a theorem, proof of theorem sometime, few examples and then exercise. This book more emphasizes more on discussing theorems and different concepts, proofs of theorems and why, how they work. The book is not very rich in examples, but once you get the concept, you'll be able to do any example. Also the examples that are given, explained thoroughly. So except for the quantity of examples, I have nothing else to complain. Thanks to Doverpublications for making such book affordable ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for experienced trainers","review":"I made the mistake of thinking this book would contain some advanced training techniques. Boy was I wrong...I was very disappointed. It would be a good book for beginners just getting into training more than basic obedience.

Consider carefully before purchasing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Dreadful...avoid at all costs!","review":"My husband was given this book during our pregnancy and as he read from it aloud, we both quickly realized that it was extremely negative. Instead of encouraging fathers to bond with the baby for positive reasons, the writer suggests that most marriages end in divorce so fathers should bond with the child while they can!! The writer is also very negative about the pregnant woman's experience and gives the father advice on how to 'cope' with this dreadful experience. We both put the book down very quickly as it seems to be written for men who want to get through the whole process as if it is a dreaded trip to the dentist.

From the start this briskly written, intricately crafted audio movie takes hold and won't let go. It is a richly textured audio experience full of music, sound effects and a variety of colorful characters which allow the listener to clearly visualize the action and the drama as it unfolds. Full of humor, clever twists, colorful language and cool style this audio experience is best experienced in its entirety--and once you start listening you won't be able to stop!

With James, Rushford, co-authors a series called the McAllister Files, which center around detective Mac McAllister. I just read She Who Watches and was quite impressed with it. Mac and his partner, Dana, start working on a missing persons case which turns into a homicide investigation with possible Native American ties. The characters are fascinating and lend lots of great moments to the book, as well as the plot, which keeps you guessing throughout. This is a later book in the series, but the books chronicle Mac's spiritual growth as well as his homicide cases.

I've only had it a short time but can tell it's better already. The company is fast in shipping, and it was FREE shipping. I got it in less then a week. I am a good size person and so far I give it 5 stars and hope it stays that way. I do like that it's not a fold up one. All I had to do was put the legs on. To store it, just roll it into a closet, or under a bed.

Recently I bought a Loctite epoxy that was designed to be used with plastic. The glue never hardened... even after 24 hours! It remained a gooey mess. The process of cleaning up the soft glue created a huge mess because it stuck to everything it touched. You are probably wondering why I bought 4 or 5 bottles of this stuff before I finally learned my lesson. Well, the stores in my area carry the Loctite brand and they don't carry much else.

If you want to see Texas and Texans unfairly judged you'll like this book. The author, surprisingly, holds the J. Frank Dobie chair at the University of Texas. But Dobie obviously loved Texas. Graham obviously doesn't. For folks who have read other books on south Texas and the King Ranch, Graham adds nothing new and much to be forgotten. In addition to wading through the politically correct platitudes, the writing is simply poor - it reads more like a sophomore research paper than a professional history. Phrases like \\"Such was the attitude of _______\\" are so overused I finally had to quit reading this thing.No thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kings of Texas","review":"It's probably not the books fault, but when I ordered it I thought I was getting a book totally about the King Ranch founders of yesteryear & all the history regarding the family up until todays time.

The author devotes nine pages to Bob Kleberg's forty-odd year reign as the King Ranch dictator and scarcely mentions several other prominent and important figures in the ranch's history. Like Gone With the Wind without mentioning the Civil War. The author's research and writing on Capt. King's early years and the history of South Texas is very well done. Similarly, the treatment of the Chapman/King Ranch dispute is quite entertaining. Other than the current status of the Chapman lawsuit, the discussion of King Ranch in the present is nothing more than a brief postcard from the author's obviously quick and unfruitful trip to the edge of the King Ranch property line. If Mr. Graham had entitled the book 'Chapman v. King Ranch - a War With 125 Years Between Battles' I may have not been so disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kings of Texas","review":"The worst book on King Ranch I've ever read. Not very interesting, does not hold your attention. If you aren't paying close attention, you'll read right over when Capt. King dies. One sentence. It just slips up on you. You can tell this guy is a liberal academe with an agenda. You get to read more anti-King & Kleberg bull than is necessary. This book is more about anti-capitalism & racism then anything. Anti-white as usual. Of course there wasn't any Mexican racism this guy saw to much. I don't believe he was fair on both sides. He doesn't really grasp the history of that area & what one had to go thru to establish oneself. Also, his dislike of the Texas Rangers was throughout the book. This is typical revisionist history & not recommended to getting a balanced view of this magnificent family & history of that area."},{"rating":"2","title":"This record is the BOMB!!","review":"August Christopher is the best live rock band in the world, and the CD rocks to!

The grits are smooth and consistent and have a long life due to reasonable wear.The only issue that is below premium is the overlapping glue joint. While I have only used the 80, 120, 220 grits, they all have the same higher than normal glue joints where the belt is connected to itself. This tends to make for a bumpy sanding action while on the sander, but the back side of the belt is very smooth so the sander continues to move at a consistent rate providing good results.Use of the belts with Pine, Red Oak, Birch, Hickory and hardboard has shown that the belt provides an expected performance of not loading up resulting in longer times between belt changes."},{"rating":"1","title":"here he goes again.","review":"This is a terrible book.

How about some no-slip pads of some sort?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical Henkels quality","review":"The first time I used the board I was impressed, seemed like solid construction, the rubber feet were a nice touch.

This is an update of my previous (first impression) of this product. Previous \\"5 Star\\" review was as follows:I have to say I really like this board.

This is one of the worst antennas I've used. Probably passable for analog signals, it really is not very good for digital signals at all.

But after 3 months the seam down the center had split wide open. I tried to tape it together but it was a loosing battle as additional spits developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"This game is great for the thinking minds. The logics are well-thought out and the game is surprisingly fun for a point and click adventure. You are given a vast amount of land to explore and occasional environmental objects to interact with. You meet (real Capri's) villagers once in a while. This gives the game a very nice touch and enhances the realism of the exploration. It was nice to include both English and Italian voices. The reason this game can disappoint is that in the beginning it's hard and a bit confusing. But once you get into the game it is very challenging and I really enjoyed it. Patience is the key with this game, if you are not the patient type this isn't the game for you. The concept is intriguing. Scenery of Capri is simply breathtaking. All through the game, you could feel playing the game. Overall, Capri is simple and organic, It's worth buying it for the scenery, logics and the surprisingly good non-linear game-play."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Quiet Weekend Spent-Doing-Absolutely-Nothing in Capri...","review":"Well...I wanted to like this game. I am incredibly patient with games, I like a nice quiet adventure, I still enjoy text games--I even got all the way through \\"Riddle of the Sphinx\\" without a walkthrough. But this game takes the cake for boring. In a nutshell, this is a slideshow of pictures of the Island of Capri, with no animation, very tiny hotspots, scattered dialogue from 'characters' whose lips do not move (one amusing moment was hearing a dog bark and seeing, you guessed it, a picture of a dog!), narrow storyline and convoluted mapping. I'll admit I didn't finish it, but after spending literally 5 hours trying to find something to do, I wanted my weekend back. Maybe some may like it, but to me Myst is like an edge-of-your-seat thriller in comparison. I'll go play Shivers again or buy the latest Dreamcatcher instead. Good thing I only spend $3 on it at a garage sale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily the worst game you'll ever pay $20 for.","review":"You remember the last time one of your friends had you over to look at the pictures from their vacation? Well, this is the video game equivalent.A Quite Weekend In Capri is nothing more than thousands and thousands of rather lackluster photos that could have been taken by any amateur photographer. There really isn't any game here... at least not that I found during the hour of time I wasted.If clicking endlessly through pictures is your idea of fun, this is the game for you. If you're looking for an immersive world similar to Myst, keep looking.I can't believe this game is sold in major retail outlets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I bought this game because of the glowing reviews that Just Adventure.com and Quandaryland.com gave this game.I am so disappointed.Boring point and click through stacks of photographs of Capri.Challenging gameplay and wonderful music?i think not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Primative and boring...","review":"I awaited this game's release with great enthusiasm based on the reviews but upon installing couldn't believe the primitive interface and was actually shocked that the game was full of photos of Capri. Yes, photos; your interaction is with still photos of people, places and things. You must click, click, click photo after photo. And, good luck in finding the cursor to proceed; I had to move the cursor in circles around the screen trying to find the hotspot. I didn't even care to continue this game to find out if there was a story somewhere in the cobbled streets of Capri. I do hope this is not going to be the future of adventure games. Needless to say, I uninstalled this game and will be wary of buying any more games from GOT Game again....."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Lousy horrible game that.........SUCKSSSSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!","review":"I never write any reviews online. Thought I have to do so to save other people from buying this horrible game......basically the game is 2D and not 3D.....just a slide show of low resolution photograhs of island Capri....any rookie can take better pics than those......there is no story and consequently there is no game...icons need to be more professionally displayed as they needed an adult to draw them......you might see on the game pack \\"THEY ARE FOLLOWING YOU....\\" I have no idea who the heck are those following me.....game is so lame and bland and it stops when you stop clicking the mouse without any idea why you do so...........the map they give you needs another map to figure out what's in there.......you just see pics of people with some recorded messages that only reminds me of the TOEFL test..........in summary....please DO NOT BUY THIS GAMe and if you did.........throw it away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Pictures but...","review":"If your looking for a point and click game with pretty pictures, this game would be for you. I was drawn to this game because the reviewers compared it to myst. Myst is so much better, a real game while this is like a slideshow with a few puzzles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should get 0 stars, but not an option","review":"I was drawn to this game by one thing, and it turned out to be FAR from the truth, in my opinion. The Box says \\"think Myst but in a real location\\" not only does it not even compare to Myst in any way, but I found it boring, tedious, and pointless, and after 2 days of wandering aimlessly through it and having no fun at all, I uninstalled it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Capri!","review":"I enjoyed this game and played it twice. I just got back from a vacation in Italy. On our tour we spent a day in Capri and Anacapri. I felt that I actually had been there because the streets were the same, the names of the streets and the hotels and buildings. I knew where I was going because of this game. I even went to the newsstand and the lady was working there that had appeared in the game. I guess they actually used the people on the island to make this game. I even took her picture. This is a very relaxing game and the first one I had played with actual scenery and streets that you could walk anywhere. I loved the game."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"I usually agree with most reviews posted here. So when I saw all the positive reviews I thought I would give this game a shot. BIG MISTAKE...it has got to be the most horrible game ever made!!! Sure the scenery was pretty...if that is all I cared about Id buy some postcards. All you do is randomly click in this idiotic interface, it's not in English..and its just plain boring and horrible. I think I tried to play it for an hour and can't make myself turn it on again. I can't even sell it because I would be embarassed to take money for it. THis game is the only game I ever bought that went straight from the computer to the trash!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope, no good at all.","review":"The whole game (which truly is a series of photographs) depends on your being able to read the map. And it is illegible. I really tried, having read all these glowing reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously?","review":"Point A) They are not graphics, they're photos.Point B) They are pasted together in what is quite possibly the most pathethic, feeble, and lame excuse for an interface you will ever seen in a game. Some of the icons look like they were drawn by a fifth grader. Maybe a fourth grader. Depends.Point C) A \\"game\\" is not fun if you spend too much time wandering around being lost with little guidance about what you are supposed to do next.Point D) Do yourself a favor, if you've made the mistake of buying this game, just take the \\"tour\\" option that the game gives you, walk around for a while and see the pictures, and then throw the whole thing out.Point E) If you haven't bought the game, go watch videos about the island of Capri on YouTube (or wherever), and you'll be much better off.Point F) It is this kind of dreck that has killed the adventure game genre.Point G) Seriously. The only well designed thing about the game is the box it comes in. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A most horrible game","review":"This game is pieced together from digital photos taken on the island of Capri. The island is a beautiful place and perhaps it is worth the price simply to wander its roads and trails in this photo format. However, after you have walked everywhere and picked up all the obvious 'clues' you honestly do not have a clue what you are suppose to be doing! I must admit that I did not solve anything that I would consider a puzzle before I quit playing out of boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is really this bad.","review":"Okay, I never do this, but I had to because this game is just that bad. The ONLY reason I gave it two stars is because at least the pictures are good, graphically. But that's it. I didn't even continue to play this game because it was just too awful. It's great if you don't like 3-D game play, but for those of us who like true adventure games, like Myst, Syberia and the like, are just going to be bored senseless. Anyway, if you want a \\"true\\" adventure game, I don't think this is what you are looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful travel brochure, not much game","review":"This game makes use of a large number of pictures of the the very beautiful island of Capri. On the other hand, you can find many pictures of Capri on the Web, so I assume that you are looking for a game as well. I don't recommend this one. The game is a series of these pictures, with a fairly linear story. The story is rather incomprehensible at first, and then once you begin to figure it out, it still feels rather pedestrian rather than adventurous. You wander through the streets but actually only run into people on rare occasions. When they do talk to you, it is rather contrived and clunky, without any animation. You have rather limited choices of actions, but you are free to wander the island aimlessly. The map tool provided is not the easiest to read, the resolution isn't as high as it could be. We did not complete the game because we rapidly lost interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Terrible, Terribly Awful, Do Not Buy!!","review":"Again, an interesting concept that just doesn't work well. This game is like looking at someone's lousy and boring photo collection of their trip to Capri. I sold this game back to a store for a fraction of what I paid for it. It really sucks. Another case of intriguing packaging hiding a very lame product. Oh well...live and learn!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful photos...but","review":"For some reason I thought this game was a 3-d immersive game...not a series of snapshots. If you want a set of photos of Capri, buy this. If you're looking for an adventure...look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slow paced game","review":"I have been looking for a good puzzle game to play. I decided to buy a copy of Capri. I found this game very intriguing. It has a Myst flavour, but puzzles sound somehow more realistic. If you like puzzle adventures you will surely like this game. Sometimes the game was a bit tiresome and repetitive but it was fine with me.I realize some folks may not be into the slow paced \\"exploration\\" style of gameplay, but if you want to learn more about Capri and like puzzle adventure games, this is the game for you. $20 are well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little gem","review":"I was skeptical when I heard about this game. An adventure game set in Capri? But this little gem has more than exceeded my expectations. Challenging, mind-stimulating puzzles set in a beautiful scenery... this game is not for people who can't deal with a challenge. The game play is fine but it has some flaws. Too much walking. But overall it's a breath of fresh air compared to other games!Overall rate: 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"I'm not quite sure how well I can do an objective review. It's hard to convince anyone about getting a game. But this game really deserves my appreciation. The graphics are really breath taking and it will not disappoint you. The music is nicely done, fulfills its function well and as a background for the game sceneries is good. Dialogues are in English with subtitles or in Italian with English subtitles. I liked the second option better. This game has a great ambience sound which allows you to soak through the atmosphere of the game. You won't be just an observer, but become the part of it. I highly recommend the island's tour option. It's very useful if you plan to visit Capri in the future. I've read great reviews about this game (Game Chronicles, Just Adventure etc...). Review is subjective thing but I agree with those. This game creates a new standard upon many games will be judged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immersive game.","review":"I found this game much more immersive than most other games. Turn down the lights and you are in this Mediterranean paradise!The environmental audio is immersive and the gameplay is captivating. I was noticing some cool sound effects (sounds that I don't think I've heard in other games). I was sceptical when I heard that Got Game was going to deliver a game set in Capri, but the game has more than exceeded my expectations. Some of the puzzles are rather wacky, but overall well designed. They are not too tough, so most people should be able to figure them out. The storyline of the game is a little strange but that doesn't really impact the fun you will have playing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't really like it","review":"This game is all about the scenery. The photos are beautiful but all you seem to do is walk, walk, walk. I should have known that I was doomed to disappointment when I saw the simplistic graphics on the opening screen.

The style is a little hard to put your finger on. You've got blues, blues-rock, R&B, jazz, and rock influences, and sometimes all in the same song (\\"Don't Deny Your Love\\"). \\"Indianola\\" is a rip-roaring celebration of the guitar that sounds great cranked up while you're rolling down the highway. \\"Something For The Pain\\" may just be the perfect rock-steady blues anthem.

Although the pieces are by and large well finished, some of the ends are rough-hewn which would appear to be a manufacturing defect. No splinters, just slightly unaesthetic.

It cut things well but the lock locks too easily, without something even touching it, so it had to be unlocked multiple times during use. Safety is nice,but that is just annoying.The biggest problem is the coil/spring is NOT stainless-steel so the inside of it rusts, even if you take it apart for each washing. Once it gets rusty it becomes very very difficult to close the shears, making cutting a real pain, literally. I soak the spring regularly in rust remover but I can not use it for more than a single piece now without horrible aches in my hand.My prior shears lasted for 10 years, but these I need to replace after a couple of months..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manufacturer's Warranty","review":"Anyone with any rust issues should contact Henckels from their website and get a replacement.

And yet, thanks to the spring mechanism, these particular shears are problematic. First and foremost, the spring will rust and seize up, which leads to stiffness in the mechanism. Next, the locking mechanism will either be too hard to engage (and sometimes unlock), or too easy (locking while cutting). Finally, the plastic nubs that secure the metal spring are weak and will break. These shears lasted a year or two for me being used several times per week. I guess that's not too bad... except my mother has kitchen shears that she bought 15 years ago, and they're just as good as the day they were purchased. These degraded over time and became a frustration to work with. Avoid these like the plague.

I have small hands and arthritis and the handles are so big they are really hard to get a good hold on them. The button that locks them is difficult to lock and unlock.

When I have used it for sleeping I wake up with a sore abdomen, because the wedge is hard. I also have a snoogle pillow, and find that it works better alone, instead combined with the wedge. I hope the manufacturer will improve upon this wedge by making it with a material more like memory foam, which would make it softer, but still supportive.

I just wish I had tried it earlier!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love my Boppy!","review":"I bought this pillow at the start of my sixth month and am very happy with it. It's perfect for sleeping on my side, but also works well in the small of my back for lumbar support. It's small enough that it doesn't take up too much room in bed and I've also fit it in a small suitcase when traveling (I wouldn't dream of spending the night without it.) I've been using it for over a month now and it is breaking down a little bit, but still provides great comfort. I've already gotten my $15 out of it and I still have 12 weeks to go!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pillow is better","review":"This only provides basic to support to the very side of the belly, nothing to help with the rest or the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype.","review":"There is nothing WRONG with this cheap, little pillow... except it's so flimsy that it ends up wedging under my husband or lost somewhere under the blankets. I'm glad so many people had success with it. I just felt it was too small to do anything worthwhile. I've had it since early in my pregnancy and tried it at many different stages and truly everywhere I could think to try it around my body. Now I'm in the last 3 weeks and I need something under my belly and this this still doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard!","review":"I was going to order one of these but ended up finding one still in the package at the thrift store. I'm really glad I didn't pay full price for it because it's way too hard to sleep with. I've had it since about 5 months and now I'm 8 months and having major sleep issues again. The only way it's of any use is to put it under your back if you have another pillow under your tummy. It's just not comfortable though and I end up ditching it for a regular pillow after about 10 minutes. It's not a pillow it's a hunk of very firm foam."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little pillow","review":"I love this pillow. I didn't want to order a big body pillow. I am a back sleeper and switch sides a lot at night. I ended up buying two of these little pillows. I put one under my belly and the other one behind my back. This allows me to switch from my left side to my ride side without adjusting the pillows. It also allows me to sleep on my back and get the little side lift which you need. The Carex Knee Pillow goes great with the wedge pillow and saved from buying an enormous sleeping pillow."},{"rating":"2","title":"as a gift","review":"I bought the Boppy pregnancy wedge as a gift for a friend's wife. After looking at reviews for other products, this pillow seemed to get the best reviews, so I bought it. My friend's wife said that it's a very good pillow and is very helpful. She wasn't thinking that she'd need the support yet, but once she started using the pillow, she mentioned feeling much more comfortable at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple is sometimes best","review":"The wedge was the perfect amount of support for my bulging belly. I am an averaged sized person (5'7\\" and started pregnancy at 160) and gained 30 lb during pregnancy. It was the perfect size to take the pressure off of my back while not taking up room in the bed. Yes, you need other regular pillows to organize your comfort, namely something between your legs, one behind your back if you tend to roll over and your pillows under your head. Some people complained that the wedge flattens out, however I found that the small amount that it flattened at the narrow edge was actually beneficial to contouring to my body. I think you'd have to be pretty large for this to be an issue. As you can tell from my stats, I'm no shrinking violet and this product held up to my weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Money","review":"Not at all worth it. I bought this pillow about 5 months into my pregnancy because my back was hurting at night. It did NO good and just got in my way! I went to Target and bought a temperpudic (sp) pillow that worked perfectly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works wonders!","review":"It does not look like much, but it really has helped me get comfortable on my side and sleep more soundly. I am so much happier going to bed now, where before I would dread having to get comfortable. I've used it every night since I've gotten it. It could be a little softer, but then it may not give me the right support. This is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"best sleep yet!","review":"My partner is pregnant with twins and has, since early on, been uncomfortable when trying to sleep. This wedge has done wonders and she uses it even when she's just laying on the couch. She's finally able to sleep MUCH more comfortably with the support under her belly. And there more space in the bed without the body pillow she was using!"},{"rating":"1","title":"mom-to-be","review":"I'm sure this pillow works for someone, but not for me. I personally found it horrible. The two nights I used it, I woke up with back pain. It's simply hard and uncomfortable. Find yourself a good, soft pillow that you can smush under your belly and between your legs, if necessary, and you'll be a whole lot happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERPRICED....SHOP AROUND","review":"I find it TOTALLY rediculous that Amazon has this pillow priced for 39.99 (2/1/2011). From past reviews obviously it was sold for the average price of 14.99 and if you shop around that is what most places sell it for...Motherhood, Target, Baby R Us, etc.... Just Goggle \\"Boppy Wedge\\" most sites also offer free shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pregnancy Support Wedge/Pillow","review":"I was searching for a supportive pillow for my growing belly to relieve backache at night. I also wanted a pillow that did not take up the entire bed and would fit my size as well (5'0\\"). Some of the large body pillows looked cumbersome so I decided that a wedge would be best. I am very happy with this wedge - having used it through my pregnancy from 4-8 months. It is also great support as a reading wedge or for extra support when laying on your side in bed. Plastic, zipper case can be saved and used to protect your pillow when traveling!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a relief!","review":"While pregnant with my second child, I decided to give in, and buy a pregnancy wedge, since I was so uncomfortable when trying to sleep. I have to say, I wish I had bought it alot sooner! This pillow is the perfect size - not too big, and not too small. It's easy to manuever under bed covers, and fits at every stage of your pregnancy, since the wedge shape allows you to push it to fit under your belly, as your belly grows.I would recommed this for every pregnant woman! It's a small price to pay, for the relief it gives of the heavy feeling of gravitational pull on your tummy, while laying on your side as you're trying to sleep.The removable cover is also great, so you can wash it when you wash your sheets!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta have it","review":"I love this pillow. I got a prenatal massage and they used one when putting me on my side. I couldnt believe the support it gave me and I ran out to buy one immediately. It completely took the strain off my back and the ligaments weren't being so stretched with the support of this cushion. My only complaint... I knock it off the bed when I sleep, but that's my problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only used it 3-4 times","review":"The pillow is OK. A bit too small for any real support. I may try to use it for my knees after birth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I paid $14.99 for this?","review":"They need to have a size reference in the picture just so you can see how big this wedge ACTUALLY is. It's tiny! I didn't even support half my belly, and I'm not a very large person! Plus, it's as hard as a rock. I understand that it's for support, but there should be at least SOME cushioning. I mean, pregnancy is already uncomfortable, why make a PILLOW (which are supposed to be soft) that makes you even more uncomfortable. Don't waste your money! Go get a throw pillow from your couch. MUCH BETTER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works after you get used to it","review":"I needed something to support my belly so I could sleep. I got this pillow and it took a little getting used to. However, after I got used to it, it works pretty well. I wish I could say more but I am close to the end of my pregnancy and I am not sure if I can really get comfy with any pillow right now. But I would recommend this pillow, love Boppy products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job","review":"When I first received this pillow in the mail, I thought I'd make a mistake in buying it. It is very small and really doesn't look like it should cost more than around $7.00 or so. But, I can honestly say that I use it every single night! I really didn't use it much until I reached about 4 1/2 months (I'm now 5 months along). Now I really love it and am glad that I got it. It's just the thing if you just want support for your growing tummy and not one of those huge pregnancy body wrap around pillows (which I tried and didn't care for)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't live without it!","review":"Great product. I bought many pregnancy pillows and this one is by far the best and most essential. I have used it since I was 5 months pregnant. I tuck it under my tummy every night, and it helps me get a good night's sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"boppy pregnancy wedge","review":"Given as gifts, these were a big hit with those ladies in their later months. Comes with soft cotton cover and provides great support under belly or in between knees."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition for sleeping comfort!","review":"This wedge pillow is wonderful- it relieved my midsection discomfort & even helped to ease my back pain! The wedge pillow is lightweight and easy to tote into any room where you may want to nap. There is a funny-smell that came from the pillow for the first couple of days... (a foam or synthetic smell). The synthetic smell subsided after 3 days. The pillow comes with a very easy to zip & unzip & wash & dry cover. I highly recommend this pillow for the comfort it provides."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS!","review":"OMG - this pillow is the perfect size to offer support for your growing belly during pregnancy! It helped me sleep so much better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great belly pillow","review":"This is a great pillow to support the growing belly. Not too big yet not too small. Also not to hard yet not too soft. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFE SAVER!!! Highly recommend!","review":"I feel like I owe so much to this little wedge!! I began having trouble sleeping at the beginning of the third trimester and once I got this I was finally able to sleep through the night again (well, until my bladder woke me up! hehe). For those who are complaining it is hard, I believe it is meant to be firm for support. If you want something soft, use one of those square decorative pillows or something. I didn't like the square pillows because they were too soft and there wasn't any support. The incline this wedge provides is perfect! Also, I am sure it works differently for different body types. I highly recommend this item!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Take it or leave it....","review":"I am about 7 months pregnant and I can't decide if this pillow was a good investment or a waste of money. It's much smaller than I thought it would be. Before I had this pillow I would just use my regular pillows between my knees, behind my back or to support my belly. This pillow is very hard and I'd rather use a soft pillow under my belly. Maybe as I get further along it will prove to be invaluable, but for now I could take it or leave it. (I do like using it on top of propped up pillows behind my head when I am reading in bed.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for everyone","review":"I bought the Boppy Wedge because it came highly recommended, but have found it too uncomfortable to use. It is very hard and doesn't give at all. I thought I needed to wait till I got bigger, but I am 31 weeks now and it still is not comfortable. Maybe this is more suitable for women who carry bigger and really need the extra support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for 3rd Trimester","review":"The Boppy Wedge is a lifesaver in the 3rd trimester when your tummy feels really heavy and its hard to sleep. It really helped reduce the pain below my waist from sleeping on my side. Just prop it under your tummy and it holds your tummy up. I've noticed that the baby doesn't wake up as much or try to adjust her positioning in my tummy when I switch sides anymore.It also works well for the back. When I watch TV in bed I like to prop several pillows behind me for support the wedge works real well to support my lower back while laying on my back in bed.This is a really good product and the price is right too. I've been thinking about buying another one to use at work to use as a back cushion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Although it may not seem like it when you see this tiny pillow, it is absolutely the best thing ever! Definitely helped me to get comfy so I could sleep. Would highly recommend it to anyone in need of some belly support at night :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pillow!","review":"This pillow is just the right size to stuff under a growing belly and give the baby a little more support! My husband is very pleased that I was able to ditch one of the full size pillows I was using:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I bought this pillow when I was 6 months pregnant and I wish I would have saved my money. It was small, made out of cheap material and it did not provide the support I needed. I wish I would have paid more attention to reviews that warned about this pillow not being worth the money. If you have the money, go with something more expensive or buy a pillow you can physically see before purchasing. This pillow did not work well with my anatomy and I threw it away before my 7th month."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as expected","review":"A standard bed pillow or sofa pillow is more firm and helpful than this product. I would return it but it is not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"WINE RACK","review":"I purchased this as a requested gift from the bridal registry and they were very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smaller than I thought","review":"My boyfriend assembled it before I got home and if I had been there we would have sent it back because it's too small. Good quality, nice wood, very expensive little thing. Amazon messed up my order and wouldn't take my $25 gift card so I ended up paying full price which is a rip off in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine.","review":"This figure is quite nice, the arms and the head are very cool, but the base and legs not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savage Dragon 10th Anniversary Figure","review":"Savage Dragon has always been one of my favorite cartoons growing up, and this figure is by far the best I've seen on the market. It stands about seven inches and comes with a nice free standing base. There's not much articulation, shoulders, legs and torso; next to impossible to stand without the base. And even with it, you have to angle it just right to make it stay and not fall over. Very detailed and is a must buy if you're a fan, however in my opinion its main use is for show or the collector; due to the lack of articulation and free standing capabilities. But it's pretty durable like most of McFarlane's line. Since I use mine for display only, I give this a 4 out of 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why I keep coming back to the King James version.","review":"A fascinating read for one who reads the Bible and is interested in where did we get this translation and how accurate is it? It's amazing that a \\"committee\\" actually produced a winner but \\"God's Secretaries\\" did just that. Perhaps in the few centuries since the KJV was printed, archeologic and other evidence has added new knowledge but Mr. Nicholson has shown why some of the \\"modern\\" translations are bland and miss the drama of the Bible story. They read the translation aloud and they all listened befoe deciding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bought to give away","review":"Very pleased with the condition of the book and the shipping speed. I think the recipient enjoyed reading this; I enjoyed perusing it briefly before wrapping it up to send."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"I am always suspicious of those who write a book on or about the Bible. Be careful, Adam Nichols in my opinion makes accusations against the Bible translators to discredit the King James Bible. He is doing what is called historical revisionism. For more on this [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the 21st century...","review":"Adam Nicolson must be aiming to show that he can copy illegible texts with their original spelling and grammer. As a result, what might have been 'quaint' in a chapter title page or two becomes a very laborious exercise. A potentially interesting topic, Nicolson's insistance on making us all scholars of old English resulted in a better solution to insomnia than an interesting tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"KJV overrated","review":"Pretty much everything that was good about the KJV actually came directly from Tyndale's translation. Tyndale was the real genius. In fact a well known biblical scholar has said that where the KJV and the Tyndale translation are different it is usually because Tyndale had a better understanding of the original language than the KJV translators had.Personally I've never much cared for the archaic translations. Come to that, most of the genius of Tyndale actually comes from the underlying biblical writers themselves and is readily seen in many modern translations.Too many readers of the KJV actually don't understand what they are reading. For example the \\"strain at a gnat\\" verse, which is often labeled a misprint in the KJV, is misinterpreted by most otherwise well informed KJV readers that I've met. (Hint: strain means \\"filter\\")."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"After reading several great reviews, I approached this book with keen interest, only to find myself bored, and struggling to finish the last forty pages. My time could have been saved if the author had simply said he thinks the KJV is better than all modern translations and have done with it, nevermind that in the 21st century the KJV is hard going, its musicality lost in the ancientness of its language. Even Mr. Nicholson's work is hard going with his insistence of reproducing all quotes in their original 17th century spelling. I found the book little more than a series of personality profiles with precious little actually devoted to the KJV and how its translation came about--something I was far more interested in than whether or not one of the Translators married for money. Sorry, but for me this Emperor wears no clothes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre treatment, a dry read","review":"I picked this book up when I read a positive review in a local newspaper. It sounded like a book that would be very interesting. However, I was wrong. Nicolson's style tends to drag, and when he decided to include major quotes in the exact language from the 17th century--well, I, for one could not understand what most of the quotes were saying without studying each one. Two-thirds of the way through the book, I gave up and didn't finish it, which is very unlike me. Rarely do I quit a book when I have made such an investment of time and money.Now that I've had my appetite whetted on this subject of translating the KJV, I might need to look for other treatments, as I've heard there are some better overviews. So I'm sorry, but I just have to say that I was disappointed in God's Secretaries and am therefore not able to recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and Disappointing","review":"Nicolson is a genius at making a fascinating subject boring. While there is interesting information here about the Jacobean Age, the text is disorganized and discursive. Not much real information is provided about the Bible itself or the process of its translation. There is nothing about this subject here provided that has not been more effectively presented elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Secretaries","review":"I suppose because the author is the descendant of Nigel Nicolson, of the Vita-Sackville West connection, reviewers are full of praise for this book. And it's subject matter is of interest to secular and religious readers alike. However, to say, as some have, that this is \\"elegantly\\" written is to put expectation and sheer fawning ahead of reality. Consider this clumsy sentence: \\"Even London, by far the biggest city in England, and on its way to becoming the biggest in Europe, over which on bad days a smog of coal smoke already hung, was still rural in its corners.\\" Syntax doesn't get more tortured than than. This is not to mention sentences that sometimes reach beyond 65 words. It is as badly written a book as I have ever read and those reviewers who are carried away with the Nicolson name should consider carefully the limits of sycophantic behavior. The King of England was never treated better for less reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"God's Secretaries","review":"This very interesting topic is spoiled by the pedantic approach of the author. This is true of the lack of creativity in writing and in the vocabulary, which will send even well-educated readers scrambling for a dictionary. I plodded through to the end because the facts were interesting, but it was very tough going. All that research deserved better handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 book set","review":"Great deal on this set. Both books in a beautiful set were much less than if I had purchased just one of them at a bookstore."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good overview","review":"This is a good book covering the complex subject of the development of the King James bible.

Has good chapter on assembly language programming, and also lots of hardware interface examples, even a few introductory type projects at the end of the text, but one big problem that will hold *ANY* beginner back. The source code examples presented is not provided with the text and is not available to download from the web, making it harder to actually try out the examples presented in the text. When contacting the author about getting the source code, his comments were \\"I don't have the source code. I would need to retype the examples.\\" I actually wonder if the author himself actually got any of the samples to work..... Don't waste your time and $$ with this.

The Mortal Kombat series got a much needed overhaul with the introduction of different fighting styles, the use of Koins (the monetary system) in the game which you can buy hidden specials to unlock in the game. Most importantly, the game is balanced and fun! Lots of fun!If there is only one bad thing to say, its the fact the characters don't look as sharp as I would like them to be.
