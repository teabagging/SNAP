If you read any of the books and the use the CIMs you will have a greater understanding of what you read and some hands-on to back up the theory.

That is to simply practice some advanced ip routing scenarios. It is another tool that you can use to help reinforce your understanding of certain concepts.

The only way to seriously prepare for CCIE Lab exam is to practice with a rack of real Cisco equipment.With this in mind, you can go through lots of complex scenarios and build on your knowledge and experience.Finally, simulations are good to use when your are still building your lab or if you want to practice basic scenarios from scratch at the click of a button."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for CCIE Lab preparation","review":"This is the great stuff to prepare CCIE Lab test for Frame Relay, OSPF, EIGRP and BGP.

Can't complain about a 7 year lifespan.My only \\"gripe\\" was that the 24 ports were 10/100Mbps bandwidth, and the two side ports were 10/100/1000Mbps bandwidth. I would have liked for it to have been all 10/100/1000Mbps bandwidth, but of course, considering that it was purchased 7 years ago, something like that would have been over $1000.All in all, it was a good switch.

He wanted to document through his wonderful illustrations and writings, a material culture that would soon be gone.Sloane's take on American history ignores the big names and the famous dates. He is more interested on the mundane and ordinary. Sloane's point of view is that most Americans were farmers a hundred years ago and therefore had to master a whole series of skills that are now gone. Purchase this book, if you want to see how are ancestors lived and functioned on a daily basis. Sloane's wonderful illustrations are like a window into a time that is long gone.Eric Sloane's books are addicitng.

But the aligator hunting is just a slaughter, no real skills involved. They put chicken out with big hooks the day before, and come up and shoot them at point blank. If you research the aligator hunting regulations for LA you find out that all of these guys have to OWN the land they hunt on or are paid by the land owner to hunt there. The guy that killed 180 last year was a guide or something, there is no other way to have killed that many unless you are hired by the land owner to cull his crop of gators. This is not hunting in any true sense of the word unless you think that the workers in the beef plant are hunting too.The show is monotonous and like watching a slaughter house operation.

I've found it to be surprisingly accurate in time-keeping, comparable to the much more expensive brands. The indiglo lighting is a plus feature. Having owned four of these models, I will point out that the water resistancy usually allows moisture into the case after about four years of constant year-round use including swimming, snorkeling and showering. Their reasonable cost makes it prudent to simply replace with similar model, even though the invading moisture doesn't seem to affect the performance, (my second watch still is ticking away in a drawer after eight years of being replaced due to moisture). One additional minor complaint would be the setting procedure for day and date. It's somewhat cumbersome and should be made simpler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Watch","review":"My husband likes this watch, and it looks nice.

The last two tracks are on the softer side, with more of an American Thighs \\"25\\" feel.While the songs are great, they don't really have a uniqueness or \\"stand out\\" kind of feel.

Pop it in, choose a day, and it plays all the videos that are associated with that day. You can choose to follow the 28-Day Plan, or do the segments separately on their own. Knocking off a star only because it's not as hardcore of a workout as a Zumba or Pilates class that you would get at a gym, but for an at-home option, it's a really decent use of your time and burn potential.The package also contains a couple of other workout segments from other people published by the same DVD company that are useful, and some great recipes from the new SparkPeople Cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"too hard","review":"This video goes too fast and has too many steps to remember.

It has given me nothing but trouble. The string breaks, as it will on all trimmers, but on this unit the string gets pulled into the head and jams the heads so you cannot bump it out. I have to stop the engine, get a screw driver, pry the bumper off and restring the reel every time the string breaks. This is the biggest POS I have ever used. I will never buy another Troy-Built or MTD product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Real Piece of Junk","review":"It took at least a hundred pulls on the starter cord to get the trimmer running, I thought it would be easier the second time I used it, but it took just as many pulls. Even when the engine is hot it is hard to start. I return the 1st trimmer and replaced it with another figuring it must be defective. I've never been able to get the second one started and will be returning it tomorrow. I'll be replacing it with another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troy Bilt Line Feed Problem","review":"Like everyone else I too have had problems with the line feed on this model (TB525CS). Specifically, after a couple of bumps the line seems to come out all at once. Being of a curious nature I disassembled the head completely and discovered the root of the problem. There is a spring loaded mechanism that is supposed to regulate how much string is released in a bump. What happens is this mechanism starts to stick due to a poor design involving a circlip and a weak spring.Long story short after putting a washer under the circlip and adding a much stronger spring at the base this is actually a very capable head. I never had any problems with the engine so I am pretty happy now. I still have to give this product one star because no one should have to go through this much work to make a product function like it is supposed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"easy starts","review":"super good item no problems with it i like it over the 2 stoke systems you need oil with, this is quit and easer to start"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch OUT!","review":"I bought a similar Troy-Bilt weedeater model number TR525ES.

If you lightly touch the casing to the ground, the whole thing flies apart!!!! There are four small metal cylinders inside the spool that are supposed to hold and guide the twine. When it blew apart those little cylinders flew across the yard, NEVER TO BE FOUND AGAIN! I have NEVER seen a product basically destroy itself like this. I was shocked!!When I contacted Troy-Bilt about the problem, they said that the part wasnt covered by the warranty and that I would have to PAY FOR THEM!!

Just it took close to 100 pulls the second time. In the time it takes me to start this piece of crap, I could've already been done with my yard work.

I spoke to customer service person today and his comment was \\"have a nice life.\\" The head does not feed string properly requiring me to go back into the garage, disassemble the head and fix it. This happenes every 5 minutes or so. After about a year of ownership and 90 minutes of use, if that much, the motor does not turn fast enough for the string to cut grass. The motor stalls and dies. The gas is fresh, the air filter clean and the fuel filter replaced and it still does not run. Squeeze the trigger ad the engine dies. Troy -Bilt comment on that, the world make bad gas these days.

I really liked it until the curved shaft trimmer cable broke and I couldn't get a replacement from Troy-Bilt. I tried a Ryobi universal replacement trimmer attachment but it was worthless. So, I bought the new almost identical TB525 (that's how much I liked the TB425). Right out of the box I noticed part of the plastic handle was broken. So I decided to at least try the trimmer attachment with my TB425 power unit. It worked for about 1 minute before the string completely disappeared into the hub. I retrieved it from the hub and tried again but this time the string fed out of the hub unrestricted and twisted around the shaft. Re-read the instructions and reloaded a few times with the same result. I could easily pull the string out of the hub with my hands. Returned product. Very disappointed with Troy-Bilt now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy","review":"This is a horrible trimmer. The line feed is a nightmare and replacing the string is as bad.

It would always start, but it would take a minimum of 15 pulls when it was hot outside and upwards of almost 30 when it was cold (always would leave a blister due to the hard pulls). Dealer said that was due to the 4 stroke engine but \\"I was helping the environment\\".Well this time I'm buy something else and I'm going back to a two stroke! \\"Heck with the environment\\"!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TB525CS working fine since 2007","review":"Granted it's a previous model, but the engine probably hasn't changed. If anything, the trimmer starts better now than when it was new. It also works well with the pole saw attachment I purchased recently. The only bummer is that the saw cost almost what the trimmer did a few year back.I do recommend this unit. No need to reiterate the tradeoffs for 4-cycle vs. 2-cycle engines.I suspect mine has been pretty reliable because I:* Run the trimmer dry of gasoline after every use* Use fuel stabilizer* Use gas that's less than a month old"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Good Price.","review":"Very easy to use, very powerful. I have to be careful not to damage things. I bought a blower afterward and it is easy to change from one accessory to another. I wish it had some type of front guard or gage.

Horrible company.","review":"I bought this and was very excited to use this trimmer. It broke after the second use. I took it to the local approved service shop. They figured out what broke quickly and ordered the part. Long story short, two and a half months later the part came in. At one point, it was in the shop for longer than I had owned it. Every review you hear about the spinning head is true. Not sure who designed that, but wow, it's horrible. The handle also doesn't lock into place, so if you get resistance while trimming or using the edging attachment I also purchased, the handle rotates in your hand. Then you have to stop, twist it back, then keep going.Overall, this is a piece of garbage soon to be on CL.

The trimmer was horrible. Starting the engine was much more difficult than my last Homelite, but the worst problem was related to the feeding of the trimming line. In 10 minutes of trimming, I had to stop and disassemble the head three times because the line became tangled inside. This happened the next time I used it as well.

Because head is not replaceable.Clearly it is being poorly design on purpose, by a greedy company.P.S. I will be shopping for a new riding lawn mower soon, guess what brand will not be under consideration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rate it a Zero if I Could","review":"I bought this trimmer yesterday because my old one crapped out after two years. There aren't many choices unless you spend twice as much money for a quality unit like a STIHL. I picked the model with the curved shaft because it was $20 cheaper than the identical model with the straight shaft, and I still have the straight shaft that came with the last one. CHEAP being the key word. I put that glorifed hunk of plastic on just to see if it was any better than the strtaight one. After less than 5 minutes of trimming, the head flew apart and the spring headed for parts unknown.The good thing is that I received a free electric starter when I bought this unit. The bad part, is that I need it. This is also the hardest trimmer to start that I have ever owned, and it is new out of the box. I plan on selling this piece of junk at a yard sale, and buy a real trimmer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheared-off Shaft","review":"I loved this machine...for 2 and a half years of quiet running, easy-operating use. And then the crank sheared off. End of machine. Think of the crankshaft in a car or a motorcycle: it is supported in bearings at both ends. But in this engine the crank is supported in only one bearing and the piston rod is connected to an eccentric counterweight on the opposite end of that crank, which protrudes only about an inch or so out of the bearing. But it's long enough to shear off. I think the basic design is not a bad one, but the steel of the crank must be made stronger or of greater diameter. Still, I'd love to have a 4-cycle string trimmer; Honda makes one, but it's far too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash!","review":"1.

They're obviously addicted to the stuff - a very unhealthy habit.I can't drink soda pop myself, it's been 5 years or so since I had one, and so I began searching for a drink that tasted like regular soda pop, but wasn't unhealthy. I searched high and low for a suitable alternative - and then I found Izze.I love the fruity, tangy flavor of Izze's sparkling clementine soda. Nothing beats an icy, cold Clementine Izzy on a picnic. The clementine flavor goes well with a nice thick sandwich and a handful of chips, but it is also great just by itself.My teens love Izze and drink it now just like soda pop! I'm so happy to know they aren't guzzling down corn syrup and artificial colors and flavors, but instead are enjoying all-natural Izze, with no added sweeetners!If you're looking for a great alternative to regular soda pop - you can't do better than to buy Izze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction For Track Listing","review":"This CD contains 27 Tracks, not the 7 listed in the product information.

This is the perfect saute pan. Whether you are cooking anything from Sweet and Sour Chicken to something simple as adding sauce to your pasta, this pan does it well and cooks it perfectly. It also retains heat even after you have removed the pan from the stove so food stays warm longer but does not dry it out. For those wondering (because this fact is important to me and a lot of other Americans) this pan is made in the USA BUT the lid is made in China. But I would not let that be a deterrent from purchasing this truly amazing pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young cooks need only three 'good' pans","review":"And this is one of them.

You can steam vegetables or cook pasta in any old pot from the five and dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE this pan","review":"My mom bought me this pan for Christmas a few years ago and I absolutely hate it. It's the worst pan I've ever owned. Food sticks to it no matter how much oil or how low of heat I cook on. It is not balanced properly and I find it difficult to manage when full of food. The handle is too narrow and it makes it so you can't lift the pan with one hand. My husband used it the other night and ended up bruising his hand with the handle. Because the handle is hollowed out in the middle, all of the pressure is on the two points of contact that meet the hand. He can't even use his hand today. This pan went out in today's garbage. I wish my mom had saved her money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality!","review":"I purchased two sets of these for serving espresso, cappuccino, and small desserts.

Be aware that they do come with some packing grease, not a ton, but enough that you wont want to wear a nice shirt when dealing with them. I had to modify each one by bending up the retaining clip and slightly pinching the clip to make the track more narrow. Both of these operations are very easily done with a pair of vice grips and took maybe 5 seconds per clip.Once loaded, it does take some force to push the rounds down into the firearm, but they all fed in and it was ready to go. An ideal way to store a large quantity of ammo for rapid deployment at a later date. Probably a waste of time if you are just shooting at the range. It's easier to just load the rifle directly (SKS anyway, cant speak for the AK).Overall, typical Chinese product. Cheap. Does the job. Don't expect perfection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good quality","review":"I recently ordered these and only 6 out of 20 clips would work properly.

I hope pack number two is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and Cheap","review":"These stripper clips are well worth the money. Out of 20 of them, only one fails to hold the 7.62x39 ammo due to the clip itself being out of shape out of the factory. They are made out of hard steel and are not bendable by hand. The ones you see here come in two bags of 10 and are well oiled. So even if you decide to leave them until much later use, they are well prepared to withstand the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly useless clips","review":"Like UAG clips, these are useless. I bought two boxes but none of the 40 clips fit because they were all to thick to drops into the slot above the bolt face. SKS clips should fit into the slot with a little play to properly function; these way too thick and could not be modified in any way or I would have done so. John Masen makes SKS aftermarket parts and his clips are now the only ones I purchase. Dollar bills spent on these clips would be better used if they were lit on fire and used for warmth in winter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for quick loads at the shooting range","review":"These work great.

I am not sure how much of the cleaning solution was spilled, but it must be a lot since both boxes lids were soaked.Yes the price paid was very good and is a excellent product but if the cleaning solution is lost due to shipping issue then is not a good deal.The product needs canister needs to include an air tight customer removable shrink wrap between the lid and the actual towel.

Then her timeline of getting a doctorate just three years later is questionable too.

It has the cumulative effect of freeing you and leaving you feeling great. Easy to follow, yet you are left feeling you have come a very long way toward self improvement.

The chapters are pretty well written. It's obvious in places that the author moved from describing NT4 to describing Windows 2000 a little carelessly. He skims over some of OEMTOOLS stuff (like driver verifier), and is a little terse on how to write debugger extensions. The sections on setting up and using the tools is good, the sections on remote debugging seem useful. Lot of good stuff, even if not as deep as could be.

And since then, I never had the opportunity to see it again. But I've always remembered the strange atmosphere of GOTO with the concerto of Haendel playing on Glossia's tearful face.Cult Epics had the great idea of releasing GOTO on DVD, adding as bonus feature \\"Les Astronautes\\", a short film directed by Borowczyk and Chris Marker in 1959. I was happy to see that the movie ages well and that my memory hadn't added to it the faked beauty of the souvenirs.

Heats up quickly and evenly, and that's really everything you need a pot to do, so I have zero complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad Pots are tops!","review":"All clad pots are wonderful. The shorter pans with thick-cored bottoms make excellent jam pots as they deliver very good heat distribution. Good heat distribution is necessary for cooking full-flavored jams, preserves, or butters. Without good heat distribution you run the risk of burn spots on the pan's surface. These burn spots may/will impart an unwanted flavor to your product. If you've ever tried to disguise burned jam-- you know it's a losing battle. While some cooks may consider All-Clad pots or pan to be too expensive, I believe they are well worth the cost as you are less likely to burn your product. One good pan is worth more than six cheapies. Besides, quality equipment instills confidence and makes you feel like a seasoned chef."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent craftsmanship!!","review":"This one more addition to my All Clad cookware collection.

I've listened to the radio show a number of times and its 100% rip off of the Limbaugh show. The guy copies Limbaugh's voice, laugh, manerisms, merchandise, etc. What appears to have happened is the guy went to some type of conservative radio convention when he was on that side and tried to kiss up to Limbaugh and was totally ignored. Now he's attempting this \\"turn liberal\\" stunt to somehow get even in his feeble mind. The book is exactly along the same lines there is nothing new if you've heard the show even a few times.

Beck's really not a great singer, but the way he delivers these lyrics is just flawless. I really can't describe what I'm talking about here. Like, I'm a much better singer, but I could never do it as perfectly as he does. If that doesn't make sense, oh well. It's befitting of a Beck review anyway. :-PBy the way, did you ever notice that that Butthole Surfers song \\"Pepper\\" sounds exactly like \\"Loser\\".

I was glad I got it from the library first so I could see what the patterns were instead of going from the title. Having seen the book, I'm not going to buy it. The patterns are pretty conventional, not really different from embroidery patterns you can buy elsewhere (except for the one pattern showing an alien in a spaceship, which I did like). In the photos, the needlework is a bit more complex than what you get from the pattern. Photos showing various ways to \\"interpret\\" the patterns would have been helpful.

It sounds as if it's falling off the table!One other thing - after you press print, there is a (longer than I'm used to) delay before it actually prints.

Anyway this gun is full sized and looks really cool, i would recomend this for cqc or just backyard. It has a low rate of fire (5-6 bbs a second) and goes about 50 ft accuraty with .12 gram, I had this gun for 2 months and it only broke cause I modded one of the magazines to be slightly a higher capacity and one of the gears got striped out so i took it apart, took everthing possibley usefull out and sold it as a prop gun for $5, anyway it can use .12 or .20 with its ajustable hop up but the .20 gram go only 25 feet perfectly straight and then start to drop. The higher cap mag only holds about 110 bbs so it not really worth droping them in and winding it up, its better to get 2-3 extra low caps cause its more realistic and easier to load cause the pacage comes with a speed loader. Also buy the one here because it comes with 8000 extra bbs for about $5 more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eyewitness London","review":"I sent it back for I just didn't need it.

The practice exams (and flashcard test)will test your readiness to take the MCSD Visual Basic 5 certification exam offered by ICCP. Even if your not going to take the test the book and computer aided testing software give all Visual Basic programmers strict coding guidlines. You won't just learn how to pass the test you'll also learn good coding techniques.

I don't think the appearance is as attractive as the stainless or even the LTD lines, but it's not bad, really. Performance matters more, anyway. Plus, I found this pan mis-marked at Dillard's for a mere $23.75, so I wasn't going to pass it up just because it isn't shiny on the outside.

If one wants to get a 1st hand and what I feel is a fairly accurate view of what soldiering must of been like , this is the one to read about War One (\\"The War to end all Wars\\") and the British Army as seen thru American eyes. (Example - How the mess kits were cleaned by using mud.) I can also state that the glossary of terms used by Tommy Atkins was both amusing and informative. Tommy by the way was a very cynical and humorous sort of fellow. While this book is not as good as Robert Graves \\"Goodbye to all that\\". Which also is part of my library. On the other hand, Graves could not not write about the others ranks point of view since he was always a Commissioned Officer in the Royal Welch Fusiliers.

They're simply not doing their jobs because I felt like I was reading a pre-proofread book.

He's calm, rational and affects warm relationships with the animals he gets to know.Interviews with Robert Redford (who used Buck in \\"The Horse Whisperer\\") and conversations with Buck's wife, daughter, stepmother and friends make this a convincing ninety minutes of education and inspiration.

But aside from the message that \\"breaking\\" horses by breaking their will is cruel and unnecessary, there is a message that every viewer can relate to. Each person is responsible for becoming an honorable, caring and fair human no matter how her or his life started.

In the film he seems to be a happy man, travelling the country 9 months a year to teach people to handle their horses gently, and WELL. Great message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic movie","review":"Loved this movie.

Not just because of the content - horses, people who love horses, etc... This film was inspirational on many levels. Buck's story alone is intriguing in itself, how he managed to overcome his past and celebrate the present is what makes a human being keep moving forward and reach for possibilities denied.Karma is so evident in Buck's life. Conscientiously he knows that he himself is his own redeemer and makes it a point to live his life accordingly. Indeed this is a story of human nature and how regardless of what we've endured, choosing to not let the pain rule our lives, but instead to celebrate accomplishements and reach out to others by example, deeds and courage.How we operate within our lives and realize the effect we have to those around us wether they are human or horses is very clear, all we need do is act upon the goodness within us, and we too can succeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"for horse lovers","review":"A lot of horse people will know Buck Brannaman.

Well done and worth the watching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, just beautiful","review":"I love documentaries, but especially any story of inspiration, triumph over tragedy, love, kindness, and sharing your/our gift with others. Bravo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing movie and book.","review":"Would recommend it to anyone at any age. Buck seems to be an amazing soul with horses and humans !!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This movie is outstanding and a must watch for any horse person, regardless of discipline. I work at a Thoroughbred farm and we've bought it for several of our more equestrian inclined clients. It's been a HUGE hit with everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"This is the type of movie that makes you want to be a better horse person and have the half the talent Buck does, but perhaps even more than that, is his no nonsense approach with people & their \\"people problems\\" rather than horse problems is more of a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kindness is the Best Training Method","review":"This man's story is phenomenal. He is so right that the horse or any other animal for that matter is our mirror.

We went to the bookstore and got to hear this gentleman tell his story. Very inspirational."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing documentary....","review":"If you are looking for a healing, BUCK is the film to watch. Buck Brannaman was the inspiration for the wonderful film, The Horse Whisperer, by Robert Redford. Buck was a victim of severe child abuse, and was also a child prodigy with rope tricks. As a healing, he went on to work with horses, to help train them with loving kindness and firm discipline.This film is beautifully filmed, sensitively depicted and full of life wisdom. Our hero is soft spoken, strong and amazingly resilient. A real inspiration of a human being. A beauty of a film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life changing","review":"This movie blew me away, I laughed, I cried, and, I hope I also grew and learned some important life lessons.Buck Brannaman is unique, part horse trainer, part therapist to the people who come to him for help with their horses. He shares so much in this movie about his own struggles to overcome childhood abuse, but he didn't just overcome it, he has managed to become an incredible person who deliberately chose to walk a very different path and chose not to carry on the legacy of the abuse he suffered. Rather he has transformed the lessons of his past into a patient, compassionate and gentle approach with both the horses he trains, and the people in his life.This is a wonderful and potentially life changing movie with lessons for horsemen, but also for anyone who can accept and learn from his message on how to live a gentler - more compassionate life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Impressive","review":"The group sounds like a really edgy version of Saves the Day.The band plays a lot of different feels, which I really like. The album is complex, which gives it good staying power.If you're a fan of punk, you should give this album a spin. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"a must read for any fan of music","review":"I have never read a book about Muddy Waters that proved to be so informative. I've been reading about Muddy for years and this book offered up new information of which I had not been aware. Ms. Tooze did a heck of a job researching this book. I beleive she had her MOJO workin'."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Impressionistic Portrait","review":"Tooze's new biography is most useful for its ample use of primary accounts from Waters and those close to him. The book works best as a loving tribute to some of the most influential music of the twentieth century. Yet a facile prose style and a lack of contextualization make this a frustratingly one-dimensional biography. One finishes with only an impressionistic sense of this singularly important individual. Tooze pays virtually no attention to the women in Waters' life, and misinforms the reader by repeating apocryphal tall-tales. Mojo Man is a poorly written and shallow portrait of a mighty and deep historical figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality of men's behavior, all women must face","review":"This book is so well written. The characters are somewhat pathetic, they do act in the stereotypical male behavior. I can't help hope that some men do grow up and repress this behavior. It is refreshing to know that most men think and act this way at some time in their lives....not just the schmucks I meet."},{"rating":"2","title":"What, I can only give 5 stars?","review":"Giving this product only 5 stars is an insult. The empeg / RioCar is such an innovative ground-breaking product that it has taken the rest of the world 10 years to catch up. If you have an extensive music collection, and have some skill with computers, then you must have an empeg. It gives control over your music collection like nothing else, it has an impressive broad range of features, and you'll always look down and smile at the amazing real time visualizations which move to the music. It may be 10 years old, but the community of users still support the player and develop new functionality for it. To find one new in the box after all these years is rare, so give this purchase some consideration.

We used it for a study in a couples small group from my church. Immediately there were questions toward Dr Eggerich ... like does he have women issues?( bitterness,lack of understanding) His focus is that the women is the main problem of every marriage.I am terriably dissapointed in this book, and I am as far from being a feminist as you could be, this book is very disrepectful towards women. Not only that it is poorly written he spends chapter after chapter repeating himself and never getting to the point. Love & respect are always part of every marriage, but they are not the only issues involved. The bad in this book outweighs the good. I think Dr Eggert should read The Five Love Languages and work on his communication skills. I beleive God's plan has a better balance for husband & wife than Eggerich's book offers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did meet my expectations","review":"I got this workbook thinking it would go well with the CD series that I also purchased.

Over the years, I have returned them under warranty. It takes them 6-8 weeks to evaluate your pan for any returns. The most recent pan I returned as it was sticking terribly was in November. Four months later, I still do not have a replacement, and am getting no where with customer service. Be sure you get a confirmed delivery as well, they said they did not receive my pan at all until I provided the USPS delivery confirmation that I paid for in addition to sending the pan back. They agree the pan should be replaced under warranty. But four months later, still no pan. Do yourself a favor, save your money and get something else in the non stick pan class. The warranty is almost useless at this point, and after a few years, even with no dishwasher, wooden utensils and care, they will stick."},{"rating":"2","title":"the ultimate pan","review":"All-Clad Master Chef 2 Nonstick8-Inch FRy Pan----hey you hestitant chefs, go for it!

She comes with a shiny, silver colored bottle with chain. Her pet is a black cat. She's just kawaii. Nothing can beat the cuteness of this doll. Check her out it in stores and you'll see what I mean!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting book","review":"This book has some very interesting concepts. Some old, some new, some I don't entirely agree with. However, it does have a welll laid out diet and exercise plan. I especially like the graduated exercise plan, and he does stress that you have to change things up-both with your diet and exercise plan. I completely agree with that, and I think his plan is worth trying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful on my section hike.","review":"I used this book to set up a section hike from the State Park in Georgia to just past the North Carolina border. Had all I needed to get my first solo hike completed with minimum problems. Some pretty bad weather at times and not many other hikers but stayed in good shape. Believe it when they say \\"pack light\\". Read the three negative reviews that were sent on the same day and seems a bit extreme. If you are going to try the AT this will get you off to a good start. Read the book, get in shape and ruck up. My best time, sitting under cover with dry socks, a canteen cup of hot coffee and sharing a MRE cracker with a squirrel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Updated Thoroughly","review":"I can not recommend this book. I found this guide is not updated as thoroughly on a yearly basis as some of the other A.T. guides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated and incomplete","review":"Information is very outdated. Doesn't seem to know about any trail changes made in the last four years. Only seems to list half of the services in most towns, and quite often lists things that have been closed for years. Author claims seven thru-hikes, but they must have been many, many years ago. Basically worthless, no thru-hikers on the Trail ever use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money..............","review":"This was probably the worst of all of the AT guide books out there. The information was not very thought out at all. I was also personally banned from the author's web page (...) for the mere fact that I am a republican and supported the president and our troops overseas. I couldn't believe it. He told me that supporters of the president were not welcome unless I could \\"keep my mouth shut.\\" Despite any personal biases I have towards him, I objectively claim that ANY other books out there regarding the AT are going to be more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much controversy..","review":"Sorry for the 1 star..

The coach was thrilled and used it immediately...we gave it to him right before a big game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent shelf companion to 'Napoleonic Source Book'","review":"Haythornthwaite's 'Naploleonic Source Book' contains a small biographical section which I had always wished to see expanded. This is it! I have been able to find entries for even the most obscure bit-part players. The author has even given spaces for significant historians and artists of the period (not necessarily living during that period either!) I think this is an imaginative and necessary inclusion. Readers interested in the War of 1812 will not, I think, be disappointed, as there is a generous spread of entries for participants from both sides of that conflict."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT new translations...","review":"The blurb on the back of this collection is highly misleading, since most of these letters were translated into English long, long before their publication in this book. It was originally published in Russian in 1990, so the \\"newly translated\\" might refer to the 1995 publication in the US. If you're really interested in Chekhov's letters, read Karlinsky and Heim's book...it can't be beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have toy","review":"I have to say this toy is very effective. The feathers on this toy are able to spin freely while flying through the air. My cat think it is a real bird and play very enthusiastically with this. The feather piece is replaceable - your cat will destroy it if you let them and you really should always put this toy away and out of sight when not using it. I am able to play 10 to 20 minutes with my cat in the evening and he is tired, ready for a treat or small snack, and isn't up all night howling. Your cat will also be much happier with regular exercise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic Drivel","review":"For anyone who is interested in Celtic myth and legend, the Matthews may seem like a perfectly good starting point. The only problem is that, as the first review of this book says, it only helps to reinforce Romantic fantasies of what the Celts were like. Caitlain Matthews is especially known for this by academics as she makes two big mistakes over and over again: a.) she assumes that all Celtic cultures are the same and b.) she makes no differentiations between different time periods. This book is no different and does not help to further true academic studies of Celtic literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good!","review":"I was very disappointed by this book. I did not care about the narrator's on-line or \\"real\\" life, nor her clothes, her dimensionless friends or her very boring fantasies. The \\"sex\\" scenes are juiceless and the show-don't-tell writing rule is blatantly disregarded. I was mildly interested in the ending though, as I skipped several chapters to get to it, so I guess Baer accomplished something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"This book did not live up to my expectations. The characters were flat and shallow. While we were given insight to the \\"positive\\" affects of Elaine's foray into computer sex; we weren't told why she started in the first place, or anything about who she is inside. I found the book boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Time!!!","review":"I thought this book sounded interesting. Unfortunately, Ms. Baer took a good idea and ruined it. The charactors were not believable, the main charactor was a self obsessed bore. The plot was ridiculous, no people are motivated to further their carrers simply by online sex. I kept reading in hopes that it would get better or become more interesting, only to be dissapointed.Bottom line: As Francesca is imposible to relate to and a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bloody bore","review":"I didn't like the characters in this book -- I found them shallow and self-absorbed and, by extension, boring. Actually, it read more like a long, heavily-researched magazine article. I wasn't surprised to learn that the author used to write for Wired Magazine, a (very good) publication that caters to geeks. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book?? Don't think so.","review":"For those of you who have not purchased this book, thank your lucky stars. I found nothing good about this book. The story line goes nowhere. I kept reading, hoping the good part would soon come up. Well--it never came. The main character is self-obsessed and boring. Horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel...........And, it's neverending.","review":"This book was a gift. Thank God, I didn't spend money on it. It's was awful. I don't see the point.

To be read while working on your tan."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Purple than Prince","review":"Distracting, overwritten prose spoils any erotic tension the story could have projected. Too much literary pretension, not enough stimulation. Sounds like it was written by a Creative Writing major- it tries too hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Luckily, I bought this book used, and after shipping and handling it only cost me about four bucks. Of course, I could have flushed four dollar bills down a toilet, and watching them go around in circles before disappearing would have been more entertaining than reading this book. The sex wasn't sexy, the \\"mystery\\" was predictable, and the characters were really obvious and boring. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Promising concept, but predictable and less than involving","review":"The book contained a promising concept, incorporating cyberia within the folds of the erotic thriller. But it was just plain boring. It was very easy to predict exactly what would happen next and who Elaine would next suspect to be the secret Inez... The story follows a rigid day-night-day-night formula which is too repetitive to be interesting. Character development is really shallow; I never got drawn into Elaine or any of her friends. Pretty disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"At Least It's for a Good Cause","review":"Well, here's your chance to show your level of political commitment. About the only good thing I can say about this collection is 50% of the proceeds from the wholesale price will benefit ACLU's lesbian/gay rights and AIDS projects. Rather than showcase the wide variety of gay & lesbian talent out there, they have filled this CD (two disc's worth) with maudlin folksie ballads (disc one) and novelty songs (disc two). The only artist with whom I was familiar was RuPaul, and even his contribution was bland. It's a shame ACLU couldn't follow HRC's example and create an exciting collection of music with a bit more variety to appeal to all ears. I'd buy HRC's Being Out Rocks collection instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome game","review":"Love it!!!

Coupled with the Logitech G25 Racing Wheel and surround sound it provides everything you need except the Gs...although I do catch myself leaning into the corners. The sound is very good...some of the car's engines sound a bit off real but you are still enveloped in the great sound of a race car. Whether or not the engine sound is a perfect match to the particular car doesn't really matter, the sound is still very good. I highly recommend this sim to everyone that has a real need for speed and doesn't have the money for his/her own REAL race car.

The physics are perfect, the graphics are pleasing, and there is a wide variety of tracks and cars. The learning curve can be very steep, but you can adjust the AI to suit your needs. You can also turn on traction control, steering aids, etc., which will get you into the game faster. After a couple months, you'll be good enough to turn these aids off and drive the cars the way they are meant to be driven. There is also a comprehensive driving school which will train you in the basics of racing. If you want a realistic racer, buy this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Driving Sim","review":"Bought this after thoroughly enjoying GT Legends. If you want to experience the best driving SIM on the market, buy GTR2. While I love rally, sprints, NASCAR and most other driving games, this one sits on the pole. Complexity level and your own personal motivation to get better keeps it from getting mundane. Graphics rock. Get your system up to speed as all these other review suggest and that means a good wheel/pedal combo as well. How good is it? I've had it several months and I still say it is the best there is. Semper Fi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very hard to play","review":"I have to be completely fair - others on the Amazon review postings warned about this - that GTR2 is NOT easy to play. I figured that it might be a little difficult, but not as difficult as it really is! As others have said, you cannot simply sit down and start flying around the track! Even the practice sessions are difficult to pass! Playing on the keyboard is virtually impossible (at least for me) - so I used a Logitech Rumblepad which did help, but still quite difficult. So I basically decided that I don't have the time to really learn how to play this game and will stick to easier ones!However, the graphics are indeed amazing. If you are really serious about racing games (I found out I am not very serious) then this game is probably for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Harder than heck, but fun","review":"This is a very challenging racing sim, not for the casual player. I've driven it for probably 20-30 hours so far and have yet to complete a race in pro mode. Dropping the difficulty only seems to add driving aids, not slow the other drivers, at least from pro to semi-pro. The training module is very good, I learned quite a bit about cornering from the challenges. Overall, I'd highly recommend it if you are willing to invest the time to become proficient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't Install","review":"It looks like a great game but I'm sorry to say that I can't install it.

The polyester fabric is easy to clean & wipe down and stretches across the frame to make a tight drum-like surface to lay on that is reasonably comfortable. (A pad on top makes it more comfortable for extended sleeping requirements.) As it has a carry sack and is fairly lightweight and inexpensive, this cot is a great option for camping too. Due to space constraints, we have had a someone sleeping on it for the last couple of weeks with no complaints (he's 20 and has no back or pain issues to worry about).

Not enough explanation","review":"While Mr. Hochheim may be an accomplished martial artist, and could probably slaughter me in a knife fight without breaking a sweat, this book is sub-par, even by knife combat book standards. This is another case of someone who is an expert in the area that they write about but who lacks the writing abilities to fully convey the concepts they present. Many of the illustrations in this book are handed to the reader without almost any written explanation of the techniques. The author seems to expect the reader to draw the necessary information from the pictures alone. For a combat expert this is fine, but for the novice this is less than satisfactory and perhaps even dangerous, if the student tries to perform the techniques in a real fight without a real understanding of how they should be properly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlisted shoes has nice quality leather top, but CHEAP SOLE!","review":"I've bought several pairs of Kenneth Cole Unlisted shoes.

Every single story in this collection has appeared before in Mike Resnick's ALETRNATE (fill in title) series or Bedford and Greenberg's WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN series, so if you have every volume of these prior collections you will be simply buyting a second copy of stories you already possess.

With my high resolution cameras (I have 3 high res cameras that overlap the area these cameras secured). I can see the IR lights from this camera out to about 15 feet past that there is very little light. Technically, the ir light probably does reach 30 feet but it's so little light that a 580 line camera with .001 lux can barely make it out.I have boxed back up three of them and put the other one over my front door so I can see when someone is at the door."},{"rating":"2","title":"Testimony by Ferron","review":"My first girlfriend intruduced me to Ferron's Music and I love it.

I'm a fan of his son, Lamberto Bava. This is a textbook example of how to shoot a horror film in color. He uses color to much the same effect as Argento in Suspiria. It's a murder mystery centering around a fashion house. If you're a fan of gialli, you simply can't go wrong with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"great film, lousy dvd","review":"Just to back up the very critical review of this dvd below, this is a major disappointment: the one star is for the quality of the dvd release, not the film, which is one of Bava's best pictures. The image here is really substandard, way below what should be expected from any serious dvd release in this day and age. Although it is anamorphic, it would be hard to call this in any way improved over the first VCI release; if anything, in sharpness and color, it might actually be worse. That a dvd release this mediocre is a rerelease is a travesty; if they want to get people to upgrade and buy again, it should be for a better product.

But that's not to say I didn't really enjoy it.Someone is killing models at a high fashion house, and there are plentyof suspects to go around.Bava's use of color is wonderful, if not quite up to what he did in his own\`Whip and the Body', and there's also very effective use of shadows andmoving lights.

Unfortunately, this DVD does not do this great film justice. The colors are muddled and the sound is a disgrace. Quite often the voices are not loud enough but the biggest problem is that sound and image are not in sync. With a dubbed film you cannot expect perfection but with this DVD the voices don't even come close to the mouth movements. It's a serious syncing problem as the sounds of doors slamming, women getting slapped, footsteps and knocking on doors do not match the images. It's all very distracting making watching this DVD quite difficult. I was very disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design!

Firstly, swords and wands are transposed, with swords representing fire and wands representing air. This would be OK to work with, except the card meaning are not representative of the elements....the meanings of the swords are still equated with knowledge, intellect, thought, justice and truth...but are now associated with fire, rather than air. The wands cards represent creativity, action, movement, enthusiasm, and career....but are classed under the element of air....this is rather confusing to new readers who are used to the Rider-Waite associations.The hierophant as elephant??

I love it the moment I opened the box. I wanted to purchase All-Clad but it was a little over my budget.

The nonstick coating was peeling. I bought the 3 1/2 qt and a 2 1/2 qt at the same time, about 3 years ago, each had a lifetime warantee. They were made in Korea, designed by All-Clad. The metal was heavy and solid, advertised as 5 mm.The replacement pan (the sauce pan being reviewed) is stamped 3 qt (I returned a 3 1/2 qt), but is identical in dimensions to my older 2 1/2 qt Emerilware, except 12 ounces lighter (yes, LIGHTER than the pan marked 2 1/2 qt). The metal is thinner, perhaps nearly 1/2 as thick, and I would never have bought the sauce pan of that thickness. This pan is made in China.I wouldn't buy this pan knowing what I know. I'd look for something heavier. And the lifetime warantee is no good to you, if they no longer make an item of the same quality as what you are returning.

It was interesting reading about India's past, but all-in-all the story and characters (especially the heroine, who without a care leaves her beloved hero for dead...twice?? and don't get me started on the ANNOYING relative) never really captured my attention and/or fondness."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried...","review":"You either love a Sutcliffe novel or you hate it... At least that's what I've always discovered...Notorious started out clever, witty and a breath of fresh air original, but it slowly but surely lost it's appeal. I did like the characters; Destiny was spunky and not the usual \\"lady of society\\" and Jason was a Lord (a high member of the Ton) but ran a team of undercover assassins.Destiny's father's in trouble in India and she and Jason go to save him.The point it started getting ridiculous was when Jason went undercover as a scarred captain of his ship and didn't reveal his identity to Destiny until later on in the story...Blah!I really tried to keep myself interested in this story, but it just got away from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting setting & sub-plot in India, so-so romance","review":"The book moved along nicely, cool bits of India's history, and it was interesting that they consummated their love so early on in the storyline. However those were the highlights. The heroine was one-dimensional and a little too perfect, young, and gorgeous. The hero was quite good... until he raped the heroine. I hate rape scenes in romance novels, where suddenly while being raped the heroine starts liking it. Please Ms. Sutcliffe! A Nasty, horrid scene. What a terrible thing for a young woman to read. Rape is violence, not romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book","review":"This book has certain moments, but it has too many faults for it to be a good book. First of all, in the 1800s, there was no such thing as colored contact lenses that the hero uses to disguise himself. The \\"makeup\\" he uses seems like it came out of Hollywood instead of the 19th century. There is use of quotes like, \\"What a tangled web we weave...\\", and other language which seems too modern. The subplot of the hero and his assassin brother was too 2-dimensional, as was many many of its side characters. I almost wanted to toss the book away, but I finished it because I was on a plane for 4 hours. It is NOT an entertaining book because of all the inconsistencies and time jumps. Oh yes, the heroine, who gets pregnant, is given opium....lovely. Don't bother reading this book.

It's been a long time since I was so completely entranced by a story. Jason and Destiny's love is a tangible thing, I found myself laughing, crying, gasping at the surprising plot twists. The incredibly descriptive scenery is the perfect background for the extraordinary love and passion these two share. England, South Africa, India. Ms. Sutcliffe's incredible talent transports you to these places in spell binding detail. Her use of secondary characters enlivens the story. I loved being on an emotional rollercoaster with Destiny and Jason. My husband is even reading the book, and enjoying it immensely. Congratulations, Katherine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Notorious--Different and Enjoyable","review":"This was my first book by Katherine Sutcliffe and it certainly won't be the last. Notorious is an enjoyable read with some interesting twists and a trip to a different locale--colonial India.So often in books set in the 1800's India is discussed, but rarely are we shown even a glimpse of Britain's occupation of this distant land. Sutcliffe shows us in great detail the perils of British Colonization.The hero , Lord Justin Batson, is a wonderful troubled alpha male, in the best sense of the term. He is a leader, trusted by his men and extremely good at his job as Cobra agent--until love comes into his life. Destiny is a strong woman, who is more then a match for Justin. I saw this as a Beauty and the Beast story and that particular scenario is a favorite of mine.This was a fun, fast read and I am hoping that Sutcliffe will give us Justin's brother Trevor's story in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book! 0 stars","review":"I love Katherine Sutcliffe, but this book was so horrible that I could not even finish it. I skipped and skimmed until the end. It's going straight to the trash can.The heroine Destiny was an evil person! She actually thought she may have killed the hero and did not even go back to check on him. She had no remorse and did not feel very guilty about it. Then when she and her annoying aunt go aboard the hero's ship, and discover that the hero is the captain-the aunt shoots him! Destiny doesn't even show that she cares that the stupid aunt shot him, while he is trying to save her father and everything. I HATED Destiny and her aunt's characters.

One shows what her hips and legs are doing and the other shows exactly what her arms are doing (Often skipped in other videos)The Dances--She does the full dance you've learned without her cueing at the end. Then she does the full dance again plus a couple extra(easy) steps in full dress to slower music.

Sometimes (particularly in the beginning of the story) it's difficult to tell which character is doing the speaking or thinking. For the most part, that problem straightens out as the story progresses, but then the plot becomes a bit convoluted. I never quite \\"got\\" the love that grew between Niall and Maura (the Romeo/Juliet main characters). Niall is violent and foul to her before they fall in love, and there's not a whole lot of repentance for it on his part, I think.The author piles on the tragedy (which sort of overwhelms the love story)by almost superfluously adding the massacre at Glencoe (when the Campbell clan slew the MacDonald clan) at the very end of the tale. The story also ends very abruptly.It's not a horrible read, but it's not very deep or involving one either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The only fiber product that really works!","review":"Have been using this product for over 5 years.

We own another I SPY computer game and it worked great. This one would not even launch. It was given as a gift purchased through Amazon but wrapped up and handed to my son, not given through the mail, so no packing slip. I tried to return this. First, I needed to know the giver's email address and home address to verify that this was indeed bought at Amazon. Fortunately, I had that information. The customer service person verified the game was bought at Amazon, but through a third party seller, so they were not obligated to honor a return. She did send me the third party information. They would not take opened software back. How do you know it doesn't work if you don't open it up and try it? I just spent eight dollars UPS shipping it back to Scholastic in hopes of an exchange.

All systems are Intel Core 2 Duo's running Leopard. The problem seems to be with the current version of Leopard 10.5.4 and the X3100 does not support the \\"thousands of colors\\" option that this game will require. Until Apple corrects this problem with the driver, I don't think this game will work with the current generation of MacBooks or MacAir notebooks.I bought a new MacBook last week for my daughter to use and she really wants to run the \\"I Spy\\" games.

My favorite aspects: beautifully detailed graphics, a fun laboratory animation with 7 ghost experiments, and the concentration games which are a challenge at many levels.

In lieu of this logic, Mr. Knight's proofs rely on nonsensical statements and circular logic. In an apparent effort to hide his flawed reasoning, he fills the book with obviously logical statements and belabors the logic behind them.The math is clearly intended to intimidate readers into accepting his points. Its misuse is analogous to the Christian misuse of the threat of hell to intimidate prospective Christians into accepting the Bible.I'm not saying that you should not buy this book. If you are looking for a well-reasoned treatise against Christianity, THIS IS NOT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly argued views, faulty reasoning","review":"Let me just say first of all, I'm an atheist. I wasn't offended by the views of the author or anything. But some of his statements just don't hold water.For example, he claims that the belief in Hell is necessary to Christianity. That's not true. It's possible to not believe in Hell and still be a Christian. Also, I couldn't go any farther after reading his argument for the existence of an afterlife. It was terrible -- it might convince a three year old. He also manages to muddle up the difference between knowing that something happened, and whether it actually happened or not.If you want to read some poorly structured, informally written, and terribly argued material, this book is for you. If you want to read arguments that you can believe, go elsewhere.On the plus side, I will say that his impassioned comdemnation of campus preachers was somewhat moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very immature writing style","review":"I'm as anti-Christian as the next agnostic, but I have to express my disappointment with this book. The author's attitude is so snotty and sarcastic that no one who holds a differing view will be persuaded by his arguments.

After that it goes downhill fast. The author's arrogance is amusing here but quickly grows annoying. He tries to appear intelligent and well-educated but is betrayed by his repeated use of the word \\"irregardless\\". The so-called proof of the existence of an afterlife in the second chapter is laughable. Maybe one could make a game of spotting flaws in the arguments throughout the rest of the book.Faulty reasoning aside, the exposition is mediocre and the ideas presented are nothing new.

If it is used as such, it is an excellent resource. If I must criticize, however, I am worried that it may be too simplistic. As any dental student knows, there's more than one way to skin a cat and there are about a thousand ways to formulate an adequate treatment plan for a patient. Again, if the book is used as tool to guide your thoughts, it will be useful.

This is a nice little \\"guide\\" book on treatment planning. It's not in depth because the very nature of planning a treatment is unique and not completely standardized. How can you write a book to prepare the reader for a thousand different possibilities? You can't. The flowcharts were good, but it's acknowledged that you don't have to follow the directions step by step in real life. Also, I must comment on the readability of the text. It's simple to read and understand, which in my opinion is hard to achieve in an educational book. The only thing I would complain is that the author seems to focus a lot more on perio than the other fields (endo, ortho, surgery, etc).

Unfortunately, you're not going to find it here as - which is a pity as it really is an interesting story.Tony Wilson has essentially rewritten the movie script, adding a few small snippets here and there, expanding on other aspects and, very occasionally, replacing the movie version with the truth.

Also, buy some of all clads recommended cleaner, Bar Keeper's friend. It works like magic to take off the stuck on gunk.Thanks for reading"},{"rating":"2","title":"great intro to quality cookware","review":"i've seen cookware like this at +70.00 before and have always wanted one for weekend omlets but could not justify the price. at 20.00, not only does it make great omlets but it gives me a way to try other dishes...and maybe lead into other quality cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money...","review":"Don't waste your money. Buy the 8 in pan. It's a real All-Clad. As I read these reviews, I keep seeing people rave about how good All-Clad is, not really how an individual pan actually performers. Yes, I have All-Clad. Lots of All-Clad. When the company brings out a new pan, I buy it. In the small pans that I use the most, I am likely to have 2 of each. But, I don't recommend the 7-? inch. All-Clad likes to bring out pans that are almost a \`try me'; as was the case with the 7 ? inch and 1 qt pan a few years ago. They priced them attractively. To me the pan is handle heavy. It does not sit properly on my electric stove. Thus it has poor heat conductivity. For a few dollars more, buy the 8 inch fry pan.

This 7\\" fry pan is not the same as those made in the USA: it does NOT have the unbelievably smooth mirror finish on the interior surface that contributes to All-Clad's great reputation. It is a cheaper version made in China with an uneven graded interior cook surface. Please be aware before you decide to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you'd expect","review":"This is a fine SMALL pan, with the emphasis on SMALL.

Moral to this story: Check your Gold Box as often as you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"get out a ruler and measure 7 inches before you buy","review":"I bought this to try out the All-clad line of cookware. I thought this would be good to fry a couple of eggs since I like to flip them without a spatula. Man was I wrong. This pan is so heavy that flipping would be difficult even if I could prevent the eggs from sticking and the handle is so heavy relative to the pan that it won't lay flat on the burner. It's not practical for much and I never use it anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"all-clad stainless 7 inch fry pan","review":"The handle is poorly designed.

This is especially apparent on the 2 bonus tracks \\"Hong Kong Garden\\" and \\"Staircase Mystery\\" which are in fact 2dB louder than the 10 other tracks. I want to ask the mastering engineer - What were you thinking? I ripped the CD and opened up \\"Staircase Mystery\\" with Sony Soundforge and you can see the damage. All the peaks have been trimmed off. Terrible. If you are going to re-master an album, the sound on the newer edition should be as good, or better than the original.

I'm a musician and would prefer to avoid this side of the business unless it's essential for me to get into it. I like making and playing music more than I like listening to that of others.

The \\"cover\\" makes a great crinkling noise, which my little one just loves. The writing is playful, fun, and rhymes. And the colors are bright and cheery to hold even my 5 month old's attention.

I recently purchased two more Roger Priddy books, Squishy Turtle and Friends, and Big Rex and Friends. He loves them also. These are great first books, and our favorites above all others!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 1st book","review":"My 5 month old granddaughter enjoys looking at this book. She likes the crinkling sounds and the fact that it is easy for her to grasp. I like the fact that I don't need to worry about her ripping pages or hitting herself with something as hard as a board book. She doesn't quite get the different textures yet, but that means the book will be interesting for many more months. I hope this will be a start on a lifetime of a love of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just fine - he's only 6 months old!","review":"As a first book for a baby it's fine. I'll ask him for a review in a couple of years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable book for small child","review":"I bought this book for an 11-month-old child, and she is enjoying it tremendously. It's not only cloth, but padded, so it's practically \\"destructive-proof\\", yet the pictures and colors are intellectually stimulating. This would make a great gift for a baby shower, also."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good choice, but fades in wash.","review":"My 5 mos old daughter enjoys chewing and manipulating this book since it has lots of fabric flaps to tug (ex: as insect wings) textures (shiny fly eyes, worm skin) and bright colors.The cover is crinkly and it closes with Velcro. It would have been nice if it had a fold back Velcro tab so you can wash the book open without it snagging on things. It also would have been nice if the snail was a squeaker or if the spider would dangle from the web on a cloth cord. The little spider legs are cute, but very spindly and small -- watch out in case they come off with wear.I'm a bit concerned about the colors fading/bleeding in the wash but overall it's one of the more attractive cloth books for babies and I think it was a good choice. Perhaps soaking it in vinegar when it is first new would have helped with the color fastness?My 6 year old niece enjoyed reading the page rhymes out loud, so it ought to have a good lifespan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Bee and Friends","review":"The first time my daughter played with this book she bit a hole in the plastic which covers the snail.

Well, when we opened up the new book, low and behold, there is no spider page! It seems that this book doesn't have two of the character's that the older version has! Amazon needs to update their website and Priddy Books needs to go back to the original! Please be aware that your book may not match the book online!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fuzzy Bee has been downsized","review":"I have no problem with the book - my daughter loves the characters in it - just the fact that Priddy Books has apparently eliminated two characters (Sally Spider and Fly to be exact). The only reason I know this is because I recently bought (and returned) Fuzzy Bee based on our enjoyment of an older version. The reduced characters/number of pages wouldn't necessarily be a problem except that Priddy Books is apparently trying to pull a fast one - the copyright date, ISBN, etc. are all exactly the same...only there's two fewer characters and pages than before. Perhaps there's a good explanation for it, but Priddy Books won't return my phone calls. So I'm giving Fuzzy Bee the lowest rating out of principle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not wash!","review":"So I read all the reviews before buying the book and felt that I could wash this in the washer/dryer. We have a front loader one and I put in a laundry bag to make it 'extra safe'... I wanted to wash it before giving to our daughter since she loves putting these in her mouth... well it's now all crumpled and has dull lifeless colors. I try to get her to enjoy it but to no avail. If you get this my advice is to not wash in the washer.

I love our cloth books for that reason! Fuzzy Bee and Friends is one of our favorites. The colors, strong contrasts, and different textures are very exciting to our three month old and have been for the last month! He has just started turning pages, and likes to look at and touch the images almost as much as he likes to try and wedge the whole book in his mouth. The text is short, and the rymes aren't obnoxious so reading it is still fun even after the 100th time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these books!","review":"And so does my child.Throw it in the washer (even though it says otherwise)...

It's a little tough to get the bottles back into their straps if you keep running while taking a drink and I've found I need to break stride to get the bottles in back snugged back down, but the tight straps also keep jostling/sloshing to a bare minimum.

It was the type that had a bicycle type biddon in a rear pouch. Apart from it banging about on my lower back I found it easy to get that one bottle out for a drink and returned even while running. The elastic bits on the side near the velcro fastener let it down in that they stretched and lost it's elasticity. So I looked for a replacement. I liked the idea of the four smaller bottles spreading the weight evenly around my hip. No more back slamming. I wanted to keep the extra pockets etc for carrying ipods, money and whatever.The only let down for me is I find it difficult to remove and replace the new small bottles. I have to stop, walk and drink. Suppose I'll get used to it.I don't miss the elastic either. Keep up the good workmanship. I still use my old one sometimes, seems like they are made to last.Anyhow, g'day and enjoy.

The first was that I needed a way to bring liquids on my long runs and the second was that I wanted a way to tie my dog's leash up instead of holding it during my runs.The 4, 8oz bottles work well because you can bring as much fluid as you want up to 32oz and they are secured with elastic holders and straps so they won't bounce out.. I never have a problem with the belt bouncing or moving.The belt also creates a nice tie off point for my dog's leash. The elastic strap is strong so if she starts pulling me it doesn't loosen.I haven't had to use the pockets but they are big enough to hold a cell phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"provocative exploration: compares and contrasts","review":"This book is not afraid to ask the tough questions, or make the tough comparisons.

Sebastian (obviously the only other brother left) was trying to put an end to their mothers' suffering. Kyle was the brother caught between the two groups, just wanting his mother to get better and to help himself get better.Personally, I felt as if the moive were building up to something...and then just dropped off a cliff somewhere.

The mixture fortells the perfect recipe for a fine album. \\"Take Me Back\\" fortifies perfect liberation from confounded confusion while \\"We Hunger\\" sinks its teeth into something untold.

It features several up-tempo country rock songs, including Mission Temple, Tarzan and Jane, and a blistering remake of Keep Your Hands to Yourself. Another key song is the heart-renching ballad They Don't Understand.I think this is their best CD since Six Days on the Road.

Nevertheless, sales professionals occasionally need to be reminded of the basics lest we become stagnant or arrogant in our approach.Among the important points covered include:1. People buy from whom they trust.2. Type of communication techniques that build trust.3. Closing results are better when you establish rapport at the beginning of the sales presentation.4. Ask open-ended questions and allow time for your prospect to give feedback.5. The art of active listening is a seldom practiced but powerful tool.6. Find out what best suits your prospect and become more prospect-oriented instead of product-oriented.7. Successful sales professionals are persistent.8.

In fact, she demonstrates the superiority of the autodidactic experience as opposed to formalized education.But beyond just illustrating the benefits of \\"unschooling\\" as she calls it and portraying the pitfalls of formal education, Llewellyn shows how teaching oneself can be done successfully. She also includes persuasive techniques to convince stubborn parents to allow their children the chance to educate themselves. Unfortunately for me, I realized too late that I had an alternative to forced learning. Most of my current learning has been done independently, and I can only speculate as to what I would have accomplished had I spent time actually reading and learning than counting the ceiling tiles in my English class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Genius","review":"Even though I am 21 years old, I still find this book very useful. At age 16 I left high school for personal problems. I spent most of my time reading books. I felt that by leaving school I was losing my education. This book teaches you different. It shows you how to leave school and get a real education. This book is very inspiring and it works. Self-teaching is the best way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read it First","review":"I liked this book - but I am a 43 year old mother.

I would urge parents to read it first or simultaneously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideas that most people just can't bring themselves to think.","review":"Most people were miserable in school. Most people have been convinced that school was good, even necessary for them. The unfortunate result is that many people believe that being miserable was good for them and will be good for their children. This is far from a healthy attitude.This book presents evidence that even the most ardent defender of the status quo will be hard-pressed to dismiss out of hand; the unschoolers who went to Harvard, the youthful acheivers in every field from theatre to animal science, the testimonials of parents who report that their 'dropout' kids are now happier, more relaxed, less sullen, and brighter.Though the author's tone is often that of the impassioned hippie lady, it adds to rather than detract from this essentially idealistic and hopeful book.This book is for all the teenagers, and all the adults who still have the spine to think that just maybe they didn't deserve to be miserable as kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Liberation Handbook","review":"The Teenage Liberation Handbook is great for people considering home schooling. It's very persuasive about the benefits of home schooling versus institutional schooling - and great for converting those who don't believe in home schooling. It's really about how to make the leap out of school. Once you've already made the leap, you probably don't need this book so much, but keep it to lend to the skeptics."},{"rating":"2","title":"The teenage liberation handbook. . .","review":". . . is a good discussion of \\"unschooling,\\" the philosophy that children and teens should take control of their own education. It was sufficiently in-depth in its handling of various topics to make it a good manual for teens who are interested. I would have given this book 5 stars but the author is very biased in her political views and this shows through in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Comments on The Teenage Liberation Handbook","review":"This book contains many excellent ideas about self-education, and would be beneficial to the outside-of-school life of a traditional high school student, as well as to an unschooler.However, this book frequently tells the reader that their problems are not their own fault. Everyone likes to hear that, but it can't possibly be completely true. The writing is frequently, and unnecessarily, bitter and mean-spirited.Much of the book is unnecessarily devoted to criticizing traditional school. In any work of fiction, the protagonist appears stronger with the presence of a strong antagonist, but the author presents unschooling as the alternative to something undesirable and intolerable. She also ignores the group of potential unschoolers who are happy with school and/or succeed in that environment. Unschooling is not just for those who hate school."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book helped me personally","review":"I think this book gave me a focus for the thoughts that I already had. I hated high school and didn't know what to do about it. This book helped me to figure out what I wanted to do and how to do it as well as how to tell my parents. I would recommend this to teenagersas well as parents. My mom actually gave me this book and I think that it is a good book for parents to read with their kids. Also it might be helpful for educators and school counselors. It will help them to understand what it is that we feel the educational system is doing to us. The reason I rated this and 8 and not a 10 is because I wasn't really interested in homeschooling and that was a big part of the book and what it was about. Still it offered a big help to me when I needed it. I appreciate that when there doesn't seem to be much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teenage Liberation","review":"This book has expressed the thoughts that have been hidden in everyones mind for a century because of being supressed and considered stupid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!

I am still stuck miserablly in school, but with a greater understanding and a stong will to convince my parents to let me out.

We know from summer vaction experiences how much a teenager CAN sleep, and trust me if school did not start early in the mourning we would not be up! So trust me, homeschool does not work!

My only concern:","review":"Skip the rant on bureaucratic problems (& story) if you want and go straight to Chapter 3 to start reading.I wish it would talk more about people's experiences and ideas for learning to replace the venting chapters.After reading it at 16, I was inspired to take my frustration with the lack of motivation for learning I saw with my classes and made a website for resources on autodidacticism. So If you're not confident enough to totally overhaul the system, you can at least do something about it. Making this site led me to talk with actual lifelong learners and advocates about their thoughts on knowledge and education, the process they underwent and so forth. Regardless of how you are conditioned to think what education, learning, school, is - the book does open up a new way to look at things, even if you disagree (provided you're open to it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This is my favorite book by my favorite author.

I've done a series of comparisons of identical shots with my 3 year old Canon G3 4 megapixel camera. In my tests, the G3 is better in several important areas: exposure accuracy, resolution and macro capability. Without question, the SD550 is a fun little camera to carry and have ready at a moments notice. However, it does not produce prints which are as good as other (larger) cameras with CCDs having 7 to 8 megapixels, nor, in my case, 4 megapixels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Lil' Camera","review":"I bought this camera along with the underwater housing and took it scuba diving in Bonaire and was very pleased with how easy it was to use and with the quality of the pics that I took underwater.

For more dramatic shots, I use my SLR, but a lot of times, when it is a closeup/macro shot of just everyday things, I find that using my SD550 on macro works just as well.For casual shots, I use this camera a lot. People always ask me what camera I use because it's so crisp, vivid, and clear. I've bought other powershots for my brothers and my mom, but none of them perform as well or as consistently, and I should have probably figured out by now why, but I haven't.

Whew.) I have now owned it two years and just lately have more difficulty with fuzzy photos and notice it is not as great in lesser lighting situations.

The only other collection I would take over this one is the expensieve box collection, but this 2 CD set is very well put together.

This is my first stainless pan - previously used Calphalon non-stick. I always thought I would have to use quite a bit of oil or butter to cook with stainless. Not the case. I used just enough olive oil to lightly coat the bottom of the pan and probably could have used a little less. It cooked the food to perfection, evenly and quickly. No burning, just the right amount of browning. Cleaned up easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best cookware brand I've ever used","review":"Consistent, durable, and will last a life time if you take proper care of it. I will never go back to a lesser-quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"My 3 quart All Clad Stainless Saute Pan has warped.","review":"I used the pan several years on a gas stove. I never left the pan empty on the flame, used high heat, nor did I submerge a hot pan in water after using it. After I moved into a new home in Spain where I have to use ceramic stove I noticed the pan was slightly but annoyingly damaged - warped. Using the pan on a gas burner does not show warping defects easily unlike glass/ceramic cook tops. I contacted All Clad and they of suggested that I had misused it. They asked me to mail it to All Clad for evaluation which I do not want to do since I now live in Europe. The cost of shipping to US is fairly high and paying possible customs charges if All Clad finds the pan was defective and wanted to ship a new one to me. Disappointed in All Clad customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you buy only one pan, make it this one","review":"Yeah, yeah, it's expensive. Sure, sure, you could get a whole set of substandard pans. But you can't 'go cheap' on a saute pan. If you do, you'll burn stuff, and generally be an unhappy cook, so that's why you need a nice heavy one. I've got loads of cookware, but this is the most used item in my kitchen. Along with a good chef's knife and one saucepan, and maybe one to boil pasta, you'd be set. All Clad is a superior cookware to other brands, and I've tried or tested all of them. It's got a lifetime guarantee, so if you space the cost of the pan over, say, 20 years, it's a great value. You'll go through six other cheap pans in the same time period. Spend the cash, go All Clad."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARPED - A Couple of My All-Clad Pieces Warped","review":"I've had this pan for years and I use it maybe a couple of times a month. I probably have 12 pieces of all-clad and I don't cook everyday. Many of my pans, including this one, are beginning to WARP. After having researched this on the web (lots of people have this problem) and learning that even if I had registered them (warranty) they are too old. I was informed by the company that warping is a sign of misuse - hmmm, I used mine to cook with.So I now get to throw them away and replace them. I remember thinking when I first began to buy/collect them that they were a lifetime purchase/investment. Well now 10 years later I'm throwing them away. I think they should have lasted longer for the price ...I haven't decided whether to replace them with a more disposable brand (cheaper to throw away) or a higher end brand (last longer?). Either way I think you should know before you buy them that they may warp without explanation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome wrench","review":"Great tool, does exactly what I want it to.

This line doesn't have a rolled lip so that pouring is more difficult than it should be. Of course with a 4qt pan that usually isn't an issue.If you are strong enough to lift a 4qt pan by the long handle don't get this version, get the one without the lip. Why? Because the loop handle prevents both the steamer and the double boiler inserts from seating firmly. They work, but it isn't as good as the non loop version. Now admitly using a 4qt pan for steaming is overkill, but if the 3qt version is in use, or you didn't buy that one too, you will wish you had the non loop version.These pans are heavy, (Although not as heavy as pure copper pans)and a gallon of fluid is too, so that if you are small the extra loop would be beneficial for moving the pot from stove to sink, so like everything its a tradeoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is described","review":"I ordered this pot thinking that I would be getting a shiny stainless steel pot. The Product Description clearly states that the exterior of the pot is shiny and the words Stainless collection are used a few times. However, I received a Brushed Steel Professional pot. Very disappointing. We'll see how the seller handles the return."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG ITEM","review":"The item sold by Firefly Buys is not as advertised by Amazon. This is NOT the classic 3-ply Stainless line. What arrived was a 5-ply version with a brushed stainless (not polished) exterior. Very heavy and does not match my other All-Clad pieces. The lid also had a poor fit on my other pots with the same diameter. Model number on the box is D55204.

The acting is top notch, the direction is top shelf and the writing is unparalleled.

The default sensitivity was too high for where I fish so I turned it down per the instructions. A few minutes later, it would go back to the factory default setting though I had not touched it. It also showed very deep readings when I went over a grassy bottom. This is a software issue. The settings are not as easy to set as one might think due to the touchiness of the system. Again, another software issue.My concluding impressions are that the build is moderately solid but the software issues with the product make it difficult to use and enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Red Rocker metal!!!!!!!","review":"Sammy Hagar's best classic work is his solo albums. He was decent in VH, but his solo records cooked. When he left Montrose, Sammy started recording classic America metal albums. Sammy is one of the most underated heavy metal artist of his generation(much like Ted Nugent). VOA has great songs all over it. The band sounds tight and Sammy shows who the better VH frontman was when it comes to singing! This is a great classic old school metal record. Sadly, Sammy only thinks about tropical drinks and Mexico now. His new band the \\"Wabo Wabo\\" or whatever is no match for the group on this record. But, Sammy will always be the \\"Red Rocker\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok","review":"The functions are great. The design needs some work. The buttons get inadvertently pushed all the time, and the cloth strap is awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her best books in years.","review":"An excellent book although written in the overly-familiar style of many of her other books. The difference this time is her wit. Her sarcastic descriptions of the obnoxious rich people in the book are hysterical. She is descriptive, critical and condemning all in the same sentence.I don't understand why writers inflict us with so many novels about the \\"problems\\" of rich people. Rich people are not all that interesting. But, in this case, Oates brings us an edge to the characters not often found in the \\"I'm rich but I'm miserable\\" genre of fiction.Many familiar themes appear from her huge body of work. She has a style that is unshakable and unchangable. She repeats herself and it's either good reading or terrible reading (e.g. We Were The Mulvaneys). In this case it's great reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Novel I Wish I Could Write","review":"This novel is nothing short of dazzling. There's so much about it that I find spectacular: poetic and metaphoric descriptions of characters, places, inner lives. The overall structure of the book is fantastic in its simplicity; Oates' manipulation of point of view and time are masterful. I find it gripping and sorry that I'm reading it as quickly as I am. It's unbelievable that at this point in this writer's already exceptional career she could reach new heights such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of her better ones but silly","review":"The story kept my attention and I was amused by the characters although not one of them rang true. I was also dismayed by the author's depiction of grown children as greedy ingrates. The author apparently does not realize that happy relationships between parents and adult children are the norm, not the exception. You can also tell that Oates, who has cats for pets, is not a dog-lover. A silly book meant to amuse and obtain insight into the author's dislikes butdon't look for anything deeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless and boring","review":"I ordered this book because I was reading it for a book club I founded. One of the book club members had said that he was a big fan of this author and had read amazing stuff from her in the past. However, as we read through the book, at each meeting this same person said he was thoroughly disappointed by this book and felt that her talent had apparently run dry. While I haven't read anything else by Joyce Carol Oates, this book does not inspire me to explore her further. The characters were totally unreal, the story meandered from pointless episode to pointless episode, and it was quite the drag to finally complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"My First, and Perhaps Last Taste of Joyce Carol Oates","review":"Anyone out there a fan of Joyce Carol Oates? Never having read anything by her, I was given Middle Age, A Romance by a friend. I tried to read the book because I enjoy trying out authors I haven't read before. Made it through part of the first chapter, then jumped to the ending pages, and finally somewhat skimmed the pages in between.My reading time is precious and the characters in this story did nothing to engage me in wanting to spend the time to meet them or know more of their lives.

I love the rest of the album because it actually has meaning and Souixie and the Banshees don't try to make hatefull gothic and pity-me songs but rather they sing about important and political issues as well in a very artistic way."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm writing this review because I have to disagree.","review":"I've seen \\"Arabian Knights\\" and \\"Christine\\" cited as the premiere tracks on this album, but I disagree. Most people who buy this album nowadays are the uber-goths, who will appreciate the gloomy, plodding \\"Red Light.\\" Trust me on this. The other songs are good, but they're so poppy and punky they might pass for Ramones tracks to the undistinguished ear (well musically at least).I've given this album 4 stars, but there are better albums to buy than this one. To really know Siouxsie, you need this album, Once Upon A Time, Twice Upon A Time, Juju, Kiss in the Dreamhouse, and Hyaena. But don't buy anything after Hyaena, because this bands goes downhill fast (Kiss Them For Me? No thanks.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Sound & Extras!","review":"The bonus tracks are as follows...Warner Chappell Demos of Christine, Eve White/Eve Black, Arabia (Lunar Camel), Sitting Room (Unreleased Track) & Paradise Place.Polydor Demos of Desert Kisses, Hybrid & Happy House.Plus the 7\\" A-Side of Israel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Synthpop at it's finest","review":"A drastic change from the first two of the Banshees albums. Not a stitch of punk, goth or whatever classification people try to tag to Siouxsie and her boys, though frankly I never heard goth in any of her work save Juju, where Arabian Nights actually appears, read earlier review on page. It seems that Miss Sioux was a pretty good member in standing of bands from that particular time period who were instrumental in forshadowing the sounds of many bands to come.

I decided I wanted an embosser since I own so many books and really love reading! I perused all of the ones available on Amazon and read the reviews as I wanted to be certain I purchased the right one for me. I will say the customer service was excellent and they were so prompt in their e-mail responses, I was very impressed. I do love the design and they were more than willing to work with me on customizing my stamp plate at no extra charge, which I thought was wonderful. The product arrived and it is really quite beautiful! My only complaint is that it is somewhat difficult to use and I am not sure that is a design flaw but the nature of trying to stamp a book! Overall, I would recommend this purchase. It is gorgeous and the embossing is very very cool!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality--will take practice!","review":"I gave this to my husband as a gift, and he loved it!

The embosser is suprisingly small, but strong. It works with anything as thin as a napkin or thick as a business card. I was especially impressed by the customer service. The world would be a better place if all companies operated like this one. I was promptly emailed to ask about my custom logo design. Then they worked with me quickly to get it exactly how I wanted it. Total time between placing the order and getting the item shipped was three days. Way impressive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I picked it up","review":"After Light Bearer's Daughter (which I did not like at all), I had lost faith in O. R. Melling but this book has restored it. Dana was not so annoying and I got to hear about grown up Gwen and Laurel, which was nice (and actually the only reason I picked it up at all). I got a kick out of Dana's aunts every time that they showed up. I only wish that the original Company of Seven would have had a larger role. All in all, this was a nice way to round off the series. I know now that I shouldn't have bothered to read Light Bearer's Daughter as it didn't really add anything. My advice to anyone out there who has read Hunter's Moon or Summer King (both excellent) is to just skip straight to this installment, which is of equal quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Fantasy Fiction","review":"Fantasy is my favourite genre.

I almost cried when the book was over, because it was so brilliant. Yes, it was a bit draggy, and the ending wasn't explained too properly, but the plots, the ideas, the exquisite description of every single detail makes up for all that.

I was looking forward to another excellent book, but I was very disappointed. I didn't connect with any of the characters and I especially didn't care for the wartime descriptions; they didn't seem realistic. The twins were not characterized well; I didn't feel I knew them. Too much time passed, too quickly for any real feelings to develop. I have to admit I just skimmed the last half of the book to see what the big mystery re: the twins was. And that was anticlimatic. I liked the first novel so much better. It hardly seems to be the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matters of Chance would make a good tv movie of the week.","review":"This book had an excellent beginning, filled with promise but quickly devolved into predictability. Most affecting section was the main character's wartime experiences. There was some expectation that, once home, some dramatic conflict would start, since he was changed by his wartime exploits. Instead, we are subjected to a relentless onslought of perfect people who always do the right, noble thing. Bits of historic arcana are sprinkled in for some odd reason -- perhaps to remind us that there is a real world out there. Subjects such as homosexuality, adoption, adultery are all reacted to with grace and equanimity. Isn't pretty to think so. I don't have a problem with noble and uplifting characters -- but there has to some bad guys, if for no other reason than texture!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good read","review":"This book is about the 40's and 50's; it is written in the prose, style, and sentiment of those years; it has the manners and the voice of those decades. The writing is formal, the themes are idealistic, the plot is secondary to the characters. If you enjoy good writing about a special, simpler time, you'll enjoy this book. If you're strung out on 90's deconstructivism and can't or don't want to understand the codes and morays by which some people used to live, then you might think the book is trite or the author is somehow a betrayal to her gender (?). I for one found the female characters very strong and interesting, but then I think that mothers can be strong, passionate figures without being lawyers as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perfectly Boring!","review":"I agree with a couple of the previous reviews. This book was just packed with perfect people who always have perfect, politically correct, supportive reactions to EVERYTHING that is thrown their way. It is so boring because it is so predictable.

But other then that these are really yummy as a snack especially if you're on the go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unparalelled mood music","review":"This is an amazing work. I give it 4 stars only because Gabriel raised the bar for everyone with 'Passion' (also available here at Amazon). It is not only wonderful music to think, study, or get intimate to, it is also a window into Peter Gabriel's evolution as a songwriter, composer, and experimentalist. 'Slow Marimbas,' for example, is actually the beginning portion of 'I Don't Remember' with a slowed down tempo. If it's between this and Passion, get Passion first. If you're on a Gabriel binge, put this baby in your cart without delay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never before has there been a stinkier blast of foul wind","review":"Having lived in Estonia and having become familiar with the culture and music, I was amazed at what junk music these people like. How many Americans know the German disco bands that Estonians love like Scooter, DJ BOBO and Captain Jack? Well, Maarja follows in the tradition of horrible music liked by Estonians. Her voice strains at every twist and turn, the lyrics could have been written by a three year old, and the album is way over produced. When the music industry emits pungent bursts of foul gas like this album, we all need to cower in a corner and guard our Pink Floyd and Led Zepplin CDs. Please do not waste your money on this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd","review":"I first heard Marjaa's music in 1999 when they used it on General Hospital for Lucky Spencer's dream wedding after he \\"died\\".

It is very mellow and very touching."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!","review":"If, like me, you're a fan of the Eurovision Song Contest, you'll already know Maarja, and love the sound of her voice. I'm sure you'll also be delighted with \\"Hold Onto Love\\" the English language version of her Dublin 1997 Eurovision song \\"Keelatud Maa\\". Even if you've never heard of her before, or heard her fantastic voice, you'll love this album. What a marvellous variety of styles and songs, all with Maarja's incomparable voice.

I was there when Aol was running its flight sim. Yes there are a few games out there with better graphics but they dont tuch the game play that FA 3.5 has.

I can honestly say that this game has a long way to go before I would recomend it to anybody. The game came with no instructions and or documentation. There is an online file you can read but I would have to say that it way too vague. Graphics are ok, but not as good as IL-2. The worst problem was with the game play. The servers are horrible including lag and random dropouts and disconnects. There is a help room, but after waiting for half an hour trying to some help I left. I also have to caution parents with young children (as I) about the language used in some of the arenas. Even with system operators monitoring the room, this still continued. Too bad, because it looks like this game could be fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"No luck is bad luck","review":"I had no luck getting Fighter Ace 3.5 to work on my PCs. I installed it on Windows 2000 and XP. When I try to fly, the plane stays in a left turn. You have to keep correcting the plane by countering with right turns. I contacted the support group and tried every fix they suggested. However, the problem has not been resolved. I would strongly suggest another game choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game in not ready for the public!","review":"Even though FA3.5 has possibilities, I can honestly say that in it's current state it has too many bugs to be enjoyable. It seems that Jaleco rushed this product out too quickly. The game has been out for several months and still there has been no patches to fix any of the current problems. The constant scoring issues as well as the ineffectiveness of any of the game designers to keep the players apprised of any progress has driven many long time players and squads to other online games. I hope Jaleco can resolve the game issues soon.Rilak"},{"rating":"2","title":"Created Gift Baskets","review":"Who doesn't enjoy popcorn!

It has 6 different activities that really help with important learning skills for his age group. I Spy has helped with learning to recognize and put together patterns, following directions, and independent thinking...and it's fun! The software uses familiar looking objects, such as colorful toys and beads. Other software packages have left us feeling that there should be more, but we really enjoy I Spy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute.","review":"This is a very cute set of games all based on the I Spy books. In one game the kids search for items just like in the book, in another game they sort objects into venn circles. My two going on three year old son enjoys playing this for about a half an hour at a time. This helps develop visual discrimination among other things.Having said all of that, this is one of my least favorite computer games to watch him play. Compared to some of the others he has, I find this one to be a bit boring. But it's not me that is playing it. I'd rate it a high four or low five because of this one reason. Otherwise I think it's a fine set of games.The pictures are excellent. The skills that children learn in these games are good pre reading skills and that is good.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfectly suited for preschoolers","review":"My son just turned three and this program is perfectly suited to his skills. The six differect games within the program provide a good variety of activities. There's even one game where you can create you own I Spy page to print out. The oral directions are very clear and simple for little ones who cannot yet read.I believe this game is time well spent on the computer. The program presents challenging thinking games and not just mindless flash. We also like the music that introduces and ends the program."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with my computer; a brand new Dell","review":"This software will not work with my computer which has Windows XP Home on it.

There are a very limited number of \\"screens,\\" and they don't even randomize their arrangement.It's a shame, because the puzzles with the circles (think Venn diagrams from elementary school math) are a wonderful twist.Therefore, I have to say the game \\"has no legs.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Entry Level Laminator","review":"This is a solid product overall.It's a little clunky to try and use at first, but once I got a feel for using it a few times...it produced clean lamination with few bubbles or errors.There are \\"higher end\\" laminators out there, and if you laminate on a regular basis, you might want to look at others first. But if you only laminate once in awhile, this is the perfect one for the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a great item, however....","review":"I got this laminator to laminate the hand-crocheted bookmarks that I make in order to keep them from getting torn or dirty. It's a great little machine, however the instructions leave a lot to be desired. They are very basic. The two whole pages are just the simple how-tos and lack a lot of information. This setup is perfect for someone who has owned a laminator before.Now, for the things that came with the machine... There is a good sized package of laminating pouches, the laminator itself is a beautiful machine and very easy to operate.The only complaint that I have is the lack of instructions and I can't wait to laminate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great laminator","review":"My only beef with this is the instructions are not clear at all, and they really don't give you information on how to use it.I have only tried the hot lamination, as they didn't include pouches for the cold laminator. But the hot works great. Tried it on several items, and was very happy with all of them (all were paper).Great item, highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Little Laminator","review":"I teach school and I am sometimes in need of a quick lamination, usually of something small. With only one laminator for the school, and it oversized, I usually wait until I have several items that need laminating before I use it. When I found the Fellowes Cosmic 125 Laminator, I was excited because I saw a quick fix to those little issues that seem to pop up in a classroom.The Fellowes Cosmic 125 Laminator is perfect for small items; it isn't large enough to do a poster, but can easily handle anything slightly larger than a regular piece of notebook paper. It has both hot and cold settings; I had decidedly better luck with the hot setting than I did with the cold. It came with 10 laminating sheets, which I quickly used for a myriad of small projects. I'm pretty excited about having such a unique tool right in my classroom, and I'm looking forward to continuing to use it for years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features but kept locking up!","review":"When I did my anaylsis for features vs. cost the audiovox came out very high on my list. It was very simple to use, it came with the maps preloaded on an SD card, it had an excellent mounting bracket, multiple views and many POI. I knew I was in trouble when I first went to use it I had it hit the reset button. Once I did that it worked great for the day, but the next morning it was locked up again and I had to reset it. With each reset I lost my waypoints. It did everything it advertised, but it just kept locking up (it is a windows based product so I should of expected it). After about 4 or 5 more attempts I boxed it up and shipped it back. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible GPS (NVX226)","review":"I bought the GPS NVX226 (Ver. 2) about one year ago; used one time on the trip to Los Angeles which had given me lots of headache, the device has bad antenna it takes 5-10 mins to search signal for satellete and sometime I have to reset/reboot 2-3 times to make it work. The preloaded map is outdated, I can not find any stores around my neighborhood: Safeway, Savemart, Target and Walgreen. I paid for more than 200 dollars on this unit and feel very sorry for that purchase. If you are on the search for GPS, try Tomtom, Mageland or Garmin. Those brands are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"The NVX226 has a known software problem that requires the buyer to return the unit upon purchase. It doesn't recognize the state of Louisiana. They only have one technician that is able to work on the units. It took 3 weeks for my unit to be returned to me.

This was an 101st Airborne Battle, not the Marine Corps. The 3rd Brigade,and units of the 2nd Brigade of the 101st fought in this battle. I hope the rest of this book isn't as poorly researched as Page 239.

It begins with French colonialism and follows through all the way to modern cultural and political influences which survive the war. It is insightful and easy to read. Most importantly, it is interesting.There are some drawbacks.About every second page Dr. Maga has included the kiss of death of writers everywhere: the cliché. I'm sure Maga didn't notice it when he was writing the book, but neglecting a decent copy edit is truly the kiss of death of what could have been a very good book. Yes, by writing \\"the kiss of death of\\" so very, very often, Maga has given himself the kiss of death. Kiss of death, kiss of death, kiss of death.Hopefully the next version will be improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad History","review":"Overall the book is terrible. As Guernsey noted, the author follows the incorrect conventional view on the war. The war was a mistake, we overacted, the North Vietnamese were really the good guys, blah blah blah blah.The only redeeming quality is the little exerpts the can be found on almost every page. These blurbs (which go by various titles) contain some very interesting facts on the war. This book may be useful for an experienced scholar on the war. However, the overall bias makes the book useless for its target audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"In a topic filled with insanity, exaggeration and political debunking, this book provides a sober, well-researched overview of the benefits of hemp. It keeps its subject tightly focused within 160 pages, providing factual arguments for hemp's use as a source of textiles, building materials, food (lots of protein, vitamins and minerals), paper and fuel. It also seems to suggest support for legalizing its sibling, which the ignoramuses of the world mistake for hemp. (I, too, advocate legalizing marijuana.) Otherwise, why would the author include a chapter on growing your own indoors, as well as a list of web sites that overtly cater to the marijuana sub-(counter)-culture. Thankfully, the author handles this topic in a calm, sane manner by weaving it nicely into the main thesis of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canada's best book on cannabis culture","review":"As a hemp lover, I've got to say that I've read all the books on the subject and this is among the top three I've seen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of crap","review":"This wasn't just the worst book on hemp possible, it may be the worst book ever written.

Gilels was the master on the use of dynamics. His interpretation of Concerto no. 5 is the best I know. He was an exceptional unique pianist that, besides a phenomenal technique, transmited all the emotion.The only remark is that the recording is not very good, only fair, but the interpretations are 10 stars.I bought 2 boxes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bargain, but not what we expected","review":"These earrings are very tiny, nothing what you would think from the picture, and I guess you get what you pay for.

It most interesting to note that the track listing for the DVD is completely incorrect!! \\"One By One' is not the dance remix, but the US remix, \\"Song For Lonely\\" is the album version (again not the remix), and Dov'e L'amore is in fact a remix and not the album version. Huh? Crossed wires I guess! Anyway, the videos speak for themselves; Cher has never been known for her innovative videos.

Well, LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE is here and has NEVER even been released on cd in the USA), WE ALL SLEEP ALONE (the version w/ band shots intercut-the one included is like a home movie of her and Rob Camilletti circa 1988), TAKE ME HOME, DARK LADY (cartoon, but one of the first memories I have of Cher) & ALL OR NOTHING."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLY DIVINE & About time...........don't you agree?","review":"Simply divine, simply the best.

I can only imagine that Warners is looking to milk us all for more dollars by holding back and then releasing another video compilation when Cher gets off her tour sometime in 2008 and records another album. The inclusion of the dreadful slow version of One by One is at least counter-balanced by the fact that the original version of Song for the Lonely, not the awful Almight Mix, is included. (Whoever was in charge of labeling the tracks was asleep.) But in sum, a neverending stream of Rob Camilletti appearances (4 videos!) makes for tough going after a while. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Last, Cher's Best Videos on DVD !","review":"For the first time ever, Cher videos are going to be released on DVD !

Where are All or Nothing, Music's No Good Without You, Different Kind of Love Song, Love and Understanding, Dark Lady, I Got You Babe, etc, etc. There is no excuse for this to be so incomplete. Plus, the package is mislabled about including the remix of One by One - it's actually the slow (and unpopular) version. And it would have been nice to see some remix videos.

The song \\"Believe\\" locks-in great memories, and the video is in tune with the times; I love it.

The new Cher video hits collection DVD!Fifteen tracks certain to induce vomit! I had a little trouble deciding which video to play (something made more difficult by Bessie's blubbering and apologizing--insincere I might add as she snuggled with her two poisonfree Bobos). The ridiculous video for \\"Half-breed\\" induced a snarl but no barf, but the silly \\"Dove Love\\" Frenchy tune did the trick. The Colonel purged and lives another day.

She has a wonderful, clear voice with a wide range and is accompanied by piano.

Without the pulse of the drums its dull most of the time. The violins are too liberal with the lyrical line at times. Often times you cant even tell what lyrics they are trying to play. When listening to the CD it either sounds like you are at a wedding, kinda like the movie \\"the wedding singer\\" when Sandler gets stood up, or it sounds like you are at a chinese restruant. Some of the songs are ok though. However, they do no justice to \\"transatlanticism.\\" It sounds like the titanic song. I would only recommend this CD to Die Hard Death Cab For Cutie Fans.

There are a couple of others that reference \\"The Son\\" and \\"a stone get rolled away,\\" but overall, joey b.'s just hiding his faith.I was pretty disappointed with this artist trying to pass himself off as a Christian artist on a sampler, and then making the rest of the songs either covers of secular Rock music or bland, this-might-be-Christian allusions.For really great Christian techno and dance, see Praise House and Hypersonic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great purchase!","review":"I am very happy with purchase & received the item very quickly!

There is not one redeeming track on this entire album. I've watched Armin rise into the scene even before he really ever got any recognition. He was one of the best in trance producing. Just take some of his old tracks such as Iio - rapture (armin van buuren remix) or System F - exhale (armin van buuren remix) or Armin - yet another day. There's no doubt in my mind he has talent but, the only problem is he's jumping onto the mainstream bandwagon. Not only are his current productions total crap his djing (track listing) is a pure disgrace as well. Armin back in 2001 you were my hero when it came to the trance scene and this is how you repay us.

However, I would simply drop the pan in the mail, send back to All Clad and almost like magic a new pan would be shipped to me within 7 days. Since All Clad was bought in 2004 everything has changed. They give you a hard time about using there famous warranty, and make the process difficult with RMA numbers, having to write something to them and wait to hear from them with a shipping number. It took them 2 weeks just to reply and give me a shipping number. Now they've had my pan for 4+ weeks and they told me it may be another 2 weeks. What's the point of the warranty? I am done with All Clad. Such a bummer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful warranty and poor customer service","review":"This pan is great when new. However, when you spend $125 on a pan, you expect to use it for a long time. Unfortunately, after a year or so, this pan started to develop a sticky film that compromised the non-stick cooking surface. All-Clad refused to exchange the pan for a new one, despite the fact that we followed their instructions with respect to heat and cleaning.Bottom line is that you should stick with all-clad for stainless cookware. For non-stick, go with a cheaper alternative that you don't mind replacing every couple of years because All-Clad will not stand by their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't count on the lifetime warranty","review":"I have many all clad products.

I sent in my pans and over six weeks later they return my pans back saying that I must have have used more than the low heat that is stated in the warranty. First of all, hat isnt true. Second, All clad doesnt have spy cams in my house to tell me i am a liar. HORRIBLE customer service. The nonstick pans are an incredible waste of money considering they don't honor the warranty. They lost me as a customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money if You Want Nonstick","review":"I'm not giving this pan a low rating because it isn't good, just that it likely isn't going to last long enough for the average home cook to justify its high price.

Yes, you could baby your nonstick, and just use it to cook omelets, it would be great for that and might last forever, but if you want a nonstick frypan for frying most foods, at a higher heat, All Clad won't last longer than cheaper pans.

The wireless router is in my office and she was having frequent and frustrating \\"drops\\" of her internet access. I bought this antenna, placed it about 5 feet above the floor (where her PC and its wireless adapter are located) and no more internet loss. It was a quick and easy fix and the choice of screws, gravity or magnets to hold the antenna in place makes it very convenient. An excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.

It's rare that I find a product easy to use and install, especially a networking product, but this one worked right out of the box. Just plugged it into my router and 15 seconds later we were done.

This is such a minor improvement that I had to make very careful measurements just to convince myself that it was helping at all, since moving the AP a couple inches or tipping it a few degrees can make a 10 pt difference. The AP had a signal strength of 20% (receiving from a distant wireless G router) at its best position with the stock antenna, and this antenna got it up to 22 or 23. When I connected the antenna with the included cable (instead of directly to the AP) the cable loss was such that I couldn't even get a 20 anymore. With an advertized improvement of several dbi better than a stock antenna, I expected that 20% to become a 40 or so, but no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great","review":"Set up was easy - just unscrew the old antenna on the card and screw the cable in.

Their previous album, Kaleidoscope, was pointing in this direction, and it came to full bloom in Juju. Goth psychedelia? Anti-disco?

My advise to anyone purchasing programs from the History Channel is to purchase programs in blu ray format only. Let me say that again. If you are going to purchase a program from the History Channel, buy it in blu ray format only or you will get a DVD with a small picture and black bars on all sides.

Purchased my TV from Crutchfield, but I don't recommend them just because they used a delivery service that did not do a good job and they did not seem to be aware of our problem until I complained. My complaints to Crutchfield were eventually addressed and the delivery took 13 days from the day it was ordered. Also it was a good thing I was here to help.

Lord, what an awesome game that was! I was so excited to jump in & play Nemesis! Unfortunately, the excitement didn't last very long.Here's the bottom line: this game is NOT X-COM. The way you control your squad is similar to the original, but the game play just doesn't have the same excitement that the original series did. Maybe it's because it's too complicated now, or maybe it's just because I'm older now. Hard to say, but please, don't waste your $20.00 thinking it's anything like the old X-Com.

Though powerful vocally, her lackluster, less than stellar album material forced her in the backseat to the likes of reigning teen queen Britney Spears and archrival Christina Aguilera. Then she and new hubby Nick Lachey decided to sign a contract and let MTV follow them around for a season to record their lives. Coinciding with the release of her so-so third CD In This Skin, \\"Newlyweds: Nick & Jessica\\" soon proved to be one of the most popular reality shows in TV history, mainly backed by Jessica's now infamous \\"blonde\\" comments (her most famous being her first: \\"Is this chicken or fish?\\"). The instant success of the show granted Jessica another chance in the spotlight and since has gained the girl the status of a true It-lister. MTV's DVD collection of \\"The Complete First Season of Newlyweds\\" is definitely entertaining and proves why America loves this uber-likable couple so much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why bother putting it on DVD?","review":"I do not understand the reasoning for putting this series on DVD.

I don't care for reality TV shows at all, but I gave this one a shot. I gave it 2 stars for the chicken or fish comment, and that one scene where she spent $2000+ on underwear and pissed him off.

The big give-away to parents should be the statement that Dr Ditchek (or was it Greenfield) will not take patients who refuse vaccination. Vaccination has no role in any home where good health is desired. All those ailments: ear infections, asthma, etc are all vaccine-caused.

Recommended for the person who likes traveling to learn and understand culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nisa: The Life and Words of Kung Women","review":"I just bought this book a few days ago and I am enjoying it so much, that I can hardly put the book down.This book is a narrative account of the social aspects of being a Kung woman of the Kalahari dessert in Southern Africa. Written with vivid details, the words come to life on the page! I recommend this book to anyone who is studying history, antropology, or wants to learn more about the pastoral life of the Sankhoi bushmen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman","review":"A read for everyone, especially for mothers, lovers and laid back women...Nisa is an exceptional woman. As for Majorie... she tells and writes Nisa's life story so well. I am buying more of this book as gifts for my friends: male and female."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been great...","review":"What started as a great idea degenerated into a listing of who slept with whom, and then the arguments which ensued because of the sleeping around. I just about threw out the book, but trudged through and actually came across one interesting chapter, Chapter 13, an 11-page section titled \\"A Healing Ritual\\". At last - something informative and interesting! But not worth the price of the book. Maybe Margorie Shostak's subsequent books on Nisa are better written, but I'm not going to take the time to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After reading the first five chapters, I felt like I had wasted my time. I did not agree with some of the opinions the author presented. I trudged through the next three chapters before finally putting down the book.Nisa sounds spoiled and frankly, I am tired of we lived, then we lived some more. Plus \\"Have you no sense?\\" got real old real fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Example of Ethnography/Oral History","review":"There are many angles by which to praise this classic. It has a voice for feminist, postmodernist, etc. I think it also has a great lesson in writing ethnography. This book was very helpful in my writing my recent book/ethnography, \\"Native Americans in the Carolina Borderlands: A Critical Ethnography, Carolinas Press, 2000). The author does a superb job of blending ethnographic descriptions and interpretations with oral history. Yes, Nisa is allowed for most of the book to talk in her own voice! Yet, with the ethnographic articulations of the author, the reader gains a more complex portrait of Nisa's people. A must read for ethnographers, novice and experienced, as well as undergraduate students in Anthropology and qualitative methods."},{"rating":"2","title":"One woman's life, all women's lives","review":"The story of Nisa is the story of a !Kung woman in Africa. Her life is told in her own words, with Shostak writing to elaborate on !Kung life and social customs. The !Kung people are hunter-gatherers, seemingly far removed from modern American culture. Through reading this book though, one can see and understand that humans live similarly and have the many of the same problems, no matter which culture they live in. Women have the same problems and triumphs as well, transcending country and culture and technology. This book, in teaching you about the !Kung people, helps teach you more about yourself"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Teacher's Point of View","review":"I am a 6th grade teacher and I teach the Holocaust to my students. This video is one resource tool that I use. It is quite powerful and the students get so much out of it. Through accounts of survivors, drawings, paintings, and vivid footage, we are taken through step by step the horror of the Holocaust and how it happened, from pre-occupation all the way until they day the war was over. The stories are fascinating, the visual images horrifying. This video is intense, but not on the \\"sickly\\" level of \\"Night and Fog.\\" However, if you are interested in this subject, I strongly suggest getting your hands on this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A work of maturity and discernment","review":"what emerges is a redifine understandig of the holocaust as experienceby those who lived it..those of us priveileged to see this work (or as i think this piece of art) will come close to understanding what it was like to be there.

I am a huge fan of Laurie Anderson and I'm sure I'd be giving it a five-star rating - if I could see it. But the video cannot be downloaded or streamed to any computer physically located outside the US, as I am. Given its subject, and the fact that Amazon is promoting it using an interview given to a British newspaper about the performance of the work in Britain, I'm sure there are delicious layers of geopolitical irony here. But mostly I'm just p'd off. When will this be available outside the US?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One sided view of religion","review":"This book is about as far from \\"scholarly\\" as one could get. It appears that he just wrote each \\"religion\\" and asked them what they would like him to say about them. It appears no research was done on anything that the \\"religions\\" told him, he mainly printed verbatim whatever they told him to write. In the case of Jim Jones and Scientology, works that are negative are never mentioned. You would think that there is no controversy at all with these two cults, just flowers and rainbows!If you live in Oz or Atlantis this might be a good resource. All others steer clear.I am an author and information specialist with a couple of Master's degrees.

I love All-Clad, but am disappointed this wasn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way over rated from my perspective","review":"I bought a 10\\" All-Clad fry pan on sale having heard nothing but raves about these pans, and highly reccomended by Cook's Illustrated. I have no idea why these pans are so highly rated, they must have the most lamest most uncomfortable handles in the entire pan world. I mostly use cast iron, and have a stainless steel sauce pan but unfortunately even though the handle on the sauce pan is ten times more user friendly, it can't be put in the oven. So what do I do? It was the last pan on clearance, sales final. I had heard from the vendor that the design is changing. Maybe the handles will improve. Too bad, an 80 dollar pan is going to spend most of its time on the shelf. So much for following what other people say. Makes me wonder if most of these reviews are rigged, how can someone give a pan like this a five-star rating that isn't even comfortable to hold?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"This pan is great. Evenly heats the food placed in the pan. Use on medium and get great results. Highly recommend pan"},{"rating":"1","title":"I am less than impressed","review":"I am completely underwhelmed by the famous All-Clad fry pan. It's supposed to be 10-inches. In fact its working surface is less than 7 1/2-inches. It is also very shallow, with no depth to the sides. Finally, the edges are knife-sharp and it is only a matter of time until I slice myself open cleaning the damn thing. I prefer my Calphalon and Farber pans to this."},{"rating":"1","title":"All-Clad knock- off","review":"The pan I received was a knock off of a all-clad product. There is not an all-clad certification stamp on the bottom. The finish inside the pan has flaws in it. They did send it in a authentic all-clad box, but it did not come with the all-clad sock cover. I'm very disappointed with amazon, I'm not sure I can trust the site anymore. I have heard other stories about other products from others that have experienced the same problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"You absolutely must read this book","review":"This book is an absolutely essential book for anyone who wants to understand musical comedy. I advise first reading a biography of Oscar Hammerstein and then jumping to this autobiography. I highly, highly recommend the book \\"Getting to Know Him : A Biography of Oscar Hammerstein II\\" by Hugh Fordin. The Rodgers auto-biogrophy is of the highest quality. Of course, it is a reflection of the author's upbringing and sense of decorum. Thus, Rodgers never mentions that Larry Hart was a homosexual despite their 20 year collaboration. Rodgers could easily have written an auto-biography that was four times as long, as his life was very full. The best part is the story of his childhood and the incredible persistance and focus he had to have to become a success. I advise, immediately after finishing this book, jumping into the suburb biography of Stephen Soundheim, to whit, \\"Stephen Sondheim : A Life\\" by Meryle Secrest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential reading for musical theatre & film buffs!","review":"Thoroughly readable and entertaining, this is one of the most interesting autobiographies in the musical theatre field. Yes, Rodgers can be less than frank about some subjects -- Larry Hart's private life and the questionable way Josh Logan was compensated for co-writing the libretto of SOUTH PACIFIC both get minimal coverage, but that was to be expected. (Could a man of Rodgers' time ever have written openly about Hart's homosexuality?) Otherwise, this is a one-of-a-kind look into the life and mindset of a genuine giant in 20th Century theatre. Rodgers was not afraid to make a few frank observations about people he had worked with, and his insights are still worth reading. If musicals are your thing, don't miss this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for theater fans!","review":"The autobiography of composer/lyricist Richard Rodgers. Very good reading; filled with anecdotes of his long career, including, of course, his work with Lorenz Hart and later, Oscar Hammerstein II. Also, his solo work as composer and lyricist. Along the way, you will meet Mary Martin, Gertrude Lawrence, and others. One caveat: Take what he says with a grain of salt. If you believe everything he says, you'll think he was Mr. Nice Guy and it was everyone else who had a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"indispensable for those contemplating a career in theatre","review":"We could have been spared the biography of Richard Rodger's grandfather, and we didn't really need to know how much the Rodgers's resented their house sitters (tenants), but overall this is enjoyable to read. Rodger's portrait of Hart is amusing. There are nuggets of wisdom along the way for those contemplating a career in musical theatre. Probably, in fact, this book is indispensable for those contemplating a career in musical theatre.Also recommended: PENTATONIC SCALES FOR THE JAZZ-ROCK KEYBOARDIST by Jeff Burns."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast read, captivating","review":"This book is a fast (but not too fast) read, full of useful information and anecdotes. Rodgers details his life from his earliestmemories, his creative process, to working with Larry Hart and Oscar Hammerstein and beyond.The names alone - Gershwin, Porter, Herbert, Friml, etc - areenough to highlight the network of musicians, lyricists, directors andproducers Rodgers knew. He gives a personal view of their lives, small bits you won't find in the history books! Highly recommend.Epilogue given by his daughter Mary."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright card thingy","review":"Product itself is ok but the fact that i put it into a dell is the main reason I encountered problems because it wouldn't work.

I would have included some additional songs for a Best Of covering their early days, like \\"Mother/Oh Mein Papa' from Join Hands and perhaps \\"Jigsaw Feeling' from The Scream.

The Egyptian chapters deal with the rules of Egyptian art, the belief in life after death, art of Thebes, Valley of the Kings, Akhenaten and Hatshepsut.

I am not a Christian but I found that Mr. Sutherland did a very good job of portraying Christ's suffering as these young men died and even the further suffering he showed when he was unable to help Joe find a way out of his predicament. It is not a happy film but one that deals with the human psyche and how we deal with life, and that quality of life truly does matter, even if it is only just being able to see or hear or talk, even one of these things makes for quality of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Ripoff!","review":"What a ripoff!

This book could discourage you from trying to make a living through public speaking as it is very honest about the work that may be involved. This book does not lack for fine details about his recipe."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, But very dated","review":"C'mon, Dr. Anthony, You wrote your book in 1983. Haven't you learned anything new since then? Granted, there are some good key points about the public speaking business, but the resources you refer to are all out of date. There are many newer, more current books on this subject. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"abigail VERY light read","review":"A little disappointing.

Sure.","review":"I think \\"a California reader\\" should just go back to reading Hustler and leave the design books to the \\"idiots\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BOOK FOR IDIOTS!","review":"What a terrible disappoinment it was to read this book. The secrets of sex as a tool in advertising and design are talked about in this so-called exploration of erotic and exotic media. The want to be interviews with what they call leading figures in mainstream marketing tries to focus on sex and innuendo, but from a very bad point of view. They bring in pornography of Calvin Klein ads, graphic and advertising design from music, art, film, packaging, and publishing. SO WHAT! What are they really trying to get across, only an idiot will know. I thought this book was stupid, shallow and totally senseless. I DO NOT recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Knowledge Management Textbook Suitable for Business Studies","review":"This is a Knowledge Management Book that covers the foundational components of KM and is laid out in a textbook format. This is a real find for any instructor wishing to add Knowledge Management discussion to an existing business course, or is looking for a text for a KM course. I believe this book would fill either role, and at 29.95 using it as a supplemental text is not unreasonable. Another plus for this book is the instructor's guide that is available from the publisher.As someone that has taught in the college and business environments, I believe this book is a strong resource for both. I've also searched the web for this title and found that Connecticut Southern State University has adopted this book for a Library Sciences course."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good textbook","review":"This is advertized as a textbook, but if it is, it certainly is not on the college level. This might qualify for a high school textbook. It is written on a lower level than the KM for Dummies book!Dont' waste your money. You can get Frappaolo's text on KM for less money and it is a better resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too basic","review":"The book is focused more on personal KM than on KM as a field. Very useful the introductory part, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Actress but boring book! Skip it!","review":"Ruth Gordon was a great actress and one of the best \\"characters\\" ever to grace the silver screen. You would assume an autobiography would be filled with funny stories from her life but this book is nothing like that. This HUGE uninteresting book is filled with names, names, names and more names of people you have never heard of. No explanation about who they are or distiguishing features about them. It would only be of interest to people who actually know these people.I'm pretty well versed in Broadway and Hollywood history and even I didn't know who or what she was talking about most of the time.This was an autobiography her friends might enjoy reading (cause they know the people) but for everyone else this is just a long drawn our series of names and uninteresting stories.I forced myself to keep reading this until I got to the Hollywood section and even then when I knew the names the storytelling was just as bad.Skip this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative!","review":"In this DVD Kelly Galloup unloads a massive amount of tips and information! Even when Kelly is fighting a fish he is telling tips on what he is doing right and wrong. This DVD is very informative on nymphing and leaves the viewer with confidence after watching the DVD. Only downside is sometimes the camera doesn't follow certain things that Kelly is trying to emphasize. I am thoroughly pleased at the level of instruction included in this DVD and hope that Mr. Galloup continues to produce instructionals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It seemed like a good pan.","review":"I have owned this pan for a few years and it has gradually lost its non-stick coating. It is now totally useless and I am off to replace it with the Cuisinart pan that America's Test Kitchen preferred over the other non-sticks out there. I love all of my other All Clad products, but from now on I am not spending more than $50 on a non-stick pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as long lasting as I would have hoped","review":"We received this pan as a wedding gift 18-months ago.

Buy it for the warranty; you'll save money in the long-run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and bad","review":"Non-stick is very good, construction a tad light but seems to heat evenly nonetheless. Overall a good pan with one huge drawback: the handle is terrible! Thin, hard to grab, feels awful in your hand.

I give them all 5 stars and I like them better than any other brand. The non-stick fry pan is another matter, however. Despite being very careful with this pan, never using it on more than medium heat, always using silicone or plastic utensils, the non-stick surface is terrible and from Day 1 it never seemed very good. My first pan's surface was horrible and broke down after about a year...the store where I bought it replaced it without question per All Clad's warranty, but the replacement one didn't work much better and although the non-stick surface is in good shape, I simply do not like using it, especially for my main use, which is cooking eggs. The eggs stick and clean-up is often quite laborious, not what you would expect from a non-stick pan. Terribly disappointing pan. I now use Swiss Diamond fry pans for eggs, and they are fabulous."},{"rating":"1","title":"My wife wanted this brand","review":"This is a replacement. The original pan began to peel so we (she) replaced it. Way too much money!! If I weren't married I would never purchase this pan for this price. I've seen similar pans for less. Much easier to replace a $25.00 pan than a $125.00 pan. And they all cook the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Clad Stainless 8-inch NON stick fry pan","review":"Perfect size for eggs in the morning! Light weight, easy to clean and always handy to have around. I highly recommend this little frying pan. My only complaint - I was too cheap to purchase it sooner! <wink> Go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I only brought the 8\\" to try it out before buying anymore and I'm glad I did. I gave it a low rating because anything you cooked in the pan stuck. I bought it for cooking eggs before going to work without using too much oil, butter, etc. I had to use lots of butter or oil for them not to stick. Not what I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Total Piece of CRAP","review":"Given as a gift - same story: The fact that I primarily used high heat, it didn't last past 6 months. All-Clad said too bad after I emailed them, and called them several times leaving messages - took them 3 months to get back to me, and then that was it. I WILL NEVER BUY ALL-CLAD EVER AGAIN!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"No history, no explanation, miniscule background, and there are some truly glaring errors. Must have been written from notes, which explains the jumpy editing and the problems with some of the calculations and theories. There are better sources for Xuan Kong calculations than this book (try Eva Wong or \\"Complete Idiot's Guide\\") and they don't mess up their math."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I was interested in learning about Flying Stars since I only had minimal exposure to this practice of Feng Shui. Given the title, I thought it would be a great way to start. Big mistake! I didn't understand most of it.There was a lot of Feng Shui jargon I wasn't familiar with. I kept reading thinking I would catch on. It was a waste of money. Buy Flying Star Feng Shui by Stephen Skinner instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"childish approach of feng shui","review":"This book approach the flying stars theorie with a childish way.If somebody knows this theorie, the only thing that derives from this book, is to... forget everything that he knews!If someone does not know the theorie, then he will confused and he does not learn anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise yet fully covers","review":"This book is an ultimate manual for flying star feng shui practitioners.

At least Sally has a child to remind her of Fred. This was otherwise a very very good mystery. I only wish it had a different ending!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Predictable","review":"Although I love mystery books, this was not one of my favorites. To me it seemed like all the whole trilogies end in a manner that is so predictable. When I finished reading this I felt as if I was waiting for the actual plot to start! I also think that this book it a bit inappropriate. When other readers say that Sally falls in love with Fredrick, they really mean LOVE. And I am not talking about kissy, kissy. When Sally and Fredrick are alone one night, they have strip naked SEX! AND THEY ARE NOT EVEN MARRIED! I thought that this book was sending the wrong message about sex before marriage, and would not recommend it to any body of slight interest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you hanging till the last minute.","review":"If you enjoyed A Ruby in the Smoke you will love the sequel, Shadow in the North. Philip Pullman again uses his extraordinary ability to write mystery books. Pullman is able to connect two totally different things to add a whole new twist to the story. An example is when he had one mystery and another one that were totally unrelated and in the end it was all one mystery. I enjoyed this book as much as his other novels because of the fastmoving plot. This book is similiar to Stephen King's books. Not because of the style of writing, but because of the fast plot and suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sad yet exciting","review":"In the second book of this wonderful triolgy Sally Lockhart has set out to retrieve a large sum of money one of her clients has lost. Her friend Fredrick Garland has also tacken a case in which a magician is being hunted. Both cases tie in together and Sally and Fred find themselves tracking one of the most twisted and sick men in London. Not all the characters from the Ruby in the Smoke are back but most of them are. I found that this book was very sad but the sadness added to the plot. The end leaves you begging for more just as the Ruby in the Smoke did. This was a very good book and i would reccomed it to anyone who likes suspense, mystery, and adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This is probally the best book ever. Its set in the late 1800's with a young blond heroine. her name is Sally. In her first book (the ruby in the smoke) she found out that her father was not her real father, that she was sold for a ruby, people have wanted her life sixteen years, both of her fathers are murdered, about five thousand people died for her to have the live she had, about five people are murderd because of her and all of this for a ruby. In this book Sally starts her own business. Soon to have it be tried to shut down. She becomes pregagnet with a child I won't tell you who. And more... theres deciet, romance, murder,adultery and plots that never stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"An imaginative mystery you can't put down!","review":"The Shadow in the North is quite possibly the best book that I have read. It is extremely well-written, and the use of words is outstanding! It is hard to find a book as well-written as it is, and nearly impossible to find one with such an imaginative and intricate plot. You won't believe what the heroine, Sally Lockhart, and her spunky friends discover as they unravel the mystery behind the sinking of Ingrid Linde, a steamship, and \\"the pride of the Anglo-Baltic shipping line.\\" The ending is very unusual, yet not the least bit dissapointing. Shadow in the North is probably the most exciting book you'll ever get your hands on, so don't miss it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shadow in the North","review":"Philip Pullman shows us his incredible abiltity to weave a fantastic mystery once again in the Shadow in the North. By far the best in the Lockhart series, Pullman mkaes you fall absolutely in love with the main characters in these books. The focus of this story is definetely Sally's relationship with Fred, with a complex, wonderful mystery going on behind it. I would recommend this book to anyone. It is sooooooo good!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"This is a great book! Philip Pullman is such a wonderul author, all of his books are great! (But... we're talking about Shadow in the North) This book is about a young girl who has to fight a lot of battles in her life to find the truth that she's been searching for. It tells of her woes, thinking/plotting, enemies, falls, and her time when she has overcome the evil.I have read Philip Pullman books over and over, and you know what, I have never tired of any of them. The only problem is to find another book that I like to read as much as Pullman's."},{"rating":"2","title":"As great as the first one!","review":"A lot of times the sequel doesn't live up to the first. That certainly does not apply to this book! As suspenful as the first, but more of that lovey-dovey, mushy-gushy stuff.

I threw them all out as they bend up and are poorly made"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work!","review":"I bought this shortbread cutter to make shortbread cookies for Christmas and was so disappointed. It does not work for me at all. The cookies get stuck in the cutter and I can't get them out without breaking the cookies. It needs an open top as other reviewers have said!!! I do not recommend this product. Save yourself the aggravation and buy one with an open top!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bake a lot and shortbread is one of my specialties. I could not use these cookie cutters at all. The dough sticks to the cookie cutter despite greasing and flouring it. The closed top makes it impossible to push the dough through from the other side. I had to keep looking for other cookie cutters. Too bad!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Served the purpose. Was packaged well and arrived fast.I read the reviews here and had decided to cancel my order but the cutter already arrived and I did not have time to order the copper one that is open at the top in time for my holiday baking.However I found that if you chill your shortbread dough and dust your cutter not too many issues with dough sticking to the cutter. Yes, would have been nice if the top was left open."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad 2 Quart Saucepan","review":"This is my little workhorse.

The company does replace the lid but only after you mail it in and wait for 6-8 weeks.

Won't buy All-clad again."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad Rates No. 1","review":"I recently purchased the All-Clad 2Qt. Stainless Saucepan. The pan is heavier than most saucepans I have used in the past, but the added length of the handle more than compensates for the additional weight.I found the pan to be extremely adept. I found that the heat transferred evenly throughout the cooking process. My ingredients did not scald or burn.I have purchased premium cookware (I thought) in the past, but the All-Clad is by far superior to what I have. This was my first purchase, but not my last."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite pans","review":"You usually get what you pay for and although All-Clad are usually the more expensive pans, they are the ones that you will have forever. This cleans up well, looks very nice and distribute head evenly. I use this for boiling pasta for one, heating up soups and sauces or melting butter. This would be one of the three pans that I could not live without."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sees a lot of action","review":"I love this pot. I've used it for boiling, making ice cream bases, etc. I occasionally use it to fry a serving of beignets. All Clad provides superior heat technology for quick and even heating. The stay-cool handle is a plus. Cleans up quickly in the dishwasher. A little polish keeps it looking like new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect size saucepan","review":"I am slowly replacing my old cookware with the best I can find. For me, the All-Clad stainless steel cookware is the best. This saucepan is the perfect size for common cooking tasks like making a batch of rice or steaming vegetables for two people.it is well made and functions perfectly. It is easy to clean and will easily last the rest of my lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most used of all my All-Clad","review":"I have about 20 pieces of All-Clad cookware, but this is the one I use most. It's narrowness makes it the perfect tool for working with smaller volumes; however, the 2 quart size can handle a sauce for an entire meal. It's perfect for reducing liquids. Even though the straight sides are not ideal for pouring, a ladle works quite well. The handle stays cool. Also, All-Clad pots can be heavy, so it's nice to have a small one that's easy to handle for everyday use.The only thing I do not use this pot for is something like oatmeal, which is sticky and that needs a lot of stirring. For that, I'd suggest a pot with a more rounded bottom like the lidless 1 quart.Overall, this is my favorite piece of All-Clad cookware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Product","review":"Cork inside whistle gets stuck in air hole when you blow to hard.

This is a great book - factual, clear and simple but not condescending. Some of the subjects are a little mature for kids, but that's why you, as a concerned adult, read it in advance and stay available to talk about it with the children you care about.This book is easy to read, well organized, honest, and comprehensible.

The thought that they provide this book to elementary aged children, yes they are children, is absolutely infuriating. This book is filled with graphic pictures that push the lines of decency.

For example, there are full blown nudity pictures of small asian kids, which is very offensive in my book because my husband is half Korean half Happa. And I must include that the misogynistic profile of the obese fat women is very hurty. I was insulted by the constant need for nudity, such as a birthing scene.

It's a sad thing when this beautiful subject is portrayed way outside the guidelines of a one man/one woman marriage.

So, thankz again, to ALL of you! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sorry, folks. Sex IS embarrasing to talk about...","review":"I've read and heard lots of thing about this book and checked it out for myself. Quite frankly, I think this is a great way to let kids educate themselves, simply by reading it. YES, it is embarrasing. But remember when you were a kid and you snuck into your parents rooms to look at your dad's porn? Or you found \\"The Joy of Sex\\" or \\"Our Bodies, Our Selves\\"? Cartoon drawings are far less offensive than learning about sex in this way and the idea of these books is to open a dialogue...it ain't pretty either way. And kids... you gotta deal with it. I take serious offense to a parent allowing a kid to right a review about this book to say how embarrasing it was for them to read. If it weren't embarrasing, I would think your kid was the dalai lama reincarnated."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not for everyone...","review":"I read the book before deciding not to give it to my grandchildren and I'm so glad I did! I found it extremely graphic, and my experience with children is such that \\"looking at the pictures\\" can distract from the information an author intends to convey (like buying Playboy for the \\"articles\\"?). Also, the book purported to be value-neutral, but subtly conveyed the idea that although \\"some people\\" believe that this or that behavior is unacceptable, the behavior is somehow so \\"normal\\" that one shouldn't be overly concerned about the \\"morality\\" of it. I chose a different book for my grandchildren."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much information, too soon.","review":"This book is probably fine for older teens, but the age guideline for this is way off. It is extremely graphic, from child birth scenes, plenty of naked people of both genders, talking about pulling out to prevent pregnancy, showing a couple actually having intercourse, etc. I took one peek through and put it in our closet, to be given at a later age or gotten rid of, I am not sure yet which one. This was actually recommended by friends so I was shocked. I may be more conservative than I thought, but this book is definitely over the top for the age range that it is suggested for. I thought I was perhaps overreacting, but I showed my husband and he agreed completely.Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"And to think this has ties to Girl Scouts!","review":"It's not perfectly normal to expose our children to a book like this. My children 14 y/o, 12 y/o may be exposed to people with too liberal sexual ideals, but they are NOT interested in these types of visuals. When my children turned 12, I had 'the talk' with them. They both reacted by crying. My boy asked,\\" Why do we need to know this stuff if we're supposed to wait until we're married?,\\" with tears in his eyes. I never saw images such as those in the book until I was out of high school, and I know perfectly well how to have babies. I choose not to indulge in the other things and would much rather those images had never entered my brain in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Perfectly Normal","review":"I was totally shocked by this book. Ann Landers and Dr. T. Terry Brazelton recommend this book for 10 year olds. I think it is nothing but porn for children.

The description wasn't real clear on how they got the measurements. It must have been just the body (torso) that they were measuring because it is a lot larger than we expected, but just what we hoped for. I don't think the measurements included the tail or legs. The tiger is as large as our Labrador Retriever. We were very pleased with the size and the quality of this product. It is soft, plush and has very realistic detail.

Then, I was cooking pancakes on it, and it burned the outside, while leaving the inside uncooked! The oil burned and left a greasy, sticky residue around the edges where the heating coils are, that I can't get off. It's either all the way on, or all the way off.

Additionally-as per the instruction manual,the item should have included both a warming tray AND drip tray-unfortunately, the box only included the drip tray. One thing that I cannot comment on, however, is the ability of the non-stick surface as I haven't tried using it without cooking spray.By the way, the 5-star ratings are clearly fake based on the content (which is extremely inconsistent with the message of the majority) and the reviewers' records, which are suspiciously lacking.

I am throwing this out and replacing it asap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Griddle Gripe","review":"I wish I had read the reviews on this griddle before buying. I too bought mine at Target after my old trusty griddle started to lose alot of the non stick surface. This was after many years of Sunday brunches-well used and loved. The Black and Decker is profoundly inept at basic griddling. My first use was pancakes. With three across the top and three across the bottom, every one of them looked like those black and white cookies you get at a deli-half almost burnt, the other half near done. My second use, just this morning, was for bacon. Set the temp at 250- bacon starts to sizzle up nicely, then all of a sudden, it shuts off! Bacon stops all sizzle and sits there in the grease. Had to keep turning up and then lowering temp just to get the bacon to cook. Meanwhile, made four waffles-one at a time-on my waffle iron-had to keep these in the oven to wait on the bacon! Wish I could return this hunk o junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"I thought I was doing something wrong until I read other reviews. EVERYTHING stuck and made a ridiculous-to-remove layer of burnt food. I carefully cleaned the thing and then re-seasoned it only to get the exact same results.Even worse, it heats unevenly. It burns stuff on the edges of the griddle and leave the middle section raw. After a couple of uses, it is going in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I bought this griddle to replace a Rival that I had for 3 years. This griddle is horrible! Right from day one very uneven cooking, one pancake in the corner never even cooked all the way. And the non-stick surface is worse than my cast iron pan. Had to spray with cooking oil multiple times for one setting of pancakes. I will stay with Rival or Presto next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of trash!","review":"This is a horrible griddle! It really deserves zero stars and anyone who bought it deserves their money back. The element does not heat evenly and it creates some very hot spots and some very not-hot spots. The grease channels do not angle downwards towards the front where the grease could get into the trap. It just pools up and actually fills towards the rear of the channels. The non-stick surface is VERY stick. The fact that it has a fairly large surface is its only good feature, but it's only of benefit if you're not using the heating element. So, if you need to melt some ice in the hot sun then this is the griddle for you. If you want to do any cooking at all you need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as everyone else.","review":"I have had this griddle for almost two years and ever since it was new have had the same experiences as everyone else here. Food sticks to it, the \\"non stick\\" coating comes off and it heats unevenly. The newest problem is the heating element has started making a popping noise and emits an electrical burning smell. Do yourself a favor, spend a few extra dollars and get a Presto griddle, I'm ordering one today and this thing is going to the landfill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smokin' - but not from the food!","review":"I've had this griddle for maybe a year and use it 3-4 times a month. Yesterday, I noticed a smell and then saw smoke coming from where you plug the cord into the griddle, I got to it before it started a fire. My brother-in-law had the same problem with his a few months ago. This griddle should be recalled, it is a saftey hazard!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"Black and Decker should simpy stay out of the appliance business and stick with what they do best.This grill is simply junk. Just threw it out after a few weeks. Got a presto gral instead. Much better.This black and decker grill says it is non stick - NOT!!!!!!!!!!YOu better have a big can of Pam if you are going to use this grill. Hard to clean. Will never be clean again after the first use. AN ok job of cooking but i wanted an item that was non stick. Buy the presto cool touch grill instead. In fact it appears that in general it is best to stay away from kitchen appliances made by black and decker. This is the second product of theirs in a month that i threw away. I need to start saving receipts so i can return junky items back to Walmart."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible horrible one of the worst products I have ever bought","review":"I bought this at target b/c it had a large surface area. Oh its miserable trying to cook on it. You'd think that the area closest to the heating element heats up the most, but as others have pointed out, on the underneath of the griddle is a \\"track\\" that the heat follows in a oval/rectangular pattern ... anything touching that gets burnt; food not touching that track barely cooks.This would make a great gift for someone you despise thoroughly, or as a cruel april fool's joke for that great cook you know -- it'll really bring them down a bunch of pegs.Pancakes? ha. you'll have better luck boiling pancakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Useless Grill","review":"I was very disappointed with the quality of this grill. The non-stick surface is a joke, everything sticks. The grill does not cook evenly. Worst of all, it looks terrible and can't be cleaned. There is a sticky mess from using cooking oil to try to keep anything from sticking, it simply will not clean up. Had I read any reviews, I would have made a better and different choice. The price was reasonable and I loved the large, non-stick cooking surface. I would never recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black and Decker should \\"stick\\" to making tools","review":"I purchased this griddle at Target for $19.99 as a Christmas gift for my husband, we are Freecycling it today. It is the WORST griddle we have ever owned. The heat is uneven with hot and cold spots, a strip of bacon will burn in a couple places and will be uncooked in others. Worst of all EVERYTHING sticks to it, we tried seasoning it with cooking oil and spraying it with cooking spray, but nothing works. The cord is very short and the temperature settings are inaccurate. This griddle is literally a piece of JUNK. Don't waste you money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have owned many grills, this is by far the WORST","review":"We purchased this griddle because the plastic on our last two became brittle and split a leg off, rendering them useless. This griddle did not heat evenly (think: pancakes that strongly resembled black & white cookies). The heating element was so sensitive that it was either too cold at 200 degrees or causing the smoke detector to sound from the extreme heat at just a fraction of a turn above 200. Finally, after one dinner of tacos, a pancake breakfast and a half pound of bacon, the griddle was completely filthy and the burnt grime would not come off of the \\"non-stick\\" surface no matter what we tried. Thankfully Target accepted a return on the item and we went with a higher end model from a different manufacterer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch - you'll get burned if you buy this grill.","review":"Have to agree with most of what's been written here. I've had this only a couple of months and it keeps shorting out or something. It heats up, and then you start to cook on it and it goes cold. Have to replug or jiggle or something to get thermostat working properly. Makes meal preparation a pain.I haven't had any problem with the nonstick surface, it cleans quite easily. But the heating mechanism is completely unreliable. I am going to have to replace this. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk","review":"Like others have found this grill is unacceptable. It is not non-stick.Found that out on the second day. B&D; you need to step up your game and replace these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"This was a gift and the pancakes all half burned and half undercooked. You could actually see where the heating element was from the burn pattern. I called customer service and for 7.50 they would send me a new one. I did not bother, but, they sent it anyway, ok so we give it another chance and this one has the same issue. All directions were followed and results were horrid.I will just go back to making pancakes one at a time for my family of seven, keeping them in the oven to keep them hot so we can all eat together. So very sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"We'll see if the second one is any better...","review":"I bought this at Target, used it once and had the same problems with uneven heating as other reviewers. I wanted to return it but my efficient husband had already thrown away the receipt and box. I called the customer service number on the instructions and was able to send back the plug along with $7.50 to them and the sent me a new one. I just got it so as soon as I use it I will update this review with the results. I'm not super hopeful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"I was very disappointed in this \\"non stick\\" griddle. I was replacing a 7 year old griddle that the non-stick had finally begun to wear out. This brand new griddle was worse than my 7 year old one! I tried non stick spray with no luck. The grill only heats where the element is, and then much hotter than what you have it set on. I can't successfully cook pancakes after my 4th try. Do your research before you buy. I learned a valuable lesson!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible. Worthless.","review":"I concur with the majority of posters here. This griddle does not heat evenly and does not stay hot. I did not fiddle with the thermostat like others did. The first batch of pancakes are dark brown in stripes, white elsewhere. The second batch of pancakes are done around lunchtime. It is ridiculous to think that B+D could make such a miserable attempt at what should be a simple appliance. Presto seems to be able to make an appliance that keeps an 18\\" x 12\\" section of aluminum uniformly hot while cooking on it. It sounds simplistic, but the folks at B+D apparently find this task too difficult.I am tossing this in the trash and buying a new Presto."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GRIDDLE!!!!!","review":"I regret buying this griddle.

For $30, I don't expect the world on a griddle, so that could be one of the issues with my success. I just made pancakes. Turned it to the appropriate temp specified in the manual (which was over 225 and the pancakes did NOT burst into flames as advertised they would) and cooked away. If anything, I found they may have taken slightly longer to cook than expected. Perfect pancakes though. Delicious. I sprayed with Pam first, like I always do. I don't believe in non-stick anyways, I always spray things with Pam, even non-stick frying pans. I also watch the food; not super intently, but I don't leave for 20 minutes and come back and expect it to be perfect. For the price I can't argue. I also can't argue because I don't have anything negative to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of money.","review":"The first time I used it I could tell the heating wasn't real good because the pancakes took forever to get golden brown.

The griddle ended up in the garbage can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap!","review":"I sure wish i would have read the reviews before purchasing this. But, thought with it being a reputable name it would be fine. I've been looking for a large cooking surface grill for a while and saw this one at Target this morning - good price and thought today was my lucky day. Got home and made some pancakes and scrambled eggs and was totally irritated with this. Uneven temp - kept shutting off and the damn thing warped when putting the eggs onto the surface. I'm taking this back and looking for another model.. What a waiste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not just me!","review":"I was looking forward to using this; I thought I'd cover the amply-sized griddle with little pancakes and power through breakfast in only one or two batches. But I didn't count on those batches taking ages. It took forever to get the pancakes on the outsides to even tan, and the ones in the middle never did brown. I thought that maybe I was being too picky. Now that I've returned it and I'm looking for its replacement, I've seen the other reviews.I am trying to imagine the meeting where they decided that this griddle was good enough to sell. Was it just all about the price point? Were they testing some other product?

Look elsewhere for a better griddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot and cold spots","review":"This is the worst griddle I have ever used in my life. It is incredibly inconsistent in temperature across it surface and will result in food that is either uncooked or burned in the same meal. For example, I tried to cook bacon and found pieces white and undercooked while others, just a few inches away, were black. An argument could be made that you CAN cook on this if you are willing to stand over it and micro manage the meal. I was interested in a griddle that didn't take this level of effort. I wanted a large cooking area with a consistent temperature across its surface. If this is what you want, the Black and Decker is not for you.UPDATE 5/9/2010I just purchased a Presto 07046 Tilt 'n Drain Big Griddle and found it to be everything that the Black and Decker was not. If you are looking for a large cooking area, with a very good non-stick coating and very consistent temp, then purchase that model. The Black and Decker is good for nothing but the scrap heap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst grill ever!!!","review":"I've used several grills with my large family of 8. I got this grill as a gift. It is the worst I've ever used. The temperature regulator is completely off. It either burns the food or doesn't cook it at all--all on the same temperature reading.

The warming tray is a little too small to be useful for much. But it actually kept a good temperature - when the griddle was set to 375, the warming tray was a cozy 107. The non-stick surface worked great; pancakes slip right off, if the griddle is coated with a thin coating of cooking oil. But the griddle itself was notoriously uneven. See the customer images for some pancakes cooked at 350 - zebra pancakes! Unless you plan on cooking only meats, steer clear of this griddle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok, but flakey","review":"I have had two of these units over about 3 years (the second was a warranty replacement of the first). It cooked fine, and I never had trouble with sticking, though I always sprayed with oil before use anyway. My problem was that one of the two contacts that plug into the thermostat went bad and created arcing inside the thermostat. This happened on both units. I'm not a big fan of electrical fires, so would not consider this a safe unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst grill ever!","review":"This has to be the worst grill ever made!

The FIRST time I used it, for 8 pancakes, it burned 9 and didn't cook the 10th. And where the burned pancakes were, the nonstick coating was damaged. Subsequently, I've reduced the temperature and the cooking time, but for 3 successive days we've had LOUSY pancakes. And I bought it before Christmas because I will have houseguests. I called the 800 number for customer service and the rep was rude to me. I spoke to his supervisor (if it was his supervisor), and she was not much more helpful. Don't buy this grill!!!

They got good and cooked evenly over the bottom and when I de-glazed, the tasty bits came right off and melded right into the sauce.Clean up was very easy. A light scrubbing with a blue scrubby backed sponge and everything looked new again.To those who say this pan sucks, learn to cook. The right temperature is everything.

Items kept sticking, and I got tired mighty fast of using Barkeeper's friend every time I used it. The biggest problem, though, was it shocked me every time I used it! At first, I thought it was my imagination. Imagine my surprise when one day it shocked me so hard a large blister developed on my thumb! It WASN'T my imagination. Maybe it was due to the magnetic surface, I have no idea. BUT, none of my other stainless steel pots and pans (cheap ones) did this to me! And they all have metal handles. Go figure.

I prefer to buy a good product once, rather than having to repeatedly buy cheaper ones. I've only used it a few times but I can instantly see why it's rated so highly and costs a pretty penny. Does the job excellently whether frying or otherwise (though I don't use for eggs-- I have a non-stick pan for that), and has made me a fan of All-Clad in general.

It's definitely the smallest pot I've ever seen. That being said, it has worked perfectly for me. I use it for some sauces and it also works well for canned veggies when I'm feeling lazy. It's small size makes it easy to fit in the top rack of the dishwasher too. This is part of the D3 set, not the newer D5 stuff, but as the rest of my pots and pans are D3 and work great that didn't bother me.

The elders want to use the church's money for a gymnasium instead of helping the poor and needy. On top of that, Sam is gradually losing his faith in God. Despite his admission of unbelief to the elders of the church, they decide to keep him on as pastor. Meanwhile one of the devout couples of the church win the lottery and wrestle with the question as to whether they should accept the money. Another family is bereft when the mother in the home deserts them in order to run off with another man. Author Philip Gulley takes these plot threads and gently weaves them into a gentle and amusing tapestry of the lives of a group of Quakers is central Indiana. He pokes fun at religious institutions and people, but does so with a gentle and loving spirit. For those who enjoy tales of small towns and the people who live there, this is a recommended series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gracie B.","review":"I began reading this book with the hope that it would provide some comfort and relief from my \\"daily troubles.\\" A great disappointment and waste of time! Many of the characters are so unlikeable that one can hardly finish the page that is being read: selfishness, greed, jealousy, piousness, & the like. There are a few touching experiences in the book, but they are so outnumbered by the negative ones previously mentioned, that I cannot recommend this book to anywone wishing to be uplifted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winning book by Phil Gulley","review":"My whole family (teenager included) just finished reading this delightful book. We all found ourselves laughing over the scripture egg project, and the folks of Harmony. Maybe we saw ourselves in some of the people.

I have read all of his books, and found this one as delightful as the others. Thanks Phil!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"After Signs and Wonders I was expecting something better. I understand the author wanted to show the downward side of community but the thing was there was little if any true Christian behavior among these people. Certainly there was no leadership from their pastor. I realize he was sort of burned out but it seemed he wasn't in the habit of calling them back from unChristian talk and/or behavior. Disappointing to say the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"The whole Harmony series is very enjoyable, and it among my favorite in the fiction genre. They are all light-hearted and full of wonderful and entertaining characters. The books follow Sam, a pastor in a small-town Quaker church, and the eclectic group of individuals who are members.You will likely find yourself laughing out loud at the antics of Dale, as he undertakes his scripture-egg project or his salvation balloons. Fern Hampton may drive you nuts, but you'll learn to love her.Many reviewers compared this to the Mitford series, reading this one because they enjoyed the Mitford series so much. I tried reading the series after this one, and found it dry and dull.These books are easy, pleasant and clean reads.

His original 60's recordings of \\"Too Young\\", \\"Smile\\", \\"Mona Lisa\\", and \\"Pretend\\" are 1000 times better than these later up-tempo re-recordings. He sounds uninterested as though he can't wait to finish the recordings so he can go home. He even cracks on a couple of the lower notes. The typical Jerry Vale UMPH is non-existant.

It was a little of everything: action, humor, romance, tragedy, and everything in-between. My only beef is that it needs more. More episodes. There's just so much unsaid. But anyway, I usually don't cry about TV shows, but I shed a few for the ending. Overall, this is a masterpiece of an anime, and a good title to add to your collection.

Funny to say but I was going thru some stuff around the time I had gotten this anime never had watched it but man after you watch this anime(even tho its fake) it still makes you realize that you shouldn't take so much for granted in life(other words opens your eyes in a way) But great anime loved it I teared up a bit in the end im not going to lie. Its a mature anime if you ask me I dont think a kid will understand the meaning behind the anime or the message that it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the better anime recently","review":"Angel Beats! seems to mesh comedy and drama perfectly. The series is extremely light hearted at times, while holding the overtone of the plight of all the characters involved in place as the main part of the show throughout. The key is the characters. If you can bring yourself to care about the characters, this will be one of the better shows you watch. If, howerver, you can't bring yourself to care about the characters at all, then you will likely view this as an overdramatic version of The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya. I was in the former category, and loved every second of the show, even shedding some tears during some of the more dramatic moments.

Naturally police are called in to investigate and they seek the help of a psychic, Myers (Patrick MaGee from CLOCKWORK ORANGE).

Hmmm...There is a severe absence of trademark gore scenes here, which is why \\"The Black Cat\\" never features much in Fulci filmographies. The only really unpleasant scene is the one in which Dagmar Lassander is burned alive, with plenty of close-ups. The English village is all very beautifully shot, and it appears to be on location, but in every scene of tension, Fulci reacts by zooming in on the eyes of the characters, (and of the cat!)

Furthermore, you learn that this short episode in American history is really the foundation of our sense of tolerance and equality. Our republic and Constitution (with Bill of Rights) is more related to the Dutch theory of government than the English prototype.

In an effort to create a narrative story, Shorto informs us of dialogue, weather, the color of the sky, and specifics of peoples' clothes in specific circumstances throughout, information totally a creation of the author's imagination. One is tempted to say that the work is direly in need of an editor to clean up the mis-spellings, incorrect use of pronouns, clumsy repetitions, etc., but even that would not solve the main problem with this book: the author has taken new and fascinating information and made it boring.My only hope is that there is room for another effort to present this material to us, one which does justice to the material and our intelligence.

Not only is the story itself an excellent balance of detail and action, but the narrator did an amazing job of keeping a non-fiction book feeling like an adventure novel. I suspect the text reads that way as well. Not only does the book teach about New Amesterdam/York, it really teaches a different perspective on how to think about the origins of the U.S. as a nation. Considering the current political climate that includes plenty of Puritan elements veering towards a theocracy, the argument that New Amsterdam/York was a place of tolerance from the beginning is a much needed perspective on who \\"we\\" are in the U.S.I'll add that I am a frequent Amazon book buyer (text and audio) but this is only one of a handful of reviews that I've written.

The are a lot of guest vocalists and they don't always match with Joni's voice or songwriting. The lyrics are ok as well as Joni's voice, but the synths sound so dated by now. Most of the songs suffer from that. There are a lot of albums who have a distinct 80's sound but this one hasn't hold up that good. I own all of Joni's albums and hate to talk bad about her but this album is not one of my favourites. There is only one song on this album that is really good, the closer A Bird That Whistles. A simple acoustic track with saxophone from Wayne Shorter. The photography on the cover is beautiful as well. So, not one of her best but she has made so many exellent albums that this one pales compared to those."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dull 80's","review":"I discovered Joni this summer by chance listening to Mingus and Hejira and then I backed up to her early CD's and started buying them one by one. I was having a great time (Blue is just outstanding) and looked forward to each CD until I reached Wild Things Run Fast. Dog Eat Dog isn't much better and Chalk Mark is unfortunately probably the worst of all of her CD's - very dissapointing. There is a duet with Billy Idol on this CD which is one of the worst duo performaces of all time. I don't know who talked Joni into this CD but it was a huge mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 track makes the disc worth the price.","review":"I was disappointed in the sameness of most of the tunes on this recording. \\"Cool Water,\\" however, with Ms. Mitchell and Willie Nelson made the purchase well worth the price.

So much to listen to. After her \\"jazz\\" era, which I found inaccessible, this album blends great songwriting with rich chords, great harmonies, terrific production and - who'd have believed it - Billy Idol. Her next album, Night ride Home is similar and almost as good, if a bit literary. Turbulent Indigo left me bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-original tracks better","review":"Like that '80s depth of field, enjoy the synthesizer when it's used sparingly and tastefully, as it is here. Funny that the '80s now sounds more dated than some of the music Joni references from the past, a cool cover of \\"Cool Water\\", plus a few other songs recalling \\"Johnny Angel\\" and \\"Corrina, Corrina\\" (Mitchell's gotta be thinkin' 'bout Big Joe's version, yeah...).Opening song, \\"My Special Place\\", is pretty okay - sounds like the theme to an unsold 1987 TV pilot about a coffee shop run by two 36 year old divorced feminists.Once again, her lyrics stand alone as poetry - and there isn't, and never was, a whole lot of rock and rollers who could seriously sell their words separate from their music. And this keeps Chalk in a Rainstorm on the home carousel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skunk at the Picnic","review":"I dug this CD out of my collection yesterday, put it on, and started working on the computer with \\"Chalk Mark in a Rain Storm\\" playing. The opening duet with Peter Gabriel was pleasant enough, but by the time I heard \\"Lakota\\" chanted over and over, I realized this CD was both dated and discordant. As I tried to sit through a duet of Billy Idol and Ms. Mitchell, I wondered what twisted muse had inspired one of my favorite singer/songwriters on this less than stellar recording.There are some bright moments here and there, but Ms. Mitchell's better works do not, in my opinion, include this album. I see from reading some of the other reviews that I am apparently \\"ignorant\\" or worse, and I'm sure that I'll soon have as many negative votes as a porcupine has quills for daring to state a qualified assessment of an icon's work.Guess, I'm the skunk at the picnic on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Paper","review":"The calculator itself looks great and it arrived quickly.

Where's the plot? Miller wants to muse about a philosophical view that's more neurotic than sane. Who cares? The sex? Anybody can write scenes like that. They're there to break the monotony, I guess. His protagonist is not somebody I admire and care about. He admits he's a loser. No thanks. There are good books out there waiting to be read and enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suxus","review":"Well apparently there are still plenty of people in the world who will call something a work of genius as long as everyone else is doing it. It's a safe and easy way to feel intelligent. When I want well written literature I'll turn to Joyce or Faulkner, and when I want pornography I'll turn to Larry Flynt. Miller makes an attempt to combine the two but fails miserably. Seems like an effort to be controversial, attract publicity and, naturally, sell more books. Like the exploitation films of the 1970's, the buyer soon realizes they've been lured into something that's more hype than quality. I'm sorry if I'm not as enamored of Miller's personal life and perverted fantasies as I should be. Another milestone in the degredation of western culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abuse labeled art","review":"It is quite obvious to any woman reader that Henry Miller is a bad lover...of the poorest quality, and that he has no respect for women or even men, for that matter.

Now they get a full CD to explore their genre-defying sound. Brothers Damon and Alexander McMahon front them. They seem entirely fresh. At the same time they seem like they are working in the same anti-fashionable mode as Ambulance LTD and Calla. This record needs to be listened to again and again. Songs like \\"Father's House\\" and \\"Search For The Bees\\" explore new areas of songwriting. Live they are one of the best new bands. They are an assault on generic music.

A disappointing rehash of all that has come before. STILL no liner notes about the music or its composition, and a silly redux of the Celine Dion song with some of the movie's more inane dialouge cobbled in. The compilation suites are enjoyable, and the Irish music interesting--there's nothing wrong with any of the performances, just a general sense of been there, done that. (And my GOD!

As with the original soundtrack, it brings back the movie's memorable scenes from the joys of the voyage to the horrors and tragedies of the sinking.However, there was clearly not enough leftover material for a complete CD-length work, so some non-movie tracks were added. Although consistent in theme with the actual soundtrack compositions, they still feel a little out-of-place.A much better approach would have been to package the original soundtrack as a double-CD, a la \\"Saturday Night Fever\\", et. al., and include the material from this album, free of the distracting dialogue clips that were overdubbed on this album.Nonetheless, there is enough here to warrant it's purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just one word to describe it: WONDERFUL!","review":"The second \\"Titanic\\" soundtrack is really wonderful and better than the first one.

I was very happy that they put the Irish party song in this because I was very disapointed to not have seen it on the first. The only failing parts of this CD would be the Dialogue. Especaily in the Irish party song. I kept hearing Leonardo Dicaprio's voice yelling \\"whahoo\\" over and over again. It seemed to distract from the music which is why I bought the CD in the first place. I really did enjoy the CD overall. It has some wonderfully done pieces of music. I aslo liked hearing some different songs that weren't from the movie but inspired from the movie. I would say buy it if you liked the first one. It's not as great as the first but still worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice compliment to the first","review":"I enjoyed \\"Back to Titanic\\" and I thought it made a nice sequel to the original soundtrack which I also own. I disagree with some of the others who have reviewed this soundtrack and think that Josephine and the Flying Machine was unneccessary. On the contrary, I thought it was one of the best tracks on the CD. I enjoyed it thoroughly because I was one of the people while watching the movie who wondered what Rose was singing on that raft.

Well, I've got to admit Horner's score for Titanic is a good score.It's not outstanding but it's good. But all the tracks Horner didn't find good enough to be on the first album together with additional music no Horner fan is interested in and finally \\"My Heart will go on\\" with the actors' voices interfering is simply too much for me to bear.

I also didn't see the reason for having a second \\"Nearer My God to Thee.\\" The I Salonisti rendition was perfect and should have stood alone. \\"Come Josephine\\" was so haunting with Maire Brennan's vocals.

It is excellent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting and powerful.","review":"I ejoyed the new pieces in the just released CD Back To Titanic and the voice over tunes are wonderful and a reminder of why I love the movie much.

Now we have it all, and I just love James Horner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some nice Horner stuff in a manipulative mess","review":"This CD is primarily for people who don't mind cynically shameless emotional manipulation and for the Titanic-soundtrack-cry-party crowd. A good deal of very nice (if derivative of itself) Horner work (Titanic Suite, Epilogue, Portrait, A Building Panic) and some completely gratuitous and unnecesssary dialogue clips from the film ruining music that was far more powerful in the original sountrack where it was allowed to stand on its own. And what can I say of the butchery of \\"Come Josephine in my Flying Machine\\"? A lighthearted, happy 1910 popular song turned into a funeral dirge?It's too bad that Horner and the executives at Sony Classical couldn't leave well enough alone and just give us an exceptionally good example of what a film soundtrack can be; and that they didn't have enough confidence in what they had to let it stand on its own merits, rather than cheapening it with sledghammer, ersatz \\"emotion.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Product management commentary with the depth of a brochure","review":"Key word here is \\"essentials\\" since it never gets past commentary that is just trivial.

But we've moved WAY beyond that.Today, anyone in the software business should be able to have written this book. Its coverage is broad and cursory: development process, requirements management, product delivery, beta testing, pricing, internationalization, and more all in 139 pages (the rest of the book is sample documents).As an example of how shallow this book is, on page 129 she sees it necessary to define a \\"byte\\" as \\"a single computer memory space.\\" Please. If you hope to be a software product manager but don't know what a byte is, don't give up your day job.The sample documents in the appendices are not bad but they don't justify the cost of the book.The book contains numerous instances of unclear writing which lead me to believe the book was not edited professionally."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I recommend this book to all PMs. It has very practical ready to use tools.

If you were silly enought to buy \\"Realm of the Killer Whales\\" To learn about orcas you will be very disappointed. Id say 85% of this over priced pile of DVD was about the plight, breeding, and harvesting of herring. They talk about alot of animals that have nothing to do with the killer whales outside of living in the ocean.Most of the killer whale scenes are above the water. The only thing that saved this dvd is the last 5 or 6 minutes showing killer whales under the water engaging in the unusual behavior of rubbing the bodies along a pebble beach. That was pretty cool. No hunting, no up close, no shark cage perspective. I didnt even see an ivory orca tooth from begining to end. I havent watched the Sperm whale documentary. However when I do I expect to learn alot about the life cycle of freekin tunas or something. I GOT ROBBED."},{"rating":"2","title":"a jewel for sperm whale lovers","review":"Haven't yet seen \\"Realm of the killer whales\\" for my interest was on \\"Sperm whale oasis\\" wich I find very difficult to surpass.

I have the same problem!\\". It then gives you some insanely simple answers. Acne? Wash your face and use over the counter face washes and creams. Didn't help? Really? Go to a doctor.

If you are a newcomer to Kitaro - go to Mandala , Silk Road fist ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful","review":"This ablum is a journey from beginning to end filled with the richness of Kitaro's imaginative world of music. Fans of Babylon 5's music done by Christopher Franke and fans of him, may find Kitaro very up lifting. The feel of the pieces can be put in any kind of fantasy setting with unicorns and dragons flying or anything that comes to your mind. This Album is truly mystical. \\"Moondance\\", \\"Howling Thunder\\", \\"Journey To A Fantasy\\", and \\"The Light Of The Spirit\\" are good tracks to research on. If you like adventurous fantasy with a feel of some victory at some point, then you may enjoy this very much. I find painting and drawing to this music very inspiriational."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst records I have!","review":"I bought this cd because I was quite interested in what Kitaro was doing, specially in his earlier worldly music albumssuch as Ten Kai or From the Full Moon Story, all of which I think they could be his best releases (including the music for Silk Road). They had some ethnical elements that sounded pretty good mixed with the technology of late seventies and made an unique and very personal sound that I find very interesting.But what I found in The Light of Spirit was a collection of sad, tasteless even frightening songs with a poor and very easy, if not strange, arrangement (think about those electric guitars with a rock mood). All the themes fall in the easy listening that lovers of new-age seem to enjoy and nothing or very little of that ehtnical element remains here. Sun Dance, for example, tries to impress the listener with great sound but only the intention remains as Kitaro, sadly, has so much songs sounding like it along his carreer with Geffen Records."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peace of mind","review":"I think this is the best Kitaro album. Kitaro will never reach the genious Vangelis or Jean Michel Jarre but this album almost gets there. I remember the first time I've heard the main track of this album I had an out of body experience. The vocals are perfect and Kitaro reachs perfection with this particular song. Moondance is beautiful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"AN EXCELLENT BOOK FOR EIT","review":"I took EIT in Oct. 2004 and passed the test with 93.

I really disliked the review on fluids and mechanics of materials, I did not take these classes in school, and was hoping to have short summary that would give me an idea of what was going on.

An elegantly (and wonderfully-enjoyably) written book, it unveils an entirely-possible future that was altogether new to me (and altogether absent from \\"official\\" discussions of the future of air travel). A must read for those of us-- all of us-- who depend on commercial aviation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Execution of Stated Theme","review":"Billed as an outline of technologies capable of changing commercial air travel, this book presents instead a personal air travel memoir by a private pilot. The book devotes only one chapter to air equipment development that can impact the travel industry, unless the reader agrees that large numbers of air travelers will become general aviation pilots and service their travel needs in personal aircraft. The book is entertaining, but looks narcisistic when compared to the stated topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aviation Issues","review":"About 2 years ago an article was written in Aviation Week and Space Technology Magazine titled 'The future of commercial travel is on smaller aircraft.'

I highly recommend it for anyone who wants to know where the new technology is taking GA and how the Cirrus aircraft fits in. For those of us that have already place a deposit on the Cirrus SR-20 (in my case via the fractional ownership program run by OurPlane) and are waiting impatiently for its delivery, this book will remind you why the wait will be worth it.

Unfortunately, I was very, very wrong. This movie is one of the worst ripoffs of The Exorcist I have ever seen. Think of the most pathetic Italian or Mexican horror film you have ever seen (there's probably been many), and you have a vague inkling of the damage it causes to your brain cells to watch this film. No scares, pathetic \\"devil worship\\" and posession, laughable FX, no gore, not even unintentional laughs.

Mr. Metheny and his entourage create an excellent example of this. Who wants to listen to random words; who wants to listen to random notes? This is execution at it's finest.

The characters were all pitiable with nothing to endear them, all sad examples of unfulfilled adults. It was really a depressing read! I was particularly unimpressed by the main female character. She's immature and selfish, despite the few samples of caring thrown in. Ultimately there isn't anyone to care about in the novel. The cats I guess. I hope the cats make out all right in the end.There was one quote that stuck with me despite all else, delivered by Isaac: \\"When it's your party, you have no rights.\\" Ha! In the throes of wedding planning myself, I had to ruefully agree with that sentiment. As backwards as it seems, in many ways that's actually true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negativity abounds...","review":"The characters of Nora and Isaac are two of the most selfish, self-absorbed whiners I've ever read in any book. I became so uninterested in them and their so-called problems that I almost gave up on reading this book (something I hate to do). I just found them to over-whelmingly annoying. What's so bad about their lives? The author focuses on every negative aspect of these characters' lives, nothing positive. Because of this, I found I cared nothing about them. I found myself wanting to tell them to shut up, grow up and get on with life. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan of this book","review":"I didn't like this book at all! The characters were incredibly frustrating because they refused to communicate their true feelings with each other, which caused plenty of avoidable heartache on both sides. I wanted to yell at them to get out of their own heads and get a life! The writer had a very disjointed style. He would have a paragraph or two that was well thought out and flowed beatifully, followed by a paragraph that seemed haphazard and totally out of place. The worst part was the ending. He totally leaves you hanging, but sadly, I almost didn't care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not a fan of this book-","review":"I agree with the person who said there's no plot!

Don't waste yours!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Here's why I hated this book: 1) There's no plot 2) There's no plot (I know I already said this but it really, really bothered me) 3) The main character, Nora, is thoroughly self-indulgent and unlikeable 4) The point of view occasionally switches -- for no apparent reason!! -- from Nora to Isaac and back again. This would make sense if it helped move the plot along, but as I think I mentioned, there's no plot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Reminiscent of King Solomon","review":"This is a good mystery novel. Spenser is hired to protect a mother and son. The son is kidnapped by his father because he wants to get at the mother due to their divorce. The tale brings to mind the King Solomon sectionof the bible with the boy in the middle and both parents pulling in opposite directions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast read","review":"I feel the relationships between Spenser and Susan and Spenser and Hawk were not developed enough in this novel. If I weren't an avid fan of Spenser novels, I would not know the true relationship between these three (which is part of the fun of these books). Hawk and Susnan included. This book is a good read - quick and funny but I was disappointed in just the glimpse you got of Hawk and Susan."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOO SHORT, TOO SHORT!","review":"Great but too short. Should of been deeper. Covers a subject matter that hit home for me.Parental neglect, of the type where the parents, who's rotten relationship is so all consuming that you, the only child, become just another unwanted burden they can't or don't want to deal with so they cope with you by disregarding your very existence. Add to that the fact that the parents themselves have no friends and discourage you from bringing any home. Add to that the child is shy and not too bright to begin with and you end up with a 15 yr old who's still 8 yrs old.....a looser, a total blank slate. I'd like to see Parker redo this one.Spenser came along and saved the kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a detective novel","review":"If you are looking for a good mystery or detective novel, take a pass on this. It is about Spencer taking a troubled kid under his wing and helping him find his way. The actual investigative nature of the novel is probably less than 15 pages...which is neatly wrapped up with a quick ride to the bad-guy's office and shooting him.I'd pass on this one if I had it to do over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardy Boys for Bigger Kids, but its not as good","review":"I read this book for a class, yes a class, and in reading this book I had to look beyond the fact that my teacher has an infatuation with small boys in tights. I looked beyond that and tried to get into the story, but it seemed that the plot came out of an old Lassie Show. The authour has next to no writing skill, and he seems to keep pumping out books for the money. If you want to contribute to this quest, buy the book, if you are sane you won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Autumn","review":"I enjoyed this Robert Parker story the first time I read it and wanted a copy to reread now and then. It is a good story!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite Robert B. Parker books","review":"I'm an avid Robert B. Parker fan---Spenser lives in my mind, and I enjoying adventuring with him. \\"Early Autumn\\" strikes me as one of Parker's most touching stories, focusing on the the intereactions of Spenser and a troubled teen, Paul Giacomin. Besides Spenser's unfailing wit, he throws out some great comments and admonitions about growing up. What makes Spenser's remarks even more satisfying is that in the discourse between Paul and Spenser, things are not neat and tidy. Life is not always fair, nor do we always control the awful events that sometimes hit us like a solid left hook. But Spenser also assures Paul that individuals can control many things in their own lives, and that's where our focus needs to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This book is very clear, well written, and wonderfully photographed.It provides an excellent view of 15th century european martial arts as being every bit as advanced as those of the orient.The instructions are clear, and the methods practical.If you fence, practice kendo, or any other sword art, and are interested in learning how fights were really fought (as opposed to how Hollywood wants us to think they were) I fully recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The key to it all","review":"Germany produced dozens of manuals on martial arts in the 1400's. Most of them stemmed from the work of one man, Johannes Lichtenauer. He is the root and baseline for much of German combat. If you understand him, you have a much better chance of understanding anyone from the Medieval German tradition. Understand the German tradition, and you can start understanding the general Medieval tradition. Understand that...it goes on. Basically, this is a great resource for anyone who wants to start using a sword or spear or even start wrestling. Ringeck presents a sophisticated system of combat, the equal of anything else in the world. Get it, no matter what kind of martial arts you dig. It will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Work","review":"I first bought Mark Rector's _Medieval Combat_, but I didn't feel I truly grok'd many of the illustrations in that book until after I read this book.For the most part I think that Mr. Tobler's interpretations of Ringeck's verse are dead on target. But in many cases, it seemed pretty nebulous what Ringeck meant - not that surprising considering we are trying to take a very abstract description of a full-sensory 4d event - verbal, and put back all those lost details.In those cases were I couldn't figure out for myself what Ringeck meant, Mr. Tobler's work seemed at least internally consistant, and well thought out.Again, excellant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not fit new all-clad 12\\" fry pan","review":"I sent this item back because the fit was very poor considering how much the lid cost. When charging premium prices, the workmanship should match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fry Pan Lid","review":"The twelve inch All-Clad frying pan did not come with the lid. Some reviews indicated that the lids did not fit. Not worth the money or to go buy a cheaper lid. Fortuneately, I did not heed the advice of the negative reviews. A great investment. The lid fits just fine and unless I am using a splatter screen on the frying pan, this is a must have to simmer. I will admit I am using a different lid on the 10\\" All-Clad frying pan, but I seldom use a lid for the 10 inch. However I suspect I will buy the 10\\" lid sooner or later. Aside from the lid assisting in heat distribution, it just looks better than a mixed match top. Worth the expense."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lid's a lid","review":"I'm not sure what you can say about a frying pan lid. I'm also not sure how you can justify the price for this one. Nevertheless, it is a nice hunk of stainless steel, heavy, appears sturdy, and does the job.A few have complained about the fit. It is a little loose, but I'm not sure that the loose fit interferes w/ function at all. The lid is heavy and stays in place. I also have a Cuisinart Green Gourmet 12 in non-stick skillet (a very nice non-stick skillet, by the way) that this lid fits well too. Good for me because Cuisinart doesn't make a lid for their skillet. Two for the price of one.I'm happy w/ the purchase because I needed a lid for both pans and I got it. I'm not sure that a tighter fit would have made it any better, but a tighter fit may have prevented me from using it on both pans. Every cloud has a polished stainless steel lining.I gave it 4, not 5 stars initially for the high price. In retrospect, maybe 5 stars is fair but Amazon won't let me change it. It's a good lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Clad 12\\" fry pan lid","review":"Lid is perfect. I bought a 12\\" fry pan at Williams Sonoma store but they don't carry lids. Wonder why?

I received the lid promptly with no problems and am very happy with my All Clad fry pan and lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the Calphlon lid AND PAN for same price instead","review":"I had the All Clad skillet, but needed a lid. This lid is way over-priced. As others have suggested, the Calphlon Simple 12\\" non-stick pan WITH LID costs less and the glass, domed lid is a perfect fit for the All-Clad 12\\" skillet. Two for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but probably overpriced","review":"Potential buyers should be aware of a couple things:1. Most of All-Clad's lids and other accessories (things other than pots and pans) are made in China and aren't actually \\"clad,\\" the 3-layer bonded metal that is characteristic of the company's U.S. made cookware. Nobody needs a bonded metal lid, you aren't cooking on it. This info is from their website.2. You can get way cheaper lids. For example, the Calphalon \\"everyday pan with lid\\" often goes on sale on Amazon for about two dollars more than just this lid costs. That lid fits this pan like it was made for it, and is also domed so you get more space inside. Plus you have an extra pan.My advice is get a cheaper lid made by another company, or buy an all-clad skillet with this lid included when its on sale for 80-100 dollars which happens from time to time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose, sloppy fit. I am not happy with the purchase...","review":"I recently purchased an All Clad 12 inch skillet and lid. My pan and lid have approximately 1/8 to 1/4 inch of play between the edges of the skillet and lid. I would expect this from a cheap set of pots and pans, but not from All Clad. A few of the other reviewers have also mentioned issues regarding the fit.I have an 8 inch All Clad skillet and lid and those two fit perfectly. It appears there may be a production/quality problem with the 12 inch lid. I am not happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy fit","review":"As another reviewer pointed out, this lid doesn't seal as well as it should. I suppose the 5-star reviews received a slightly different product.In comparison, the All-Clad lids for my 10.5 inch frying pan an 1-quart sauce pan fit perfectly.I gave it only 2 stars because of the fit was not what I expect for a $47 lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"unlike the pan you'll be covering it with, this is not made in the US","review":"This lid is actually made in China, not the US. I'm willing to pay more for domestic labor, but the price is pretty egregious considering its origins."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China/discontinued by All Clad","review":"After reading the reviews for this item, I called All-Clad customer service to ask about complaints that this lid did not fit the pan properly. While they did not admit to any product defect, I found out that this item was made in China, and has now been discontinued.All-Clad used to make all their stainless steel lids in China, but they recently brought lid manufacturing back to the USA (wonder why!!??). So their NEW line of lids is made here. However, the NEW line doesn't include a 12\\" fry pan lid. They decided there was not enough demand for it, so they are not making a 12\\" as part of their USA-made product line.What this means is that the old, China-made, potentially ill-fitting 12\\" lids are all we can get now -- while supplies last.I don't plan on buying one of the China-made ones. I'm taking other reviewers' advice and finding a different brand that will work - probably for less money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most useful pan in my cupboard.","review":"My wife and I came from different backgrounds. She swore by Calphalon before anyone else in our group ever started buying high end pans and I was almost exclusively stainless. As a result, our household now contains Calphalon, All-Clad, and a couple of stainless lined copper Mauviels.I bought the braiser about five years ago. It handles frying, sauteing, and braising beautifully. I don't flip with a 13\\" pan so not having another pan handle in the way on the stove is a real convenience. The domed lid provides good circulation and the pan itself spreads the heat quite evenly.The best part is that after turning out a great meal, this pan is a breeze to clean. (A trick I stole from Calphalon is, if need be, I can throw in some cleanser and let it soak. Nothing withstands that.)My wife has now come around to preferring All-Clad as a result of this pan. As her pans lose the anodized coating, we're simply replacing them with All-Clad."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Used Piece of Large Cookware","review":"For Christmas last year, my husband gave me my All Clad 13\\" brasier.

The music itself is somewhat diverse intertwining elements of folk, progressive rock, blues and blue-eyed soul with an edge. I hear plenty of early Mott The Hoople elements throughout this recording as well.

Pro Tennis is a buisness, so it's important to give your best performance. But does \\"Eat To Win\\" mean, eat to win a match(and big money involved with that match) or eat to win in general? Eat To Win is for me one of those books that seemed great in the Eighties but twenty years later you're not too sure about the facts in this book. Many top athletes might use this book but many top athletes have eating disorders as well. I felt after reading this book, if you only look at a bottle of kitchen oil, you turn fat, since it more or less excludes any form of fat and I've never been fat in my whole life.

Haas has basically repackaged the Pritikin diet from the 70s and added some of his own mumbo jumbo. Unless you're an endurance athlete eating a huge volume of calories to keep up with your expenditures, you probably won't get enough protein from this diet.Do some real research, and follow the simple (and un-magical) recommendations of researchers who have done real peer-reviewed studies.As far as my own annecdotal evidence, my performance in cycling and alpine climbing improved immensely when I ditched the Haas plan and embraced a more traditional 60-25-15 diet designed for athletes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eat to Get Fat","review":"Haas needs to get with the 21st century.

Many of their danceable songs are produced by Giorgio Moroder who is famous for mega disco hits sung by Donna Summer.Let me add that the lead singer Terri Nunn appeared in the disco movie Thank God It's Friday(circa 1978) in the role of teen-ager Jeannie.

But my local New Orleans radio station (a Katrina survivor, like me) kept playing \\"No More Words\\" and I could not get that song out of my head, so I bought this CD. It's heavy on synths and beats, with just enough metal guitar thrown in. And of course, there's Terri Nunn, who can put out a rock tune right up there with the best of them. My favorite cut is \\"No More Words\\", but 2 other interesting ones are \\"Sex (I'm A...)\\", which plays with your head sonically and lyrically, and \\"Matter Of Time\\", which is experimental, heavy and haunting.

I bought it for Christmas last year and I love it to pieces. Every song is amazing especially The Metro, Sex, No More Words, Blowin' Sky High, Masquerade, and Matter of Time. Frontwoman Terri Nunn has a beautiful and powerful voice, she's got some pipes!The song, Take my Breath Away ultimately caused a riff between the band and their creative process became threatened due to the popularity of that song. Even so this short-lived band made some incredible, heartfelt, weighty songs and all that matters. Berlin was a gift from God, great band, coy songs, and awesome frontwoman, eat your heart out Gwen Stefani, Terri was the real deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"acorralada","review":"Again i am very upset with amazon's false advertising, why do you keep putting up that this has english subtitles, when that is not the case, please stop putting out these dvds when you know that this is not the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome","review":"I think this soap was great.

My spanish is passable enough to get the gist of what was going on; and, let's face it, it's a soap opera, the plotlines aren't terribly deep. Even if they were to start with, the amount of cutting that happened to get this down to 10 hours makes the whole thing one big romp from bedroom to bedroom.

However, if you are the average person that knows some facts about the lost cities, such as Pompeii near Rome you might want to pass on this one. But you can't beat the price if you are looking to add to your collective historical library. The documentaries were done back in the 1990's but there is good educational information here for the taking. I was familiar with most of the cities mention, but I was able to pick up some interesting pieces of information. I still find the discussion on the Forbidden City and its colorful history worth revisiting and even though I had heard about Port Royal - lost city of pirates I didn't know it was in Jamaica. All in all I would recommend this DVD for those looking for a little more information on the subject matter or someone who does not know anything about the cities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foolproof and noise free","review":"I am using these in my home to share a broadband internet connection.

For some reason, the IP addressing goes off when adding a second (or third) unit.

One or two of them raised some concerns, but I obviously ordered it anyway.My experience... Installed in a snap, just follow the directions (don't use it through a power strip, UPS, etc.) & it only took 60 seconds to get it working. It came with a utility with a few tools. One particular tool that I liked is that it shows signal quality/strength just like a 802.11b connection. The prodcut claims \\"14mb Max\\" throughput. According to this tool I'm getting 9.5mb with excellent signal quality (about 80-85%).Overall... The product works excellent for what it was designed for, i.e. low speed LAN connection. It certainly does not have near the performance of a 100mb LAN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does the job, but poorly","review":"It works as advertised but it needs to be reset frequently - unplug, plug in, unplug, plug in, after owning it for a few months (probably when the warenty expires :-) ).

Our house is about 3 years old, so the wiring should be sound. Thus far, my experience has been that I get full connection between some outlets, and none between others. There is no obvious reason for this - some plugs next to each other don't work, while others across the house do. Some rooms have lots of things plugged in while others have none.

In fact, my latest purchase was to replace a unit.

My wife told me she would not allow me to cut holes in the walls of our home for Ethernet cabling, so I decided to let the existing electrical wiring, handle networking chores as well.

Since losing my dad, I've struggled with fears I haven't had since being a teenager and feel like I've had the rug pulled out from under me.

It helped me more effectively deal with many bereavement issues. In The Orphaned Adult, psychologist Alexander Levy provides thoughtful, head-and-heart analysis of what it's like to lose one's parents. He draws the meaningful distinction between those who have lost one parent and those who've lost both. A person who has lost both mother and father is forced to confront his or her own mortality because there is no longer a generation that stands between that individual and the reaper. Drawing on examples from his practice, Levy sees bereavement as an opportunity for self-exploration and growth, a chance to find out what you really want out of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review","review":"I am not an orphaned adult. My mother has passed but my father is still alive. I do not have a relationship with my father therefore I do feel \\"orphaned\\".

I like how it explains that we all need to find a new identity after such a devastating loss. I would recommend this book to anyone who has lost a parent. My sisters will be getting a copy once our father passes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the same person who took the cookie from the cookie jar...","review":"One of the reviewers on Amazon.com I think correctly described this book as \\"bathroom reading.\\" I agree wholeheartedly. The book reads like an encyclopedia more than anything else, and it's not recommended to read it in large sections (like I did) because you'll be bored quickly. Apparently its part of a series, and this one focused exclusively on language (Where did the term Peeping Tom come from? What does it mean to mind your Ps & Qs?, etc). I suppose if I read a few explanations every day while in the bathroom the novelty wouldn't have wore off so quickly.

It really makes each song interesting and gives the listener a great chance to hear the lyrics and understand the depth of the song.I find this album to be very unique - I have never heard a group with a similar sound (but I don't know much about 80's music!).

Edie Brickell sings about - \\"electric dye in her lover's hair\\" - \\"living it up to die in the blink of a public eye.\\" \\"The Wheel\\" actually sounds like a wheel spinning around, and \\"What I Am\\" is simply...what it is.This album is filled with original music, and Brickell's voice is amazing, flattening out and dipping low and then raising high, taking the listener by surprise. Although the lyrics to some of the songs aren't the most introspective, they give a variety of different moods and situations.This is a very laid-back compilation of songs that can lull you to sleep or put you into a relaxed mood.

Only better can come from this band"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical at first - takes a couple of listens......","review":"but now I love it every bit as much as the first two CD's. I am glad that Hootie and the Blowfish doesn't rely on the same old formula sound - instead they seem to be growing both as artists and people and it shows on this album. I would highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good album, but not as good as previous ones","review":"Well, one of my favorite bands Hootie & the Blowish's new album is not as genious and musically perfect as previous ones (they are still seem fantastic to me), but it is really good and interesting . Especially \\"I Will Wait\\" and \\"Wishing\\"... Really good music while driving a car somewhere in MidWest... Or just sitting in small bar there..."},{"rating":"2","title":"One word: solid!","review":"The boyz from Columbia have done it again. Thematically similar to Fairweather Johnson, Musical Chairs is nonetheless a better album. The band shows its varied style to a hilt on this album. \\"What's Going on Here\\" has a \\"Tucker's Town\\"ish chorus and will be a hit single when released. The acoustic \\"Michelle Post\\" recalls the Rucker/Bryan cover of Tom Waits's \\"Closing Time\\". Would have given album five stars except for the limp \\"Desert Mountain Showdown\\" and \\"What Do You Want From Me Now.\\" Overall though, a great album with catchy melodies you will be humming in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This CD You Won't Be Sorry!!!!!","review":"Hootie & The Blowfish know how to write great songs that you want to hear over and over again. I love them and reccomend them to everyone! Take a ride with Hootie and get this album, you will thank me later. And buy it for someone who won't buy ot for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT IS THE BEST HOOTIE YET","review":"i used to hate the way hootie made all his songs sound exactly alike finnaly he got smart and really tried hard to make these amazingly great songs vary in sound the cd is just plain great so if u dont buy it u got problems i would also like to tell you this cd has at least 7 #1's on and all of the songs are just pure excellent"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever!","review":"The first time that I heard of Hootie and the blowfish was on an episode of friends and ever since then I've been hooked. This is a top album and one of the best that I have ever bought. The album shows a different variety of songs going from a country feel, to rock songs. My favourite songs on the album are\\"closet full of fear\\" and \\"what do you want from me now.\\" If you like to chill in the summer then this is the sort of album to do it to, it is totally worth the money. Go get it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine didn't work","review":"I bought one of these new, but since it continued to be on back-order I bought a used one. When I got it is was still in the original package. The batteries were shot and corroded in place. After cleaning it worked but only for a day or so. Now I barely get a red dot at a range of an inch or two.I am very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laser pen review","review":"I thought that the pen was very accurate.

It was also very small, so if the teacher came near, I just stuck it in my pocket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works","review":"Tape arrived in acceptable time and condition. Used to attach to a rubber seal that meets glass so that the glass can move. Cleaned the rubber with alcohol and then attached this. It is still attached but have to re-press in some areas. Overall good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Felt, it's tape, and it works.","review":"Well what can I say, it's felt tape. One side has excellent adhesion properties... And, on the other side felt... Nuff said."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good!","review":"I used this tape to provide a contrast edge for a projector screen I built. I find this a perfect tape for that purpose. It absorbs excessive light from the projector without any reflection. The glue is manageable until firmly installed.In all, a great product. (especially for its price!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Stick","review":"Every morning I'd wake up and my screen would be removed from the wall (partially) I tried sanding the wall down to get a better grip..nothing. I will say that they did send me two rolls and only charged me for one which was nice because I went through the first roll in about a week trying to keep this thing up. I eventually just stapled the screen to the wall put the tape over the edges and stapled the tape to the wall. I don't think you can really call it tape at that point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sticky","review":"The back of the felt is barely sticky at parts. Had to use glue,, what gives ?? Otherwise nice felt"},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely handy for curing those annoying rattles and squeeks","review":"I have been looking for something to use in the automotive realm to cure annoying squeaks and rattles. A lot of manufacturers use felt between clips etc. to lessen the noise from moving parts. This product does just that. Easy to apply with the self adhesive backing, and the perfect width. I have used this on my door locks which were plastic on plastic and also on my driver seat. The leather was rubbing the plastic frame, so I used this between the two and whoola, no more noise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality","review":"I was happy to see that the JVCC-FELT-06 tape I ordered had the high quality clear adhesive backing. If you like to do jobs right the first time, this is the stuff you need.

Do not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool designs","review":"Another Dover Publications book. This one has ten temporary tattoos of various mythological creatures. The mermaid is a bit plain compared to Ruth Soffer's beautiful pictures in her \\"Mermaids Tattoos\\" book, but is pretty in its own right. The head of Medusa is interesting and unusual. The Pegasus tattoo is lovely and well detailed, as is the Chinese dragon. Other designs included are a centaur, a unicorn, the Minotaur, the Phoenix, the Sphinx, and a griffin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoddy","review":"I've had this product for around a year & kept it in pristine condition. But yesterday, without rhyme or reason, the display console stopped working. Completely dead. Nothing, absolutely nothing, was done to cause this malfunction.Called customer service. If you're no longer under the one year warranty, it costs 1/3 of the price to get a replacement console. And note that, if the console fails, you basically have an expensive, ugly piece of trash on your hands.Since this console failure isn't a rare event (do a search to collaborate this), I'd advise that you look elsewhere. Spend the extra money to buy a more reputable product, and save yourself the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warranty is not long enough","review":"This trainer had worked great for a little under 2 years. While it was working it was a delight to use, and did the job well. However, the peg for the pedal that is attached to the wheel recently became loose, rendering the trainer virtually unusable.I called Fitness Quest, and since the 1 year warranty had expired, the only thing they offered me was a 20% discount on a new one. I am definitely looking elsewhere for my next trainer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two in a row broke - don't buy!","review":"Neither of the two models I had lasted more than a year with occasional use. Eventually the motor goes, meaning you have little resistance. The \\"savings\\" on this lower cost model are not worth it, and I feel bad about putting two big machines in the landfill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overall machine","review":"This elliptical was super easy to put together and provides a good workout. The hardest part was getting it out of the box! It is lightweight, which is probably why I am only giving it 4 stars. It doesn't stay where I put it. The room I have it in has plush carpet. I put it on a fitness machine mat, but it moves when I use it. I may have to move it to the kitchen, where the floor is hard. It is easy to move around if you don't have to turn corners. You have to pull it by the handle up on the wheels on the front of the unit, which makes the handles stick out, so corners can be tricky. Also, when putting on the handle bars, use a 10mm socket. The tools it comes with don't work really well."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"This trainer is great. Though it produces some squeaky sound, overall I'm happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"got it over 3 years ago... still going nowhere fast.","review":"small stride, makes it weird for me, but ok for my wife. it chewed through batteries (6 C's), and the power adapter (not included) was difficult to find.. not on amazon, not on fitnessquest's website, not @ radioshack, etc... i ended up wiring an old cellphone charger to it (specs were close enough). looks nice & ghetto. oh yea, and grease got on the new carpet, that was cool too. still, gets the job done."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this machine...","review":"A year after we bought the first elliptical the Eclipse 1175 in was recalled and replaced with this one. 1 1/2 years has gone by and it is now broke. The right pedal attachment to the flywheel is loose and there is no where to tighten it... this will be going out to the street tomorrow... such a shame. I am now looking into the Sole e35 elliptical because of the high reviews- although I wanted a cheaper machine- I also want it to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one is going back","review":"I ordered this product 6 weeks ago. I received it within 5 days. Once assembled, the motor did not work, so I called the manufacturer. I was told that they would ship a new elliptical within 7 to 10 days, at which time I was to return the original one to them. After a couple of weeks, I called the manufacturer again. I was then told that the item was backordered and that it would be another 1 to 2 weeks before I would receive it. After 3 weeks,I still haven't received it. Today I called the seller, not the manufacturer, and they are going to have the item picked up by UPS and refund my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remember..","review":"You get what you pay for. This elliptical lasted for about two years before it broke. I rode it just about every day for 30 +/- minutes. I really had a hard time aligning the main column so that the left/right steps function correctly. I will buy another elliptical but plan to upgrade."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice while it lasted...","review":"We've had this elliptical for a year and a half. In the first year, we had to have the computer replaced 3 times, which was covered under the 1-year warranty. The computer broke again a few months ago, so we could still use the machine but could not adjust resistance. Now one of the pedals is falling apart, making the machine unusable. We enjoyed using the elliptical - it had a smooth motion and was quiet, although it's not gym quality - but in our experience it was not reliable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was sent used/repackaged and non-functional product","review":"The trainer I was sent was non-functional and had probably been returned by someone before me because the components didn't align well when assembled according to instructions. Amazon refunded the purchase amount and arranged pickup so no complaints there. However I spent more than two hours assembling it with great care before it turned out that the previous owner also had the same issue with the alignment (extensive scratch marks on the body exactly where the problem was). I hope they don't resend the same trainer to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has its limitations","review":"The Eclipse 1100 HR/A trainer is priced reasonably for a home use elliptical trainer, but I must say I was kind of disappointed in the performance of this trainer. I am fairly petite at 5' 4\\", and found the pedals awkward and hard to work even at the lowest level of resistance. Even though it only has a 15\\" reach, for me, I am maxed out at that stride length. And the arm bars squeak while using, even with all hardware tightened as much as possible. It's ok, but I think there's better out there. I've come to the conclusion it's important to first try an elliptical on for size before purchasing sight unseen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you don't care how far you've gone","review":"The elliptical I received was not the one in the picture. The screen was completely different. The setup was pretty easy. When I started to use it, the speed and distance stayed at zero even though I was on it for a good few minutes. I tried to find some answers in the owner's manual, but all I found was a few workouts and nutritional facts. I emailed the company, and I am now waiting for a response. Besides the screen not working properly, it's a pretty good machine. It's not like the ones at the gym at all, but that's why you pay so little for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst fitness machine I've ever owned","review":"This is the second Eclipse I've owned - I returned the first one for the same problem that I now have with this machine. The nut that secures the rear peg to the disc separates after only a few months use. This is NOT repairable because the grommets etc. are destroyed in the process rendering the machine unusable. It is now a large paperweight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy expecting more than a throwaway...","review":"I purchased the big brother to this, an Eclipse 2100 HR/A a little under three years ago. It has seen very light use, however recently started making a grinding noise on higher resistance levels. After some minor disassembly I found the problem--the flywheel (made of plastic) has warped and is now rubbing against the magnet plate when it moves closer to provide greater resistance. I contacted customer support and thus far have been told the only available replacement part is the belt. The belt is perfectly fine, so it appears I now have a rather large $500 paper weight..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could use it!","review":"I was excited to use this product. Unfortunately, after 2 attempts at delivering me one that was not damaged, I gave up and still don't have an elliptical. I don't know if it came that way from the warehouse or the delivery service damaged it, but I guess be careful buying large products from Amazon. One good thing, the customer service was good and helpful in returning the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"We hate the sixth one too.","review":"We received this unit as a replacement for a recalled version made by the same company. Because we purchased the unit from Target in the first place, we were unable to take advantage of Amazon's full refund. These things must grow on trees in this factory because they never hesitate to send us a whole new unit when ours breaks down every 2-8 weeks. If you do buy this, buy it through Amazon, but don't think you're not going to be assembling and disassembling these things like it's your job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the money","review":"I have had this elliptical for about a month and so far, so good. It was extremely easy to put together, my 16 year old and I had it up and running in about 45 minutes - however either one of us could probably have done it ourselves in a little more time. I use it about every other day and have had no issues except for some creaking noises in the beginning that have since stopped on their own. The computer is a bit hard to figure out, still working on that as there are no clear directions for it. The instructions tell you more about how to stretch out than how to actually work the machine. All in all, I am pleased with the purchase. For the price I think I got a great machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"First one broke, replacement has now broken the same way","review":"I take Amazon ratings into account when deciding to make a big purchase. After seeing a 4.5 star rating I felt pretty confident with this purchase.The first one I received broke after 2 months of occasional usage by my wife and I. (Both moderately fit). I went through the hassle of disassembling the first one and sending it back. Got the second one in the mail and it broke the same way within 3 weeks.I got the impression from Eclipse that this is a fairly common issue. The customer service rep knew exactly what I was talking about when I said \\"The linkage below the foot platform has come loose\\". Apparently there is no way to fix it and it requires a replacement by mail every time.Eclipse is happy to send me a third replacement machine. Fortunately Amazon has decided to offer me a refund as an alternative.If you buy this, keep the box because you'll probably have to send it back!Amazon - goodEclipse - bad"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fitness is Religion","review":"Fitness is Religion covers all the wellness basics in a very well written, eye catching format.

Truly inspirational in tone and images, this book is great if you're looking for reasons to start a fitness routine anew or energize a lagging one. However, some of the diet recommendations are questionable as far as fitting yourself into protein categories - the nutrition advice should be looked at as healthy guidelines and not gospel formulas.

I then clicked on \\"play all\\" and after the first episode played, it went back to the menu. I tried it a few times and got the same result.

Villa Elaine is most probably the best album I have ever encountered. The lyrics, guitar, and overall musical score are amazing. I've heard everyone compare them to radiohead, U2, Queen, and others, but I feel like RZ has a style all it's own. I haven't been able to take this cd out of my player since I've bought it, and I've told everyone I know about this amazing band. They're sure to be legends of their time. I was blessed to be able to hear them live in Dallas, TX at Deep Ellum Live with Semisonic. They are the most energetic, emotional, and gripping artists I have ever encountered. Buy this cd and you'll be perpetually satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Villa Elaine is A Sensory Feast.","review":"Zero has an eclectic variety of style to their music. While creating an aura all of their own, at times they seem familiar. Sort of an aggregation of sounds meshed together ranging from Radiohead to Jeff Buckley and at moments even Queen, Porno for Pyros and the Beatles.The transitions are amazing as are the harmonious and intuitive vocalists, the Tate brothers. Already 100% better than their last album. I can't wait to hear what there music will evolve into next. ~Christy Taylor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Overlooked Gem - Ahead of Travis, Coldplay, Muse","review":"Don't get me wrong - Travis, Coldplay and Muse are all just great, but Remy Zero is a cut above. Villa Elaine is fantastic. Yes, there are hints of Jeff Buckley and Bends-Era Radiohead, but the songs are more tightly constructed, and they stick in your head. \\"Motorcycle\\" is particularly excellent. I'm really looking forward to their next album. Muse in particular MUST have been listening to Remy Zero when they recorded their album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This CD is absolutely amazing. I loved almost every song on it. Cinjun Tate's voice is tremendous and could probably make anything sound good. The only drawback for me is \\"Goodbye Little World.\\" Shelby sounds like he's drunk when he's singing it and took crack before writing it. It's so weird, I can't explain it. All I can say is that when I first heard it, I laughed for almost 5 straight minutes. If THAT song wasn't on there, I'd give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mellow goodness","review":"This is the first Remy Zero CD I've ever owned and it gets better every time I listen to it. The lyrics and music are like nothing I've ever heard before; though \\"Goodbye Little World\\" is very Beatle-esque. \\"Gramarye\\" has this rising chorus that hooks you immediately.

Everyone is compairing them to Radiohead and U2, and I can easily see how they are similar. What the first five songs on \\"Villa Elaine\\" remind me of, especially the vocals, is Jeff Buckley, who produced some of the finest pop melodies of the 90's. As a whole, this sounds like a record the Manic Street Preachers would have been proud to make.To be truthful, I bought this album without hearing the faintest note of it. They are the support act for the Manic Street Preachers (my favourite band) 1999 North American Tour, so I figured that I should find out who these guys are as well. It was a nice suprise. Every song is a story, equally engrossing and catchy. \\"Prophecy\\" is by far my favourite track. A rare pop record that is a cut above the mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blown away!","review":"I first heard a Remy Zero song on the TV show Roswell and I was so impressed by it that I immediately downloaded it. I then decided to give the album a listen to on Amazon.com and I have to say that I was blown away! I've never heard music quite like this before- it's not 'pop' music but it's so melodic while being alternative simultaneously. There's real power behind the vocals on all of the tracks and my favourite track has got to be Yellow Light-it's incredible!!

I have listened to this disc repeatedly and it simply does not gel for me. The elements are all there, but it just doesn't have that certain intangible that makes it a great record. It has received great critical acclaim as well as a consenus 4-5 star pick on this board.My sense is that Remy Zero is trying to do Radiohead. I read where Thom Yorke was somewhat influenced / liked their first record. But the problem with trying to be Radiohead is simple: there is nobody who can be Radiohead but Radiohead themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you 'so-called' reviewers thinking!","review":"There are times when I feel that I made a mistake choosing a CD, you know, the one that you never listened to again. Well this CD goes way beyond that, so much so that it went back for a trade in! I was just browsing the reviews and it seems that they all have something in common, a bad taste for artists. I have been in the music industry for 18 years now so and of course it is my opinion, but I have heard this type of style played and abused many times over. There is no original creativity at all in the beats or melodies, hence the constant comparison to much better bands that had done it all before these guys. Their saving grace on this album is some good vocal work by the lead singer, but his talents could be better spent with a backing band from Seattle. I give the thumbs down on this chestnut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hype Hype Hype","review":"How boring is this? Is this all a band needs to do these days, record songs in the style of really good bands? Not that I have a problem with that but at least those band injects a little of their personality into the music they make. Remy Zero fails to do that to the \\"music\\" they make. This is CD is poorly written and it sounds like different artists that we all know and love.

The sound effects and phrases are amusing, and there's lots of different interactions (push, pull, twist, turn, etc).Indoors, however, it's just too loud, even for adults (children generally have better hearing than adults, so if it's loud to us, it's even louder to them)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy","review":"My son has this toy.....I think it's hilarious and probably play with it more than he does. It's too funny. As for it being loud....it's no louder than some of the other toys out there. It's extremely durable as we have laminate flooring and my son has tossed/dropped it several times.

The music is out of this world! There is just something about \\"Little Shop of Horrors\\" that makes you wanna get up and sing along to the music. \\"Skid Row (Downtown),\\" \\"Somewhere That's Green,\\" \\"Some Fun Now,\\" \\"Dentist!,\\" \\"Feed Me (Get It),\\" \\"Suddenly Seymour,\\" \\"Suppertime,\\" and \\"Mean Green Mother From Outerspace,\\" are all stand-out songs that are great and love 'em.

Though i thought the movie soundtrack was pretty good but it was missing a few things. First of all Little Shop the movie is supposed to be looked at more in a movie sense then by the great vocals, meaning it is a lot smarter to buy the movie and see a good movie with mediocre singers than by a CD of just mediocre singers. However i did quite like Rick Morannis even though i liked Lee Wilkof better (from Broadway.) Also i thought Ellen Greene in the movie was annoying and hard to understand whereas on the Broadway CD i thought she sounded quite good. All in all i think Little Shop shoulde be looked at for the movie not the soundtrack."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie Soundtrack Made","review":"I saw the 1986 film version of Little Shop Of Horrors with Rick Moranis and Ellen Greene and then rented out the movie soundtrack from the library and found that Suppertime(Reprise), Suddenly, Seymour(Reprise), and Feeding the Plant(the number where Orin gets chopped up) that are seen in the movie were not on the soundtrack. Also the guy who says the Prologue on the soundtrack is not the same voice as herd in the film....WHATS UP WITH THAT!So if you want to buy this soundtrack read my review first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged","review":"I bought this cd brand new, took it out of all the wrappings and put it in my cd player.

As the story moves on, the reader finds out that Emily has a troubled past she's never dealt with and an even more troubled present to sort out.

Taking a knife fight to a ground fighting situation on purpose is dumb. The aikido/jujitsu styled locks used to control the arm will only work if the attacker is not a trained fighter or is just weaker than you. For example in one of the techniques it requires you to hold the weapon hand with your lead hand & do a wrestler's leg pickup on the other without first injuring you opponent - imagine how strong you would have to be to pull this off. There is no way the majority of these techniques are going to work against a big grown man who is drunk or under the influence who is trying to cut you up. In short - his book is lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grundig FR200","review":"I bought this radio for use if the power goes out before storm.

Granted, you won't be able to read what the designers has to say, but I think just the artwork makes up for it, especially many drawing / sketches never showed up in the game (Ruby in human form, for example).I think if you like the Lunar series, this is a must-have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's going on.","review":"I have had saturn for a while and I could not figure this game out for my life!

The Chemical Wedding is an allegorical tale of the processes of \\"alchemy.\\" Written in coded and highly symbolic language, the book is historically important, but also important for the practicioner of spiritual alchemy or ritual magic in the Golden Dawn or Rosicrucian traditions.

I can only boil about 1-inch over the bottom of the colander without this occuring. Can't cook much pasta in 1-inch of water.

It is much shallower than a standard wok, and has a much larger flat portion on the bottom than a standard flat-bottom wok (it is more like a deep skillet with a lid than it is wok-like). Yes, one could stir-fry in it, but that means little (one could try to stir-fry in a skillet or sauce pan also). This makes the complaints of \\"Student\\" moot; this pan was never meant to replace a traditional wok (if it was, why would All-Clad also make a wok in the same series of pans?).Stir-frying will certainly be easier and better in an actual wok; I have one made by Calphalon and it is great. As far as this chef's pan goes, I plan to use it primarily for fricassees and braises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size for 2-4 people, Scratches easily","review":"Good \\"wok\\" for 4 people or 2 people with leftovers. It is not big enough for more than 4. Overall good sturdy construction and it does heat evenly. I use medium or medium heat, does not require anything higher or may burn the oil/food. No problem with sticking as long as you keep stir-frying.I bought the metal All-Clad Stainless Solid Square Spoon and used it to stir-fry with this wok. What a big mistake! It left irreversible scratches all over the wok after just one time of light use! So the lesson here is DO NOT USE METAL UTENSILS ON THIS WOK!! Use wooden ones instead. I called All-Clad and they said their limited warranty does not cover these kinds of scratches, only manufacture defects. Be warned!This wok has performed very well otherwise.

The \\"targets\\" of the story (if, indeed, there is one) seems to be persons who believe that they better than anyone else for whatever reason. As an alternative to her (or his) interpretation, I would suggest that the stereotypes be opera lovers and fundamentalists of any religion.I will give this book to my stepkids and my only reason to doubt that they will enjoy it is that they might think it was intended only for younger children.It's been referred to as a \\"fable\\". If that is so, then the moral is clearly \\"Be willing to accept change.\\" And that is a very good lesson indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful!","review":"This is quite a lovely story, with great illustrations (by the same person who did \\"The Stinky Cheese Man\\"). Humorous, happy, and not just for children.By the way, my mother works in a press, and upon showing up with this book the entire (admittedly small) press was simply amazed by the production. For the price you pay for it, this book is very, very beautifully produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belongs in everyone's library","review":"I would buy any book written by George Saunders; his is an astounding genius.

As it is, I will have to settle for buying ten or twelve, giving them away, and hoping that each recipient will do likewise."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent fable that can be enjoyed on multiple levels","review":"The \\"Very Presistent Gappers of Frip\\" is a wonderful fable that adults will love and that kids will enjoy as well, but on a different level. (Much as \\"the simpsons\\" has many layers.) The illustrations are also great. Lane Smith's artwork evokes the surreal quality of Saudners prose perfectly. The tale is typical of Saunders' short stories in his earlier books, although without any perversity or \\"unsuitable\\" language. The story is bizarre and endearing; the characters live in a world so different than our own, yet they seem so familiar anyway. This book is expensive considering its brevity, but is worth it just for the illustrations, let alone a funny story by George Saunders. In short: Buy it! Buy it now! Buy extra copies to give as gifts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"George Saunders Rocks.","review":"I had read all of Mr. Saunder's work, but had avoided the Very Persistent Gappers of Frip until I saw it on sale at Amazon.

It is just a matter of time before they get the idea of walking them down to the beach and dumping them into the sea.This book is funny and insightful and great for kids and grown-ups alike.

To this day, not having seen the book in nearly 20 years, I can recall vividly the illustration of Argus with his hundred eyes, standing in Hera's chamber. Or Athena, springing fully formed from Zeus' head. Another thing I like is that the authors didn't sugarcoat any of the Greek myths, which were as red in tooth and claw as Nature herself.

It's a good read for youngsters and helps them out later scholastically when they need to know about the Greek pantheon. Any class of English lit, Latin, History, etc. will have allusions to them. Yes, some day they should read Bulfinch's to get the full story--fuller, anyway--but this is a great introduction. If you're thinking of setting Bulfinch's Mythology, 300-500 pp, in front of a grade-schooler, you have got to be out of your mind.This one's for the kids.The incredibly colorful illustrations and easy-to-understand language allow this book to relate the story of Zeus and his raucous and dysfunctional family. Each god gets their own chapter, and their most important myths are explained.Again, if you're looking for a more-in-depth title, Bulfinch is the way to go. If you're looking for a neat book on myths to share with your kid or young friend, this would be it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The students love it!","review":"This book is a favorite in my school library.

Be it a small child, a middle-aged adult, or a senior citizen, all ages will be delighted with this highly detailed, awesomely illustrated, soon-to-be classic"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!","review":"The person speaking in this documentary was difficult to understand since there was background noise going on during the entire documentary and the person speaking was drowned out by this noise. I wish I hadn't bought it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sewing machine trolley","review":"Very good looking and durable item. Perfect size for a portable sewing machine. Nice extra pocket for sewing essentials. Merchant and item highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"$315 for a bulb?????","review":"$315 for a bulb? WTF?! I know the standard 55 watt #13355 bulb is about twenty bucks. Maybe this 85 watt version should be $31.50. PIAA products are always expensive, because you pay for all of that INCREDIBLE HYPE. Sometimes they even work. I don't know if Amazon hiccupped on pricing here, but I doubt anyone is crazy enough to order a replacement bulb for $315, even for a PIAA lamp. BTW, these prefocused PIAA bulb are proprietary and expensive. I strongly suggest lamps with readily obtainable bulbs, such as the universally available H3 halogen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This book is great.

Bought it to help my fishing but got so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"COWGIRL","review":"I LOVED MY LAMPS THE ONLY DISAPPOINTMENT WAS THAT THEY WERE A LITTLE SHORT THAN I ANTICIPATED. VERY WELL MADE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Leadership Book I've Read In Years","review":"Most leadership books are either unrealistic, full of nonsense, or downright boring or useless. Jim Stroup has somehow managed to transcend all these hazards to provide us with one of rare compelling, inspiring, and relentlessly useful book on the topic. I was especially struck with his contrasts and deep exploration of leadership from the rear, leadership from the rear, and leadership from within. This book really surprised me, it has been around since 2004 and and is an unappreciated gem. I wish I had read it earlier, but I am glad that I am now. I just added it to my list of favorite boss books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dies an early death","review":"I did not buy the 6 combo but the 5 combo. I just did'nt get the planer.I am a contractor in UT. First off the drill was out performed by my Panasonic 15.6 volt by both torque and length of run time, plus it's lighter and smaller. The sawzall needs a new blade quite often or it's run time is severally reduced. I have used a Dewalt and have received much better performance.The circ saw performed well but again the battery did not last as long as I would hope for. The flashlight worked very well. Over all I was quite disappointed with the Bosch combo.I never thought I would say this, but yellow kicked blues butt."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bosch","review":"I was under the impression Bosch made good quality tools.Bosch from my recent experience has VERY poor qualtiy control.The jig saw in this set worked twice (on thin plywood) and now just smokes and really heats up the battery.The flashlight never worked.The drill has been working OK, but the chuck is pretty poor, the bits tend to rotate if the bit just binds a little."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T buy Bosch","review":"I 've been a carpenter for 30 years and have owned many different makes of tools and with the exception of Ryobi my recent bosch purchases have been the most disappointing. If you are a tradesman save yourself alot of pain DON'T buy Bosch! If your like me and remember when Bosch was a quality tool it is no longer true. It is not same company by any means. I'm at the point where I want to throw a couple thousand dollars worth of tools into the dumpster, and start fresh with Makita whom I should have stuck with in the first place. They fooled me don't let them fool you . DON'T BUY BOSCH."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great atmosphere","review":"Love the diction, the style of the prose in each story, the characters and the atmosphere. Looking back, the plots where simple, the arcs linear, and the characters pretty much sings one tune each. But combined together and you get many different flavors in short, easy to consume half stories. The connecting thread isn't an overarching plot but a theme of predacity: the predators and the preys. I wouldn't say it's better or worse than the movie. They're both really good if you approach it with the right frame of mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Challenging To Follow","review":"I found this book hard to follow. I was constantly having to look up the meaning of various words (many of which are not in the Kindle dictionary). Might just be me...There are a lot of parallel tracks to follow in this book. Went to see the movie thinking it would be easier to track on, but found it almost as confusing as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely surprise and a real treat to read","review":"I picked up this book in charity shop for the princely sum of a 1 expecting it to be a flakey summer holiday type read, which I could enjoy without having to use any of my brain's synapses. I wasn't entirely sure I understood where it was coming from for the first 20 pages or so, but stuck with it as the writing style is good and I have to say the more I read the more I was pleasently surprised. This is my first encounter with David Mitchell and I will be trying his other books in the future. I won't go into the detail as other people have done this for me but this is a book with real content and substance without being too obvious. It is well worth reading and committing the time to. The only bit which annoyed me slightly was the post-apocalyptic story and that's purely because the use of language took a little bit of getting used to, it was still worth sticking with and I would recommend it in an instant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Visit your library","review":"If you're thinking about buying this book, I assume you will read other reviews or summaries for info concerning the structure and stories that make up Cloud Atlas. Recapping the whole thing would be almost as tedious as reading the novel.As intriguing a notion as the concept of linking stories through time and space may be, Cloud Atlas failed to provide stories and characters that were worth spending time with. Each individual's story seemed -- there. My personal response to the characters can best be summarized by my exclamation when I got to the place where one character explains how he has arranged his suicide. \\"Thank goodness. Will the next story be any better?\\"Cloud Atlas is one of those books you can borrow from your local library. If you love it, then buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever Idea...Lousy Execution","review":"Ordinarily, I'd love something wacko like this. I read it once--disliked it. Read it again to try to better understand it--hated it. It is a verbal assault, and unless you are a masochistic reader, avoid the book...see the movie instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"Life is too short and I have too many books to read to waste my time on this boring book. Just glad I got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle version broken","review":"The first story, in the Kindle edition, ends in the middle of a sentence. I think there has been a mistake. I wish I had gotten the print edition. Now I am stuck not knowing how the first story ends, and I'm not going to bother to find the next error."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very overrated","review":"This book is borderline unreadable. Even more, it doesn't really tie into each other except through cheap B-movie lines (like something you might read in a bad fantasy or romance novel). The only part of the book that has any real narrative flow is the first part. Then it quickly goes downhill. My criticism isn't with the subject, the individual plots, or the overwhelmingly weak attempt to \\"tie everything together.\\" It is just the poor quality of the writing. It commits one of the worst crimes a book can be found guilty of...it is just boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"This is a bizarre book which I could not recommend to anyone. I wish my local library had carried it so I wouldn't have wasted the money that I spent. There are some good parts but few and far between. I read it so that I would understand the upcoming movie. I think I will need the movie to help me understand the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"One of the worst books I have ever tried to read. It reads like someone writing a jounal. I read about one third of the book and desided it was a waste of my time and money.I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"why so clever?","review":"This book was and is touted as a future classic...yep, like many classics it is ponderous, unenjoyable, has a difficult language style, and is over rated. The concept of the interlinking stories and the idea premise behind them was an interesting one but the writing was difficult to get into. Once you got into the rhythm of the writing in one story it changes completely in the next, it was like the author was letting the world know how clever he was rather than consider the reader. I read this one in stops and starts as I had to finish it for book club, but I am not sure I would have bothered if I didn't have to"},{"rating":"1","title":"Paperback is cheaper","review":"It was a perfectly wonderful book, but OH MY GOD WHY IS AN ACTUAL PHYSICAL PAPERBACK THAT NEEDS TO BE PRINTED AND SHIPPED LESS EXPENSIVE THEN A DOWNLOAD? Publishers are greedy greedy people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh!","review":"I have to agree with the folks who found this book severely wanting. I got to the North Korean chapter when things began to irk me though I struggled through it. BUT when I hit the Hawaii section I just had to quit. Some one else wrote a book with the same name not to long ago. It was a far better than this mismash. I wonder at all the rave reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't have a clue","review":"We always have to read books like this at book group, rather than anything with a proper plot. I think I started it half-a-dozen times before I gave up completely. It was dull and pretentious and I couldn't concentrate on any of the stories. I'm sorry but I really didn't enjoy it. After this book I decided to give up the book group. My girlfriend seems to enjoy it much more than I do, though, and she's still going. She seems to find the books much better than I do. And she seems to spend most of her time with her book group mates anyway these days. Maybe she'd rather be going out with David Mitchell or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hawaiian's from Canada??","review":"Like many others here I bought this book based on awards and glowing reviews. It has ended up being one of the worst books I have ever read. I am listening to it on CD and the dialect of the narrator in the Hawaii section is sooooooooooo annoying that I've almost had several accidents while listening to it while driving. The first couple of short stories were just ok, some funny parts, but the sci-fi Korean thing and now this Hawaiian guy who sounds like he from Canada, \\"Ya hey dere\\", are absolutely killing me. I've reached that point though where I will not let this book defeat me. I am going to listen to the bloody end and then maybe take a sledge hammer to the CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collage of short stories.","review":"The book just seems like six short stories to me, only interlinked because the same character name was used in a few. A few of the stories were good, and a few cliche, i.e., herroine that survives several murder attempts to win out in the end. If you like short stories then you'd probably like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heavy on prose; light on plot","review":"Heavy on prose; light on plot. The diary was especially irritating, completely written in sentence fragments. The last two parts were annoying as well, written referring to sci-fi elements not yet explained or described. I'm an avid reader, but hate literary fiction when the words are the focus and not the plot. This is more for those who love purple prose and the writing and don't mind a fragmented plot. Fortunately I rented it from the library before buying. Phew! Next time I see Tom Hanks give an interview for a film and recommend the novel, I will think twice. If you didn't enjoy this novel, you are not alone. My advice: if you hate the first 10 pages of each section, just skip it entirely because it doesn't get any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"cloud atlas","review":"I found this to be a rambling, disjointed, aggravating read. I selected the book after reading reviews and expected a great read. I plowed through about half the book before I decided I had better things to do with my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda frustrating","review":"Itnis am interesting concept. Read a half of a book. Then totally stop. Then start another half of a book a generation or two in the future with a minor reference to the one before. Repeat that seeral times until you arrive at a post apologetic future only to descend back through time through all of the other books you started earlier.I just pushed through the book to find out what happened to the first and the most likable character in the whole book.This wasn't my cup of tea and I don't intend to spend any more money to go and see the movie even if Tom Hanks is in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"It didn't work for me","review":"It's 6 stories extremely vaguely linked told with a jump of about 30 years per story as each chapter progress. Each book is supposedly written in the style of the era it's set in and based on the age of the person telling the story. The books are split with the first half told forward - the as you get to the 'end' of the last time period, it reverses telling the rest of the story for each story.As I don't read reviews ahead of reading the book I didn't know any of that.Instead of finding it clever I found myself incredibly frustrated as each chapter ended with a cliffhanger so to speak. By the time the story reversed - I didn't care anymore as the story lost its momentum. I didn't think the changing writing styles added to the story - on the contrary I felt it took away from it.Based on this I won't be reading anything else by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult...","review":"interesting book, but difficult to stay engaged in.

I do not understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"dazed and confused! \\"cloud Atlas\\"","review":"Mitchell tried too hard to be complicated and confusing, maybe to be considered \\"very brainy\\". This read was not enjoyable and I actually finished it just to see what it was all about. The centuries were never labeled which made it more confusing.

When it went to another chapter, I thought I was starting a new book until the weave between the chapters was introduced.

Would I recommend it to my friends - no."},{"rating":"1","title":"not impressed DIFFICULT READING","review":"it has been one of the most difficult books that i ever have tried to read. I am still on 1% reading and just can't understand the story. DIFFIFULT READING. It was suggested that we read the book before watching the movie.....guess i will never see the movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"Spoiler alert...this is 6-amazing short stories that don't connect to each other at all. The first half of the book is the first half of each short story. The second-half of the book is the second-half of each short story. Great individual stories...but don't expect any 'oh-my-god' moments when they all connect...they don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Reincarnated","review":"I finished this remarkable novel at the start of a long plane flight.Then I turned from the last page of CLOUD ATLAS back to its first.I don't usually re-read novels, but this book is that jaw-droppingly good. It certainly qualifies as the best book I've read since Chabon'sThe Yiddish Policemen's Union. As this Amazon page contains analysis and plot synopsis aplenty on it, I'll simply add that this is the rare novel that should have won both literature's Man Booker prize and science fiction's Hugo award.Wowsers."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLOUD ATLAS","review":"I don't mean to write a review of this book.

I had no idea what to expect and found it initially confusing but fascinating.I loved the way it all came together in the end. It is thought provoking especially about the influence of corporations on society. The characters are very interesting and the plots have lots of twists and surprises.It is an interesting blend of historical fiction and science fiction.I recommend it and now want to see the movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas: A novel","review":"I enjoy offbeat and different novels and the appeal of this one being about six different stories interconnected over centuries intrigued me.I couldn't put the book down. I went through it in four days. While it is difficult to shift with each story it is worth the effort. I \\"got\\" the central premise of how we are all connected by living and have lived. The human spirit will be reborn and love will find a way to always rise above all challenges put in the way, in the end it defines who we where, are and will be.I really want to to see the movie. Keep an open mind and just let yourself fall into the story and let it take you on an incredible ride through the lives of it's characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what the big deal is.","review":"I didn't find this book to be masterfully written or the different stories elaborately woven. I was forcing myself to finish because it was too late to turn back. Toward the end, I thought maybe it would pay off because somehow, the stories would come together and reveal something. That didn't happen. This might be one of those rare cases where the movie might be better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun read.","review":"This book is well written.

If you are up for a read that will get you thinking as the imagery passes by this book is for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloud Atlas - Or In A Fog","review":"Too much surrealism for my taste. Unable to finish book.............unususal for me. I was unable to relate to the characters in this story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"Terrible movie. Someone bought my ticket, but I still want my money back! An attempt at profound that entirely disappointed. If the emperor has no clothes, Tom Hanks, this is no movie.My only wish on this rating is that there would be a choice of negative stars, since I want my time back."},{"rating":"1","title":"A grueling read (IMHO)","review":"I found this one of the most grueling books I have ever waded through, and I'm not opposed to reading confusing and trying content. I suppose I'm just not sophisticated enough, but I couldn't wait to get to the last page and delete it off my Kindle. The story line was somewhat interesting, but not overly so. The entire book, to me, was just a lead up to the final \\"moral\\" the author wanted to get across. Hope the movie is more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"At times, confusing, and I really never could figure the whole meaning of this book. I understand that human beings are cruel, and that we will probably self destruct, and/or blow our selves up, it was depressing. I know that there had to be a point made, but it was not strong enough for me. It will be interesting to see how they make this into a movie. Maybe for once the movie might be better than the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"well written but boring and long, long, long","review":"Way too much time invested reading a book that just drags on and on. Some of the characters on their own were interesting, but then we were done with them and on to a new cast of characters. A couple of plots are O.K., but with this book they just keep coming. The thread that binds all of this together is also mighty thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved it....at first","review":"I was very excited to get Cloud Atlas for my Kindle. Dived right in and loved the first third of the book. Extraordinary writing; Mitchell was weaving a spellbinding tale. Then I hit \\"the wall\\" with the chapter on Sonmi. The book turned toward preachiness and difficult-to-follow language and structure. I saw where it was going so I slogged through the chapter hoping for better. The next chapter was worse, mega-preachy and really hard to follow. It was like Mitchell put down a challenge to readers to get through it, and while he was at it bludgeoned us with stuff that made me feel like I was sitting through a basic, and boring, philosophy class. I skimmed that chapter, then gave up. Made it about halfway through, but by that time I didn't care how it ended. Sorry Mr. Mitchell."},{"rating":"1","title":"Imposible de leer","review":"Este libro tiene un serio problema, en vez de la palabra \\"and\\" aparece el simbolo \\"&\\".

The story didnt flow even though all of the elements were there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in love with it.","review":"I knew going into this novel that the stories are told in a unique style, one falling into the next. Still I found the book a little hard to stay with, or to care much about the characters. I heard from people who saw it that the movie based on the novel was even more confusing it that is possible. Not for those who like light reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Read","review":"Bought this book during the movie release hype and expected a great story based on the actors in the film. maybe the movie will be better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"If you enjoyed 1Q84 by Murakami, read Cloud Atlas. It combines just enough magic realism, sci-fi, and classic literature to meet the avid reader's needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing I've read in a while","review":"I was giddy the entire way through the book. I enjoyed every part equally and immensely. All I can say is to read it, and it's most like you won't regret it if you enjoy at least anything more complicated than your average Joe. One of my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing syntax","review":"Some parts of the book were impossible to understand what the characters were saying since the writer felt compelled to use historical phrasing and vernacular. The disconnected nature of the narrative was hard to follow and the vague connections over time (comet like birthmark) were vague and meaningless. I guess the message was that the more things change (time shifts) the more they stay the same (strong overpower the weak). Another book that I couldn't wait to finish and move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope the movie is better","review":"Now that's unusual for me. I always like the book better thanthe movie. Sure hope it lives up to the hype"},{"rating":"2","title":"great concept but lacked dirextion","review":"it just needed a llittle push to be a great book. it gave a hint of something more but never elaborated. ending kind of just trailed off as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sprawling masterwork","review":"Mitchell is the current wunderkind of British fiction and in Cloud Atlas it is not hard to see why. An interlocking blend of six terrific studies of hope in the face of opression is presented in an ingenious and entertaining manner. Some of the links may be less convincing than others, and certainly the storytelling is a tad uneven. And yet one cannot but admire and enjoy the sheer boldness and talent that unfolds on the page. Not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas gasp","review":"Really a fantastic read, although hard to follow some of the language use, I really enjoyed how the author tied everything together!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Will Read This Again, and Again!!!","review":"I really enjoyed this book! It's definitely one of a kind. I really got to know and love the characters. And, what a story! It pulls you in! This is one of the VERY few books that I know I will re-read many times. All that I can say is: OUTSTANDING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, Great movie","review":"I really enjoyed this book but went to the movie before finishing it. Big mistake, I was 60% finished and should have waited to see how the stories ended. This rarely happens to me but in this case I liked the movie better than the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not done reading","review":"Sometimes Amazon reviews are tedious, particularly when I'm not decided on the product. I wasn't in to the first chapter/section of atlas cloud, but I kept reading, and am now on character number three. I'm hooked! The stories intertwine with each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"It is thought-provoking, funny at times, intriguing at times, and often sad. I think the disjointed structure is challenging but maybe causes the reader to pay greater attention.Not for an \\"inexperienced\\" fiction reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"tricky puzzle","review":"An enjoyable read, Michell is adept at various sorts of voices. The sections don't seem to have much to do with one another until the end, where all is tied together. Only four stars because at the end I didn't feel a great deal of emotional connection with the characters, but it kept me reading until the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Connected lives","review":"At first I wondered how the different lives were connected. I did have to go back to previous lives to remember the people and places when they were revisited. Once I had done that they all fell into place. I found it fascinating the way the language each life had, especially the speech of the future lives after the present. A very interesting story about a subject I find very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the pre/post-apocalytic novel. If you are looking for a story with an unusual plot dynamic, that is written-well, and has distinct, fleshed-out characters, this is the novel to read. Moreover, it's one that really makes a reader think. I have the paperback form of the novel and also the audio version. The audio was awesome and had different actors reading the various stories - I would encourage you to get the audio format for the full effect of the characterizations, various dialogues and dialects."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesomely different","review":"I loved the way he wrote (1 story 2 story 3 story 4 story 5 story 6 story and so on 6 5 4 3 2 1). It felt like I was reading the best set of short stories I have ever read (take that Joyce, Doyle, and Chekhov)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An interesting read","review":"This was another book club book and for once I actually finished the book. My favorite parts were the futuristic sections and especially future Hawaii after \`The Fall'. I liked that best because I do a fair amount of reading into the ancient past and what is interesting to me is the cyclical fall of civilization and empires from cycles of plague and cosmic catastrophe that have happened in the past. It is bound to happen again whether in our lifetimes or not. So to read the authors take on how the future unfolded through the eyes and story of an inhabitant of Hawaii was most entertaining. I didn't catch the exact meaning the author was trying to portray with life connections and if I hadn't read about the book because of the movie then I would have been even more in the dark on this aspect. Overall, not bad for fiction and I'll eventually get around to reading another book by the author. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"A friend highly recommended the movie, so I thought to read the book first. Had a very hard time getting through the first thrid of the book, but then it seemed to move a bit faster. Some parts were actually easy to understand and follow, and enjoyable. But other parts unbelievable and difficult to understand. When the book sections skipped time, or between stories, it was difficult to follow the reasoning as to how each time era was interconnected. I kept reading to the end, and it did abruptly end without completing the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book if you want to be bored.","review":"I have never read a book that contained so many characters I just don't care about.

It was turgid, uninteresting with murky, boring characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still don't know what it's about!","review":"One of the most discombobulated books I've read - can't imagine this being made into a movie. Sci fi fans may like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed enjoyed this book...","review":"but should I say \\"these\\" books?Built as multiple narratives one in another, each section is quite enjoyable on its own. Although the links between each part sometimes feels a bit stretched and the flow of reading halted by the insertion of yet another narrative (hence my rating of 4 stars vs 5), the total does become more than the parts and makes for excellent reading. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I had high expectations of Cloud Atlas based upon reviews. I was so bored I deleted it from my Kindle after a few pages.

The premise of it says so much about human nature, time, and relationships. I think the story itself is brilliant, but its written with such a lofty, complicated style that the author has essentially shot himself in the foot. The story gets lost in the language and writing style...so much that I had to stop reading it in the last 100 pages. I just couldn't muck through it anymore.I am a speed reader, an academic reader, and a reader for pleasure. I read often and much, so this is surprising to me. I was sorely dissapointed...which doesn't happen often!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What.","review":"I can't get into this at all. It was a big waste of my kindle money.

I purchased this book after first reading the author's latest novel The Thousand Autumns of Jacob DeZoet"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book of 2012.","review":"This book hits all of my favorite subjects in novels. It keeps you hanging, wanting to stay up late to find out what happens in the next story. To discuss the structure of the book which most people wonder about I have to say is unique and makes me like it even more. You have history, religion and the answer to the question we all wonder.....why are we here? No, not really but according to the novel it does answer that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining, layered well","review":"In much the same spirit that Mario Vargas Lhosa writes, Cloud Atlas was crafted with multiple stories that were and weren't connected to one another. Stories each offered their own personalities to the overall effect, but were still within their own context when placed next to one another. This is a very entertaining book, though some may find that the arrangment of several stories to be confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"It made me think","review":"I guess the best measure of a writer's work is what you think of a book after you finish reading it. Like some others, I was expecting a \\"big\\" ending that would tie all the stories together, but that big ending never came. Instead, over the days after finishing the book, I found myself spending a great deal of time thinking about what the author was trying to say. I can't say this was a great book (although I can say it was very well written), but I can say that it made me think -- and that alone makes the book worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book written to be profound - but completely unnessary","review":"This book was a terrible read. Expect to be frustrated and annoyed as your reach each semi decent story until you get the the last one. The last story was so miserably written I couldn't read it. I scrolled though the story hoping it would get easier to read but it didn't. The only redeeming part of the book was the story with Sonmi-451. I agree with some reviewers that stringing together 7 poor stories in this fashion doesn't change ok stories into a book that's profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant, thought-provoking","review":"What an incredibly dense read. I loved the book, but as my sister said so aptly, \\"It was hard work.\\" I didn't mind flitting from story to story, as some have mentioned in their reviews. I thought the characters were interesting and well-developed, even though there were few of them that I really liked. Most of them I detested, which left me wondering about the point of the book. Fate, reincarnation, the soul, and the morality of actions were all strong themes but didn't really point to any kind of answer. It's possible that Mitchell was just saying, \\"Life is a wild ride. Who we are is sculpted by what we do, but we are also sculpted by fate. The universe is a mystery and who knows where this is all headed.\\" If you are the kind of person who prefers for a story to be tied up in a neat bow by the time you get to the end, I would not recommend this book. But if you're OK with no real end and just like contemplating the universe, this may be a good choice for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't miss this one!","review":"An astonishing book, extraordinary writing and what an innovative plot! I could not put this down. And don't see the move before you read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle, haunting","review":"Don't avoid the book if you didn't like the movie. Excellent stories, characters, and plots. Loved the nesting of the stories and the subtle links amongthe narrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"an intellectual puzzle, beautifully written","review":"This book is lots of fun to read. David Mitchell has created a puzzling series of stories, that gradually fit together beautifully. You have to have faith and not give up when one story seems to stop in the middle of things and you are thrust into another world he has created. His language and style suggest other great authors, but he puts his own twist to each one. This is not a book where you are swept into another world and stay there for a while. This one challenges you and makes you think. A very good, and important work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can not get pass the first two chapters","review":"Hard to read. I like to enjoy reading...not analyze each sentence to decipher what is being said. I know that when you readanything written in a particular historical setting, that can be expected...but this was just not enjoyable for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"I found this book to be non-sensical on the whole. The moving between stories was an interesting structure and that is not what put me off. The writing was just hard to follow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant and weird","review":"The first chapter tested me thoroughly. I'm glad I stuck with it, because the subsequent reading was intense and brilliant. I did have to go back and read a chapter over for clarity and continuity but overall I enjoyed the adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really like David Mitchell","review":"David Mitchell is a really smart writer. Cloud Atlas is his third novel (I believe) and extremely well written. I judge books based on writing, characters, and then plot; this book exceeding my expectations in all three sections. Because he offers such a variety - all sections cannot honestly please everyone. For me, the first and third plots didn't hit it; but I read them in amazement, not believing that the same man could drastically morph his style so seemlessly. And where two didn't quite please me, the other four AMAZED me. I really like this author.I recommend this book if you want to think. It's not a mystery, not that kind of thinking; but most of it is not \\"easy reading\\"...it's smart reading. The first section is really difficult - you don't need to understand everything. It probably will not draw you in, but get past the first 10 pages and you'll be used to this section's style. And after that, you'll be sucked into it all. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious Literary Twaddle","review":"I was shocked when the first section of the book ended in mid-sentance. I thought at first it was a misprint until I discovered the second half at the end of the book. It's a ridiculous literary stunt to \\"nest\\" the stories inside each other. I continued to read the first story by skipping to the back. Very irritating and it does not add to the book. The actual writing is fine, nothing spectacular. This would have been tolerable as a collection of separate short stories presented in a linear fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Multiple short stories = Single terrible novel","review":"I am ever so glad I did not pay a dime for this monotonous tome. I do feel sorry for the trees that were butchered to make this terrible book. The stories are boring and ponderous. The interconnects consist of a single sentence or two. It is hard to pick a story that was the most pointless but I think it was the guy stuck in the old folks home. How did that relate the collapse of mankind in the far future? The answer, it did not, it was filler like 99% of the book. If anyone reading the book want to save many hours of their life just skip to the last page. You will learn that unchecked greed and lust for power is bad and can lead to bad things. With all the 5-star reviews of this book you would think the author is the first one to espouse this idea and it was a great revelation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cloudy book","review":"I hope the movie is better than the book. It was just not what I expected, read 1/3 and gave up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This book was painful to read. The first page was ok but after that it was downright awful. Almost gave up midway through chapter one, again in chapter 2, again in chapter 5 but forced my way through. Not a good book, how it got 4 stars overall is beyond me. I think people give it high ratings because they think it makes them sound smart."},{"rating":"1","title":"one of the worst","review":"I read on average 2 books a week but this book was so bad it took me 3 weeks to force myself through it. a big waste of money!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique reading experience.","review":"The structure of the novel -- a kind of bell curve from the past to the future to the past -- was fascinating, and the varying dialects from 19th century Dickensian formality to an imagined future dystopian patois made each story a richer tale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspired a whole different idea aboout reincarnation","review":"The belief in reincarnation has always fascinated me. This book was an interesting spin on this belief. I would have given it a five but found the chapters that were written in a different \\"tongue\\", were a little difficult to get through. Overall, the journey of the \\"Soul\\" was very interesting. Can't wait to see the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Just Wow!","review":"a truely unusual and fufilling journey that unfolds with all the craftsmanship of an Esher print...be prepared to work, but oh, is it so worth it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgot I already read it","review":"I read Cloud Atlas several years ago. It made so little an impression on me that I forgot I already read it and almost ordered it again today. Another look at the book cover and an unsettling feeling about the name of one of the characters (\\"Frobisher\\") finally brought my memory back. I just remember being incredibly bored by the stories and wondering what was the point of it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like","review":"I don't like novels in this form. It has multiple parts, with the \\"clever\\" author jumping from story to story. I found several sections boring. It was disjointed and confusing. If you like being bored, confused, and wasting your time, this novel is for you. Did I mention that I hated it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"crazy","review":"Sorry, I didn't like the book at all. I found it disjointed and hard to follow any plot line. I don't know what all of the hype was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saw the movie","review":"Hubby dragged me to the movies to see this. I hope the book is better than the movie. Hubby appreciated the gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Hottest Writers Today!","review":"A series of unconnected stories that come together at the end, Cloud Atlas is a book you will either love or hate. Find out why Mitchell is one of the hottest authors today."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Winning Awesome Tale","review":"It's unbelievable that Cloud Atlas was written by one writer. David Mitchell's development of characters and settings is remarkable. I just ordered another of his books for a trip I'm taking. Classifying as historic fiction? Science fiction? Political fiction? It's all of them and more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort","review":"The reviews that laud the authors writing ability are fair, but I'm left feeling this technical effort was a stunt with no purpose. The story covers a large span of time using language authentic to those times. Making the writing authentic to the times, comes only at the cost of making the reading difficult. Nothing additional is conveyed in the writing styles. Just the opposite, it leaves the reader to interpret the language.The linkages between the various characters through time, added nothing to the total story. Many of the individual stories where slow and of uninteresting consequence. At the end the story only conveys a trivial message, not made more interesting by the laborious stories.Overall, I feel misled by the other reviews. I believe they are fairly praising the authors skill, but over praising the result. Just because something is difficult to make, does not make it good.This is one of the few books, that may benefit from being edited down to a 2 hour screen play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book","review":"Would give 0 stars if I could. The stories dont intertwine so dont be fooled by that intrigue. its 6 short stories that are not interesting and dont get better. its not a thinker or a mystery, and wont leave you wondering \\"whoa what happened\\" like a deep literary masterpiece. instead you will be googling \\"seriously, what happened, i somehow missed it\\" but you didnt miss it, the book sucked, thats it. also, i painstakingly wrote this review on my kindle which is time consuming and tedious so please disregard punctuation."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLOUD ATLAS","review":"This is one of the most tedious boring over rated novels that I \\"tried\\" to read..

I admit I only read half the book. It was a real struggle to get that far. I guess I just didn't get it. I read for pleasure maybe this book has literary merit, but if I could I would ask for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time","review":"To read this book was a struggle. There were a couple of chapters that were interesting and seemed to make sense, but the majority seemed more like the ravings of a deranged mind.I wish I could get my money back on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hugely disappointing","review":"This book on my all-time 5 WORST book list.

Oh well, win some, lose some."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I rarely abandon a book mid read but I could not force myself to get through this one. Absolutely uncompelling and pointless garbage. I can't understand why this book was turned into a movie either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas","review":"This was a collection of interesting characters set in different time periods. I found the speech patterns initially rather uncomfortable but once I realized the purpose it made sense. Although this was not one of my favorite books it was never the less quite informative. I will next see the movie and decide which was more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Complex","review":"The synopsis and reviews cover the unique structure of the novel, but what I found fascinating and compelling was the interwoven concepts of human ethics and slavery that brought all the stories together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disconnected","review":"This book was disappointing to me. It was actually well-written, but terribly disjointed and hard to follow. Some sections are more engaging than others. It took me a long time to get through this book. It didn't keep my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Ten","review":"I would rate this novel in the top ten books I have ever read. I really loved the character development, the interesting connections, and the nesting of six stories in one. I hope the movie does it justice!"},{"rating":"1","title":"literary self indulgence","review":"I was constantly aware of the author's self conscious writing while struggling to wade through this book. I kept on hoping it would redeem itself in the second half. While it improved, I feel the various stories do not add up to a whole greater than a sum of its parts - in fact the disjointed nature of this book kept me from caring about or getting involved with the stories or characters. I fail to see why Mitchell structured the book as he did except to try to impress the reader with his literary craft. The stories set in the future took constant work to understand the showy, manipulated language. I was never able to move beyond the artifice of it. Perhaps it requires a British male sense of humor and class consciousness to find the characters of Cavendish and Frobisher more funny than obnoxious, pompous and annoying. There are better ways to reveal the consequences of human greed and cruelty than this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expertly rendered","review":"This book starts off strange. if you've never read any of David Mitchell's work, you probably stand a chance of putting it down and forgetting about it. However, once you make it through to the third chapter the throughline becomes evident and you'll find yourself barreling through the book desperate to see what happens next.It's truly one of the best books I've ever read, right up there with Murakami's \\"Wind-up Bird\\" and Robbins' \\"Skinny Legs and All.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Textual and narrative kaleidescope","review":"This novel has an accordion-like structure where story plots, characters and traces of their traits interweave and resonate off each other, reminding me of something I was told about how karma cycles back and forth in past and future lives - a concept that Mitchell also alludes to. The author is deft with his character portrayals and also the descriptions of the eras and circumstances they lived in. Each story/chapter ends in a coda that leaps to the next, and yet which somehow ties everything together when you reach the end. An intriguing structure that may be challenging to keep track of if you have more than one book going at any one time (like I do) but which is nonetheless interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"riveting book","review":"kept me hanging through every page and storygreat story telling mechanics, though i wont ruin the ending for you :)highly recommenced"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different in a unique and good way","review":"The novel was like no other I have ever read. It's stories were well developed but punctuated by three other stories before resuming where they had left off in the wake of the others. Thru all of this the stories characters and incidents were connected via hints of re-incarnation and time.I thoroughly enjoyed the book. It was somewhat difficult \\"getting\\" into but once you were hooked, it was full steam ahead. Overall, a smart book that left you thinking and imagining the many twists of fate that each of us go thru in our lives' journeys. A solid 4 thumbs up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cloud Atlas","review":"I enjoyed reading Cloud Atlas immensely, I hated to put it down sometimes. Each life had lessons and each story had twists and turns I did not expect.Over all it was a great read. I recently saw the movie too. It was good but there were some changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Imagine","review":"The theme is that everything we do creates a ripple effect which will affect other lives in the future. Or is it reincarnation? Or perhaps how we can master our worst instincts to become better beings? I'm still not sure. That said, I'd be willing to go on this ride again and again to see if I can come to a clearer understanding.The book is beautifully written, and an interesting exercise in stylistics when we're looking at language in the future - never mind a post-apocalyptic \\"culture\\" scrabbling for survival under what appears to be insurmountable odds.Cloud Atlas is not the easiest read, but I found it impossible to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, complex read that I almost put down...","review":"It took me a while to get into this book. I started off reading a few pages before bed and just couldn't get into it. After months of just sitting there, I brought it on a vacation and could not put it down --- I was at the third story by this time. I had to go back and reread the first two stories as I continued. Not the easiest book...definitely not for everyone. If you are a hard core reader and like a bit of a challenge get this book. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm sure plenty of people found this interesting. For me, it just didn't connect in any way.

He was probably busy aping styles and planting surprises and thought he was writing a novel. There is far more value in something like the Twilight series or even that ghastly heap The Casual Vacancy. We should create a new genre for this kind of text, viz. written from dry ideas and trying to be a novel. I don't know, \\"serious fiction\\"? There is no danger of this being confused with Jane Eyre, or The Great Expectations, or The Trial, or Brothers Karamazov. Who ever wrote a great book with a \\"serious\\" intention?

I initially lost interest in the first story, it wasn't very captivating but I trudged through it looking for the meat and potatoes. Unfortunately I never got to it. About 2 weeks later and I'm only on the second part of the Luisa Ray story. In other words I've lost my interest and am only finishing to say that I finished. This book shows tons of promise but it just doesn't deliver. Plus the breaking of each story into 2 stories is just annoying. Not to mention the VERY weak link between each story seems to be thrown in as an afterthought, not as if it were actually part of the story. I wanted to be generous and give this book 3 stars but in good conscience I just can't do that. If possible I recommend just borrowing this book rather than buy it.

The idea is, in theory, brilliant, but despite my plodding, persisting and struggling through the pages, I found nothing to suggest it was anything other than - dare I say, amateur. It didn't hang together, it made absolutely no sense and the plots were just fantastical and unrealistic. I won't deny Mitchell's undeniable talent as a critically acclaimed and esteemed author, it's just this book......One of the reviews I read on this site was from someone who had read it and wanted to claim their life back for the hours wasted on reading it.

(Full disclosure, I'm a huge fan of post-apocalyptic fiction). So when the movie came out, I ordered a copy on my Kindle (as a side-note, I would recommend reading a physical copy of the book, because each story has it's own typeface, which I found added to the evolution of the book).I really struggled with the first chapter, both times I nearly gave up. But the story really picks up after that. I think what I loved most about this book was that it was so many types of genre in one, but all with a connecting thread. Part confusing, part thrilling, part thought-provoking, I definitely recommend Clout Atlas."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Kindle bookmarks are numerous","review":"How on earth can they make this into a movie? This is a rare book I'll read twice and refer back to my bookmarks often. This book doesn't read itself for you... you have to pay attention to understand what's happening. That's what I call a good read, and one that will stay with you for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good theme","review":"You may categorize this as a post-modern novel, ( Gaddis, Pynchon, Barth, Nabakov, DFW, etc.) according to whatever critical theory definition you have of that \\"genre\\", but for me, it's most concrete virtue was it's good theme- our greed and quest for power will ultimately destroy us. Our civilization and culture are poisoned. What lies beyond this dystopia? I think the book answered those questions for me, and will for you also.The writing was very polished and professional. The author searched for and found a unique and different way to express his metaphors-bravo!A very quick read, even though you had to switch gears and find the authors voice because of his style pyrotechnics several times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to read","review":"Not very interestingThis is not the type of book I enjoy and would not recommend it to anyone to read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nope","review":"I know this book is a hit, and I'm sure I'm the only one giving it a 1 star, but I just couldn't get into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn.","review":"This book may be good for high school or college course with a study guide involved.

And now I've let too much time pass and I can't get my money back. I'm only 8% into the book and can't even imagine continuing and I read all of the Game of Thrones books! And I hated them, too, but at least there was a story.Oh well - I fell for the Tom Hanks/Halle Berry movie trailer - at least I won't waste my money on the movie. Sheesh - Penny Marshall and Cloud Atlas at the same time.

The part about the nuclear power plant reminded me of Harold Robbins. The publishers journey to the nursing home bored me. The last straw was the prospect of wading through a chapter of dialect. That's where I quit. Literary novel? I don' think so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gave up after six hours","review":"This book is a collection of novellas. The first, about a man on a ship going to California during the 1849 gold rush, is OK. The second is an enjoyable imitation of Oscar Wilde. The third is an execrable crime thriller that piles cliche on cliche, without a shred of plausible story or an interesting character. The writing wouldn't have passed a freshman English class. I suffered through that hoping the fourth novella would be better. Again a completely implausible, cliche-ridden fantasy, this time about a publisher making a fortune from a badly written novel. I gave up one-third of the way through this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter waste of time","review":"Wow, where to begin...rather than rehash the 1 star comments, I will concisely say that this book is not worth the read. I kept waiting for some type of meaningful connection between the short stories, but the only connection is that each story references a previous story. The difficult diction from the first story and sixth story was frustrating, and the pointless nature of most of the stories made me wish I could have my life back that I wasted reading this book. Other than the Somni story, this book was terrible. If you want to read a great book, try Cutting For Stone, Life of Pi, Dragon Girl series, or Game of Thrones (except for book 5, which is pointless and does almost nothing to advance the plot - much like Cloud Atlas)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baffling","review":"Six boring stories loosely connected by a flimsy thread does not a good book make.

How anyone can love this disjointed, poorly written collection of short stories I really don't understand. I can honestly say I have never read a worse book. I thought at first perhaps it would get better. It didn't. I find the stories boring, poorly written-- just a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there a point?","review":"I started reading this book because it was categorized under \\"dystopian\\" in some reading list and the reviews seemed to be generous. But I can't, for the life of me, figure out what the point to the book is. The stories seen to barely intermingle, and the stories themselves seem to have vague plots to them that I can't get interested in. I trudged my way through the first story, hoping it would get better as some have said, and forced my way through the second, hoping still. I got through the third story, but just barely and skipped the fourth because I'm so sick of the change in writing styles. The 6th story was interesting enough once I figured out the new language but as I'm reading the center story, I'm trying to figure out why I'm even bothering. As far as I can tell, this book is just short stories that kind of intermingle. I don't even really like short stories that much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witty, soulless, meaningless","review":"Like many postmodern novels, it's about form over content. There is nothing here you haven't read in Pynchon.

This book, however, showed great promise so I kept reading. I anxiously awaited a clever ending that would tie all the pieces together and give me the \\"WOW\\" I get at the end of a good book.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and unusual","review":"Rather than re-cap what others have said, I will add a new insight. This book required full attention while reading. I found the post-Fall center section the most difficult because of the dialect. I had to slow down and mentally \\"speak\\" the words and sentences in my mind. The dialect is very lyrical and there was unique reading pleasure associated with this part of the book. This is a book that is NOT a quick read but the rewards are worth the time invested."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great way to tickle your brain","review":"Cloud Atlas is like a maze of stories through which you travel alone, following a main character and a main theme. Part of the thrill is to discover how these stories are connected, and it's highly rewarding. As a bonus, this book has several separate books inside it, and it's worth rereading the chapters in different orders.A word of caution: try to avoid reviews who delve too much into the plot. One of the biggest pleasures in Cloud Atlas is the sense of disorientation you feel as you travel through its many twists and turns. In the end, you'll feel the story coming full circle and will have a lot of things to digest and talk about.A magnificent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Absolutely one of the most amazing novels written in my life time.... Look out Thomas Pynchon..... The story, (story's) themes all intertwining, and the glorious use of language. The first chapter is rough, and thank you Kindle for the built in dictionary...

Truly exceptional..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb virtuoso storytelling","review":"David Mitchells book is a literary Palindrome, the first half a mirror image of the second half. That, in and of itself is not intersting, but it is the means of weaving six stories spread across about 400 years of past, present and future that make the book so enthralling. Strong visual language and riveting action sequences are dovetailed with ruminations on mortality, reincarnation, deja-vu, morality,creation and redemption. There is no bigger palatte. Although some of the juxtapositions between stories are a bit sudden and contrived, the overall effect is shimmering, thought provoking and haunting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is easily one of the best books I have ever read. A seriously engaging and through-provoking work.

As a result of the movie I am actually enjoying the book a lot more, whereas a movie after reading a book is generally somewhat limited in depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you liked the movie this is necessary","review":"OK so if you thought the book couldn't quite achieve what the movie did, you're right on some fronts. The switching of characters is something you simply can't achieve with words. However, the idea that \\"our lives are not our own\\" (something similar to Years of Rice and Salt) comes through much more clearly and sentimentally in the text. Highly recommended.

I came to the book after the movie, to get more of the story, to understand how the book structure works compared to the movie structure. I got a great read, where karma-twists are clearer, informed by additional events not in the movie, yet the same message, nutshelled in the book's last line, in Adam Ewings' words, \\"Yet what is any ocean but a multitude of drops?\\"I can't wait to read Mitchell's other books!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Impressive","review":"Even though the book spans centuries, I was caught by each story, each character. My favorite was the 1970's story for some reason. I think it was the quick nature of the chapters and the impact of what could go wrong if something blew up. I recommend reading the book before watching the movie, not because the book is better... just so you can let the book uncompress as you watch the movie. There is so much discussed in the book that only a mini-series could cover it all. If you have the book in mind, the characters will pop to life instantly for you. At least they did for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to get into","review":"I guess I'm just not much of a reader any more, because I still haven't gotten past chapter three.

It's an okay book but I was so sure that there was going to be a more detailed connection between the different stories that I was extremely disappointed. Besides the comet tattoo, there is very little connection and evolution of the characters. Maybe that wasn't the author's intent but from this reader's perspective, it could have been a much deeper and more meaningful book.

It could be that his isn't a voice and style that works for everyone, but if given a chance there's a big payoff waiting. I started with The Thousand Autumns of Jacob de Zoet, a more traditionally structured book, and a great story. The Cloud Atlas is not a conventional format, but what a joy to read. When I reached the last page I was almost sorry to have it end and wished the book were twice as long. Have read all others available on Kindle, Number 9 Dream was the best of those. But the first two were just outstanding and highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenally inventive, slightly depressing","review":"The failure of some reviewers to comprehend the depth and nuances of this book is, frankly, an indication of its brilliance. One reader threw in the towel after the first few pages, disgusted by the use of the ampersand in place of \\"and\\" - completely oblivious to the fact that, like the vocabulary shifts throughout, it was a historical writing device - and another huffed that the book seemed \\"disconnected\\" (well, it is in a way, but in a way it's completely connected, and that's the very point). This is no piece of fluff, so if you don't want to put your thinking cap on, steer clear.Others have recapped the genius of the plot and writing style, so I won't tread into that territory. I'll just say that, while this is the most astonishingly original read I've had in a long time, its creativity left me enriched but its message left me a bit hollow.

I can't imagine the printed book is in this kind of shape, so I assume there is a big problem with the conversion process to ebook format. There are literally thousands of missing periods, word spaces, and commas, several per \\"page,\\" along with many spurious line breaks. I've been reading past these, but when sentences are run together I often have to slow down to sort the missing punctuation. THIS IS A DEFECTIVE PRODUCT.

The basic problem of this book is that its central characters are uninteresting and the plot (such as it is) unabsorbing. The \\"short stories within a book\\" at its core are an interesting idea but somehow never quite work properly. At some points it threatens to really take off, with some good secondary characters and scenes (particularly between academics and lawyers)and there are some memorable flashes of humour, but overall it is very unsatisying"},{"rating":"1","title":"6.99 Worth of Disappointing Novel","review":"Coe's first and least novel. Pants to be honest. Some humour, particularly at the expense of the novel as an art form, and readable as always, but it is all very insubstantial and lazy. Can't abide laziness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Came fast, new packaging, everything I wanted. I use to have one of these and it fell apart and lost the light bulb.

Not only does it help you clarify your issue by forcing it into the form of a YES/NO question, it suggests a viewpoint from which it could/should be examined. The wordings on the page you randomly and instinctively choose do neither clearly nor directly indicate THE answer, however, suggests you a way to look at/deal with your issue. With this in mind, you will go back to yourself to ponder untill what is said makes sense within you. Highly reliable in that it concludes that the answer lies in you, nowhere else but within yourself. You will go back to this book again and again, every time you wish to confront your deeper thoughts and hidden intuitions. Recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Reasons to Buy This Book","review":"(in no particular order)1. the design is awesome - makes it look like ancient book2. fabulous conversation piece for any get-together3. uses all the different kinds of divination4. ten times better than a magic eight-ball5. the price is great for a hard coverAll you have to do is ask a question, and randomly flip it open!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oraclemania","review":"I highly recommend this book for anyone - whether one believes in divination or even if one just wants to have fun reading the answers to their life questions. Ms. Routis Savas is definitely a talented writer and is knowledgeable about both Bibliomancy and human nature overall. She perfected how to magically hook the reader into wanting to continue over and over asking life's questions (whether it's regarding this life or one's next life). She also is a very creative / imaginative writer with intuition into the inner self. Once the reader starts, he/she can't put the book down. I wish my friends and I had this in high school. We would have spent many evenings asking \\"The Oracle Book\\" question after question. It's lots of fun and informative. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very cute book","review":"If you've ever indulged in stichomancy -- the art of divination by randomly opening a book -- you'll get a big kick out of this one. Specifically designed for that purpose, The Oracle Book consists of almost five hundred pages of brief oracular messages accompanied by charming illustrations. The physical book itself is stylishly made to resemble an ancient tome, and the whole effect is, well, cute. This would make a great gift item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raw and Real","review":"A knock-out performance by California's own Tesla!A terrific raw, fresh 80's sound comes alive on this one and if you like it hard and rockin then your gonna love this one.Keith's killer vocals and Hannon's crisp guitar make it a total winner.Keith's vocal performance on \\"We're No good Together\\" is a blusey knock-out, turn it up real loud for this one!!! And you can catch the original studio version of \\"Before My Eyes\\" here and catch the acoustic version later on 5 Man Acoustical Jam, both great, both different.You'll love it, it's really a great first effort and sounds like no other Tesla since..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A band slightly better than their own debut album","review":"Back in 1986, this album was a big deal. In a sea of poofy-hair heavy metal bands (and bands pretending to worship the devil), Tesla came out of nowhere with a debut album of straightforward hard rock songs. Sounding like a Midwestern Def Leppard, they had a couple ballads, three or four songs about rocking all night, and even a political song.Listening to it now, it's a little cheesy but too sincere to dislike. They know how to write a song and they can play, but they didn't have a gimmick that would embarass them later. The only real drawback to the album is the song \\"Little Suzi.\\" It's so good, you can't avoid noticing how mediocre the rest of the album is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard rock/metal without all the nonsense.","review":"Along with the Cult, this band helped propel hard rock back into it's power zone, after countless heavy bands had melted away into pop ballad, gutless relics. If you grew ill listening to Van Halen trying to imitate a keyboard guru, then this little gem would have provided instant resucitation indeed. The guitars are razor sharp, tearing into simple,yet overwhelmingly macho chord sequences. If you're an aspiring guitarist, you can learn the artistry of power rock/metal by listening to this CD. It's just that simple. This was THE guitar rock album of the late \`80's, and well worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tesla -one of the greatest bands of all time","review":"This cd is a keeper, I'v always wonderd who that band was in my dad's cd rack and thank God that I borrowed it. I would say the highlights on this cd are Modern Day Cowboy and Rock Me To The Top even thought I'm a fan of just about the whole cd. Get this cd and get it quick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tesla are AMAZING and this albums proves it!!","review":"Mechanical Resonance is absolutely fantastic and it deserves so much more credit that it is getting. Actually Tesla deserves so much more credit altogether, but they are terrific in my eyes and songs like EZ Come EZ Go, Cumin' Atcha Live, Modern Day Comboy, 2 Late for Love, Changes, and Gettin' Better are awesome. I'm glad Tesla are back and I hope one day they come out with that one album that will make them superstars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Their best","review":"They should have stopped after making this album.

It takes some context to set me up for genuine laughter or tears, though, usually in the form of solid stage work or a well-known story. Happily, this CD doesn't seem to need either, creating an experience that's almost as immersive and moving as being in the theater itself.Christiane Noll has developed such wonderfully matched, dynamic vocal and emotional ranges that each song is a story in itself. Happy or sad, she's so present in the songs I can't help but think that's how the people who wrote them meant them to be sung.Bruce Kimmel's wonderful choice of songs really does tell a story over the course of the collection, and his and Todd Ellison's arrangements showcase the Broadway style I love to get wrapped up in.Grab a glass of wine, turn it up, and close your eyes -- you're in for a treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"She could do so much better!","review":"I didn't even sample this one, I bought it immediately. \\"ANYTHING from her would be great\\" is what I thought. I was very disappointed. She could do so much better. I adore her from Jekyll & Hyde and will buy any CD she comes out with, but she is high quality material. This CD didn't do her justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the Person I Heard in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\", is it?","review":"I had the pleasure of hearing Christiane Noll's voice in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\". It brought me to tears with its beauty and passion in the role of Emma Carew. I listened to the CD and swear I'll never listen again! Her voice is annoying and I can't even recognize it from the beautiful performance she gave on Broadway. I wonder if she's just trying to sound like all of these different characters or something. At any rate, DON'T BUY THIS CD! It's not worth it, unless you really want to hear impressions of the characters in the various shows she performs selections from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noll has great voice. But this album failed to move me.","review":"One way I evaluate a CD is by the degree to which I am motivated to give it repeated listenings. While I was impressed by Christiane Noll's voice -- she can hit those high notes without screeching-- there was something missing in this CD. I just couldn't get involved with the songs. I have no desire to listen to it again. Therefore the low number of stars. If Miss Noll puts out another CD I will check it out. I like her voice. But this particular one didn't hit the mark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barry Manilow of the Broadway set","review":"If you happen to like the Michelle Nicastro school of singing then i think you'll like this album, but if you dont, better stay far, far away. Christiane Noll's voice has a striking similarity to Michelle Nicastro's, crystal clear, good phrasing, but somehow lacking in texture and emotion. The arrangements are pop, way too pop for my taste. The concept of stringing along songs from musicals to tell a story was better realized in Mandy Patinkin's \\"Experiment\\" album. The orchestrations in the Patinkin album is more varied and moody, the effect more introspective and ultimately more affecting. A similar album with similar emotional effect would be Stage 2: The Human Heart. The album does have its merits though, however little. The better cuts in the CD are \\"Who are you now?\\" and \\"A Quiet Thing\\". I think if the arrangements were more sparse and acoustic this could have been a better album."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unhappy Love Story","review":"Why would someone with a voice as sweet and pure as Christiane Noll choose for her debut solo album to showcase the least flattering elements of her usually delightful vocal skill on a collection of songs that for the most part are completely unremarkable? Those familiar with Ms. Noll's enchanting performance in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" know this budding star for her soaring soprano. Rather than accentuating that gift, Ms. Noll resorts to employing a harsh nasal belt that is overly-penetrating, and, in general, annoying. The selection of songs isn't much better. Many of them are from lesser known shows like \\"Pipe Dream\\" or shows that should be lesser known like \\"The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\\" Not one of the tracks ever catches fire, and the passion and excitement that filled her performance in \\"Jekyll and Hyde\\" is nowhere to be heard on this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one of the best broadway solo CD's!","review":"When I bought the CD, I anticipated to hear the same sweet voice from J&H. Not only did I get to hear her wonderful voice, she presents a well-rounded performance. She demonstrates the versatility of her voice as well as her convincing interpretation of the material. She really takes you through every emotion of a love relationship. My favorite cut is the duet with herself, \\"You're Just In Love\\". This is a MUST BUY for Broadway lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it!","review":"This is the CD that I listen to again and again while driving. I love Christiane Noll's voice and the beat of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"I saw her perform this LIVE!","review":"Thanks to a great friend with a great internship, I got to see Christiane perform this entire album at a small concert space in 1999. As you can hear, she is a wonderful singer. My personal favorites are \\"Unexpected Song\\" and \\"Now When the Rain Falls.\\" A must have album for Broadway lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Ice Limit\\"..the motion picture.","review":"\\"The Ice Limit\\" reads much like a movie script..and a solid one at that. I enjoyed the story and the characters..especially Lloyd, Glinn and Britton. One major flaw could be that near the end during the chase scene chapters, Preston and Child fail to include a chapter that includes the foiling of Vallenar's plot from his perspective..this was strange since the chase scene included perspectives from both ships. Aside from this, I found \\"the Ice Limit\\" very exciting and fun to read. Deserves a possible consideration for a film adaptation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not worth the price.","review":"This bowl is made of gold, sorry, platinum. Oh no! The quality of this SS bowl is very high. Why giving it one star? There is no virtual difference between this bowl and quality SS bowls sold for less than 20% its price. ...I am picky when it comes to bowls. I use them a lot and drop them from time to time. Save your money and do not support such companies selling their products at ridiculous prices. Do not believe their products are better than others. They are very good but do not worth the price. Shop around and your will see other products even better than All-Clad products at less than 25% their price.

This compilation is great for reggae enthusiasts and people who want to add some great reggae riddimz to their collection.

The trellis has nice little stickers of trailing roses that you put on the side and the birdbath has two little cute lovebirds that you attach to the rim. The chairs and table set snap together easily and are so cute.I just put this toy set together a few days ago and I didn't know what to rate it so I rated it 3 stars although I should rate it as \\"pending\\" since you never know with 2 little kids!

They also have interesting articles about health issues and foods to improve your health. Whether you're trying to lose weight, eat healthy or just add some variety to your menus you can find assistance in this magazine.

Very different from the pretty fruit & veggie covers. I was planning on cancelling.However, I've grown to like the magazine. Despite the typical focus/obsession on animal-derived proteins, they've got really wonderful articles.One article they need to write is a review on The China Study.

I like to have confidence when trying new recipes that the food will be pretty good.

And, nothing is better to prepare it in than this All-Clad Stockpot.It seems that a stockpot is one kitchen item that never wears out, so I'd been making do with what we had. But, when I was fortunate enough to be gifted with this stockpot from All-Clad I couldn't believe the difference!It has a thick conductive base that spreads the heat evenly, not just where the burner might hit it. And, it has solid stainless steel walls that keep the heat in. The lid fits snugly, and it simmers away for hours emitting the most delicious aromas.The brushed exterior gives it a great look, and it is made to conform to All-Clad's estimable high standards. Soup's on!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits my needs to a Tee! Buy It!","review":"I got this pot to replace an old 5 quart teflon lined aluminum pot of similar shape but with plastic handles, which kept it from the oven without extraordinary measures. The old pot simply did not heat up very quickly or evenly and it's dark interior made it more difficult to see what was going on with braises or pasta cooking.So, I was often lugging out my 8 quart Le Creuset dutch oven when the smaller lighter pot would be the perfect size, but for the plastic handles.I have used it a few times since receiving it, and it meets every expectation, even outperforming a similarly sized 5 quart Calphalon pan which was my old favorite when I bunked with a gas range.This is an incredibly uselfu size and shape, and worth the cost if you cook a lot.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Typical All-Clad Pot","review":"Well built, pot.

They highlighted the mug's water tight seal and its ability to maintain a consistent temperature. I can vouch for both and really am impressed. (The review also stated that you can buy new tops if one breaks which is a nice bonus.)I found out later that the silver version of this is dishwasher safe while the colored ones are not.

What a great purchase! Coffee stays hot for about 2 hours with a minimal drop in temperature. It's even better for cold drinks. Keeps them cold for easily 4 or more hours. I've put ice in the mug to help keep a drink cold and, after and 8-hour work day, there were still sizable cubes left in the mug and the little bit of beverage left was still ice cold as well. I definitely recommend this mug!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best travel mugs","review":"These travel mugs are the best I have used. They do not leak and keep my ice water cold for a entire work day. The only caution I have is that if you put milk, juice, or add creamer to your drink I would be sure to at least rinse the top out when you get back home. The mechanism under the cap is difficult to hand clean so if you leave it to long it may add some little friends to your drink : ) That being said, I have used it with water for a week or more at a time without washing it and had no difficulty. I have also used a their water bottle with the Autoseal mechanism for my tea with honey added and have not had an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've used","review":"Previous tumblers have leaked and not kept things warm. This is wonderful. Also bought one for my daughter who uses it every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not great","review":"Overall, it is a good coffee mug. 16oz. is a fair amount of coffee and the no drip lid works well. You do have to be pretty careful on your first few sips as the hot coffee kind of will flow out quickly with the trigger seal until you get the hang of mechanism. My only real complaint is that it really doesn't keep coffee hot as long as I thought it would. It is good for about 3 hours and then it will be warm - still drinkable but not as enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coffee tastes bad","review":"First the good. It's a well-made product. It really does seal well. I've never had any problems with it leaking. You can throw it in a bag, leave it on it's side for hours - it just doesn't leak. It insulates well too. Coffee stays hot for hours. One-handed operation is easy, convenient, and works well.But I don't use it anymore because it makes my coffee taste horrible. Hand washing doesn't seem to help, although running it through the dishwasher does work better. So maybe it's my fault for not cleaning it thoroughly enough after each use. I just can't give it more than a few stars because my coffee always tastes horrible when I use this mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money and buy a better cup.","review":"Bought 2 of these mugs at about 6 months ago.. didnt really have any expectations just seemed like a good price for a full sealing mug. After a couple weeks the design of the lid seemed very hard to clean.. to much going on in there with spots that cannot be reached to clean. Keeps my drink fairly warm but i have non sealed mugs that work just as well or better. The final straw for this mug was when the plastic in the lid started shedding small pieces of thin plastic off into my drinks. It is not an isolated incident as the same thing happened to both mugs, it is nearly impossible to get all the plastic flakes out of the lid as it is a complete design flaw. It is unsanitary and will leave you dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mug - make sure to keep it clean","review":"Love this travel mug. I'm particular and like a the raised drink hole the Contigo has (like you get with disposable cups) rather than the recessed ones that it seems most travel mugs have. This one is well insulated and the mechanism for drinking is easy to get used to. Make sure to keep the top clean - there are lots of nooks and crannies that crud can get in to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, no-spill mug","review":"This mug is fantastic! It really does keep your coffee hot, or a cold beverage cold, for hours. I searched for months, and tried many different \\"no-spill\\" travel mugs, but this is the only one that works.For the reviewers that had a hard time with using the mug, I would guess that they either purchased a faulty mug (in which case, they should return it), or they're not using it properly. Here's a couple of tips - never fill it past the grooves for the cap, and press the button WHILE TWISTING on the cap to release the air pressure. And, of course, make sure the cap is on all the way - it should be a very snug fit. If you bought a colored one, no silver should show between the cap and the mug.I recommend this mug to everyone I know that uses a travel mug. Superior product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Lid","review":"This mug keeps liquids hot or cold as advertised. However, the lid is very brittle and will break with the slightest pressure. Has anyone else had this problem?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Would love it except for the uncleanable lid","review":"MOLD. The contigo mug has been washed repeatedly in very hot soapy water, but can't get rid of the mold inside the lid. The water seems to have become trapped inside the lid so it doesn't dry properly, even though I do dry it opening down. If it wasn't for this, it would be a great mug, but the growth inside is absolutely disgusting and probably horrible for you. Regretfully, I'm throwing it out. Didn't buy it from amazon (Costco) but wanted to warn people of this downside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the insulated feature","review":"Like others have indicated - the top is difficult to clean.

They keep my tea pipping hot and my drinks cold for the whole day. The only thing that I do not like about them is that the lid is difficult to clean. I use to hand wash them, but they never came out clean no mater how hard I tried, so now I stick them in the top rack of the dish washer (and they come out pretty clean and fine though it says not to). But if you try hand washing them or stick them in the dishwasher the lids are atrocious to clean! Some residue sticks in the top lid and in the spout where the liquid comes out. The holes are too small to stick anything in there to clean it. I hope that they fix this problem since they are such amazing coffee mugs! Almost there contigo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel mug!","review":"Keeps drinks HOT for hours.

I no longer have to worry about it tipping over in the car. It keeps my coffee hot till the last drop. It is very easy to drink from and does not leave that lingering last few drops rolling around the lid you always have to slurp off! Cleans easily in the dishwasher but I usually just rinse it out and let it air dry. I have dropped it a couple of times while digging in my pockets for my keys and it has survived fine and never sprung a leak. I use it in the car and around the property with coffee and hot chocolate. I hate buying something that I love and needing a replacement down the line and then you can't find it anymore so I am purchasing another one as a back up to put in a safe place so I won't ever have that problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not easy to clean, but keeps a warm drink","review":"Other reviewers have said it, so I won't mince words.

Also, the design is nice looking and very simple to operate.Not so good: The mechanism that opens the flow is a large button on the side. If you put it into a bag where it can bump into other elements I would not advise to buy it as it will leak and get your stuff wet. Otherwise it works fine, for example, if you use it in you car's cup holder or standing in your home/office.Bad: One of the two began leaking a month ago, so I can no longer carry it around in my backpack's compartment. Also, I don't own a dishwasher, and cleaning the lid requires a bottle brush to prevent stuff from accumulating in the moving parts. It can get smelly if you don't clean it with detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top quality","review":"You will feel and touch the top qualityI love it. Easy to use , and safeBut the hot drinks will remain hot for 3 hours max"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good to sip from","review":"I purchased this travel mug to replace an OXO Good Grips LiquiSeal stainless steel travel mug. The main motivation was the lack of ability to clean out the sealing mechanism in the OXO (I had the original version). While the Contigo does have a simpler seal (which makes it easier to clean), it is absolutely terrible for actually drinking out of! Because there is no ledge for the hot beverage to sit, you cannot sip out of this thing. You're just playing chicken with your scalding beverage of choice.So to sum up, yes this keeps beverages hot and it seals well, but it will destroy your mouth if you like to have your drinks at \\"normal\\" coffee drinking temps (180 F). I'll be going back to OXO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great insulator- horrible mouthpiece","review":"On first use, I could not manage to keep the hot coffee from burning my lip. Since there is not bezel or edge on the spout, the hot liquid goes right from the inside of the cup to your mouth. Then after the first use, I could not get rid of the detergent taste remaining from the washing. So now, I take my coffee to work and take the lid off when I get there and drink my coffee right from the main container. Kind of defeats the purpose of having a \\"go cup\\" since I can't utlize for this purpose. Does keep your beverage hot, though. Will be looking to another travel mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so leak proof...","review":"So when I received this tumbler I was in love. It didn't leak, the color was great and it was easy to clean. Well I've had it less than a month and it's leaking - from the bottom! What a disappointment. For almost $20 a pop you would think that any kind of leaking wouldn't be a problem. It feel really well constructed so I couldn't understand where the water was coming from. Then I flip it over and see where the bottom looks stamped together or something. Think I'll be returning this.

So I starve through my class without sippin on tea. In conclusion: great insulator. My burnt lip isn't too happy about how well this is designed. It's also carelessly thrown into my book bag and it hasn't leaked a drop onto my papers and laptop, unlike ALL my other thermal cups. Once also made tea for my boyfriend in this tumbler. I made tea for myself in a tumbler from a different company. Both teas were brewed from the same kettle. We both went into class at the same time and we see each other after our 2 hour class.

However, all three tumblers have a terrible taste and cause the contents (tea, coffee,) to be completely undrinkable. At first, we each thought it was us or something was wrong with the beverage...but then we started sharing experiences and realizing that we all had stopped using them for the same reason...the just awful flavor that leaches into whatever beverage we put in.

Because of the thick double-walled design, it looks bigger than its volume, and I sometimes get charged for 20oz coffee.- If there is too much liquid in the cup, the lid squeezes out the liquid when you screw it on.- Cafe baristas very seldom know how high to refill it, leading to the \\"too much liquid in cup\\" problem above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contigo Stainless Steel Vacuum Tumbler","review":"This is a replacement for a different style Contigo tumbler and this one is not nearly as good as the previous one.

If you choose a color, the color will be damaged in the dishwasher and the cup will look VERY bad, but function perfectly. The plain stainless comes out of the dishwasher beautifully, even though the maker says to hand wash. I have noticed that the lid picks up soap flavors way too easily, so I mostly just rinse them with boiling water from my kettle to clean.

There is NO way I'll ever let this type of Contigo travel mug be used by my family members again! (This also explains why a number of reviewers complained about a smell developing in the lid.)I see that users who have noted this problem have been subject to comments by a Contigo customer service rep who blames the user for not following \\"Recommended Care and Use\\" procedures!

You CAN'T clean it. I scraped it with a toothpick, let it soak overnight...nothing. It smelled terrible and was just always on my mind when I'd drink from it--that there was coffee residue sitting there that was unreachable. I will say this thing never spilled a drop though--best seal ever. But read the other one star ratings...I'm not alone here.

It is helpful to \\"burp\\" the cup a few minuets after putting hot beverages in to let the steam out so it won't explode on your face later when you are trying to take sip.

I thought it was how I was drinking it, but if I press the button and tip the cup slightly, I can reproduce the same problem.I really had high hopes for this mug, but I will be returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad packaging!","review":"So I don't know how the mug actually works so far, but I'm going to believe what most of the other reviewers have said. I am super annoyed at the horrible packaging of this mug! The box was barely wide enough to \\"hold in\\" the mug (it was bulging when I got it) and then when I went to open it (by using a scissors to carefully (no, I didn't jam it in like a maniac) run down the length of the packaging tape in the front) it left a significant scratch down the side of the brand new mug, which is supposed to be a gift for someone else. Amazon packaging folks if you are reading this, please use a bigger box or actually have the bubble wrap wrap around the product. Thanks!Other than that, it looks very sleek and nice, and I'm sure it'll work just fine. Hopefully I got a \\"packaging dud\\" or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful travel mug","review":"I take this travel mug back and forth to work because I don't want to be without it. I have knocked it over many times at my desk and thankfully, it did its job and did not spill. My tea stays hot for hours, so I even use it at home rather than reheating my tea after it has gone cold in a regular mug. I have found that the best way to keep it clean is to put boiling water in the mug between fillings and shake it vigorously and release through the lid so that the top gets irrigated. Once in a while I also use Dip It for the inevitable stains from coffee/tea (not for lid)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"This cup is truly spill proof. Love that I can throw it in my carry bag and not have to worry about it. Also very easy to push the button and drink from. But, while I LOVE the red color it scratches very easily leaving a silver mark behind. I've only had the cup a short time and it is already all marked up. So I would recommend you go for the silver in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover is impossible to clean","review":"It is not recommended that this product is put in the dishwasher. That might help to clean the cover. But it is just not possible to get to most areas of this cover to clean them. You get a build-up on the lip. Underneath? Who knows what it looks like as there is no way to get in there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to throw out your Nalgenes and Camelbaks!","review":"This is a fantastic bottle! Awesome that it is spill-proof and keeps cold liquids cold for a LONG time. My only complaint is that if you use it for coffee, it retains the flavor until you actually wash it (whereas I rather rinse it and fill it with water). Absolutely love it though and would buy it again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fragile","review":"This mug was just fine for a short period of time. Soon the lid was cracked and the mug leaked. I would have liked to have contacted the company to see if it is possible to buy a lid only, or if they have some kind of a replacement policy. But Amazon allows me only the option of paying to return the mug or writing a review. So I'm writing. If you are very careful and never drop your travel mug this mug may be for you. But I need a more robust product design for a life on the go.All in all I was disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contigo 16-Ounce Double Wall Stainless Steel Vacuum Insulated Tumbler","review":"Awesome mug.....seen a lot negative review talking about the smell from the lid.

At home or in the car this isnt a problem, but in a quiet office it's really not great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mug, a little.. too.. good","review":"This might be an odd reason to rate this product 4 out of 5 stars, but I've actually found that it is SO good at keeping my coffee warm, that I hardly get to drink any coffee from it.Imagine this: you make your fresh coffee in the morning right before leaving for the office, and pour the near boiling liquid into your awesome vacuum insulated travel mug. To your disappointment, the coffee stays insanely hot for the entire duration of your 20 minute commute, and the few adventures sips you take ultimately result in burned lips (this thing is pretty hard to sip from, btw).I have plenty of mugs at my office, I don't need a $25 travel mug for desk use. I'm going to return this and get a mug that doesn't keep my coffee hot.To be clear, the lack of one star is ultimately because the product's design does not afford the ability to take cautious sips."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cup","review":"I have a sleeping disorder and have broken many coffe cups and stained even more carpet and furniture by falling asleep with my coffee in hand. I tried many other cups and while the breakage was easily stopped the spills kept comming. With this cup I am so happy to say I have not spilled a drop. I fall asleep with it in hand all the time and no matter the position it ends up in it has yet to leak. If there were a negative side to this cup it would be the nasty slime worm it can develop in the lid. I was not aware of the problem and used my cup for long periods without doing any more then just a quick rinse. I dink ALOT of coffe and almost always have a cup going. I found out the hard way that you MUST clean this cup after every use. If you dont it can develop what my wife and I have named the Slime Worm. Basically a nasty slimmy worm shaped build up that dislodges itself once its big and nasty enough to make you vomit. Seriously though the cup rocks just keep it clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contigo mugs are terrific","review":"These mugs are even better than the ones I had purchased earlier from Costco.

I have careied this mug in my purse, on back seat of my car,, tumped it over, dropped it off table. it has never leaked. come in a great selection of colors. I have bought obne for all my sisters to take to work. They love them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, but not indestructable","review":"I will say this for these Contigo mugs - they will not spill until you break the lid (or accidentally push the button). I have never accidentally pushed the button, but the lids do not stand up to repeated (30+) impacts on concrete or asphalt. I have a tendency to carry these things by the lid and they frequently slip out of my hand. Of course, they're not designed for impact resistance, so I can't say that I fault Contigo for this.Pretty good mug if you're not a spaz or carrying them over concrete."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel mug ever!!","review":"I got this mug a couple years ago it does everything as advertised.

I don't exaggerate, I have even bought these as gifts for my sister, aunt, and mother! And all were extremely satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and bad","review":"Ive had this cup for a year now and the button is going out, squeaks when I open and close it so not good for meetings or quiet places. And it is very hard to clean in the lid, its gotten this foul odor of mold or something. And it is not dishwasher safe, it will chip the color off. But it does amazingly keep your coffee extremely hot for a few good hours or your ice water iced while sitting in the hot sun for the same amount of time, so kind of a win/lose situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spill proof","review":"I'm giving these out for Christmas presents. This is spill-proof but also very comfortable to use. The flow is consistent and not \\"gurgly\\" as other cups are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great theory, Needs work on how liquid pours out.","review":"While I love many things about this mug, the most frustrating thing is how the hot liquid pours into your mouth. In my opinion it should have a lip like most mugs do. I use this mug to hold coffee directly from my one-cup coffee maker that brews coffee at the most ideal temperature. However the cup instructions state not to use with liquid above 90 degrees. I can see why. When I drink the coffee through this type of design it burns. It never did when I used ALL my other cups. I can't wait til they redesign the lip on the cup. Then I think it will be perfect. Until then, I cannot even use the cup, it's too uncomfortable.Pros:Great heat retentionGreat Stainless steel contour design and durabilityGreat Splillproof mechanismCons:Poor mouth designI would not buy a colored one, you cannot wash it in the dishwasher"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Travel Mug","review":"This is by far my favorite travel mug, so much so that I have owned multiple. It keeps my coffee hot for a very long time and I can make coffee at home, go to a meeting, and come back to my desk to my piping-hot beverage. It is also clear that the design was really thought-out. For example, unlike most travel mugs, the top on the Contigo has a small indentation so that you're not hitting your nose while drinking. This sounds silly, but it's quite pleasant.Some recommendations: have not really had an issue with cleaning my lid so much. I do recommend cleaning the lid daily though and putting soap and water directly in the crevices in the top. Additionally, I highly recommend purchasing the silver/stainless-steel version (without color) since paint on stainless-steel does tend to scratch off eventually. Also, I have noticed that the Contigo AUTOSEAL line has been improved over time, so if any parts aren't working anymore etc, I recommend buying a new one. They're worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"no hot enough","review":"The water doesnt stay hot for the time they offer (4 hours), less of 2 hours the coffe is cold. but is ok."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than my old one!","review":"This tumbler is a better version of what I had before.

There are two things my father does well, drink coffee and not pay attention. I have bought scores of mugs for myself but he eventually takes them and ruins them. From breaking them, putting them in the dishwasher, leaving them in his car for months so a new civilization can form in them, it runs the gamut. This mug has done really well, as it has not yet leaked which is a sign that he has broken it. It also keeps his coffee warm well into lunch time.I would recommend this, if it was around ten or fifteen dollars it would be perfect!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel mug","review":"This is an excellent mug.

It doesn't leak, is small enough to fit into standard cup holders in cars and is easy to drink from. The button that releases the vacuum means that the drink stays insulated when you aren't drinking.

It doesn't hold hot coffee hot enough, long enough, which was my whole point in buying it. If you're filling it and planning to drink it within an hour, its fine. I wanted it to retain heat for 3-5 hours. Perhaps my expectations were too high. I was thinking I was buying a portable coffee \\"mini-thermos\\" that I could take to the office and have hot coffee for half a day. Didn't quite work out that way.

I tried using q-tips, toothpicks, rolled up papertowels, etc. Nothing can get at it. I even bought a bottle brush to try to salvage the mug but that was too big as well. I will not drink from a moldy, nasty cup so I have to throw them out. What a waste! Check out the pics Amazon has posted to show you what you'll find inside the top....disgusting!

I was SUPREMELY disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it but......","review":"I received this as a gift and thought it was the best travel coffee mug ever made. Until, that is, I gave it a \\"thorough\\" cleaning. Although I'd clean the mug and lid after each use with liquid detergent, I discovered that the lid required a much more extensive cleaning. I was so grossed out to discover how much black gunk collects inside the lid. Cleaning the lid is really difficult/time consuming. I became concerned about the health ramifications. I added dilluted bleach to the lid and let it sit overnight. However, the bleach smell lingered and I found myself not wanting to drink from it. The bleach odor eventually aired out. I currently use baking soda with white vinegar. The two ingredients foam when combined. I still used a long bristled brush to ensure that everything is removed."},{"rating":"1","title":"insulates well until you exit the 1 year warranty","review":"Bought 2, one for my wife and one for myself in june 2011. within about a year I noticed a lack of insulating abilities.

It seems that it may just be the condensation (I was using it primarily for water) that accumulates between the two layers leaking from the joint on the bottom.

Okay so I returned it and explained the problem clearly. I wanted the item with the red button as shown on the website. I received the exact same mug blue button. Picky?

We both thought it was great in the beginning. Then after a few uses, it became REALLY gross! The flavor of the coffee became really strange. And I noticed that no matter how hard I tried to clean it, I couldn't get the gunk out of the crevices. Then I soaked it and became really grossed out. All of this black mold started coming out of it. After I did that, I thought maybe that was it and since I cleaned it so well, no more funny taste and no more gunk. I was wrong! As frugal of a person that I am, I ended up throwing this away. I'm going to go to the store and buy a cheapo brand.

It looks nice, fits the hand easily, doesn't spill...however, when you put in a hot liquid it tastes strongly of plastic, this taste does not go away over time. With the concerns about chemicals used to make the plastic I wonder what I was drinking. It cannot be cleaned adequately; you can use hot water and shake the lid until your arm falls off and it still isn't clean. Coffee acumulates in the crevices and turns into a scum which will wash out in disgusting pieces but I never feel it is clean. You cannot reach into the lid's spaces, I've even tried q-tips. I bought 2 and dislike them so much I can't even feel comfortable putting them in a yard sale, much less giving them away to some one I like. This is not a product that lives up to its positive reviews and I would not recommend it to anyone just because it doesn't spill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinking Travel Mug","review":"Bought two of these from Costco.

I was so happy to find these. However, after a very short time I realized how hard these lids are to clean. I bought a seperate little brush for the opening and a larger one for the inside. I even occasionally soaked them in dissolved dishwasher detergent (which will clean a thermos or carafe like nobody's business). Yet I still had these things that kept ending up in my coffe. So one day we sacrificed one lid......beyond gross. It is impossible to reach the areas where the crap accumulated. I drink my coffee with cream and if you drink black coffee or tea, you might not have this problem.

Well, except after I dropped it down a 10 foot ladder onto a metal deck... twice. It still worked and kept my drinks hot/cold, but not so much on the leak proof.

A mug retailing for $20 could have those two plastic pieces be metal.Aside from that one small complaint this has been a great mug. My coffee and tea stays nice and warm for as long as it takes me to drink, but that is only about two and a half hours max. The brushed finish is nice and the mug is comfortable to hold with my mid-sized hands. I have thrown this mug in my backpack and haven't seen a single leak. Did the same in my car and still haven't seen a leak. A great, unadvertised feature of this mug is you no longer have to stir your coffee! I have gotten a few looks at my local coffee shop when after I put in my cream and sugar I give my mug a good shake. Definately has been good for Contigo because I have sold a few of these mugs for them on that feature combined with the no spill technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"upside down","review":"Very nice product, does not leak a drop.

Anyway, I used to nuke my coffee near to boiling in my old thermos sippy cup so it would be warm 20 minutes later when I sipped it on the train. With the Contigo I actually wait a bit before I pour the coffee in so it won't burn my lips when it comes out. I drop this mug in my backback, sideways or upside-down does not matter: no leaking. Need some wrist strength to twist the top on tight. Good product. Buying it in red helps keep the coffee extra hot; I presume buy blue for mai-tais.Not as heat-retaining as some dedicated thermoses but that is partly a function of volume vs. area of container wall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Too Bad","review":"Not a Bad Mug. I love that it is 100% Spill proof. It also keeps your drink cold for a very long time. My only complaint is that It doesn't keep my drink hot for 4 hours like it claims to. I even tried pouring boiling hot water into the cup for about 20 to 30 minutes to get it conditioned to retain the heat and then dumping the hot water and pouring the hot coffee in right away. Even then, I still only get about 1 to 1 and a half hours before it gets warm. In fact it doesn't do much better than my cheap stainless mug from Walmart, although that one is not spill proof. But other than, I do like the mug. And my wife absolutely loves hers for keeping her drinks cold all day long, often while still having some ice left in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps drinks cold for hours!","review":"The Contigo mug is my new favorite water bottle! It gave it a four star review because I have left ice water in it over night to find ice still remaining in the morning. It is also great because it does not leak. I ended up buying one for my husband too because he kept taking mine. I did take away one star because they do break easily. I dropped one on my kitchen floor and the top portion broke instantly. Maybe it was just my luck but I will be more careful in the future because they are a bit pricey to replace. Happy shopping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works!","review":"I have struggled to find a good travel mug that really does not leak, and this thing really doesn't leak! Keeps coffee hot for a reasonable amount of time, similar to my other mugs, however its seal works wonders for my car upholstery ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sippy Cup for Grownups!","review":"I like this cup. Wish it had a slightly larger opening. Can't get my coffee out fast enough!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still doesn't leak after falling off roof of car and being run over.","review":"My kindergardener left the container on top of my SUV. It fell off and got run over by another car. There is a dent on the bottom where it hit and scrapes where the other car ran over it but it still works! No leaking and keeps the milk cold all day at school. She loves the color and the easy of use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insulation, finicky drinker","review":"Provides really great thermal insulating properties, really nice color finish, nice shape providing good grip while holding the mug. The button to push that opens the \\"spout\\" is on the lid, this means to drink you need hold the button down, which means you need to hold the mug at the top which to me is a little awkward. I have the Nissan Stainless mug and like that mug better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contigo","review":"Contigo mugs are the greatest. They really are spill proof. I've dropped one outside of my pick up truck onto pavement and it didn't break or spill. I have really put the spill proof to test on this and it really is truely spill proof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mug, One Very Small Problem","review":"This mug is awesome, first off. It does exactly as advertised, and really is totally spill-proof. You could shake this thing upside-down like a salt shaker and you still wouldn't spill a drop. In addition, it keeps whatever you put in it at the original temperature for hours, literally. In these ways, the mug performs perfectly.The only flaw is in the lid. While there is no issue sealing, the exposed mechanism makes it tough to really clean all the nooks and crannies. A long-handled brush will take care of that though, more or less. The big problem is odor retention. I drink my coffee extremely strong, and as a result of that, the lid usually ends up absorbing coffee stank. It takes a lot of effort to get rid of, usually a strong soaking in a bleach-water mix.If the lid didn't hold odors like it does, which might just be the tradeoff when you get a great mug like this so cheaply, it would definitely get the five-star super-awesome rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bottle for hot or cold...just too small","review":"I found out about this tumbler in the Maxim magazine after they did a review on it. It's a great tumbler that keeps the temperature EXTREMELY well...more than any other tumbler I've used...however 16oz is small. I drink a lot of water. I'm constantly refilling, which almost defeats the purpose of having a long temperature hold. Either way, I highly recommend it unless you drink a ton of water like me, in which case go with something bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't leak from the spout but still leaks from the lid","review":"I was very impressed by the ratings for this mug overall, but both times I used the mug I had hot tea all over my dress shirt on the road to work. The problem is not the spout but the rubber lip that's supposed to tighten around the space between the lid and the rest of the cup. It's not tight enough.Would not recommend this product. Maybe it was once manufactured in a way that deserved all the good reviews. From what I can tell, it's not manufactured that way anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product","review":"This product is so useful I now own six of them. We use them for water as it stays cold for many hours. Other than the squeaking sound the mechanism makes when you squeeze it to open the lip on it, it is a perfect product. We both love the fact that it can't spill, and it works great for night time storing pills on top of it. It feels great in the hand. We both find ourselves drinking more water b/c it is always cold (even over night). Cleaning it is somewhat hard as you can't get directly to the mechanism which is why I'm not sure it would be good with a sticky liquid although it should come clean by soaking it. I just hold it under the tap and back flush it from both sides. I love them and, of course, they are great in the car as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Contigo mug","review":"I love the autoseal button. It really does work just like in the video.

The Extreme Mug is double-wall stainless steel and vacuum-insulated, ensuring that your hot coffee or other beverages stay that way for hours. It keeps coffee hot for ~4 hours. I go on road trips for 2 hours, the coffee is still hot. Cold items for 12 hours. Ice water at bedtime still is loaded with ice in the morning. Will hold up to 16 oz.and fits most standard car cupholders. AUTOSEAL means that not a drop leaks out the top. You open the seal with your thumb, drink, and when you let go it automatically seals.

I use creamer in my coffee and that seems to adhere to the underside of the mechanism and is impossible to clean with any brushes. I tried soaking submerged in boiling water and thought I was getting it clean. It wasn't until I soaked it in a bowl of bleach that I really found out what was still there. It explained the smell and the funky taste I got. They need to work on this design because it really is a great mug otherwise. Just for safety sake, I suggest you will have to use the bleach from time to time and then rinse copiously."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm satisfied.","review":"At first, I don't believe this ad movie.But I'm wrong after I got delivery.It's not fake.

The mechanism used to open and close the tumbler works well enough. However, the lid retains odors no matter how thoroughly you clean it.

I drink tea so I didn't pay attention to the comments about making sure you rinsed it (coffee with cream). I especially like that I don't have to worry about accidental spills...my other cup did.

The contents will not spill once the cap is screwed on properly.Effectively cleaning the sealing mechanism housed in the cap is an ordeal. Soapy water leaves a residue that is hard to rinse away...even with a vinegar solution. The question is: As you sip you expensive brew, do you prefer the lingering taste of soap or vinegar?Worse still, forcing hot water through either end will not remove coffee oils. Overtime, the coffee oils form a film which get lodged in the cap that come out the spout. It is a unpleasant surprise.Packaging did not offer cleaning suggestions for the cap."},{"rating":"2","title":"great mug","review":"Husband uses it on the couch because there is no risk of spills. keeps drinks hot and cold well.

This travel mug and the Autoseal Technology is fantastic....you never have to worry. AND it keeps your beverages piping hot for hours. I once left my coffee in the car at work....I was too lazy to back out to the parking garage and get it. I got in my car 9 hours later to drive home....coffee was actually still warm and enjoyable. Was it piping hot? No, but still had warmth to it beyond what any other product would produce.If your lid gets all gunky or does eventually start to leak due to wear....just simply order a replacement lid.

Contigo stainless insulated tumblers. I spent years looking for a travel mug for my coffee that would not leak and finally found these. They do not leak. As a side benefit, they don't even leak when they are knocked over. That has saved my laptop and my husband's keyboard. It also means I can put the mug in a large pocket while hiking; that requires a somewhat large pocket, but it fits into pockets in my travel vest and also in most of my coats. Also, it keeps my coffee hot longer than any other travel mug I've used. Coffee is still warm after a couple of hours.After reading other reviews, I do take care to rinse the mugs well in hot water after use. I sometimes soak the inside of the mugs in diluted bleach, to refresh the stainless interior. We only use them for coffee, either black or with sugar, no cream. After a year of daily use, they remain clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome product, shipped fast","review":"I got it within 48 hrs of purchasing on the regular free shipping option. Used it this morning and loved it. I ride my bike to college every day, and now I can bring my coffee or hot chocolate to class with me rather than chugging it before I leave home. Not only did it not spill at all, it is thick enough to fit snugly in my bike's water bottle holder, so it did not rattle and bounce like other coffee mugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid plastic threads strip easily","review":"These steel mugs actually kept the coffee warm for four hours, but after six months of use, both of the mugs (which we had bought at Costco in 2011) had stripped the plastic threads off of the cap.

The problem, as reflected in other reviews is that it is very difficult to clean. I know others have had success cleaning their mugs, but I genuinely have not been able to get mine completely clean after a few months of use. It always still has the smell of dairy products (since I add milk to my coffee in the mornings), and the smell never leaves! I've tried brushes and everything but the smell remains, and some gunk seems like its stuck on there forever.

Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very nice...not perfect, but nice","review":"A lot of reviewers commented on the complicated mechanism in the lid getting fouled and funky. It is, indeed, a complex little mechanism and impossible to disassemble. I would not recommend this for sugary beverages or for someone who likes vanilla hazelnut lattes. For black coffee or tea, however, there's absolutely no problem rinsing the thing out. It is absolutely spillproof, holds heat fairly well, and does what it's supposed to. The little puddle of liquid left on top of the flapper valve can be slightly annoying, but it's not a huge issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky","review":"I got this as a gift. Looks and feels great in the hand and keeps liquids both warm and cold so it is very functional in that regard. But if you want a leakproof tumbler, this is not it. I like to put sugar and cream in my coffee and then shake it just a little. Every time I shake it everything pours all over along the seam where the top screws on. Even if I let out a little pressure. The inside threads are an issue as well since the coffee shops just don't listen and if filled up you have to pour an inch out so the top will screw on. Poorly designed and leaky. I think there has to be a better product out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leak proof but difficult to clean","review":"This tumbler is great for keeping coffee warm and has never leaked. I am only giving it 4 stars because it is difficult to clean with hard to reach nooks where gunk can easily build up.

After that, your coffee starts to taste different and a funky smell begins to waft up from the lid when you take a sip. This lid is 1 piece and does NOT come apart like the Thermos Sipp 16oz model. Bacteria and mold begin to grow in the lid area rendering this mug useless and winding up in the garbage.

When I returned no later than 5 min later is was gone.I'm on my 2nd one now and I really like it. Have not had it spill once and insulates like crazy. Coffee poured at 7AM can be warm until noon. I'm a fan of the black one, but beware it is painted and will eventually chip if its dropped.My one complaint is that the relatively sophisticated cap is hard to clean and take on the taste of coffee. This is a common thing with any tumbler but you really notice if you go with tea when you normally go with coffee.If somebody steels this one, I'd but it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best travel cup ever!","review":"This mug is a great size, has a sleek and stylish look and performs like a champ! It keeps hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold nearly all day. If I forget my hot tea on the counter and return to it at 4pm after a full day of work, it's still somewhat warm. It's easy to use with one hand if you're driving or using the phone. And it WILL NOT LEAK!I have had 3 of these. Both previous ones bit the dust after being dropped onto a hard floor. The seal just didn't work the same way. I ordered a replacement for my latest one the same day it was dropped because I couldn't imagine not having one.It's a somewhat pricey cup, but it will last you many years and make you happy every time you use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mug but Be Careful","review":"I have had this mug a few months now. It's great. It keeps the coffee quite hot, it doesn't spill or leak, and it's a nice mug ergonomically.There is a warning though: sometimes when the air pressure builds up, the coffee will spray out the back hole when you push the button (and quite a bit). I make my coffee in my mug every day, through a cup filter, and then pour it into a mug, and this spewing has only happened when I am pouring (I rarely drink directly from the mug). But if this happened when I was drinking, it would spew in my face, and given the hot temperature of the coffee, this could be dangerous. My suggestion: make it a habit to always push the button when the coffee is away from your face, and then bring it to your mouth. Better safe than sorry. But overall, a fantastic mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"We usually love Contigo mugs, but this one leaked","review":"I had to return this. The seal was bad, and it leaked where the lid screwed onto the base. At least the Amazon return process was easy.

Lid a smidge hard to clean.","review":"This is a great mug!What I like about it: Awesome green color. Feels great up to your mouth. It dispenses the right amount of liquid - doesn't gush all of a sudden; but doesn't barely trickle out. Best thing is how perfectly spill proof it is. You can tip it upside down and shake the thing to death and not one little drip will come out. I'd trust the cup in my purse, it's so leak-proof!What I dislike: The lid is pretty tricky to clean. The instructions come with a page of instructions/tips for cleaning. Even suggests using a pipecleaner. That's a little involved for me. It does keep liquids hot, but I know some Thermos brand stuff keeps it hotter, for longer.The good far outweighs the bad in this cup!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT hold 16oz & you lose money!!","review":"If you fill this beauty to the brim, you might be able to fit 16 oz of coffee in it. But when you put the lid on, get ready for large spillage and, incidently, get your fingers out of the way. This container works with, at most, 14 oz of fluid in it. Take your trusty Pyrex measuring cup and see for yourself.Aside from the misleading claim that you can drink 16 oz out of it, the problem with this thing is when you fill it at Starbucks or Peets you pay them for 16 oz. Well, your only going to get 14 oz in your Contigo. That means you lose almost twenty five cents on each \\"Grande\\" coffee you buy at places like these.Be up front with your customers, Contigo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"They Work Great","review":"I bought 2 of these, one for me and 1 for my wife.

I make coffee at home in the morning so I can have at least one good cup o' joe a day.It's generally the better part of an hour before I actually crack the seal on said morning cup and when I do I find the coffee to still be too hot to drink (a very good thing!) and it's accompanied by a nice \\"woosh\\" indicating an excellent leak-proof seal has been maintained since filling!All in all money well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite for the car!","review":"Finally, a travel mug for my coffee I can trust not to leak! The cup holders in most cars are just not deep enough to keep things from tipping over when you make a turn, and this tumbler solves that problem completely (unfortunately, after years of carpet cleaning!) You can hold this one upside down and not lose a drop. And, at the end of the day, I can throw it in my brief bag and not worry about the last few drops leaking onto important papers. You do have to take care to clean the lid well as it does have a tight seal, but it's worth the extra effort. I love it, and am giving it many times over for Christmas!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A really good mug","review":"We got these mugs a year ago. We first got one for my husband. He wanted a non-plastic mug for his hot and cold beverages at work. This fit the bill and then some. He can not say enough good things about this cup. It has had a few accidents but nothing has broken or spilled. One thing if you have a hot beverage, push the button a few times to de-pressure the cup and give the cup a chance to cool down a bit. It might not look like it but it sure can keep the heat in. We drove 4 hours on a family trip. Started with a full cup of coffee, on hour three the coffee was still hot. Its a bummer you can put it in the dish washer but a few mins hand washing is not that big of deal. We have given these as presents and they are so greatful we did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seal is great, doesn't hold heat!","review":"I got these as a 2 pack and was super excited. They seal great, so if you are prone to spilling, these are great! The downside is that they do NOT hold the heat well. After about 2 hours my coffee is lukewarm and by 4 hours it is room temp. I pour it in the morning, get in my heated car, drive to work and work in an office, I am not in extreme tempratures at all.If you drink your cup in the first horur, maybe two, you will be fine with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost great, with a major taste problem","review":"I'm sad to have to leave a negative review of this product. I love the overall aesthetics and ergonomics of this product. It also does a fantastic job of keeping things hot for a long time. However, none of this matters when the liquid its storing comes out with a horrendous taste. No matter how many times or methods I try to use to clean the lid, everything I put into the mug comes out with an \\"off\\" rubbery/plastic taste. The lid also seems to trap smells, as even after repeated cleanings it smells like the last drink the cup contained. I've tried the various suggestions for cleaning found elsewhere in the reviews, but none of them have seemed to help. My advice is to avoid this mug. It costs too much to ruin your morning coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the better one","review":"After a couple of weeks of using this, I noticed an off smell. Got out my tiny bristle brush & cleaned the inside top really well. Actual chunks of grossness came out. Had to clean it with the brush each evening in order to use it. Ended up throwing it out. They now make a wonderful mug that has a hinged design so the inner workings open up for cleaning. Much more sanitary & it cleans beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard product","review":"Why did you choose this rating? ExperienceWhat did you like or dislike?

You can smell either petroleum or a bad plastic smell, AND taste it when drinking. It was bad enough that I finally looked at where these are made and discovered they are made in China. Something that didn't surprise me after I smelled the funky lid.Having said that, I have 5 other Contigo's (2 are the sports model) that I really like. This is the first time I've run across this funny smell so I'm just hoping that it's THIS particular color? (though it shares a lid with the red Contigo...same lid, and that one didn't have the funky smell)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"This travel mug is sleek and good looking. I love the colors it comes in. Initially I bought 2, one green to keep and one black as a gift with the intention of buying more as gifts. I found it fit wonderfully in the hand. Not as bulky as some. I am conditioned to filling a stainless steel appliance with hot water first and then pouring it out. This is to warm the container prior to filling it with hot liquids so that is precisely what I did. I don't know what this container is capable of as I found it leaked immediately upon the first tilt. It was sold to me as something that would stay hot and never leak. When it came it did come with a disclaimer that it wasn't guaranteed not to leak but too late as that was not what I saw prior to buying and back both went with no second chances. I have other travel mugs that may or may not leak, I didn't buy this one to add to my collection of maybe maybe nots."},{"rating":"1","title":"I like the color","review":"The color is cool but I don't like having to hold in the button every time I need a sip.

Lid impossible to clean.","review":"My girlfriend (now wife) and I walk less than a mile to work in the morning and she has been struggling to find a coffee mug that would not leak. I've bought a couple, she has bought a couple, and she has a few gifts - in the end, they all leak. Either at the hole you drink from or between the screw-on top and the mug itself.This is how I tested:-heat up 8oz of coffee-poured into new, clean mug-screwed on top securely-turned upside down-wait a few seconds and drip, drip...-turned upright, opened and closed the \\"drink hole\\" a few times-turned upside down-wait a few seconds and drip, drip...Bottom line, this mug leaks. I bought it because it was not supposed to leak.I would avoid this if you want to be leak free.Update: 2/2/2013. The lid is nearly impossible to get clean. Q-tips and soapy water gets the job partially done, but there are still areas that cannot be reached for cleaning. A bacteria magnet.

OK, it looks nice, fits well in your hand, mine doesn't leak...however, when you put hot liquid in it there is a strong taste of plastic. This does not go away. The lid cannot be cleaned adequately and coffee accumulates to eventually wash out as scum which is disgusting. It does not keep things hot which may be a plus as maybe it is releasing less toxins as the liquid cools. I cannot recommend this to anyone and can't even bring myself to put them in a yard sale so I guess they will go to the recycle barrel. What a waste of money and I would liek to know if the people who like them have taste buds that work.

And boy does it keep coffee hot for a long time!!! If you rinse it out after every time you use it and toss the lid in the dishwasher once a week it won't turn your coffee funky.

It's double-walled vacuum construction is the best out there and remains totally cool to the touch. There is some heat loss near the screw-on top. You will not get the hot 4 hours/cold 12 hours that is advertised, but you are not likely to find a more effective IM anywhere.Regarding the screw-on top and push-button \\"leak-proof\\" spout: in the four Contigo mugs I have, they work flawlessly. I can invert and shake the mug and not a drop spills. Some review opinions complain that the top has to be screwed on just so. Yes...it does. It's a screw-on top, not a space shuttle 0-ring.My only complaint is about the top. I don't like the way the sip-spout feels, but it is acceptable.

Other tumbler designs make you twist, flip, or unscrew which risks spillage until reclosed. This tumbler opens when you press the button on the side to drink, then automaticall closes when you release the button - VERY CONVENIENT one handed operation. I use it almost every day for coffee.

The outside is not very durable, because I accidentally knocked mine off an end table onto a carpeted floor and it somehow got dented.

Then rinse again with warm water, and let both parts air dry. I've never put the top or cup in the dishwasher. I have a red one and just ordered a pink one to replace it. The only reason I'm replacing it is because the paint has chipped off, and quite frankly ... it's ugly. But it still works!

It definitely doesn't keep hot drinks hot for 4 hours, I would say about 2, which is fine for me.

The cap is great because you can take sips with a push of a button but I like my coffee hot not just warm."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I read the reviews before ordering this during the lightning deals.I keep the lid rinsed and wash it like my other coffee cup covers, in a bowl with baking soda, vinegar and water. Rinse some more.It keeps my coffee very HOT which I like. In fact I do not put the cover on right away, to let it cool a bit. However it took some time getting use to how the coffee comes out when I am use to a lip/rim around all my other travel cups. Also when you put hot coffee in it and then the cover, besure to press the button to open the mouthpiece prior to bringing close to the face as it creates a vacuum and a little coffee will splash out. Enough to get on your glasses/face etc.Also I was surprised how TOP heavy this coffee mug/tumbler is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good insulation","review":"Keeps water icy cold all night with no spill worries...My kids only use it for ice water and love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid impossible to clean","review":"The lid on this coffee mug is impossible to clean. I've tried several ways to wash it by hand, but can't get all of the gunk out. Just now I took a sip, and thick black gunk came out the sip whole. Disgusting. I'm getting rid of it now."},{"rating":"2","title":"MUST HAVES","review":"If you don not have one of these Contigo Insulated Tumblers you MUST buy one. They keep your hot tea and coffee HOT for up to 3 hours. Spill and leak proof all in one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly spill-proof. Love this.","review":"I've used this mug every day for the past month and I can definitely say that it is truly spill-proof. I've become so comfortable with this quality that I don't even think twice before allowing it to turn upside-down in my purse. I love it.I don't find that it's difficult to clean at all, and I have not had ANY problems with the odd smells that some people describe, even though I do take lots of half & half in my coffee. I haven't even washed the lid in the dishwasher--I just rinse it out with the button depressed every time I'm done using it. Very easy to clean.Only one small complaint, but not enough of a complaint to warrant docking a star because of how much I truly love the spillproof-ness: The lid does seem to let some heat out, and is warm to the touch after I've filled it with hot coffee, so I know there's heat loss. I think my drink gets cold more quickly than it did in the Thermos brand tumbler I previously used."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is as good as it's described - - -","review":"I work at a computer, & I had just one to many times of spilling my coffee & having to clean-up that whole mess (thank goodness none of it got on the computer.) Anyway, I was looking for something that is spill-proof. I saw this, & it was on sale too, & I just love the color. I tested it out. Shook it upside down w/hot water in it as hard as I could... not a drop came out :-DI am very please w/my new mug. Just one caution, the hot beverage stays hot for a good long time, so be careful when taking a drink from it, I was surprised how hot it stayed, even an hour later, & well... yeah... burned my tongue, but, at least I can no longer spill it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!!!","review":"I got the blue and it is really eye catching! I commute to work via subway and whenever I take this out of my purse, sometimes even upside down cause its fallen while in there people stare because first of all it fits nicely (thanks to no mug handle), its really nice looking and not one drop of coffee spills out!I love this thing and it saves me time and money not having to stop for coffee everyday and I'm not tempted to ruin my diet by buying a donut. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"contigo tunbler","review":"I am very impressed with the construction. Keeps all liquid hot or cold and allows one to drink without spilling"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"I love thus mug! I was looking for something that I could put my hot drinks in (Starbucks) that would not only spill but keep my coffee hot. I work in the health field so sometimes it takes me a few hours to finish a cup of coffee due to the interruptions. Usually I have to throw away a full cup of paid coffee or get another or re-warm what I already have. This mug did its part. By the fourth hour I can honestly say my Carmel latte was still warm enough to sip on.!!!! I also love the fact that the mug is stylish and spill proof. I placed it in my work bag and nothing spilled out, of course after I made sure I correctly placed the top on right. One thing many people complain of is the fact that the smell of coffee is stained into the top. I haven't really noticed it unless I just deeply inhaled the top closely to my nose. But thus mug was meant for that so I don't mind it at all.I would defiantly recommend. Love it! Might buy some for my family!"},{"rating":"1","title":"4 stars for Amazon cust. service!","review":"I wanted to give a better rating to this product because of 2 things: first, the great Amazon support, and second, because of the first contigo I bought last year, a 6 star product. But as i count on customer reviews to make buying decisions myself, i had to be clear about my opinion. these seem to be pale versions of my initial contigo, they don't lock as properly and securely, and obviously they don't keep drinks warm. my first contigo would keep them almost burning after many hours, which amazed me and got me to order a few more for me and my friends. i can't explain how such a supremely efficient product was turned to a disappointing experience, except maybe for possible 'copies' of the real thing. Amazon was very supportive in dealing with this, but the product quality is really not what i expected from Contigo."},{"rating":"2","title":"my daily buddy","review":"this is definelty one of my best purchases, it keeps the coffee warm and is really spill free so basically all i need and very stylish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffee Mug Ever!","review":"I have been drinking coffee for well over 35 years. During that time I have gone through a lot of mugs. I have now had this mug for 3 Months and have no issues with it. No odors no leaks nothing. I drink my coffee black so no cream or sugar, this might cause the odors others complain about. I also love the vent. Other travel mugs I have owned had insufficient vents. The vents were so small that they would fill with coffee. Then when I tried to drink nothing would come out. This is not an issue with this mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"it works!!!!","review":"my first cup i found while on a walk.it worked so well i bought 2 moremy thought was i never had a cup that kept my hot chocolate warm for 4 hourshow amazing.then i went online and saw their claim keep drinks hot for 4 hoursits a true statement and well worth the cost"},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't buy from Amazon, but by far my favorite travel mug","review":"So this is actually this first product that I am reviewing that I did not purchase from Amazon. However, this is such a great travel coffee mug I can't help but review it. I have had this \\"tumbler\\" for about 6 months now and it still has yet to leak once. I only clean the lid and body by hand (yes I know the lid is top shelf dishwasher safe, but I prefer to be safe). Like other reviewers have stated it keeps my coffee warm long into the morning and has never burnt my hand. The auto-seal is my favorite feature. I use it every day, as I hope to for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Travel Mug!","review":"I own two of these mugs for myself and have bought more as gifts. They are amazing mugs. They will keep your beverage warm for hours. I can fill one with coffee in the morning and drink it at lunch, which can't be said for many travel mugs. It is also amazing because you can just throw it in your backpack or purse and not worry about it spilling everywhere. I find it much better than a thermos in that you don't have to unscrew the lid every time you want to take a sip. SImply press the button and you can take a drink and then it's back to it's no spill state. The mug does occasionally let a few drops of liquid out when thrown into a bag really full of hot liquid, but not enough to ruin anything. I really love this mug and would definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not spill.","review":"This cup is great. It holds in the heat, does not spill.

While the Contigo is probably better as a genuine travel mug because it has an excellent seal, I find it impossible to use comfortably. For reasons I can't fully explain, when I test the temperature of the coffee without the lid, it seems fine. Put the lid on, vent it and invariably I burn my lip. So I take the lid off, wait a minute more and now the coffee is lukewarm.

When the button is not pressed you can hold the cup upside down & nothing comes out. It's also surprisingly well insulated. Coffee stays warm for a couple of hours in it. Even left in a car in 20 something degree weather it stayed warm for an hour. That easily beats any of my other insulated cups.

If you drink anything but water, the fluids are eventually going to build up in the lid and start growing mold. Didn't realize it until i tapped the lid on the counter top one day and noticed all the gunk that was coming out.

At the end of the day, I would still have a lot of the ice I started with, despite several refills of tea, But, if you think it's bad to find the black gunk in the areas you have to dig to get to, have you ever been able to remove the rubber gasket? The mold under there is unreal.There really should be a health warning for all cups with the rubber gasket. I never would have thought of digging(and I do mean digging) this one out, had I not removed one from a much bigger cup where the gasket was a little easier to pry out.I'm swearing off all these bottles with inaccessible nooks and crannies, AND with rubber gaskets!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not function as specified","review":"This Tumbler has leaking problems.

Coincidentally, my brother purchased one exactly the same for me as a gift for the holidays that same year, so I had two in rotation. It auto seals, it never leaks, it's still vacuum insulated, and coffee stays warm for half a school day. I have no complaints on its leak-proofiness or its insulating hot coffee to stay warm.The exterior, however, looks like a worn out neighborhood: chipped, dented, and the button the opens the top for drinking busted off. So it's more of chipped, peeling, busted, dented 16 ounce tumbler that's tumbled too often, which is a shame. Tastes great, looks crappy.So for a year and a half with two identical tumblers, the Contigo will keep your drinks warm or cold, but the beautiful purple will splotch off and the exterior won't look or feel nice. Ultimately, that's taste 10, looks 2, which is kind of like human life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best...mug...ever","review":"This is an awesome coffee mug. It is really a small thermos. It will keep coffee hot for up to 3-4 hours with the top on and even 1-2 hours without the top on. It is really phenomenal. I have read some reviews complaining about liquid getting stuck in the cap and causing a bad smell. I have not had that happen yet, but here is a tip. This happens to me a lot with other drink containers and the way to handle that is to just rinse it with a little hydrogen peroxide. Smell immediately gone. Anyway, this is the only hot drink container I use anymore. I have thrown all my other portable containers away. I would definitely recommend this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leakproof? HA!","review":"Sure, it doesn't leak from the top, but it leaks from the sides, where the lid screws onto the tumbler. Every time I think, maybe this is a mistake and it'll work again, I open my bag (or I look down at my bag) and see spilled coffee all over. It is really not the best start to the day.The button is NOT depressed. I have tested it several times by holding the tumbler horizontal in my hand, and of course, coffee just leaks from the side.Also, the other reviews about cleaning this tumbler are accurate. The lid is impossible to clean.The tumbler does not keep my coffee hot through my morning commute, let alone throughout the work day.I've had this tumbler about five months, so I have really stuck with it, but I regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish peels QUICKLY","review":"I contacted the manufacturer since the finish on my mug is completely peeling off, leaving a sticky area right where you hold the mug.

I would clean the mug after each use with dish detergent and hot water, but the taste and smell remained and got worse with each use. I figured the problem had to be within the mechanics of the lid, so I filled the mug with half bleach and half hot water and let it sit upside down for an hour so the bleach solution would soak the inside of the lid. Then I vigorously shook the mug for about a minute and poured out the contents which was now full of pieces of black mold.Even after cleaning it out with bleach I won't be using this mug again, it's going in the trash. There's just no way to properly clean the inside of the lid due to the plastic mechanism inside.

I use it on my bus commute to work each day for coffee and it keeps it hot to the last drop, even after 3 hours. The shape is just right to hold comfortably, and it fits in the cup holder in my car. The larger 16 oz is better that the dinky 12oz versions on the market. The lid, as well as the sipping hole, both make a perfect seal so there is never a spill or splash. The button to open the siping hole is loaded with enough spring pressure that it isn't prone to accidently opening, even when I throw it in my backpack sideways with my other gear. Construction quality is very good and I expect many years of reliable service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely perfect--for a week or two.","review":"These mugs were the answer to our prayers. reusable coffee cup, lid that worked well, stainless body, kept coffee really hot for a long time.And then I washed the lids. And reused them, washed, reused--and within a week, my coffee developed an off-smell. The lid smelled like a locker room, and the smell would not go away. I could hear liquid in the lid, and it would not dry out.The concept is great, and I want these mugs to work, because they're the best I've tried, but I won't buy them again. The lids are just impossible to clean thoroughly, and if you're drinking coffee daily, there's just no way to wash the tops properly. Gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ew travel mug","review":"This is definitely the best travel mug I've ever owned - it looks nice, is relatively compact, and doesn't leak. But, there's the issue of the lid. I would drink mint tea in it, clean it, put coffee in it, and the coffee would taste like mint. The same thing happened with orange mandarin tea, which was really gross. But- last night I turned the lid upside down in my sink, put a squirt of dawn direct foam in it, and some really hot water, and let it soak overnight. When I rinsed it out this morning, all the smells were gone. It worked better than putting the lid in the dishwasher. Maybe this is the answer? I really don't want to give up on this mug.Update - a few months laterOK - it's not so great anymore.The smells are staying in the mug, and the dishwasher isn't doing the trick on the lid. I won't even drink out of it anymore. My husband uses it as a last resort. This thing refuses to be cleaned properly. Don't do it.

They don't keep my coffee hot half as long as my Primus mug does and 2. You have to hold in the button in order for the liquid to come out. I understand that it's supposed to prevent spills but there should be an option to keep it open. Also the fact that there is no reservoir on the top is an issue. Again, I realize it's supposed to make for easier cleaning but the first few sips (when the coffee is still hot), you can't really 'test' the temp - it's all or nothing and you just have to hope it doesn't burn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't recommend this mug","review":"I don't recommend this mug. It's balanced weird, and instead of being able to sip, you'll inevitably end up with a mouth full of hot coffee because you can't control how much is coming out. It also affects the taste of the coffee because of the way you intake it through the hole.You're better off with the Nissan / Thermos mug with the twist lid. You can control it much more even if it costs a little more. Actuall you're better off with a starbucks cup as those are just as sealed and easier to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money...","review":"...on this product. I had mine for less than a month before the Autoseal stopped working, in fact I only realized this after I found some coffee stains on my backpack. It seems like a good idea but the Autoseal with it's push-button, lever-activated seal just seems poorly executed. I'd much rather spend the money on a stainless steel vacuum cup that had a simple screw off top that you had to undo every time you wanted a sip. Is it convenient? No, but most times the simplest solutions are the best, especially in this case.

A discourteous customer service rep dismissively told me that my only recourse was the retailer, who was \\"expecting\\" another shipment \\"later in the year.\\"Despite the fact that Contigo sells these on its own website, they refused to provide any support or make an exchange, pointing out that \\"what [I] was having a hard time understanding\\" was that the retailer, and not them, already had my money.

Lea Salonga's voice alone (the main female lead, Kim) makes this cd worth the purchase. If you have seen the play, you won't be disappointed with this recorded version."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites! Buy this CD!","review":"I just absolutely love this CD. I bought this mostly because of Lea Salonga, but it surprisingly turned out to be a wonderful musical. Now I just have to debate whether I like Miss Saigon more, or Les Miserables? I have not heard the CSR of Miss Saigon yet, but you can't pass up the OLC. This is the original, and if you love Lea, get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MISS SAIGON LIVES ON","review":"It's just great to revisit the refreshing soundtrack of 'Miss Saigon'. Claude-Michel Schonberg's sophisticated musicals of 'Les Miserables' and 'Miss Saigon' are welcome spots of creativity from what is becoming a theatre scene of rehash too often driven by the dollar. We want creativity out here not the predictability of those in it for the buck. Where are the risk takers going?There are of course still moments of brilliance on stage.A recent viewing of the Australian production of 'Love Never Dies' was an absolute delight.More romanticism please.Love you Cameron MacKintosh and Andrew Lloyd Webber. Keep charging forward.Can't wait to see both the film versions of Les Miz and following that Miss Saigon.Neville Williams[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"The only flaw here is Peter Polycarpio. I could have Hinton Battle for John's role. No one beats Lea Salonga and Claire Moore. If you have heard all version of Chris you will be satisfied with Simon Bowman's rendition. Ruthie Henshall is a better Fantine in Les Miserables than Patti Lupone but I believe Claire Moore is a better Ellen than her. Isay Alvarez voice fits to her role as Gigi, a veteran prostitute. Joanna Ampil plays a good Kim but she just can't beat Lea. It's a taylor-made role for Lea. Lea and Jonathan Price has my 4 stars and the rest gets one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lea Solonga Captures the audiences hearts","review":"Seeing Miss Saigon for the first time I was amazed at how i could feel so intense an emotion just by watching the characters. It was only when i heard Lea Solonga singing in the Miss Saigon original cast recording that i realized there is no musical that surpasses it in excellence. My friend was fortunate enough to see Ms. Solonga in it, and she was and is amazed. Johnathan Price speaks for himself, he is truly amazing! Buying this cd just brings to life all the empathy we feel for each character. I don't know how many times i've cried at the ending on the c.d.

The best songs of him is \\"Why God Why\\" and \\"Last Night of the world\\". Jonathan Pryce excels as The Engineer. His version of The American Dream is just wonderfull.

However, I later regretted the purchase. Unlike, say, Rent, and Aida which I listen over and over to again, this does get old after a few runs.

With the full dicriptions of sexual acts and constant cutting on the seventeen year old girl I would think that this was a CD that would be kept behind the counter. If someone came up to a child on the street and started talking to them the way this this story is written the parent would want them locked up but it is okay for this to be within child reach at a library or a music store.

It was a great workout - putting it together that is. Seriously - ~ 1 hour and the parts are pretty solid considering I am sure they were made in China. I am 6' - 200#'s and am about the maximum size that can fit on this bench as other reviewers posted. If you are looking for a gym quality bench - this is not it. But if you want to throw around some 20-30 lb. weights on a pretty comfortable adjustable bench this is for you. For the $85 I am happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great free-weight bench","review":"Received this bench yesterday and put it together today with my 4 and 1-year old grand kids in-tow. Managed to set it up in about an 1-1/2 hours with interruptions, of course. The main frame is a bit bent to the left, causing an misalignment with the Incline Support bar and the catches on the main frame (hope that makes sense). My coach husband said that shouldn't be too much of a problem as it catches on at least one side of catch (I weigh 120 lbs. and the bench can take up to 300 lbs.). I guess if you were a perfectionist the noticeable bend would be offending to your eyes. But... all in all, I used my dumb bells and it works great. I appreciate the small poster that came with it as well. It appears to be well-made and pretty sturdy. It would have received five stars from me if the frame wasn't bent."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS A GREAT BOOK!","review":"This was the first Judith Ivory book I have read and I absolutely loved it. Winnie and Mick were such great characters. I really liked Mick. He seemed almost innocent (though, of course, he wasn't). The scene with Winnie dancing on the tables was great. He had a way of bringing out her secret desires. They seemed to have such a great relationship. This book also had several funny moments. I have fallen in love with Judith Ivory's writing style and hope she continues to write such great books. In fact, I ran right out to my local used bookstore and bought \\"Beast\\" and \\"Sleeping Beauty,\\" which were also very good. I also bought two of her books that she wrote under the name of Judy Cuevas. I haven't read them yet, but am looking for to it. This book is making the rounds at the office and is definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superlatives for this Pygmalion Twist","review":"Ivory/Cuevas has a unique and delightful voice in romantic fiction and with her latest, The Proposition, she delivers. Mick Tremore is multi-dimensional, tender, wise, mischievous and now one of my favorite heroes. Winnie, the linguistics specialist, is a great foil for him. Read this re-take on the Pygmalion/My Fair Lady story! It's good from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely loved it","review":"Great story in every way: wonderful characters, believable plotline, hot chemistry, and, best of all, flawless prose. This book turned me into a Judith Ivory fan. Mick is in my top 5 favorite romance heroes of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting","review":"It is definitely more interesting than \\"My Fair Lady\\". Edwina is far more passionate and intelligent than professor Higgins(how I hate him and I don't think he's worthy enough to have that lady's love). The characters really interact with each other, but I think the ending is kind of too convinient. I mean, what did the hero (mm, what's his name) really do to convince the old duke? Just one word \\"Poppy\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pygmalion Tale of the most Delicious!","review":"Judith Ivory is at her peak with this delicious Pygmalion tale in reverse.Mick is an unabashed optimist, romantic and abso-tively darling of a hero. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you won't want this Victorian treat to end. If you read only one historical romance this year, make it this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really cute","review":"This was a great book! You will fall in love with both: \\"Mick\\" is charming and flexible - something we don't see in male leads (the flexible part, I guess). \\"Winnie\\" is also great as she understands herself and needs to learn how he really sees her. It's great to watch/read that transition."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD HAVE TURNED THIS PROPOSITION DOWN---","review":"The first word that came to my mind at the end of this audio book was \\"choppy.\\" The SLOWLY told story seemed to contain several so-so parts that were unsuccessfully forced together. Also, all throughout the book the author took simple situations that should have lasted mere minutes yet would stretch them out to the point of annoyance. I enjoy emotionally strong heroines. In this book, the first time the hero/heroine had a small intimate moment, the heroine started a MASSIVE crying fit that went on and on. She really put a sour note in what was supposed to be a romantic story. It went downhill from there for me. (Narrator did a fine job with all voices.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Version of Pygmalion","review":"Very poignant story with real characters, not perfect, plastic people. The whole book is an interesting read, too, not just the love scenes. I anxiously await the delivery of her other two books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long, slow buildup","review":"I really enjoyed Judith Ivory's sense of humor and warmth. She's created in Mick, our hero, the kind of guy you could keep around for a while. Real warmth, humor, and generosity are the foundations of his character. Her heroine is charming and intelligent, and somewhat of an ugly duckling. This book has the longest buildup to a defloweration scene that I've ever seen - and it's all worth it! My only disappointment was the slightly too pat nature of the ending. However, in context in the romance novel world, this is a strikingly original piece of work and is truly just fun to read. Oh, and sexy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"really, really slow but well developed characters","review":"my god, it must take a tremendous of energy to make dialogue and story lines go on forever and ever. i could hardly bear to finish it, except i wanted to see how it ended. of course, the ending was contived. how about more story revolving around the ball and the final denouement? after all the agony having to get to the end, it was over in a flash with absolutely no depth to the final pages of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Heroes of All Time :)","review":"I am in serious hero-love with Mick. He is a favorite of mine, truly delightful. He's honest (I find open, honest characters so rare in the romance genre that it takes me by happy-surprise when I read one), he's sensual and a rat-catcher to boot (a commoner!) Who could ask for more? He is a wonderful foil for the heroine. His attempt to become a gentleman and Winnie's discovery of her hidden self is lovely and unique; layered yet simple and utterly fabulous. The only nits to pick are a couple of devices used to bring the story to a solution were kinda lame or \\"typical\\", which put a damper on how very refreshing this story was for me. Judith Ivory is an amazing writer. I am sad she doesn't have more books for me to drool over. I seem to enjoy the Pygmalion premise so if anyone has any rec's for that, I'm listening :)The scene in which Mickey wants to impress Winnie with his rat-catching skills is so endearing that it stills resonates long after I've read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yummy Hero!!","review":"This is my first book by the author. Mick is such a sexy/romantic hero even when he is a ratcatcher...and is equally great as he learns the ways of a gentleman. I just could not put down the book, once I started reading it. This is a very funny book too with a lot of scenes wherein I could not help but laugh out loud."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"I BOUGHT THIS CAMERA FOR MY 10 YEAR OLD SON FOR OUR VACATION OUT WEST.

Worthless.","review":"My kids are always stealing my expensive Canon digital camera, so I bought 2 of these Disney cameras for them. They like to photograph silly things like their feet, their toys, and their lunch. This Disney camera is not even applicable to such silly-fun photography. I was fair warned that the pictures would be grainy when downloaded (only 1 megapixel), but I hoped that the act of photographing stuff would be a fun activity for the kids. No so. The LCD screen on the back of the camera is completely useless, as you can barely even make out objects within 1-2 feet away. When preparing to take a picture, you must hold the camera very still and about 12 inches from the subject. When using such a technique, you will be able to make out the outline of the object, at best. After the kids gave the cameras a try and discovered that the LCD images were impossible to decipher, the cameras were left in the bottom of the toy box. Do not waste money on this camera."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you pay more than $40, you'll be disappointed!","review":"I love Digital Blue's Disney photo editing software. That alone is worth the $20-$40 you'll pay for this type of camera but I wouldn't pay more than that! I have the Disney Pix Max (with flash) and the pictures are extremely grainy. The flash is like an old 35mm flash ~ very bright! TOO bright. Great for taking pictures at least 6 feet away but any closer than that and your picture will come out almost white.The Disney Pix software that comes with these cameras is so much fun, though!

Her voice could be quite gruff and powerful as on most of the aforementioned, but also more tender as on the moving I Don't Know How To Love Him from Jesus Christ Superstar. My other favourites on this great collection include her version of Van Morrison's Crazy Love, her cover of The Beatles' Fool On The Hill and the songs Candle On The Water, Emotion and Bluebird. As an exponent of angry woman country music, Reddy certainly earned her niche in history. She wasn't outstanding as a ballad singer, but this compilation offers enough real talent and variety to appeal to both country fans and those who love the big pop ballad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm officially out of the closet as a Helen Reddy fan","review":"Throughout the 70s I enjoyed most of Helen Reddy's ever-present work on pop radio. But it was a guilty pleasure because Helen was simply not considered \\"cool,\\" then or now. Enough guilt, I'm coming out...hear me roar...Helen Reddy is one of the finest pop singers of recent decades. That voice, brassy and bold, soft and soothing, never fails to engage me. Yes, some of the songs (Angie Baby, for example) seem silly and dated, but whatever, it's the singer I'm drawn to. Outstanding tracks on this collection: Peaceful (exquisite), West Wind Circus (classic) and Emotion (high drama). Disappointingly left out: This Masquerade and Gladiola, two minor radio hits meriting inclusion. Helen, I'm in your camp...at last."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Smorgasbord of Emotion and Insight","review":"This is one of the very few cds I can listen to, continously, without skipping a song. Helen tells numerous sentimental stories and tells thorough and honest testimonials of love, loss, regret, redemption, and aspirations. \\"Candle on the Water\\" sure could have fooled me; I would have never known it was a Disney song. \\"Peaceful\\" and \\"Best Friend\\" have to be two of the most optimistic songs on the list. Helen shows Tanya Tucker up on \\"Delta Dawn\\". She evokes the listeners empathy more effectively and demands a profound understanding of Delta. My most favorite song is \\"Keep on Singing\\". You would think Helen really grew up in one-room shanty that her daddy tried to make a home. I'm 18 years old and it's amazing I even know who she is, but I think this music would still sound good on the radio today! No one has ever made a point so deliciously crisp or evoked half the things in me that Helen can do with just one song."},{"rating":"1","title":"This costs way too much.","review":"These days, 8MB of memory can do nothing but waste a DIMM slot.

The JadaKiss and BG videos are the best on the DVD. Hardware MUST come out with a sequel to this. I am so tired of seeing chopped up videos on MTV and BET that this DVD is a breath of fresh air.

See for example, Perret's \\"Old Soldiers Never Die\\" (Random House 1996)The story of the Bonus Army was an interesting event in the Depression era- combining the confused politics and economics of that time with nearly unprecedented societal anxieties.

The fabric is thick and feels very durable. I can't wait till the weather gets warmer so we can use it every day! I had a Graco stroller thirteen years ago with my first child and it lasted and lasted, I know I can expect the same from this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Stroller","review":"I got this stroller last year when my daughter was born. I fell in love with the pattern. After 3 boys my girl needed something other then blue! I think this stroller has been awesome. I love everything about it. The large basket that is easily accesssible, using the matching infant car seat with this stroller, the handy parent tray and the clock but I do think the temp is a waste of money. The easy fold. For those that feel this is too big and takes up your whole trunk. If you want a big stroller that is going to happen and the only way around it is to use an umbrella type of stroller. I'd much rather use my mid size stroller then an umbrella any day. The other reviews about it falling apart I think is complete nonsense. My thought is they didn't have it put together properly. My daughter is almost a year and no signs of problems. Please listen to the good reviews and not the bad. This stroller is awesome! I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW. this is what i need!!!","review":"being a first time and single mother, anything cheap would do. but after a year with my baby, i have learned what i actually need to help take care of my baby. i bought a clearence dark blue graco stroller when she was born and it worked fine for most of the time since it had the basic conviences of a stroller. but after eight months, i saw my baby getting really uncomfortable in this cheapo stroller, the wheels always was sqeaking and to do two things at once was impossible and to turn the stroller was bouncy making it worse for her comfort. plus it was a depressing dark blue for my baby girl. then i saw the quattro. it really has everything i need from the convient drop down basket to one hand turning plus the tray comes off, and the five point harness is so much safer then the clearence stroller. its smart to go cheap for the for the first year, but if i had known about this stroller a year ago, i just would have invested wisely then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I love this stroller. It was a gift along with the matching car seat when my daughter was born. It is very comfortable, sturdy and has lots of room for shopping bags or a large diaper bag underneath. It is easy to fold and clean. My mother has a cheaper travel lite stroller and it doesn't compare. The only thing i hate about the stroller is that i have to put it in my trunk upside down inorder for it to fit. Yes i do have a smaller trunk, but the stroller is a bit larger than other. But it is definately worth the trouble..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two wheels fell off in less than a year !!!!","review":"I have had this stroller less than a year. Three months ago, a back wheel broke off at a plastic joint when I was trying to set it up. Got a new wheel from Graco and considered it history. Well, about two weeks ago, while on a walk, a front wheel broke off and the two wheels which make up a single front wheel assembly went down the sidewalk in two differnt directions. I am very glad that my son was older with a sense of balance(15 months) because the stroller lurched forward and very nearly threw him from his seat! When we took the assembly apart, the wheels are held on with very cheap locking washers that are completely rusted out! I store this stroller inside and take very good care of it. Both times, Graco has sent me new wheels for free, this past time, they replaced all four. I still consider this stroller junk and quite unsafe and am looking for a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"contact person it was shipped to.","review":"the item was purchased as gift. you would need to contact the person it was shipped to."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Must Read This!!!!","review":"My daughter is 3 months old and this stroller was given to me for my baby shower and let me let all of you know that if this is what you want then you must know what your getting yourself into. This stroller is SOOOOO inconvinient for me because it is HUGE, it DOES NOT fit in any store ailse, it takes up all the space in the ELEVATOR, some times when the stroller gets unfolded the adult cup holder gets cought with the one on the bottom where the baby sits and its so ridiculous to waste your time trying to untangle it. Also the levers in the back of the seat recliner is so impossible to try and pull that by the time your stroller feels like cooperating your ready to take it back to the store and LASTLY the trunk space this takes is sooooo ridiculous and soooo aggrevating that if you go grocery shopping you might as well use you back seats as storage. I couldnt be any more honest!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great!","review":"I got this stroller as a gift at my baby shower. Although our little girl is not due until July, I already put it together. What a snap! And I mean that literally. No tools needed. I put it together in about 15 minutes.

If you plan on leaving your home, don't buy it. It is BIG, BULKY and HEAVY... I have to use all of my strength to lift it into the car! Since getting this (which I did more because of the beautiful pattern/color than for practical reasons) I have bought two more strollers. The first was the Snap N' Go (LOVED IT) for when my daughter was in her carrier, and now that she has outgrown the carrier I have gotten a lightweight stroller that is practical for getting in and out of the car. I wish I had known before I got this stroller that it would be so impractical. I now leave it in my garage and only use it for walks around home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have ignored Consumer Reports","review":"I bought this stroller because it was recommended by Consumer Reports. What a joke. I wonder if the Consumer Reports reporter was a shareholder of Graco prior to making the recommendation for this stroller. I regret spending so much money on this thing. It's heavy, awkward to maneuver at times, takes up a lot of space, reclining mechanism not easy to adjust, and weak wheel pins. I made a temporary repair to the wheel pin after the back wheel fell off during a walk - boy, was that ever a pain in the butt inconvenient. I will have to call graco for a replacement pin. I shouldn't have relied so much on Consumer Reports and relied more on my own practical needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your back and money!","review":"I've had this stroller for 6 months. This is the worst stoller ever! Where do I begin... It's heavy and cumbersome. The last thing you want after delivering a baby is to bend down and pick up a heavy stroller; it's too heavy to lift in and out of the trunk. I have a Mazda Portege 5 and it takes up the whole trunk. Save your back. It's also too wide to fit down the ailses of many mall shops. The sunglass holder fell off the first day. The cup holder snaps off everytime I fold it up, and needs to be reattached. The foot warmer also has to be taken off before I fold it up. The seat has to be all the way up inorder get anything of substance in the basket. The headrest slips and never keeps my daughter's head supported - sitting or reclined. The design is attractive, but it fades. I can't believe so many people like this. I can't wait to get rid of it. Go test it out before making this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby Prefers It...","review":"YES IT IS HEAVY AND BIG as all the negative reviews have stated! However, my baby sleeps through a whole shopping trip in this stroller but not in the Snap & Go. Also, I don't trust the safety strap on the SNG. The car seat just sits on the frame with a strap across the top. You should always try out a stroller at the store if you can or at least find out how much it weighs if you can't get to a store (this bad boy weighs 28 pounds and takes up a lot of trunk space). If you aren't interested in lugging around a big stroller, don't get thsi one. I don't mind it so I love this stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Windsor Stroller Stinks","review":"This is the stroller I selected for my fourth child. It is horrible! The first time I used it the child tray snapped off. I returned that stroller for a replacement of the same model. That stroller was not much better, the sun glass holder doesn't stay shut and the parent tray is always snapping off. This stroller also weighs twice as much as any of my former twin strollers! I am sure that by the time my son is five months old I will have thrown it away!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So","review":"We checked it out in the store and it looks very nice from a distance. But when you actually pick it up it is very heavy. Also it was difficult to close and kept getting jammed when we tried to open it. Even the stroller expert at BRU had a tough time opening it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This really is a FULL SIZE stroller","review":"I registerd and received this stroller for my baby shower. I didn't do any research on it, I just wanted it because I loved the Windsor print. Where should I even begin....It was not exactly the easiest stroller to put together, I had to call Graco and get two more wheel pins. They were so hard to get in that I bent them and they would no longer fit properly. I have a 2003 Chevy Cavalier, which is a pretty small car, but the trunk isn't that small. The stroller would fit in my trunk, but only with a big struggle and a lot of time. The padding on the handle bars ripped from trying to fit it in my trunk. The stroller is very big and does not fit in aisles of stores. It takes up all of the space in most elevators. I am not very happy with this stroller. I purchased the Eddie Bauer lightweight Stoller which I love and it fits in my trunk. I plan on selling the Graco Quatro Tour Stoller at a yard sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"very big and heavy","review":"I have been using this stroller since my son was born 3 months ago. I purchased it on a friend's recommendation and on the reviews. It will not fit in the trunk of my Corolla or in many stores. It can be difficult to \\"bump\\" up steps and is heavy to lift and push after a long walk. Changing the seat position can be challenging at times. The hood doesn't do well at protecting from the sun because of the window and mesh but it does swing forward which is a plus. The handles are covered with a type of foam that tears and dents. I find the jog stroller to be better at navigating the bumpy city sidwalks. It is very pretty and the clock is convienient. Colin seems to find it comfortable and the price is right but I wouldn't recommend this stroller based on the girth and weight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Stroller","review":"I love this stroller! Although it is big I feel the benefits are worth any inconvenience related to its size. This stroller basket holds a diaper bag, purse, blanket and other necessary items. It easily folds down and is not too heavy. I bought a smaller stroller thinking I would use it more for short trips but I prefer this one and use it wherever we go. I feel my daughter slumps over in the smaller one even though she can sit up on her own. I love everything about this stroller and would tell anyone in the market to get this one. However, I do not like the matching car seat and regret not purchasing a different one. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"dont know where I would be without this","review":"So I bought this after I bought a travel system and relized that my very big son wouldnt last in that long so i had ot buy something that would last a while!

I have a baby girl and am planning on using it for my next baby too...could be a boy or girl stroller. I love the extras on it, like the time/temp gage. Seems like a small thing and I thought I would never use but I actually use it every time I go for a walk. The stroller has big wheels that turn easily. I Also, love the cup holders/extra compartments on top. I can store my huge key chain in the compartment on top as well as my cell phone in the pull down compartment. I love that I can reach my pocketbook underneath the carriage even when baby is in her carseat. I am still using it with the matching car seat, which I love as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stroller you should consider.","review":"Not sure what you are looking for in a stroller? This one has it all! It's light weight, folds down with ease (one hand), has a large lower basket which provides tons of storage, works with my infant car seat (it's part of a travel system), cleans easily, lays down completely so my daughter can nap, has a comfort tracker which tells the time and temperature (digital). Another thing I liked about it was, it's easy to maneuver, and the smooth ride. I also loved the stylish \\"Windsor\\" print. So, if you are shopping for strollers or travel systems, consider this one a MUST to check out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eva's Man","review":"I applaude Gayl Jones as an African-American writer, but her writing has much to be desired. Her thoughts are not conveyed in a manner that is progressive, but repetitive. The whole story consists of one thought for the characters, sex. I find the book thoroughly disgusting and boring. It is filled with evil thoughts and hate. I wonder if Ms. Jones herself has some problems with her own mentality, she paints pictures of grossness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice yaoi treat.","review":"I will say this, I agree completely with the last reviewer. I enjoyed the scenes of hot sex in this novel. Unlike the other book from this publisher called \\"Pinned\\" there were plenty of detailed drawings showing the sex scenes and that is what I'm looking for.The story is pretty weak though, but that is expected. I wasn't looking for the homosexual \\"Godfather\\". I just wanted enough plot to perk up the sex scenes.What I did not like was the old happy ending/love romance. The Uki was far too compliant, far too forgiving, I wanted to see a little more resistance.Overall, Not a masterpiece, but it is still pretty enjoyable if you know what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read with a cup of tea.","review":"This is an enjoyable, relaxing read.

One of the guys brought his GameCube and I brought my PS2 (which is a hell of alot better then GameCube). Well, we were playing a tournament of Super Smash Bros Melee, and it was my turn. From the start the controller felt weird. All of the buttons were way too close together,it was really hard to control, and there was this huge bump at the back which made the controller feel really awkward. So for all of you who haven't decided to either get a PS2, a GameCube or an Xbox, I definatley would recommend the PS2, because i have tried all of the new systems and PS2 definatley has the best controllers and alot of better games."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Most Uncomfortable Controller Right Now!","review":"This controller fits like a glove...a really tight one. I am 16, and this thing is so small my thumbs overlap two or three buttons at the same time!

The analog is in the right place this time (Thank god), but what's with the C analog? Why can't I just use the the L and R triggers to move the camra!?! Plus why can't I push the A button? I swear. Regardless how big that button is I can't use it right to save my life (And when playing a video game, that could be a bad thing)!Don't even ask me what we'll ever need the D-Pad for, I don't know!

You might have some difficult about managing it from the first times you play, but, soon after, you won't even think it's a controller. In games you shoot (such as Resident Evil or Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem), you really think you are with a gun in your hands, because of the rumble feature, it's great. There are weaker and stronger rumbles... The only bad thing is the Z button, near the R button, because sometimes, at some games, when you're having, by example, a hard time defeating a boss, you might not find it... Talking about the L and R buttons, they have a perfect space to put your fingers in. If you don't like the + Control Pad, then you can use the normal Control Pad... The C Stick also helps at the games.And it's also great talking about design..."},{"rating":"2","title":"looks are decieving, feeling is believing...","review":"This Controller is the best out on the market. The looks of it are a bit off balance, with the giant A button. Nintendo must have spent a pretty penny to research the feeling of a controller.

(hmmm, a truly astute observation.)The book might be good for a manager or technical writer who wants to know about XML, but doesn't want to learn it, or do anything with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful background, even for a year old book","review":"Although not as up to date as this year's publications, this book explains a lot of XML technology in ways that other SGML trained authors can't seem to do. It answered a lot of background questions of 'why' XML does things in a way I could understand even after perusing a lot of other books on XML. It lacks XSL and other newer aspects, but should be updated to include them. Still, good for the basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"0 to 60 in no time flat.","review":"I'm suprised by the number of critical reviews. This book had both good content and a very plesant delivery.

More importantly when done one will have a deep and solid understanding of how XML works and be able to start making there own XML documents."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY (and time)","review":"Awful, full with stupid jokes that raises alot of ? over your head. Doesn't get to the point, never shows you a piece of code, you are not thought how to implement anything of what the writer's talking about. I found myself reading again and again the same sentance, and after 3 chapters, and quick review through it, discovering that nothing is going to change, i put it in the paper basket (PLEASE RECICLE! ) Luckily, there is WROX, gonna get a look on what they have, didn't dissapoint me once."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"I tried to read this book for a project I'm working on, but found this book is full of useless contents, which confused me and wasted my time.

I don't recommand anyone to read this book, except those who mean to spend their spare time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confused! well let me help you","review":"Ok this book is BIG disappointment for some people and for someit's entertaining. Well I don't see that these two schools ofthought have any thing to say against each other. Any way, buy this book if you want to learn about XML in a fun way. It's not technical so you hard-core-programming-book lovers stay out. I read this book when I started XML. Why I picket it because it didn't seem that heavy. Any way now here I am on my XML highway more or less satisfied with this book. Its definitely lacks some important things like schema... Watch out for its new edition when it hits market. Ok here are my final words: If you are casual in nature go for this. If you hate B-Movie or FUN-Way of learning something don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you've studied CS, get a different book.","review":"This book is really annoying for someone who has programming and CS expirence. It takes over 50 pages to explain the basic syntax of a DTD, and there isn't a brief summary of the syntax anywhere.If you know what a regular expression is, you will find it annoying wade through a 20 page excercise walk-through (using post-it notes!) to get the synax: i.e. \\"[If] it will always be in a document at least once, and possibly more ...[a couple lines cut out]... pencil in a plus sign (+).\\" ARRRGH!If you only know HTML or if you only read every 10th word, this might be the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written overview for savvy readers","review":"I didn't pay for this book (I checked it out from my local library), and I started reading at Chapter 7 (XML and CSS), but I enjoy the author's style. Having written a couple of technical books myself, I understand the pressure to just parrot the spec or the manual and I am pleased to see that Simpson brings real thoughtfulness to his subject. Instead of describing the syntax of CSS, he explains \\"the style problem\\" that led to SGML and offers one reason why HTML is more popular than earlier technologies. Then he describes the syntax.Reading other, more negative reviews, I wanted to add my positive opinion of the book. Perhaps some of those who were disappointed were hoping for more of a verbose spec, or a canned application. I prefer the thoughtful FAQ that this book seems to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Astonishing","review":"For a aviation history fan, this book is a MOST WANTED ITEM, certanly reveled some stories of only found in web pages without any autor; It focus in fighter pilots, their experiences and oppinions, interesting is the part of the early daysIts easy to read, but certanly needs more photos, specially in color and more photos of the victimsI hope that Peter B.

Django Reinhardt for jazz, Robert johnson for blues, Chet Atkins for finger-style and Joe Satriani for shred. It's unlikely however, that each of these guitarists is proficient in all styles. Not so with Tommy Emmanuel. Tommy is without question the greatest guitarist EVER TO HAVE LIVED. His prowess and musicianship are of a standard that any budding or professional axe-man would cut off their fingers for. What further seperates him from the pack is his inherent ability to create songs and melodies with total perfection. His songs on this as well as his other albums invoke a level of emotion and pure listenability, that anyone with a love for beautiful music can appreciate. Not since Chet Atkins modestly gave himself the title 'certified guitar player', has any guitarist on the planet so much deserved that title as Tommy Emmanuel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good....But.............too soft for Jazz","review":"I too bought this CD on all these rave reviews, but I have to agree with the reviewer from Missouri. This is good, but a bit like Lee Ritenour-Dave Grusin stuff from the 80's, except just too soft. It's good soft jazz, but a bit too soft for me. There is no challengne to it at all. I'd rather listen to my old Lee Ritenour CDs and hear soft with a kick. This was a disappointment overall. If you are looking for late night seduction and soft background music, this might work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ex Whitesnake, ex King Kobra, ex The Firm = Blue Murder","review":"I'm not that excited, but it has at least one excellent song: \\"Jelly roll\\". The rest is average heavy metal. Sometimes too frantic if you know what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fading memory","review":"Blue Murder were John Sykes (vox/G), Tony Franklin + Carmine Appice and were, in essence, a project put together to take advantage of the short term high profile Sykes had after his association with David Coverdales Whitesnake. Backed by the seemingly unstoppable (at the time) Geffen, produced by Bob Rock and with John Kalodner lurking around this album had just about everything going fot it. Yet it utterly failed to ignite and the reasons may well include;* A annoying treble heavy mix that's distracting to the listener on an average stereo and downright painful via headphones.* Overly long songs. They wouldn't of fired if they were four minutes long so why drag them out for six minutes?But it's not all bad. John Sykes sings well enough in an over extended way. And the players are skilled and worthy plus Valley of the Kings is lumbering - but in this instance in a good way.2.5 stars on a good day. But these guys have all played on better albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be fooled ! It is not that good!!","review":"Man, what all those reviews below are talking about?! This album is nothing more than hair metal. And worst of all: hair metal coming at the end of the nineties, when all this stupid genre was falling apart (Thanks God!)Just check the guys in the photos of the album (Sykes, Franklin and Appice). They are dressed in the best Poison and Ratt way!And about what riff you're talking in \\"Riot\\"? There's only a resemblance of a riff, it's sheer pop metal!!And talk about the drums sound of Carmine Appice. It's that typical \\"digitalized\\" sound of that period, it seems a machine.I just don't get so many praise for this album. It deservedly failed, not due to Geffen's lack of promotion, but due to its sheer mediocrity."},{"rating":"1","title":"sucky suckness from sucky land","review":"blue murders debut album,in all of it splendor and glory. i had to buy this for a friend, who loves them. he sucks, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should sue the good reviews","review":"What are these reviewers listening to????? If you're age is more than single diget, there can be no reason for a positive review. This is so bad, that I could hardly force myself to listen to the whole cd at least once. I loved SYKES work with THIN LIZZY and was expecting something pretty good. This sets a new benchmark for innane lyrics and rotten recycled riffs. THIS IS COMPLETELY MINDLESS DRIVEL!!!! And those are the better points. I would guess that MARCEL MARCEAU was the sound engineer and that the production was handled by OZZY in a very wasted state. If there is a good guitar solos on this one, it is completely lost in the horrid mix. I am just glad that they achieved the success they so richly deserve - total unnonimity. If your familie name isn't SYKES, than there is absolutely no reason to waste money on this shocker."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a rock record should be","review":"Although you'd never know it from watching any of the Whitesnake videos that dominated much of MTV's programming in the mid-80's, John Sykes was the real genius behind the enormous success of Whitesnake \\"Whitesnake.\\" On Blue Murder's self-titled debut album, Sykes' brilliance as a singer, songrwriter and guitar player is all too evident and, in fact, makes you wonder why David Coverdale REALLY wanted him out of the band.All I can say is thank goodness the other members of Blue Murder talked John into taking over all the lead vocal duties. On every track of this album, his voice soars with serious expression and just the right amount of '80's arena rock bravado, showing there's a lot more to him than just a fierce set of fingers. From \\"Riot\\" to \\"Jelly Roll,\\" Blue Murder roars through this well-written set of songs with all the power, passion, chops and authority you'd expect from an immensely talented power trio. An incredibly underrated album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"John's Crowning Moment......","review":"I remember when this album was brand new. Still have my old vinyl copy, and a CD copy.It is too bad this record was not more successful than it was, because it would have put John in the spotlight he sorely deserves for his contributions to the Whitesnake album.But, what an album Blue Murder is. John pulls off some of the most unbelievable guitar work in 'Valley of the Kings', 'Out of Love Again', and especially 'Ptolemy'. 'Jelly Roll' still gets my foot tapping to this day, and I have worn this album OUT listening to it over the years.Most people expecting a song to follow typical form, don't bother with this album. The music is far more complex, but beautiful. John's writing seems very against the standard verse, chorus, verse, chorus, guitar solo, etc.Carmen Appice <sp> and Tony Franklin make this trio one of the most memorable of the end of the metal era.Thanks for all the music, John. 5 out of 5......you're truly one of the greatest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"One of the better Metal bands of the '80s. There are some lame compositions with lyrics not to be repeated, but the composition \\"Out Of Love\\" is absolutely breathtaking! It's one of those songs you love to belt out in the car and/or shower. It's deep and moving and makes you hate all your ex's even more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair-Replacement Metal is DEAD","review":"You know about all of the Hair Metal bands worth mentioning, from Great White to Extreme...Cinderella to Poison. This is yet another group with ZERO originality who tried to capitalize on the Hair Metal formula: Power Ballads + Glitter + Spandex + Overplayed/Cliche guitars, divided by Hairspray, multiplied by sissy-prancing onstage. For some groups this worked...Poison worked it to a science. But BLUE MURDER?! WOW! That is a hardcore name man! You must sound like Ozzy or Dio or Judas Priest!No, I dont think so. They sound like all of the other second rate hair bands who, thankfully, were flushed down Nirvana, Mudhoney, and Soundgarden's toilet.I think I saw the Blue Murder lead singer duck into a Hair Club for Men the other day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best unheard band","review":"I had this album my senior year in high school. None of my friends had ever heard of this fabulous band. One of the darlings stole the album and I have been searching for 11 years to get it back. John Sykes sang some of the most soulful, sexy lyrics of the time (this from a die-hard Poison fan!!). The guitar work is other-worldly - damn near demonic. The amazing bass playing is still unrivaled by anyone today. Try this album. There is really no way to put a lable on these guys, their music is totally unique, but fans of Company of Wolves and Badlands will love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY NOW!!! Enuff said....","review":"Blue Murder is one of the most unheard of GREAT bands and rock albums. The brainchild of guitarist/singer John Sykes(Whitesnake, Thin Lizzy, Tygers of Pan Tang)rocks with an intensity and feel that was sorely lacking in the mid/late eighties rock scene. The album had minor MTV success with the songs \\"Valley of the Kings\\" and \\"Jelly Roll,\\" but lack of record company support left this album/band dead in the water after a short time. (It's a shame considering they lost tons promoting the next Whitsnake album which only had marginal success. Touche!) The songwriting on this album is second to none and it changed my view of what music really can do for the mind and soul. I recommend this to anyone who likes melodic hard rock. The guitar tone alone is worth buying this album for. It's like biting into a big, fat, juicy hamburger with the juices dribbling down your chin and all over your hands. It permeates the very essence of senses."},{"rating":"2","title":"opus masterpiece","review":"BORING?????...not, minimalistic.....not, raw, oh oh oh yes.....this is an ocult masterpiece, foward step heaven shall burn, the ultimate act of a good and powerful vocal ( joakim grave) , maybe much people by dissapointing with this review, but I dont care, for me all marduk albums is a little operetta , fantastic, older sweden school black metal, blacker than darkness, hey you fans of true black metal try to hear this magnificent album, is a sweet sin in yours ears........."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Marduk CD","review":"Opus and La Grande are the worst Marduk CD's.

First the name caught my eye as an odd name, Marduk is the Sumerian god, their Jesus for lack of a better term. The artwork was very mood influencing when you listen to to the tracks. When I opened the CD jacket and saw the band picture I knew something fishy was going on. Come on, what REAL metal band needs make up and chessey weapons you can buy at a souviner shop at any castle in Europe. I poped the CD in and found an unpleasant noice coming from my stereo that caused me to turn it off after the first few tracks. I tried repeatedly to listen to it, but the music stank the stink of feted week old fish. Steer clear of this CD and sample some of their newer more polished works before buying.

It is astounding! What I found most valuable is not the specific rules Vollmann lays out for deciding whether violence is justified or not, but the detailed and thoughtful examinations of specific historical events and people: the American Civil War, the Holocaust, the ethnic conflict in Yugoslavia; Napoleon, Stalin, Gandhi, and, most importantly, ordinary people who were victims or perpetrators of violence. Vollmann's writing is precise and eloquent and carries you so seamlessly from one page to the next that you don't realize until it's too late that you've reached the end of this 700-page volume.

I have heard nothing but rave reviews from those who I gave the CD to.

Gabriel's \\"Passion\\" is like that. Once you listen to it, its eerie eroticism will capture your mind, causing you to play and replay it many times in succession. Having watched Scorcese's film, \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" many years ago, I was inspired by the music to rent the video and re-watch the film just to hear how the music supported and underlied the drama of the film. In all of cinema, there are very few times that the music and the drama were so expertly fused, and it creates a synergistic effect well beyond the power of either. \\"Movie music\\" has never been better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting & Beautiful, Powerful & Spiritual","review":"After watching the movie (and being amazed by it), I picked up this album. What Peter Gabriel has done here is something few pieces of music have ever done for me: it has changed my spiritual outlook on life. Rarely has music penetrated so deeply into my soul and become a part of me. Persons of all faiths can appreciate the humanity and beauty of this music. At once exotic and familiar, Peter Gabriel's 'Passion' is destined to become recognized as one of the most important works of Spiritual music in human history, alongside Handel's 'Messiah', Bach's 'St. Matthew's Passion', and Bernstein's 'Kaddish'. Truly remarkable and ahead of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"MASTERPIECE...5 stars +","review":"A masterpiece without question.

Also, the Pyle Pro has a push button switch to turn the megaphone on, while this has a switch you move across, just trying to hit the right spot. To make a long story short, the Pyle Pro is much louder, and has better features. This megaphone is a bit smaller and cuter, takes the same amount of batteries, but really doesn't help much with magnifying your voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"One worked; the other simply buzzed.","review":"One Megamite worked, with a rough, sticky slide to the sliding volume switch. The other, ordered at the same time, was defunct on arrival. It only made a loud buzzing sound, no siren at all.These both smelled like rubber on taking them out of their boxes. I don't remember this smell on previous ones. (A strip of rubber runs around the large part of the megaphone opening.) Therefore, I wonder if a different manufacturer has been used to make these, a more inferior one.."},{"rating":"2","title":"megaphone","review":"Love this. Used at family gatherings and everone wants to play with it. Great for getting the attention of 100!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you live with someone who's hard of hearing","review":"My mom and I live together. She has a hearing deficit and refuses to get hearing aids. She would be in another room, ask me a question and never hear my answer. I would have to stop my activity and go stand in front of her so she could understand my response. I purchased the MEGA MIGHT megaphone, explained what I wanted to use it for and it has solved my problem...she can hear me. It's a win win for both of us. Thank you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last","review":"Mine never lasted long enough to use. A bad connection developed so that you never know if it will come on or not. When it does come on the siren works but the speaker part only produces a shrill whine at any volume setting but off (where it is really off). I kept it on my boat but it was in a RubberMaid storage container in a secure compartment with the bubble wrap around it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic crap, doesn't really work.","review":"The whole thing is so crappily constructed, it makes a person wonder why companies can even make something like this and have the nerve to sell it on here.The back compartment pops open constantly, there is no way to jury rig it except to stuff a slip of wadded paper into a cavity, which makes it impossible to open the back compartment (which holds the batteries). To add to the humor, there is no power on/off switch which actually works.The only way to turn it on is to hold the back compartment closed. The only way to turn it off is to let the back compartment pop open (which it will do constantly anyway).Piece of crap. The designer should be fired and let starve on the streets with nothing but one of these atrocities for a belonging."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible amazon vendor","review":"The vendor I purchased my charger from was Bargaincell although their email address is Webtreo. I ordered my charger and it was shipped relatively quickly. The problem was, when it arrived, it was the wrong product with a packing slip for another customer's order. I emailed Bargaincell/Webtreo at the e-mail address they provided and the emails were rejected due to an inactive inbox. I currently have no way of contacting the vendor to correct the problem with my order."},{"rating":"1","title":"Banned in America 6 DVD Set","review":"Beware! I saw the first DVD in this series when it came out in VHS. This is truly toxic. Like another viewer pointed out, this not only shows a countless number of deaths as they happen (not many \\"aftermaths\\"), one after the other after the other, in very rapid succession. Most clips only last a few seconds and the commentary is always \\"very humourous\\", in very \\"good\\" taste: \\"Ow, that guy won't be eating any more buritos!\\" \\"We'd like to say this woman was unharmed, but we'd be lying!\\" That type of thing.The main reason I call this toxic is that once I started watching it, I couldn't stop. I even watched some of these \\"exciting\\" deaths several times. By the time I was finished, over two hours had passed, and I had watched litterally hundreds of deaths, all the while encouraged to watch more by the \\"witty\\" commentary.If you value your sanity: please avoid at all cost. This should actually be... \\"Banned by Amazon\\", if you ask me."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very comfortable controller","review":"I haven't tried any of the third party controllers for the Game Cube but I have tried controllers for the x-box and PS2. Nintendo's controller is by far more comfortable. It's a quality product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instead of the \\"Classic Controller\\"","review":"Great product. I bought it so I could play Chrono Trigger and it works great. No sticky controls. Bought this instead of the classic controller because it was cheaper and will work with classic games on the wii.
