Installation and operation are familiar and straightforward. And maps download quickly to the PDA if you have a USB connection. But despite the fact that my PDA is equipped with a 128mB flash disk, Streets & Trips 2002 severely restricts the size of a downloaded MPS map file to a region that is about the size of Rhode Island, pretty much a joke out here in the Western US.

Sure enough, now it found a 370 mile, 7 hour and 12 minute route.Further experiments show that the software's \\"shortest\\" and \\"quickest\\" routes are often longer and slower than the routes you can force it to plot by adding well-chosen stops. But of course if you know what route you want to force, you don't really need the software.I'm switching back to Delorme's Street Atlas. I've been using Version 6.0, where the interface is truly awful but at least you get the right routes.

In the old version, whenever I was planning a trip lasting many days and needed to find hotels and see which ones were suitable for me I would use the \\"More Information\\" option when selecting a specific hotel. This would then give me all the features about the hotel such as; does it have a pool?, what are the rates, and so on. Well, now when you click on the \\"More Information\\" option all it does is give you the street address along with a link to some partner website where you can do your own searching to try and get more details.

In some cases they are totally wrong and in other cases they interchange answers. Another problem is that the book promises a forum on page 5 and posting of corrections on the web site.

But I think it may be useful for Architect exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Untrustable Information","review":"Too much talking with little demostration on advance topics such as hashtable or property. Too many typos. I have to rewrite the program codes in order to make it work correctly as its answer in the self-exam section. For example, the author stated, \\"Hashtable does not allow NULL value\\" but in the coding section and self-exam answer, he stated that Hashtable allows NULL value. I am really loosing my confidence and trust for reading this book. Don't buy this book if you don't want to be the next victim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably could be better","review":"Developer exam is not really covered, there are also several typos and mistakes (probably present in other hastily made Java certification books). Wide almost unused page pargin is really annoying, so many trees would be cut for the author and publishers to make money. Programmer exam topics probably could be covered somewhat better. But the book has the only coverage available today on Architect exam, even if there are probably better generic books available on the topics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing but CD-ROM ...","review":"This book is well-organzied at once but in fact, it has lots of typos and mistakes. Like some question numbers and answers do NOT match. It says it covers up Architecture test and developer at all but the sections for those tests are really tiny. nevertheless the CD-ROM inside this is quite worth to try. however, except that, nothing to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointing","review":"Explanations could be more thorough. Each page is 40% margin. The most difficult exam (Developer), is covered in 2 chapters. One of those simply restates the instructions that come with the assignment and briefly restates the assignment the author received. The other chapter on the Developer exam is a short chapter on how to answer the follow-up exam questions. The sample question in the Programmer exam chapters are very easy compared to the actual exam. Many topics are covered by giving the reader a brief explanation and a list of other resources that explain the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"This book says there is a website having errata posted for the errors in the book, but I checked the URL and this certainly does not exist. Too bad, since I can't count on the book to be accurate and must return it to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Programmer Cert Section","review":"Used this book exclusively to study for the J2CP test. The example questions were outdated and nowhere near the level of complexity found on the actual test. I passed, but not because of this book (5+ yrs experience w/ Java).The developer certification section was short on content. Now that Sun has beefed up the Architect exam, I wouldn't trust the Architect section in this book.The book is good at giving you a solid understanding of the Java language basics. However, the purpose of buying a book like this is to prepare for and pass the certification tests, and there is no hope for someone with little experience to pass any of the exams using this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Exam Prep, IMO","review":"I bought three books in preparation for the programmer anddeveloper exams. This book is my favorite. Even better,it makes a good reference, as many subjects are explainedw/clarity. I frequently xerox selected pages and pass themaround to co-workers.As for the complaint about the architect exam... I amcurrently preparing for this and the architect exam haschanged. The cover of this book clearly states 310-050but I believe the current exam is 310-051. Since I haven'ttaken this exam yet, I cannot comment on how valuable thebook is. But I did want to point out that Sun has moved on.I'm not sure what to say to the person who claims 4 yearsof java development and still didn't pass the test. Mustnot have been your day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Errors cost me critical points on the exam","review":"I just failed the exam by a small margin, and I know I missed at least 1 question because of errors in this book. This book doesn't even accurately list all the Java reserved words, which I discovered after reviewing Brogden's Exam Cram book this morning. For instance, Jaworski does not list \\"true\\" and \\"false\\" as reserved words, yet they apparently are (and were on my exam).Jaworski, take your book off the market or publish a full errata sheet. You should refund the cost of my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cover a small part of the Architecture Exam","review":"This book officially cover the first step of the Architect Certification: the first exam. But in fact the book cover just a quarter of the exam. The author is not supporting his book anymore.A lot of copy past was done in this book. Same things can be repeted more than 3 times! On the CD-ROM a test engine is provided with no more questions that those listed at the end of each chapter in the book! Useless in anyway for the Architect Exam."},{"rating":"1","title":"A shoddy job, full of errors","review":"Others have pointed out the egregious number of errors in this shoddily produced book.I would just like to add that the errors are not all trivial typos, as some reviewers have asserted.Basic points are omitted, for example the scoping of an ELSE in nested IF's, a standard pitfall of syntax, is nowhere discussed.Worse, some subtler points are completely fluffed. For example, the answer to question 12 of Chapter 6 is exactly flat wrong: static inner classes *can* be instantiated. It looks as if the author has simply misunderstood what the static modifier means when used with inner classes, has explained them vaguely, and then failed his own exam.Fellow student, your money is better spent elsewhere. I just wrote this one off as a loss, and taking the recommendation of a well-informed friend in the computer-book business, have bought Simon Roberts et al instead, which already looks a lot better.And shame on New Riders for publishing this sloppy, shoddy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short for Java Architect exam","review":"This is the only book I found for the Certified Java Architect exam. After taking and failing the test twice, I can safely say that this book misses many points, and is downright misleading on others. Many topics appearing on the exam were NOT covered by this book. The test simulation is just a re-hash of the questions in the book, and some of the answers are incorrect. This book gives you information on the test - but by itself is not enough to pass. IMHO, that makes it just about worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRAINING guide, not STUDY guide","review":"This book provides a broad overview of Java. It lacks detail and no way provides ALL the information needed to \\"cram\\" for the exam. It relies upon referencing the reader to external resources regularly.

(as opposed to the previous exam that had more definitions)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading book","review":"This is one of the few books I have seen that have unpardonable mistakes. Seems like no proofreading has been done, there are lot of mistakes in the questions itself and can lead to the programmer believing in wrong stuff.

My experience with it has been very positive culminating in my passing the exam after 3 weekends of studying the material presented in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This books is very bad, do not buy it.","review":"This book is atrocious. It is very expensive and is completely valueless for passing the exam. It provides no real information, rather it is an endless checklist of things that you need to know to pass the exam. Sun provides this for free in their test objectives list. The mock exam is exactly that, a mockery of an exam. The test engine barely works (I had to modify several files to get it to work) and the questions are poorly phrased and confusing. I would strongly advice anyone who wants to pass the test to save their money and purchase another book instead...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Riddled with errors, typos, and omissions","review":"So far I have read 6 chapters of Part I. There is a typo or an outright mistake on nearly every page. Semantics of the language are described either incorrectly or in terms too vague to even be wrong. Whoever typeset the thing put \\"fi\\" and \\"fl\\" ligatures in the monospaced code typeface, and after about 100 pages forgot to indicate syntactic metavariables with italics. When I read others' reviews saying that the real exam questions are much harder than those in this book, and then I find that the ones in the book actually have incorrect answers given in some cases, I lose all faith in the rest. I guess you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have this book","review":"This is a good book. It covers the operators, basic java fundas and IO very well. The lang, util and awt packages are not sufficient but will give a good insight if you have a basic background about these packages. Some of the excercises and review Qs are very good. If you have a descriptive book and the Exam Cram (Brogden) along with this, you have enough material to pass the latest pattern test. I passed it quite comfortably in the first attempt. and I have no programming experience (pro) in Java"},{"rating":"2","title":"Margin is useful; book looks good.","review":"Another reviewer commented on each page being 40% margin. This is true. However, there are reasons this isn't so bad.First, the margin allows lots of space for sidebars, diagrams, and code samples. This is nice, because it helps keep the diagrams or notes close to the text it refers to.Second, the main text is set in a relatively small typeface, so you may not be losing much. It would be worse if the main text were set in 14-point with large titles.Third, the margin provides lots of space for you to make notes, or corrections, if you wish.So overall, I'd say the large margin isn't a major problem, though it *is* off-putting at first. At least the book is devoid of textual fluff, as is the case with some other technical books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and time","review":"I baught the book to prepare for the exam, I recognized that I wasted my time and money after I failed the exam.

It is as if the book were written and published the same day, with proofreading by the postman who delivered it. It is full of errors on the details of the language, which, given the nature of the exam is unforgivable. Worse yet, there is no support from either the publisher or the author with regard corrections. Example errors: \\"null\\" is not a keyword, Strings are mutable, precedence of the \\"&\\" and \\"^\\" confused, I stopped reading after that. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this.

The only DS9 character is Jake, and even he is not in all of the book. Instead it talks about the crew of the ship he is on, and none of them are really that interesting.

What was the point? I realize this is science fiction, but a mysterious deck called the Wa with floating spots that take you other places?

The images are poor. If they had been in color, they would have been worth the publisher's price. This book is not about painting, but rather about the content of paintings. I would rather have had half the paintings reproduced in color and a tenth the commentry edited out. The same point could have been made if a lot of Victorian pornography had been substituted. But the rarity of the chosen works gives them some value as an art study. Just separate the cultural comment (whatever your personal opinion) from the art work if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously not written by Matt Groening!","review":"What upset me about this book was that it's listed as being written by Matt Groening. This is not the case. It's introduction is written by him, but the scripts were done by Eric Rogers, who is one of the staff writers for the TV series (info from [the web site]).The writing seems a little dumbed-down at times, and it makes me wonder if it was written for a younger audience (pre-18) than the audience of the TV series. The exception would be the fourth story which is a parody of Apocalypse Now featuring Zap Branagan.The colors are vibrant, and almost has the appearance of a photo book.The art is spot on for the most part.In the end, though, you have to look at it like this: here are four so-so episodes of a series that has unfortunately seem to have met its end, so fans looking for more material should pick it up.Conclusion: Not horrible, but ultimately forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, A good fix for when you can't see the show","review":"Good animation.

Even Futurama fans may find this comic a tough pill to swallow for their Futurama fix.Though the art is solid and familiar, the writing and stories are ridiculously sub-par. i would much rather watch the worst Futurama episodes over again than read any of the comics in this trade paperback.The writers occasionally attempt to interject some of the ongoing gags to make it feel like Futurama. Like everyone's disdain for Zoidberg. Common exclamatory phrases (Sweet Zombie Jesus!) and the like.

I really got sucked into the futurama universe with these, so much so that i thought later that i had actually watched those episodes, and would say phrases outloud from them and other futurama fans(who haven't read the book) didn't know where it came from. I kept getting the giant lobster one mixed up with the show, where leela eats zoidberg; oddly enough, that is probably the comic i get mised up with the show the most often.

It has given me great service and I like the programming option so that I can wake up to a cup of coffee already made. I came into a crisis a few weeks ago when my coffee maker broke. Alas Coffee machines do break down. So I looked around at several stores for a new one. Low and Behold Target, Walmart and other stores only sold coffee makers that had a basket type filter. Every coffee guru knows that the Mr. coffee type filters are rediculous. Then I looked on Amazon and found Coffee Noir for 35 bucks.

(2) The coffee ground section is not separate from the water section so when you're pouring water in and aren't careful, it's very easy to pour water on top of your coffee grounds as well and then end up with little coffee grounds in your coffee. Had this coffee pot for about 4 days before I couldn't take it any more and had to buy a new one. For the money and ease of use, you're better off buying the Black and Decker CMD3400MB 12 cup programmable coffee maker which runs about $35 to $40 depending on where you shop (Target has sales sometimes). Why? Lid stands up by itselfe, programming display is on top of the coffee pot (now I can read it easier), and the coffee is separate from the water.

It works fine, I suppose, and it's quite cute, but unless you plan to use twice the coffee you normally do, you're in store for a weak cup of java. This thing brews coffee so quickly that the water hardly has any contact with the grounds. As a result, even with increased coffee grounds added, the best you're likely to get is a caramel colored coffee.

Lift the lid, and the boiling water, which comes out of a little arm attached to the bottom of the lid, shoots out at you. Do you want to remove the coffee filter right away when the coffee is done?

In the BIOS it worked the same as connecting the keyboard directly to the PS/2 port, but it was much more unreliable at the Windows 7 login screen. Sometimes it would work, sometimes I had to wait for it to work, sometimes it entered a bunch of garbage for the password, sometimes it didn't work at all, and the final straw was when it just kept flashing the keyboard lights.

So, if you're looking for a book that will simply repeat what the Magisterium of the Church says, this is not it. If, however, you are interested in what a broad range of Catholic theologians have had to say, this book can not be recommended highly enough. McBrien simply explores what these theologians have to say and some of the critical questions they have raised, while not necessarily endorsing them himself.

Even worse, Mark Walters has trouble deciding how to write his book, switching back and forth between semi-scientific writing and silly poetic descriptions.

Moneyhon's focuses on the rebuilding of Arkansas' government and economy is very concise. He details the difficult tasks of building an infrastructure to lure industry and commerce to Arkansas. Another area that the book focused on was the begining of the transformation from the slave labor economy to a more modern agricultural and industrial economy. Moneyhon also does a good job of describing the hardships of the countless poor farmers and sharecroppers. The plights of the newly freed slaves are also portrayed in detail. Being from Arkansas, this book not only expanded the stories that I was already familiar with, but also taught me new histories of the state. A \\"must read\\" if you are interested in the post-Civil War South."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Although they do state that some things may be missing and replaced with something else, I did not expect it to be one of the main things which was the edible handcuffs.

I definitely feel more calm, and a sense of overall peace. The music and the sounds that accompany it are very relaxing, though not in a typical new-agey kind of way. The guided visualizations are a bit unusual, but I found them to match the style of the music. A man's voice is used, and I found that it gave the directions a forceful feel. Somewhat like 2001's Hal at times. Trippy and spacey. They actually use sounds recorded from space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Miss the Boat!","review":"I believe some of the previous reviewers have missed the boat in understanding these CD's. They are for the purpose of self-hypnosis. That \\"irritating patter\\" of voice is designed to implant positive concepts deep in the core of your subconscious to assist you in life. But you have to be able to \\"let go\\" in order for it to work. If all you hear is the patter, you're not allowing it to work. If you want relaxation and rejuvenation, Thompson's Brainwave Suite is excellent. But if you want to make changes in your life, Brainwave Journey can really help. Since I've been listening to Dr. Thompson's works, I am no longer stressed out and angry in traffic; I'm more effective at work and calmer at home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Brainwave Suite instead of this.","review":"As an owner of Thompson's Brainwave Suite, I am quite disappointed in Brainwave Journey. The music and sounds are outstanding, but the voice track is annoying and distracting.The voice is a strange, electronic babble. This is unfortunate, and unnessary. The music could stand alone to inspire your mind to travel into a relaxed, positive mental journey.My frustration grew intense after a couple of months that I gave away this box set, and have since replaced it with some wonderful collections by Hearts of Space."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best brainwave entrainment program","review":"I have several of Dr. Thompson's CD programs, and this is BY FAR the best. These CDs are perfect for improving creativity, inner peace, mood, focus, stress levels and relaxation.

These CDs have produced fantastic results in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear and cogent, though dated","review":"This book contains detailed and extremely valuable advice about starting (and running) a used (he calls it Antiquarian) bookstore. If you own, or want to own, a used bookstore this is a must-read. Even if your experience doesn't match the author's experience, you can't help but find very useful, usable advice here. The author does tend to make it sound a lot easier and straight forward than it probably is (I am not a used bookstore owner--I only dare to dream) and I think he doesn't take into account his own extensive sales experience obtained prior to opening his bookstores. The biggest problem, though, is that it was origanally written in the mid 80s and the latest update was 1989. That means that the effect of the internet in evening out distribution inequities is not taken into account--an event of likely significant impact on used book sales. I heartily recommend the book, but it's age drops it from a solid five to my four star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated","review":"Here and there some good advice, much of it pretty obvious stuff about doing retail business in general--but for the most part, obsolete and often misleading when it comes to specifics about the trade. The book is almost twenty years old, and the internet has made much of it irrelevant--he starts off by describing used book stores as \\"a tremendous growth industry\\". If you want to know how to build shelves, greet customers, and set up your store, he has some useful things to say, but his advice on what to stock (Harlequin romances?????) is absurd, and his pricing formulas make little sense. I'm thinking about buying a bookstore, and this book was very little help to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"best genetics text available","review":"The Stansfield/Elrod outline remains as comprehensive as any of the intro to genetics textbooks currently available. At about 10-15% the cost of the \\"standard\\" texts, this outline delivers the same material with more clarity, and often more accuracy. The concepts of classical genetics, which often prove more challenging for students than molecular aspects, are covered admirably in this book. While those who enjoy colorful illustration and pastel text boxes might be disappointed, the b&w figures in this book are extremely clear, logical and most importantly helpful towards learning the material. No solution manual or supplemental CD-ROM is required. Highly recommended as a reference, or as a text for general genetics classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Text, Still The Best","review":"This book will give you a quick overview and solved examples for most of the genetics you need as an undergraduate and even into grad school.

I am especially drawn to the books that encompass the flea market, antiques, and shabby chic styles. I was prematurely excited at the idea of Victorian Chic. This book failed to deliever. In fact, it quickly became the most dissatifying home decor book that I had purchased in the past 10 years. The author seemed to totally miss her objective. The book really did not address adding victorian items into your decor. Instead, it appeared to be discount store items that were added to the rooms shown.There was very little to no victorian influences noted and there was certainly nothing chic about any of the decors. It appears that the author attempted to take from Rachell Ashwell and make a buck by targeting Victorian Chic, but missed. It was simply a very bad imitation of the ideas of Shabby Chic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old News","review":"This one goes straight to Goodwill or the Salvation Army.

This is a wonderful piece, with memorable melodies, spectacular orchestration, bracing harmonies. To put the work in context, Mahler threw everything but the kitchen sink into a work, and considered the result to be a symphonic world unto itself. Richard Strauss (in his orchestral works) made no pretense of being anything other than an orchestral magician, and used a more conventional, highly polished technique. Von Reznicek strikes me as a mixture of the two, creating tone poems similar in spirit to those of Strauss using the orchestral toolkit and sense of sarcasm of Mahler. The result is highly entertaining, though perhaps not as deep as the best symphonic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Anointed!!!","review":"I am tremendously blessed to have listened to this CD.

Watching the video was like participating in a self-improvement seminar. The most dramatic change I've made is in my income.

An early student may find the extensive bibliography and glossary of benefit, however, I wouldn't recommend this book as a starting point. Instead one should try: Dalai Lama - \\"How to Practice\\", Batchelor - \\"Buddhism without Beliefs\\", Goddard - \\"A Buddhist Bible\\", and, of course, Hesse - \\"Siddhartha\\".

The acting...I expected the in-between acting to be bad- everyone does. But the acting when they're pretending to have sex was simply sub-par.

If you really like blondes or ... women or both, such as me, then you'll love one scene in particular called Oriental Massage involving two drop-dead gorgeous girls. The [woman] is an incredibly sexy Tricia Yen, and the blonde is the queen of softcore herself Jacqueline Lovelle. These two get together for a very hot scene that would captivate any guy.

Needless to say my new boots did not prove to be as great as I had expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"steer clear of this water toy!","review":"Based on the photo of this toy and it's description, one would think that it is a learning toy designed to enhance the user's knowledge of water properities. In reality it consists of a few pieces of styroform, a piece of plastic tubing and some plastic pill bottles. It was a disappointment and the contents of the package could have been purchased for a few dollars at a hardware store, instead of the $20.00 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Place I know to get Chocolate Dunkaroos","review":"My son loves chocolate Dunkaroos, and they aren't available in any stores in our area.

Disappointed in shipping!","review":"Product was good. Kids love them/brought back memories. VERY VERY disappointed in Amazon's lackluster, unreliable (lack of shipping) to military APO addresses. In general, they've shipped to my military APO address about 60% (if that) of the time - for very basic items. Many purchases were not made because items can't be shipped to me, other items I had to have shipped somewhere else and pay additional shipping to get item mailed to me. Shame on Amazon!

It is too bad that very few portable CD Players don't have an tuner. They should make it an standard. I really like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, uncomfortable headphones, weak FM reception","review":"I purchased this AIWA because I expected a high quality unit that I could use both for CD and FM radio use. To begin, I'm sure the unit itself is fine. The anti shock system seems to work. But the headphones are of poor quality and don't adjust for larger than childrens' heads. Plus, the FM reception is so poor that even in living in an urban area, I can barely pick up reception from local stations. The reception is so bad that the FM search won't stop on any station. This makes even listening to radio a pain. Apparently the unit utilizes the headphones as an antennae. I wouldn't bother with this CD player."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I bought this player because, to be honest, it looked good. Another reason was that it plays CDRs and CDRWs and it had a radio.At first, I had no complaints, but then I decided to used smallerheadphones and that's when the problems began. I didn't know that the headphones acted as an antennae. Those earpiece headphone don't work good for reception. I don't like bulky headphones and that's was a problem for me.The second thing is that even when I turn the \\"hold\\" switch on, the songs began to skip. I never dropped it so that couldn't be the problem.The sound is fine and it has nice features but the problems overshadow the positives. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aside from the packaging","review":"The packaging stinks as others have already commented on.

Most of the CEOs seem to be just spouting innocuous platitudes. Usually about how well their company is doing, etc etc. Reading this book is like sitting through a set of boring speeches at some political gathering. Like Khandros' \\"Building a Winning Company for the Long Haul\\".

The \\"hero\\", Connor, grated on my nerves so badly, I finally gave up. But, this book is wonderful. I absolutely loved Kit. He is all that a hero should be. Long has totally improved her writing with each book. This one had me riveted. Her dialogue was intelligent and so quirky that I was totally engrossed. Her master of the little ironic statement was priceless. I love authors who are good writers and Long is. To me, she is in a class (with this book) of Karen Marie Moning, who can positively transport me to her faery world with her words. I am anxiously awaiting the next effort by Ms. Long."},{"rating":"2","title":"soooo romantic","review":"Have you read a ton of romances where the two characters like each other on site and you never really get a good explanation for why there is a bond between them?

Recently I have been devouring her back list. I truly believe she cannot write a bad novel.This novel is so well written and kept me turning pages just like her other novels. There is mystery, romance, action, humor, heartache, and a surprise thrown in for good measure. Those surprises are wonderful. Her characters are understandable and so likeable that they are a treat to know. The laughs are out loud and frequent because the humor is not forced but so natural and realistic.I look forward to reading the next two books in the Holt Sisters Trilogy:#2 WAYS TO BE WICKEDWays to Be Wicked#3 THE SECRET TO SEDUCTIONThe Secret to Seduction"},{"rating":"1","title":"Refreshing Change of Pace/FIVE STARS","review":"It has to be hard coming up with plots for a regency romance given all the great story lines floating around out there.

Also, with every OS X update, especially now with Jaguar, there has been updates with Suitcase 10.Suitcase 10 has received perfect ratings from many magazines and reviews have been wonderful.I know there are a plethora of font managers for the MAC at this time but Suitcase 10 is worth the money and worth the investment. It's easy to install, easy to add your fonts, put them in categories and look at the fonts if you deal with many of them, like I do.Also, they have released updates to work directly with Adobe Illustrator 10 and Adobe InDesign 2 for font auto-activation which is awesome!Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE toy, hurt my baby boy and my daughter!","review":"This is quite possibly the worst design in a toy I've ever seen. It looks really cute until your baby actually plays with it. The \\"dump\\" feature on the cement truck, causes the whole back of the toy to come crashing down onto the floor. Unfortunately, if a little hand or finger is in the way, it's going to get smashed. My 10 month old son had a red welt across the back of his hand from this happening. My 4 year old daughter played with it and got her finger pinched in the mechanism that makes the cement mixer spin.Neither one of these were major injuries, but there is no reason this toy should have gotten to the public without these issues being addressed!

This season seems to have a bit too much \\"filler\\" but that's understandable considering the time they must spend doing the amazing action and location scenes. The budget for the show must be astronomical. Basically, we love the show and have missed a lot of sleep by staying up late watching three or four episodes, just trying to catch up to this season. The writing and weird happenings suit our sense of the absurd and we enjoy it tremendously!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing season","review":"Each season of Breaking Bad has been better than the last.

It's one of the best shows on television and just gets better and better the more it goes along. In Season 2 we saw Walter falter (did that on purpose) some in trying to maintain his sense of decency. I won't say that this sense of morality is thrown to the dogs in season 3, but it plants seeds of doubt in the viewers' minds, making them wonder just how far will he go and, more importantly, force them to as themselves how much longer will they be willing to sympathize with the chemistry teacher turned meth cook. With what many consider to be some of the most action oriented (and just plain edge-of-your seat thrilling) episodes in the series, Breaking Bad season 3 would make a fine addition to anybody's collection of dvds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breaking Bad","review":"Thanks to Amazon I got up to speed now that i have purchase season 3 and it's a great buy.

I am currently envisioning Walt and Hank going into the drug business together. DEA Hank is about to blow sky high and I think nothing would make him happier than to beat on some bad guys. Well, take your pick if you are on the other side of drug trafficking. There are no good guys. Anywhere.Just as Walt gives up on Skyler, she seems to change her mind. She's seen the money ....Walt doesn't know what to do with himself. He's waiting for his cancer to return and just sitting around in a house which is a war zone. Gus shows him the chem lab of his dreams to lure him back.???????????????In short, fascinating as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such gifted writing","review":"Being a 72-year-old WASP grandma, I am hardly the target audience for this product. However, when it is finally done playing later this year, I don't know what will serve as its equal in talented writing, directing, acting, production and just plain off-the-wall enthralling viewing. It's such a game of chess, a cat-and-mouse chase, twisted and perverse often, edge-of-the-seat viewing which frequently left me cheering or, alternately, cringing. Walter and Gus are both brilliant minds, trading the upper hand. One knows Gus is corrupt and one sees that Walter is becoming more and more so, digging himself in deeper and deeper until you cannot imagine a way out for him. Supporting them is a cast of diverse characters, each with good and evil qualities but to a much lesser degree than Walter and Gus. It is my hands-down favorite piece of writing EVER. By the end of its run, I will own the whole set, most of them acquired thru Amazon. Wouldn't part with them for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"What was that?

It is like most other series they build on and continue from the previous episode/season. You really do have to start from the beginning. But after one show it will draw you in, and before you know if you'll be done watching all of season one, and onto two. As far as I know there are 4 seasons, with season 4 not out on dvd as of 3/7/11. Even my boyfriend loves this show, and he is against drugs- he usually won't watch anything with alot of drugs in it.

The entire book is comprised of words and styles that have been published a million times before in other books pertaining to Viking Mythology and basic, basic shamanic practices.

The development of Imrhien, once she discovers her sex and that people will talk to her, is extrodinary and dart-thorton makes every pain and joy exquisitely real.

The writing style is agonizing to read. The story and concept is excellent but the writing style drags on and on. I've never read a romance novel but I expect it would sound like many parts of this book. I read the whole series and unfortunately each one gets to be more and more like a romance novel. Reading this series was somewhat tolerable as you can just skip over pages and pages of the descriptive text and not miss a thing. It's really ashame because there was so much potential here and I really wanted to like this series. The faerie lore is the only redeeming quality and the reason for the second star."},{"rating":"1","title":"uninteresting and trite","review":"After reading all the great reviews on this book, I couldnt wait to dive into this \\"Tolkein-esque\\" world of fantasy. I couldnt be more disappointed. Several things bothered me about the Dart-Thorin's writing style. She seems to enjoy throwing in difficult words that seem way too premeditated. Yes it displays her skills in vocabulary, but it also takes away from the overall flow of the book. The plot was, for the most part, empty. I skimmed through many pages looking for something interesting to happen.Bottom line: Please dont do Tolkein's works the injustice of comparing them to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"it could have been so much better....","review":"This series had an intriguing story, its just to bad that the writing was so poor...."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful writing","review":"I couldn't even finish this book.

This was not the case when I read The Ill-Made Mute. It exceeded my expectations.I have read a lot of fantasy and never have I come across a writer who can create a whole nother world with so much detail, as well as a complicated plot, believeable characters and a style that blew me away.It's kind of hard to review a book when it's the first of three, and you know the story is far from complete. I get the feeling there are a lot of questions raised in this book which the author has deliberately left unanswered until the next two, so I don't want to make any assumptions about the plot. I can only say, I'm hanging out for the sequels. I've had a long thirst for a real Tolkien-style story and this book slaked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad.","review":"The first 39 pages of this book are utterly dire. I simply do not understand all the glowing reviews. The level of the writing is about what you'd expect from extremely pretentious internet fan fiction written by a dungeons and dragons player who wished to show off her vocabulary. Totally unnecessary metaphors and descriptions detracted from any interest or merit the story might have. Whether it improved after the first 39 pages I can't say as I just couldn't force myself to continue with it. I only regret that I didn't give up after the first page."},{"rating":"2","title":"A refreashing change of pace","review":"I work at a bookstore, so I get the chance to discover authors and books that I normally wouldn't notice.

I highly recommend this book and am impatiently waiting for the sequal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Struck dumb with wonderment","review":"I must say that it is hard to put into words the wonderment I felt whilst reading the Ill-made Mute. It certainly doesn't show that Dart-Thornton is making her first outing into the novel-writing world. The book is spell-binding from start to finish and is a vibrant and fresh entry for the fantasy genre. The weaving of old-style myth, particularly the wightish legends is masterfully done, and adds a richness of magic which leaves the spell-and-lighting-flash-style, which much of the fantasy area has fallen into, in the dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Great Book","review":"Read this book if you enjoy reading Celtic-like fantasy and appreciate a beautiful writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new favorite","review":"For the last few years I have mostly stuck to reading my same favorite fantasy authors over and over again, just because I couldn't find anything else decent. Tolkien, Le Guin, etc seemed to be the only ones to write with brain and soul. Now here comes Dart-Thornton and if her next books are going to be anything like The Ill-Made Mute she's now on my list of favorites to read over and over again.Impressive! Enthralling! Slow to start, but once you get into it, unputdownable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ill Made Mute and Lady of the Sorrows","review":"I've been an avid fantasy reader for over 7 years now and have read many great books, and I have to say that the whole bitterbynde series has, so far, been one of the best I've read in a while. It's original and vibrant. The characters have depth and Imhrein/Rohain/Tahquil/Ashalind has a unique courage. The whole series has a feel of fairie to it and fairie tales are interwoven all throughout the tale especially in the second book. As I am a lover of everything fairie I could not help but love this series. However if there had never been a single fairie tale in the entire series it would still have caught at my imagination. So in short Loved IT and cannot wait for the third book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ill-Made Mute, Not so Ill-written!","review":"For my 13th Birthday my dad bought me The Ill-Made Mute, I am pleased to say I finished it in a short time, because I couldn't put it down. I'm really into sci-fi and fantasy so I truly loved this book, but two reasons I like this book is, that is written with so many elements like mystery, adventure, and even a dash of romance. The other reason is that there is so much suspense in the first (and second) book because Imhrien aquires her voice in the first book she only says 3 words and the book is over! This great sense of hanging in mid air is also found in the 2nd book, she remembers vital memories and we are not told what she will do with the information she has, so we will be left guessing for another year!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely lovely book","review":"The main character is introduced horribly injured and reduced to miserable dependency in a harsh and rigidly straified society (almost Gormenghast-like). Then, leaving the 'safety' of this closed world, gradully restored to awakening sense of self in a rich, detailed, wonderful, dangerous world.Best read in ages. Can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"verbose, slow","review":"After reading the reviews in the inside cover, I started this book with high hopes. However this book appears to be more of an attempt to show how clever and broad the author's vocabulary is rather than tell a good story. For the first hundred pages or so I read out words to my wife to see if she knew them (she didn't), but finally got tired of the author trying to make me feel stupid. Since my wife and I both have university degrees and read continously, I can only wonder what a struggle this book must be for many.I've read Hemmingway, Fitzgerald, Tolkien, but no author has made me reach for the dictionary like Ms Dart-Thornton. In the end it distracted from the story too much - intricate detail about nothing is how I'd describe the book. No tension, no character development, little plot.... but LOTS of poetic description.Colin."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ill-Made Book","review":"I love fantasy, when it's well-done, but this is apalling. While the main character is engaging at the first, the rest is extremely repetitive, with enough figurative language to choke a bard. However, were it not for all the reptition and figurative language, the book would only be fifty pages long. Also, she takes the convention of inventing new words for the new world too far, and as a result, it is extremely hard to read. Moreover, any interest the main character generates at the beginning is quickly lost when first Truth is discovered, as it becomes a matter of stereotyping, rather than playing with the rather role-reversals that could have been. If you are very hard-pressed for good fantasy, hold out but a little until something better can be found!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid at all costs","review":"I bought this book on the strength of the jacket blurbs and other reviews. Lots of people highly recommend it. So I was amazed at just how BAD it actually was! The descriptive passages are so flowery and over the top (eg; clouds looking like 'tesselated teasle-tufts') that they are quite nauseating and serve to seriously undermine the credibility of the storyline. Furthermore there is, for the most part, only one main protagonist in the story - and she is both mute and suffering from amnesia! Needless to say this makes character development rather difficult. I was quite unable to empathise with the plight of Imrhien and thus the book failed to develop any sense of dramatic tension for me. All in all I thought it was an absolute shocker! Don't bother with this one! Really it should get NO STARS"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautifully written book","review":"While this book started out rather slow, and it took some getting used to the very descriptive language, it was definitely worth persevering (and you find yourself loving the detail given). Once Imrhien had escaped from her life of drudgery & persecution at the Stormriders Tower and the reader begins to get more information on the story's world and new characters it becomes compelling reading. The story grows more and more complex and indepth. By the end I was compelled to immediately read Book II Lady of Sorrows. If you love science fiction you will definitely love this trilogy. Do yourself a favour !"},{"rating":"1","title":"grrrrrrrrrr too wordy","review":"I do not understand the ratings on this book. I tried to like this book.I kept thinking in the next chapter the story will get interesting. Never happens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"The story was good. But unfortunately, it was hard to find it. The writing style of the Ill Made Mute is by far the most annoying that I have ever read. The writer's \\"voice\\" was very clunky, and I noticed the writing early and often. Cecilia Dart-Thornton constantly pulls you away from the story to announce, \\"Here I am! I am a writer, and this is my style!\\" I am an avid reader of fantasy, and the best leaves you with a story. I have never noticed the writing style of Tolkien, King or Lewis. (among many others) But you will notice the writing style of this author. It is like biting into a hamburger and tasting spinach, lemon juice, garlic and figs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great book. I really liked it and would recomend it to anyone.

I think it will turn out to be a classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for the fireplace...","review":"If there was the option for 0 stars, this book...and the entire trilogy would deserve it.The story in itself MIGHT have been interesting. I was so intrigued by a mute, disfigured protagonist and confident in the glowing reviews that I bought the entire trilogy. I wish I had read more reviews, because as many of the other readers have attested to---the story is completely lost in the author's rambling, boring, wordy, and frustrating descriptions. The entire time that I was reading, I kept WAITING for something to happen. The pretentious Cecilia Dart-Thornton is ten times worse than Robert Jordan in the later years; the worse I have ever read. She may have an astounding vocabulary, but she doesn't have what it takes to be a great writer---a person who knows how to tell a story and holds the reader in thrall.All I can say is...these books look great on my bookcase, but if I was a rich person and could waste money, then I would just throw them into the fireplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Beautiful","review":"The Ill Made Mute was simply one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. It was as if the author had rummaged around in my head and written down exactly how I envisaged the land of my dreams.Absolutely gorgeous!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghastly, ghastly, ghastly","review":"I was ecstatic to find some other people also found this book dull beyond measure. I do intend to haul my way through eventually, just to see if the story does get interesting, but frankly I just couldn't stand the overwriting. I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but I don't mind it - this, however, was just \\"my enormous vocabulary\\" and a complete lack of characterisation. I couldn't see the point in the folklore - I am a big Celtic mythology buff and I love that stuff, but all C D-T seemed to be doing was repeating a few stories with no apparent narrative tie-ins. I also found her appropriation of Irish language as \\"Ertish\\" offensive. We are not diddly-diddly leprechauny elvish \\"characters\\". We're real people with a real language. Another reviewer suggested it would be good for children - children with a reading age of 250, perhaps? Extending vocab is great but this is mostly unreadable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fuss over very little","review":"I really just don't get the fuss. So far this year this is the most mediocre book I've bothered finishing. And the only reason I finished is because a friend recommended it. I ended up skimming huge chunks just to get through it.The plotting was transparent. With perhaps two exceptions I could pretty much tell what was going to happen. Boring.The characterization was nonexistent. The heroine had no personality, the hero was perfect and had no personality, the secondary characters were archetypes. Boring.The world building was thrown at you in undigestible chunks at the beginning. A good author weaves the world seamlessly into the plot, IMO.And how hokey - she gets a normal face and doesn't know if she's ugly or pretty <eye roll>. And worst of all, this book ends in the middle of nowhere. It. Just. Ends. ARGH!!If I hadn't gotten this book from the library and had actually paid full cover price for it I would be frothing at the mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pearls before .....","review":"This book is a box full of pearls of celtic mythology, much of which is rather repetitive. The language is mined from a thesaurus. (I have a good vocabulary but every page has at least one word I've never heard used before.) The author builds an extensively described fantasy world, too much of one - more than you want to go into. Between the myths recounted and flowery language there is very little story. The mystery of the history of the main character is revealed slowly . More detail is expounded on the bloody fight with air pirates than moving the story forward.If you like celtic mythology, find a good anthology. If you want a novel with good characterizations, look elsewhere. This book only satisfies a reader that wants to simply float in the world the author built."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze Alert","review":"I was unable to finish this book. I trudged through the first 120 pages,then, which I have never done with a book before, threw it aside and never looked back at it again.I understand it takes time to get a story set-up and rolling, and it looked like it was in the very beginning. It seemed somewhat intriguing, but then it suddenly stopped, and aside from 2 actual incidents of something happening, the rest was a bunch of people telling tales of folklore, which are old stories we have heard before, told just slightly different.I have read Robert Jordan's Wheel Of Time series, and as long winded and sometimes boring as it gets, it had nothing to compare to this.In all fairness, I should have been fore-warned by the title...The Ill-made Mute pretty much tells you the main character has no voice, and though the author uses many words, has no actual voice either."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Bad It's Fun!","review":"There is one word for the Journals installment: hilarious. I have given it one star because it is so bad that it is sometimes fun to read. The author frequently breaks third person narrative to communicate his silly political views; the sex lives of the characters are the fantasy of a frustrated heterosexual male author; the tedious description meanders on and on until its pointlessness is simply cut off; anything with a New Agey feel is fetishized while anything that is Christian is twisted or evil; the author believes he is smarter and more enlightened than his readers when in reality his silly, heavy-handed rants fluctuate between cliche and conspiratorial paranoia. Oh, yeah, and the plot is unfocused to the point that you have no idea what these characters are supposed to accomplish in their hundreds of pages of aimless wandering. It's so bad that, at times, it's fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A WASTE OF GOOD TREES","review":"A paradisiacal exemplification of self-absorbant vaingloriousness, Mr. Rippe's gravely protracted \\"oeuvre\\" accosts the reader with an unexceptional saga intertwined with copious doses of ingenuous magniloquent ideology. Definitely for the reader who prefers to have their beliefs dictated to them rather than actualizing their own personal convictions.At 700 pages, you would be better served devoting the time you would have spent reading this book to something else. Spend time with your family, become active in your community, or even write a novel yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"pedestrian and egotistical","review":"It is hard to believe how many people out there are so unfamiliar with good writing that they actually like this book. I was really looking forward to a good read, based on some reviews, and the intriguing cover... unfortunately, the cover was as good as it gets. Ponderous, opinionated, and unfocused- not to mention the second-rate, high-school metaphors and verbiose descriptions of minutiae. The conversations between his flat characters were awkward and false, as were the scenarios he set up. The author should spend a few more years reading the works of good authors before he attempts to not only put himself in their league, but to vault over them (\\"the Bible is man-to-God, but this book is God-to-man,\\" yeah, right).

The action figure is difficult for my 4 year old to remove or put in by himself so I spend much of my time doing that for him. The missiles will fire across the room making them difficult to find and my son has already pulled off the headlight/missle covers several times. You can put them back on but they shouldn't come off so easily! The missles have to be put back in a certain way which takes some fine motor skills that he hasn't developed yet. It's only been a day and my son is still interested in it but I know that will soon fade. I'm sure the missles will be MIA in a few days as well.

To listen to his work is to find yourself sinking effortlessly into meditative, healing phases of consciousness.This collection is invaluable.Buying this set gives you four CDs; each includes tracks that will help you achieve different types of meditation. The four categories are: relaxation, performance, creativity, and health. My personal favorite is called \\"Dream Mentor,\\" on the creativity CD, which never fails to gently lull me into restful sleep.If you are interested in meditation to facilitate relaxation, mental performance, creativity, or physical health, this set contains material that will help! Also try Soma by Tom Kenyon.The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 stars is the cost. If these CDs were sold separately I would have bought Relaxation and Creativity. In any case I recommend this set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep Throat To You All!","review":"Now I have owned Trunk's copy of this record for the last 5 years.

From reviewing the CD it appears old film equipment was used to convert from mono to stereo. And the tracks actually sound good! On top of that LITA has added Deep Throat 2 to the CD! Probably better music then Throat 1...and barely ever heard. There are some sick notes by the hedge hog and a prof William Wackenstein. Ron speaks of deep throating tricks while Prof William talks about throat parties, ludes and trying to bang Trannies! What a group the LITA label hangs with! These guys obviously have deep issues! Make sure and peel off the sticker on the cover...as santa brings a hard one for you peepers!

His hard work, dedication and desire for hunting,using his senses to the best of his ability,his understanding of the whitetail, especially seasoned older bucks,his intense and graphical account of past experiences, and his sense of humor make it a joy to read.

After reading it I really feel like I have a much better understanding of whitetail behavior, plus, I'm much more confident. It's not just about deer either; it addresses so many other aspects of hunting. It covers, gear, firearms, proper shot placement, and that's just for starters.I can't wait until this fall for deer season.

Frankly, I am worried and offended that such a \\"Mr. Miyagi\\" (or maybe \\"Meeyahghee\\" if the author spelt it) type, a cultural dinosaur, is depicted (wrongly at that) in a book for children introducing Japanese culture.

After breastfeeding continuously for over seven years, I really wanted to read a good, funny book about a nursing mother. However, I kept feeling that Lisa Shapiro was trying, really hard to be funny, but just kept missing the mark. I was prepared for the fact that the book might not be factually correct ( it isn't ), I was just hoping for funny. If you're looking for funny AND factually correct, I'd really recommend, \\"So THAT's What They're For!: Breastfeeding Basics\\" by Janet Tamaro"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not funny, just whiny and miserable.","review":"I'm pretty sure Ms. Shapiro fancied herself the next Vicki Iovine (author of the Girlfriend's Guides books) as she wrote this book. However, I found her to be far off the mark.While Vicki's perspective is down and dirty, her writing is fundamentally infused with a great sense of compassion, generosity, and warm humor. Ms. Shapiro, on the other hand, just comes across as whiny and miserable.As a new Mother myself, I'm currently dealing with the many ways nursing can be challenging, maddening, and downright weird. I would have gladly laughed along with Ms. Shapiro as she documents her trials. The problem is: I couldn't hear her laughing. Frankly, I just ended up feeling sorry for her. I didn't find this book funny OR inspiring OR hopeful. I'll stick with the Girlfriends Guides in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"How her breasts bored the world","review":"This book starts out promisingly, then degenerates into an ordinary (and rather dull) personal journal. I am a nursing mother of a 2 month old, and was intrigued by the subject, but disappointed by the book.I'm with the other reviewers who said that the author comes across as braggy and self-absorbed. Slogging through repeated accounts of how fat she looked and what she wore was tedious at best.Also, maybe I'm a dork, but I kept wondering how she would tie the title of the book in with her story. She doesn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic and boring","review":"I wanted to like this book. I really did. But I couldn't, because it just wasn't that good.Ms. Shapiro comes across as whiny and resentful. She seems to be well-educated, but she refused to educate herself on breastfeeding, or even childbirth, and thus brought most of her problems on herself.Her writing style is rather boring, and I just could not force myself to care about her or her baby.Additionally, this book does women the disservice of protraying nursing as always horrible, not as something that may be difficult at times, but in the end is a wonderful thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!","review":"Finally! A book that really lets you know what being a new breastfeeding mother is all about. I could not stop laughing. Lisa Wood Shapiro is not afraid to tell it like it REALLY is. I felt like she was reading my mind. I am so glad she didn't candy coat her experience or pretend that she had a huge epiphany at the end. Just like childbirth,the emotions we feel as new mothers are sometimes messy. This book felt to me like it was real. Is that so much to ask for nowadays?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Girlfriend's Guide to Breastfeeding","review":"......only younger, smarter, and funnier. Lisa Stone Shapiro is not just a mom with keen vision, great advice, and a story to tell; she's a REAL WRITER, and this book reads like the best fiction -- gripping, human, and irresistible. Think Ruth Reichl, only instead of recipes you get breast feeding tips. Shapiro's description of returning to Manhattan after 9/11 gave me chills. Her lacatation consultants and fellow nursing moms come to life like characters out of Ann Tyler.Most importantly, this is a book I wish I'd had when I started nursing my daughter. It would have made me feel like I had very smart, brutally honest, and totally sympathetic company (and I would have known what was wrong with my wrist!). Though this isn't just a book for nursing moms, it's definitely a book no nursing mom should be without. It's right up there with Nalgene bottles and breast pads: but enjoyable as it is indispensable."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book if you have a sense of humor!","review":"A friend gave me this to read as I was struggling with breastfeeding my newborn.

I thought there would be some skipping, but there hasn't been any. I use rechargeable batteries and I'm surprised at how long it holds a charge. I especially like the \\"indicator\\" that tells you when you need to replace or recharge your batteries. If you're using rechargeable batteries, AIWA supplies an adapter so that you can recharge the batteries through the CD player. I can't think of anything that I don't like about the AIWA.

The cd would play fine as long as I pushed down on the lock but it finally went bad altogether but the radio still works. The unit worked fine about 6 months.

I then have to remove the batteries to un-freeze it and I lose all of my preset stations. This is a real inconvenience if you're out walking or jogging! Also, the single track repeat mode does not work. In the beginning I also had problems with the headphone output, but that seems to have cleared up. Perhaps my unit is defective or perhaps they are all like mine- I wouldn't know- AIWA didn't include any contact information so I don't even know how to get service on the darn thing and it's been to long to return it to the store!"},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"Unfortunately I think I received a defective player. The radio work fine, however the cd player is very temperamental, but when work it worked well during my treadmill workout, also the display never worked.

Our son is so sad that they don't glow as he really wanted to look at them while sleeping. Not only they don't glow, but they are not even correct by color e.g. the earth could have been blue or green but is white. My son was really confused by that.

One of the reasons I chose it was that I had read the handle stays cool. It is a pet peeve of mine that in 2012 one would sell a kettle where the handle gets too hot to use without an oven mitt. This kettle unfortunately falls in that category. It becomes too hot to even click the spout opening; much less pick up the kettle. This is a design flaw I would not expect from OXO, and it is the reason I cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I ordered this kettle two months ago and have been using it daily ever since; it is great.Since it was mentioned by a few other reviewers, I wanted to say that I prefer the fixed handle because it means the kettle will not slide around when I am pouring. I've had that happen with the type of kettle that has a longer spout.Regarding getting the kettle under the tap to fill it. Yes, a bit awkward but since I only make eg, one cup of tea at a time, I just fill a cup first and then pour that into the top (plus a little more \\"for the pot\\"). No sense boiling a whole kettle of water for only one or two cups of tea.I also recall someone saying the whistle was not very loud. I can hear mine all over the house, that is definitely not an issue, but it is important to have the lid securely in place--it is a very snug fit. Otherwise the steam escapes and the whistle is not as loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the color of this teakettle/","review":"A very well made teakettle, love the color , adds a nice touch to my country kitchen.

My grandma is 80 and easily uses the spout by pulling the lever and closes it by pushing the button on top. It does not leak when she pours. Also, the whistle is nice and loud and blows right away, as soon as it boils. The handle does not get hot and even though she uses this kettle 5 times a day (at least) and she has really hard water that is full of calcium, it has not even tried to rust. The coating on the inside looks like it should last for quite a while. Great function and ease of use for a kettle in this price range.

It was not high enough (or thick enough), the width was not wide enough, and the back of the pillow hurts my back (rather than supporting it) when I sit on sofa, bed, or rocking chair. I bought a Boppy pillow and kept that instead for breast-feeding. I hope you'll find your preference."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, but not perfect","review":"i like how firm it is. the flat surface (not counting the bumps on there which i assume are for baby's head?) is better for holding your arm up than any other BF pillow i've tried. baby doesn't slip down between your belly and the pillow or sink into softness. i don't really walk around when i'm breastfeeding though, so to me the wrap-around feature is just a pain in the butt. it's cumbersome trying to get that thing around you while there's a wailing newborn in your arms. would rather have a version without the back part, it would be easier to put it on your lap and take it off after feedings."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOXIC!!!

Some moms seem to adapt very quickly to breastfeeding and can hold the baby a variety of ways - this is not me at all! This pillow is awesome and really places the baby at exactly the right position. Plus it has 2 little \\"bumps\\" on the front to lift the baby's head also.

Plus if my toddler misbehaves while I am nursing, I can stand up to redirect the child ...then return to nursing in a snap because the pillow is ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design probably good-Fabrication NOT","review":"This item and an extra cover were purchased as a baby shower gift on the recommendation of my daughter who breast fed both her children. She had used a similar product but had read some good things about the \\"Brest Friend\\" and and thought it appeared to be well designed for its purpose. When it was delivered, and before it was even taken out of the clear plastic packaging, my wife looked at it and said \\"No Way\\". The fabric exterior looked, felt, and truly was way to abrasive for a newborn's or infant's tender skin. The additional cover was made of the same fabric. Because of the actual makeup of the fabric, its was not likely that even repeated washings would soften the fabric to any noticeable degree. My talented wife has been sewing, knitting and otherwise working with fabrics for decades and has years of experience with infants and their skin so her reaction comes from two areas of substantial experience/expertise."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome pillow","review":"absolutely amazing, completely worth the money! it is sooooo much more comfortable and very easy to use, i definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than Boppy!","review":"I inherited the boppy from a family member and was struggling with breastfeeding. I tried using the boppy and numerous other pillows to get comfortable and raise him to the right height...it was a huge struggle each time I breastfed. I was hesitant to spend the money on this but it was recommended by the lactation consultant. I ended up buying one and am so glad I did. These are made so the baby is a good height to your breast to relieve discomfort. As much as I'm breastfeeding it was WELL WORTH IT and I no longer am frustrated each time I breastfeed. I can now just enjoy time with the baby when I breastfeed. I highly recommend to any nursing mom.Update: Great pillow but once your breasts toughen up, they are no longer really needed. I used mine for the first few months. It was worth it in my opinion but some may want to just make do with pillows/handed down boppy until both baby and mom get better at nursing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Nursing Pillow","review":"I love my \\"My Brest Friend\\" nursing pillow. It is so comfortable for me and baby. The hard pillow supports baby and helps keep her in position while feeding. I love this pillow so much I purchased this one as a backup for when the first one gets dirty, and I am washing the cover. There are a couple of cons. First, the cover is hard to get back on after washing. Second, there is a buckle on the side to strap mom in, and it is hard to buckle when holding baby. It is best to get the pillow on and then pick up baby. Overall, I love this pillow. It is much more comfortable than my \\"Boppy\\" pillow and supports baby much better! This would make a great gift for a new mom who plans to nurse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Breast or Bottle feeding or just carrying baby!","review":"Both my husband and I use this pillow for many things and I recommend this highly!Breast feeding: I find the support amazing and baby lays comfortably on there and he gets so relaxed he can nap on there and I can let him without my arms getting tired. Lets me move around while breastfeeding.Bottle-feeding: As he gets heavier both my husband and I put this on to support him while we do so. It helps our arms not get so tired and baby has a stable place to sit down.Playing: 2 months old, he likes to lay down and just look at us and coo. It is the perfect distance from his face to ours so he's not overwhelmed and he'll look at us. He likes to lay there and just move around while he's on our lap.Napping: Good place where I can let him take a nap on me while I'm doing something and don't want to put him down. Or I'm watching TV and he likes to sit there or lay there and nap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought I'd love it, but I could do without it","review":"I got the Brest Friend pillow this time around, having used the Boppy for my son when he was a baby. I actually don't really like this pillow. It's big and bulky, hard to position correctly, and the velcro strap on the deluxe cover (which I purchased separately) itches like crazy against my bare skin! I'm not sure if the regular cover has the itchy velcro strap, as I removed the leaf cover immediately and haven't looked at it since.Most of the time, I just nurse using a regular pillow and would get by just fine without a special nursing pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made","review":"It looked so great when it arrived. Right until the first wash. After I took the cover out of the washer, it was a disaster. Strings coming out of everywhere and seams torn apart. Not to mention, now the cover doesn't fit the pillow because of its torn seams (which is nothing but a piece if foam, btw). The pillow doesn't worth the money I threw out on it.(Yes, I always use delicate washing cycle for my baby's stuff.)Either get several covers to throw away the previous one without trying to wash it, or sew everything before considering putting it in the laundry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect but well worth it!!!","review":"I used this pillow for nearly every feeding with my son for a year. It was terrific for the back support, especially, when you didn't have a good chair nearby. It was also very firm and never lost its shape despite my frequent use. As for the reviews that said it's hard to put on and off without using both hands, well I didn't have that problem because you don't HAVE to snap the thing into place. It will go around your waste and around your back just fine without you securing it and stay there. In fact, the only time I really needed to secure it was when I knew I was going to be shifting around. Then I simply put it on before I picked up my baby. It was never an issue!The only con was that it was hard to get the slip cover back on after washing since the foam is so firm. I had to work on getting it to be the right shape again. But that won't deter me from using this pillow again with my second child. I'm actually looking forward to it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Off gassing","review":"The foam smells horrible of toxic chemical foam & glue. The foam is cheap quality & is made of 3 pieces that have been cheaply glued together. It is made in china. This pillow gave me a terrible headache. Huge disappointment. My pillow is also one that says it does NOT have the flame retardant chemicals on it. So that is not the problem. I love the concept of this pillow. I'd be willing to pay more for one that was made of quality & ALL non toxic materials, & made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not pretty, but very helpful","review":"I highly recommend this pillow for breastfeeding. I tried using the boppy, but that pillow drops off near your body and the baby just falls into the crevasse. The brestfriend pillow is big, ugly, and has a stupid name, but it is a highly effective tool in supporting your baby while you nurse, and I am so glad that I have one!I like that it clips around you so that it doesn't shift around. I like that it offers back support. I like that it keeps your baby high and close to your body. It took the strain off of my neck, back, and wrist when I was learning to breast-feed. Honestly, nursing is awkward enough as it is when you're just getting started. It makes it worlds easier to be able to lay the baby along your body on this pillow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boppy Would Be Better","review":"I purchased the Breast Friend over the standard Boppy thinking it was better designed to support the newborn during breastfeeding. I do think this is true but it has some major issues that make me wish I had just stuck to the standard Boppy. It is made of hard Styrofoam with makes it difficult to sit in chairs with arms while you nurse. You have to wrap it around you (there is no place to put that back support if you do not) which just digs into your back if you are sitting in a chair and leaning back at all. When you stand up, you have this thing clinging to you and no hands free to remove it (forget trying to get it off without waking the baby) which is a hassle too. Finally, it is not as versatile as a Boppy. It might work for some, but I just ended up using pillow(s) instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE this pillow!","review":"I bought this as a gift for a friend of mine. I just this breastfeeding pillow with three kids and could not have survived without it. It truly helps position the baby properly and provides comfort for both baby and mom. The Lactation Center at the Hospital recommended it and I'm glad they did! Colors and patterns are cute and tasteful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wearable Furniture","review":"While this isn't the most exciting thing to wear, it works perfect! It stays in place, supports the baby, and does everything you'd need it to. We've had to take the cover off to wash it a few times now, and there is no indication that it's wearing out. The foam is very firm, and feels like it'll hold up through our \\"brest\\" feeding years. It might not be my best friend or most fashionable accessory, but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for the Breastfeeding Mom!","review":"Wish I had one of these with my first two! I used a Boppy with my first two children but purchased this pillow when I was having breastfeeding difficulties with my third. I was impressed beyond belief! The way it clicks into place is ingenious. The pillow is not constantly sliding off like the Boppy does. This pillow offers support to the back and also helps support the baby helping keep his latch. This helped tremendously and if it were not for this pillow, I might have quit breastfeeding. I also like how the cover is washable.I only needed to use it for a month. Once the baby was bigger and were were breastfeeding effectively, I no longer needed the pillow. So, I would recommend trying not to spend too much money on it. But honestly, it was worth every penny!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells like Glue!","review":"I loved the concept of the pillow and how it made a level surface for nursing. However, the pillow smelled like industrial glue. Even after airing it out for a day it still smelled like glue. I have to return the pillow. When I took the cover off to air it out, I noticed that each of the pieces had been glued together. I am trying to find a similar option without the glue smell because I liked it better than the boppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Brest Friend","review":"I started out with the boppy, but was frustrated when it would always slide forward, and also didn't offer much support, particularly since I am taller. I was always leaning over and having to push it back towards my body. Then I tried the brest friend at my lactation consultant's, and it was so much better!! It stays in place due to being strapped around your back, and is firmer and thicker so baby sits up higher and is in a better position for nursing. It also really helps to nurse baby hands-free, and is helpful for doing other things while baby is nursing, like eating dinner or folding laundry when baby won't let you put him down at all! I would definitely recommend any nursing mom to start with this and skip the boppy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little helper","review":"I find this pillow to be a great helper. It's comfortable and firm, easily supporting my 11 lb 1 month old. I do find it a bit annoying to have to strap it on each time but that is what makes it so supportive. I also have the Boppy and of the two this one is better for breast feeding support while the Boppy is better for ease of use (no need to strap on the Boppy). This is a great help and I would recommend it, especially to first time moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeding made easier","review":"Highly recommend.

The strap also provides back & lumbar support. The pocket is a nice touch (you put your Lansinoh, cell phone, baby nail clippers, etc in it) The only possible downside is it isn't that easy to put on with one hand (for example, if you are already cradling the baby)If you're price sensitive look around, there are often significant discounts for older colors.If you've found this review helpful, please let me know!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boppy was much better for me","review":"I've been breastfeeding for 6 months now and had both the My Brest Friend(MBF) and the Boppy. I preferred the Boppy much more and here's why:-Boppy is easier to use. I just grab the Boppy and and throw it around my waist instead of fumbling with a strap on the MBF and getting it clicked in.-Boppy is more comfortable. That piece that goes around your back on the MBF is just uncomfortable to me. The Boppy just seemed much more soft and comfy for baby too.-Boppy is multi purpose. I sat on it when my bottom hurt after childbirth, used it as a place to set the baby, and used it for every nursing session.-Boppy feels better made. The My Best Friend just felt cheap to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"I had one of these with my firstborn son but wanted a different print for my soon to be daughter.

I like everything about this pillow, its firm and sturdy ..good for baby's back. I sometime leave the baby sleeping on her side ( pref left) for about 5 minutes after feeding so that it helps the baby in digestion, i would have not been to that with other softer pillows. The back support is excellent, makes it easy for me to maintain the posture while breastfeeding.Am happy with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have!","review":"I didn't have a nursing pillow during the first two weeks of my new daughter's life. The pillow I used in the hospital nursery room was a discouragement. I almost thought I didn't need a breastfeeding pillow at all but my husband helped me research for a good one and we bought a Brestfriend. It relieved my back, freed up my hands, made the baby calm and comfortable and it looks absolutely lovely! I use it all the time. I agree with the previous reviewers that the slip cover is a little hard to put back on once washed but I can live with that since this is such a great product.

Part 1 is slightly more of an homage than a spoof, although there's plenty of that too, while Part 2 is where things really get crazy.The cast of characters is surprisingly extensive, but none are really neglected and all mesh together fairly well.

But I would like to underline what a previous (3-star rating) reviewer pointed out. The launch sequence has to be considered one of the most powerful, riveting, and exhilarating sequences in the history of film. This is so from both an artistic and intellectual perspective. The gradual, extended, relentless buildup to the actual launch has an epic quality which is perhaps unmatched in science fiction films, and which manages to convey--through the imaginative force of its artistry--the strangeness and wonder of the event almost more vividly than what we experienced at the time of the actual moon landing just four decades after the film was made. This creative leap of the imagination is all that science fiction can hope to be--as the opening motto states: 'Never' does not exist for the human mind...only 'Not Yet.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"simply irresistible","review":"forty yrs ago i bought the complete book of mexican cooking by elizabeth lambert ortiz and thought that was the sum total of authentic mexican cuisine. it was full of the recipes that i knew growing up so i felt very comfortable with them. however, over the yrs i came to realize that there was much much more to mexican cooking and that the different regions of mexico have their own recipes, their own cuisine. during a book search i found zarela's book which delves into the cuisine of veracruz. i read the whole book and loved it. soon i found myself getting more and more into the wonderful line-up of fantastic dishes. not one recipe has disappointed me or my family and i'm not done yet.in addition to irresistible recipes, i like stories in a cookbook such as this and also some good tips, hints and sources. this book does all of that and then some. buen provecho!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP!!!!!","review":"$150.00 for COMPLETE PLASTIC!!!

It was just a 50/50 chance really because I don't mind either flavors when it comes to protein shakes. Considering I require higher amounts of protein, I use at least 2-3 scoops, making the flavor a bit more bold... and more like a \\"shake\\". Now you are thinking... how does that work with lemon-aid? And you would be right... after a while it becomes kind of nasty to drink.

Absolutely yummy, makes me look forward to my protein drink. The cappuccino flavor is good, apple is too sweet (and believe me, I love sweet, but it's just not tasty). The strawberry kiwi is OK; have not tried others. Mixes easily with water, but if you put it in a blender let it sit awhile to get the foam down. Otherwise you end up swallowing air and after bypass, you don't want that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crystal Sky -- a pantry staple","review":"I spent a small fortune buying sample sizes of all the different \\"fruit juice consistency\\" protein powders I could find. Everyone raves about Nectar (Fuzzy Naval & Roadside Lemonade in particular - both of which I detest). But most of the flavors I could only barely tolerate -- and I've tried them all. I ended up mixing the majority with real fruit juice or diet drink mix (4C Totally Light) to make them palatable. This flavor is the exception! Granted, it is no Kool-Aid, but the taste is actually similar to the Berry Blue Kool-Aid I remember as a kid. It is a sweet & fruity drink of the fruit punch variety. And man is it BLUE! I poured the powder into a bottled water & shook the heck out of it. It mixed up without any clumps. I'll definitely be ordering more of the Nectar Crystal Sky, but there's not a single other Nectar flavor that I'd buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"Everything we expected.

More than anything, though, the book needs proofing; for example, Figure 4.20 supposedly shows the \\"Add Layer Mask\\" button location, but, in fact, what's shown is the \\"Add New Layer\\" button.

Lubenow presents the scientific methods and political and social pressures (including racism) that influence researchers as they examine and interpret the fossil record, morphology, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and the historical records of paleontology to understand how modern day humans came to exist on this planet. Most of all, unlike many authors, Lubenow presents the information with respect for those on both sides of the Evolutionist/Creationist debate. Evolutionists and Creationists alike should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Evolutionists had it coming!","review":"This book is very informing. I recommend this book to anyone who has a vested interest in the subject of origins. If you are a creationist, this book will strengthen your faith in God. If you are an atheistic evolutionist, it will leave you shaking in your boots(If you are honest)! One thing that I wish the author would have dealt with more is on the KNM-ER 1813 fossil.

I am continually amazed at the misinformation so many insist upon spreading about science, especially evolutionary biology. It horrifies me that a book like this can be published and treated as if it has any scientific validity whatsoever. \\"Scientific\\" creationsim is not science, it is merely thinly veiled religious dogma. This book distorts the writings of real scientists to support its beliefs and ignores scientific evidence when it does not suit the author's purpose. This book is fundamentalist Christianity disguised in scientific clothing for ulterior religious motives. As a Christian, and a scientist, I hope that everyone who reads this book will read it with St. Thomas Aquinas' words in mind, \\"The truth of our faith becomes a matter of ridicule among the infidels if any Christian, not gifted with the necessary scientific learning, presents as dogma what scientific scrutiny shows to be false.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Just the FACTS ma'am","review":"Wow! Anyone who thinks scientists are only interested in the facts without bias should read this book. Lubenow challeges evolutionist to put all the known 'hominid' fossils with their taxons and 'age' (data from evolutionists themselves) into a chart. The result is 'Fossil Failure on a Grand Scale'. Appartently evolutionist have not produced such a chart because of all the conflicting data. The physical evidence speaks louder than words."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bones of Contention","review":"This book is disordered, flawed, and highly irritating to read. When the author uses the evidence that various subspecies of a common ancestor coexist to \\"prove\\" humans did not descend from primates, it is painfully evident, that Ludenow has no grasp whatsoever of how the evolutionary process works. It is unfortunate that pseudoscience like this creeps into the public consciousness as proven fact. Ludenow has never provided any technical evidence or papers for peer review. This really should be considered a religious book. How depressing that this drivel parades as hard science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad Science","review":"I grew up with this perspective, was taught it in school, and finally rejected when I discovered: 1.) the dishonesty in the \\"smoke and mirrors\\" affect imployeed by creationists' dealing with the facts 2.) the lack of even anything like adequate credentials by such authors 3.) the overwhelming and sheer MASS of data confirming evolution (all but ignored) and the scientific intergrity of its method contra creationists' claims. I myself am a theistic evolutionist (of the \\"Robust Formational Economy Principle\\" persuasion). However, had I not had a quite mature faith in, and experience of, God's grace before discovering these things, I would have certainly become an atheist or agnostic through reading creationist literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the credentials?","review":"Hmm, you'd think for such a paradigm breaking book Lubenow would have the credentials necessary for this critical analysis. No, Ph.D. in anthropology (or even in the biological sciences for that matter), no published peer-reviewed journal articles dealing with the issue at hand. If he's so correct in this, why didn't he ever submit his work to the scientific journals (where REAL science is done afterall)?

Although much work has been done to advance the model since this work was published it is still an important beginning point.Despite attempts by annoyed or frantic evolutionists to pooh-pooh this work it is filled with valuable information. I would urge evolutionists to try with a straight face to study evolutionary literature and show how it accords with the evidence Lubenow points out. Evolutionary theory can best be described as fighting the evidence, not flowing with it. If this is not the case, why do evolutionists avoid \\"big picture\\" analyses like the one Lubenow has performed that survey ALL the accepted evidence and chart it together? Why are they so selective even within their own camps and factions?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"What an insult to science....How could this have even been published?

Perhaps if he actually attempted to understand evolution without letting his religion get in the way, he might be able to be a competant author. Why do creationists have such need to preach to their own choir? Could it be that deep down they know their religion is merely mythology?

This story did nothing for me. I didn't like Zoe very much, she was kind of hard to understand. I understood that she loved Sam and wanted her to be part of the family but she was very shady with Ryan in my opinion and from how far I read didn't always respect Ryan's feelings for his niece. She kind of threw her close relationship with Sam in his face all the time. And Ryan started out good but the social worker mix-up which wasn't really his fault kept being brought back up by Zoe and his angry moods and stodgy attitude turned me off. It was too boring to actually finish reading it. Maybe it redeemed itself in the end for other readers.

The tap on the jar is a great addition, but my favorite feature is the stir stick that is essential to making a successful smoothie or frozen concoction. This feature alone precludes the need to stop blending and scraping the jar to mix up the contents. The jar has measuring marks for adding ingredients in the correct proportions to make a very successful smoothie or frozen cocktail. The design of this item is excellent and the construction is robust, as evidenced by the fact that it has held up for over six months after daily use and daily cleaning.

Frommer's Prague is incredibly innaccurate and is full of errors. To name a few, the times it lists for castles is incorrect as well as the location of several tourist spots. The guide assumes the train drops one off at the site, when it can lead one several towns astray from the actual location. Furthermore, in terms of times to destinations that guide makes it seem that only a few hours are necessary when one could spend an entire day getting to only one spot. This especially is true for Karstejn Castle and Krivoklat. Please make sure to print maps off the computer before you depend on this book (the book also lacks a great number of necessary maps for tourist spots). Prague and the Czech Republic are not difficult to navigate, but without a good guidebook with maps and relevant information, days and hours are wasted wandering, which leads to ruined adventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely difficult to handle though interesting.","review":"Book is too massive to hold while reading.

For example feeder cattle: in their statistic they published 2 trades with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book they published zero! For example lean hog: in their statistic: 9 trade-opportunities with a winning chance of 100 %. In this book: only 2! They filled this book with 80 % chances. I don\`t know, why they have hidden the higher chances?! Somehow I have the impression, this company don't want to tell us the trades with the highest probability.

Awarded by Billboard as an \\"Outstanding Children's Recording\\", this timeless work has proven to be one of the best musical stories for kids. The delightful production stars the lovable character, Ramo, a young elephant who is treated as an outcast by the other animal children of the jungle. The recording masterfully includes all the audio tools to effectively captivate young audiences, with it's terrific blend of music, narrative, sound effects and vocals. A story that is so sensitively written, all ages will be enthralled by Ramo's trials and triumphs. After three decades of popularity, Ramo the Elephant has certainly earned it's place among the children's classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says: - Nothing serious.

Great!The same uptempo swinging tracks and slowdown ballads with a samba track (what a delight!)which have marked Hargrove's Jazz albums.A great 2006 surprise to celebrate Hargrove's return to his roots after a long time trying new ways, boring ways.By the way, this is the true 'new way' for Hargrove: brand-new and creative compositions by members of the group, one by Hargrove, an inspired 'Day in Vienna' by Slide Hampton plus one only standard, the great Bronislau Kaper's 'Invitation' from the self-titled movie picture.

The quality of the recording was great - it was band music that sounded like it was played in a concert hall. But the choice of songs was questionable. What do \\"selections from South Pacific\\" have to do with \\"uncommon valor\\" or the Marines? \\"Eternal Father Strong to Save\\" was sullen where it should have evoked more emotion. The first track, the armed forces medley, was upbeat, but I would have preferred if I heard each song in its entirety on its own. The last track (the Marine Corps Hymn) should be the best, the loudest, the strongest, the most ebullient. Instead, it was somber and slow and a \\"different\\" interpretation of a rousing song that seemed to be done just for the sake of being different.

All given unbelievable, over the top, characterizations. The usual boring traits you can look inside or across the street and see.

This'll prevent the liquid from boiling away too quickly. You won't have to refill it during the smoking, and it'll prevent the smoker from getting too \\"wet\\" inside. When I left it uncovered, I was getting steamed meat, not smoked.2) Drill a hole in the bottom of the unit, and get a drip pan underneath it.

Heavy, but the suction powewr was great. We have three cats and one dog so we needed a vacuum that had the kind of power offered by the wind tunnel. Unfortunatly the vacuum only lasted one month longer than our warranty. We are told the repair costs are very high and not worth the fixing. Our repair man stated that the vaccumm has a very poor design and would be back in his shop within one year, he futher stated \\"save your money and get a different vaccum\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, poor execution","review":"It is HEAVY. I'm not a small man, and it is a pain to vacuum a 2-story carpeted house. In addition, the combination of height adjustment and drive system seems to work badly. The beater brush stalls in thick (but short) plush carpeting, making an already unwieldy machine very hard to get off dead center. The net effect is that the drive belts squeal and smell of burning rubber in a way that reminded me of my sons' early driving days. The suction is great, and the hand-held attachment is the only useful stair device I've seen (but only when combined with the accessory extension hose). Next time I'll opt for the British R2D2 look-alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Belt continues to fall off","review":"I just bought this vacuum's sister, U6432-900.

How Hoover deemed this product acceptable to sell is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"happy until today","review":"I purchased the original self-propelled Wind Tunnel about 2 years ago. I must say that I was thrilled with the power and ease of operation. I have cats and this vacuum cleaner was great at picking up cat hair. However, today, the motor burned up. At this price, I certainly expected it to last much, much longer than 2 years. (And I must say that I am NOT a frequent vacuumer!!) I took it to a repair shop and the man pointed to 4 (out of 10 or 12) Wind Tunnels waiting for repair or pick-up...I haven't decided yet whether to repair or put it down to a bad decision and buy something else. But I am very disappointed in my Hoover experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this product","review":"Bottom line: don't buy this product.We got our Hoover WindTunnel in early September. Used it, twice a week, nothing dramatic. Within one month of purchase, a belt broke. Bought a belt at the Hoover center, fixed it.One month later, the whole machine imploded. Too big to fix on our own. When we took it in, a guy there, shopping for a vacuum, told us that WITHIN THE HOUR he was in the Hoover store, two other customers came in with the WindTunnel and the same problem! He promptly left.Would that we were so lucky. It's been two weeks, and I'm still without a vacuum cleaner. I don't hold out much hope that will change when I get the WindTunnel back. So, four months after we spent three hundred dollars on a brand new vacuum cleaner, we're buying yet another one. Different brand.An incredible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start, but burned out quickly","review":"My husband and I purchased our Wind Tunnel less than a year ago. We were thrilled when it picked up pet hair so easily! Last week we weren't thrilled when the motor \\"burned\\" out and our local repair shop said that we may as well get a new vacuum due to the cost of a new motor. The Wind Tunnel isn't exactly an inexpensive vacuum, and for the money we spent we expected it to last longer than 10 months. I wonder if the raters from the consumer magazines that have recommended this vacuum have tried to use it for a longer period of time? We won't ever buy a Wind Tunnel again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many problems","review":"I have only had this vacuum for about 9 months, and have had a number of problems with it.

I am certain it wouldn't have been a Hoover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the money...","review":"...Five weeks ago, I bought the Windtunnel Premium, and my life changed. I stopped thinking about the money and stared in awe as it rejuvenated our tired carpet, sucking out nearly a bag full of dirt in its first go round. Seriously, my wife's allergies have almost disappeared.The model I purchased was the premium model, which is nearly identical to the ultra model, except it includes an extra long hose, which is essential for those hard to reach crannies (the ultra model does not come with the extra long hose)...Bottom Line: This is top-rated in Consumer Reports for a reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with ease of use and durability","review":"I've only had my WindTunnel for 3 months. We purchased it based on the high ratings it has received. Unfortunately, we've found that the tools are very difficult to use due to the short, stiff hose. It takes two hands to manage the hose/tools and prevent them from pulling apart. In the meantime, the vacuum tips over very easily as you try to manage the hose/tools. The very first time it tipped over the release lever broke. We now have to bring it in to be repaired. Who knows how many more times this will happen or what will break next. I'm very disappointed with the ease of use and durability of this product considering the price Hoover charges for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HATE THIS THING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Sure it vaccuums just great but the belt breaks so frequently and I have to take the whole vaccuum apart to get to the belt- this takes FOREVER. Then it is hard as hell to put the cover back on. It took me 4 hours and I'll still not done. Hoover has not made it easy or simple to replace the belt and also the roller mechanism that adjusts the vaccuum higher / lower off the floor is a pain in the neck to put back on. It is SOOO FRUSTRATING! ARGHHHH! If it takes too long or you have a hard time putting the vaccum together, return it! Do a test run, try replacing the belt and if this takes more than 5 minutes, RETURN IT! I suggest: STAY AWAY FROM HOOVERS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Hoover like it avoids dirt.","review":"This is one sad machine. If you want constant head aches this is the machine for you.

Hoover was a name I grew up with and trusted.

I also wish the attachment hose had a little more flex in it so I didn't have to hold the vacuum on the stairs and use my other hand to actually vacuum them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Be Fooled!","review":"I have had 2 Hoover vacuum cleaners. Before my Self Propelled Windtunnel, I had a Self-Propelled Breathe Easy. Each vacuum cleaner had a lifespan of 2 years! My mother's Self Propelled Eureka works far better and she's had it far longer than I had my Hoovers. I recently bought a Bissell Bagless vacuum. It's so much cheaper and easier to use, especially if you are a petite person.Pushing each of my Hoovers felt like driving a bus, despite them both being self-propelled. The belts broke, the hard floor/carpet lever broke within days after purchasing my Windtunnel, and the door in which the attachments were encased broke off shortly after I purchased it. The Self Propelled Windtunnel has great suction power, but my Bissell works just as well. If you buy this vacuum cleaner, don't expect it to have a long life.

Now mind you, my house is only 1600 sq ft, and half of that space is wood flooring, so I don't have an excessive amount of carpet. Nor do I vacuum excessively. Maybe once a week.

This was regular, everyday carpet with light dirt--not on individual rugs with fringe or other items that typically damage a vacuum. It cost me $100 to repair. After that it required two more spendy repairs and I finally stopped using it.The depressing thing was that the repair shop owners (I went to two places) both had a good laugh when I brought it in.

Even though I have had to purchase a new box every year due to the old box wearing out (with only one cat), I have always been happy with it- until I purchased this model TWICE! I bought this 2 weeks ago and within one day of turning it on it decides to stop working right. The rake goes back and forth non-stop. My cat even urinated on the couch because he couldn't get in the box. I contacted the company who said it was because I had too much litter but that was not the case. The litter was an inch below the litter line and it hadn't been used yet.I returned it and purchased another one and the same thing happened. I did some research and found other complaints the same as mine. After this and on top of having to purchase a new one every year, I won't be buying another one."},{"rating":"2","title":"As easy as it gets","review":"This unit has flaws, like any unit will, but the benefits out way them. The motor is somewhat noisy, but we keep it in our laundry room with the door closed so it's not as bad. We actually tried going with a silent one that spins and it didn't work as well at all.With this one, the claws clean out all major clumps, so its great for one (or multiple cats -- we have 3). You just have to make sure to check it every day to every other day to make sure there aren't little pieces that got through.Some people say the replacement bins are expensive -- they are. Just use small trash bags and line the inside, and keep re-using them. I haven't had to buy any replacements at all. This litter box also keeps the room its in smelling nice - you can't tell you have cats in your home.

Then it started to fling stuff onto the floor. Then it jammed because the crud built up. My dad called the manufacturer, and they told us to change the litter, though the litter we were using was perfectly OK. It seemed to help for about ten minutes. Then it went right back to jamming and flinging. Worse, the motor went wonky after a few days and wouldn't stop. We would've cleaned it up and demanded our money back, but my dad got sick right about then, and by the time he was feeling up to it, it was too late to return it. So buy this only at your peril.Oh, also, if you leave the thing on automatic and are using battery power, the batteries will be drained in a few days.

When it tried to scoop my cat's urine clump, you could hear it in the other room. The motor seemed like it was crying. It ended up breaking several of the tongues or teeth or whatever you call them off. It was more work than a regular litter box. The lid wouldn't close over the litter it \\"did\\" scoop and I was having to check it after every time it was used so it wouldn't try to run all night long.I'd rather have a loud motor that actually cleaned the box as to a quiet motor that knocked all night long.

It is as if Littermaid tried to design a product to expose you to as much used cat litter as possible. The rake almost always clumps up with wet clay and cat waste, so you have to manually pic the rake clean and scoop out the box. On the rare occasion the rake doesnt clog, some of the used litter misses the recepticle all together and is dumped on the floor. For the price of the recepticles, which you will need to change every few days, you could buy a silver plated cat box after a few months.

While you dont have to scoop the litter the liter does get wet and clumps and sticks to the tray. The you have to clean the tray which is even more work then just scooping. I have to get gloves to clean it. Its nasty. The poop gets stuck in between the rakes and it gets messy underneath the liter box. They keep coming up with all these automatic litter boxes. One is always suppose to be better with the other but I know that every liter box has its flaw(s). To be honest Id rather go back to scooping. Does anybody agree?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This won't save you any work","review":"If you have a picky cat that will do his business elsewhere if you don't get to the litterbox immediately after it's used, this is the product for you.However, if you think this is going to save you any work, think again. Little crusties do indeed stick to the bottom of the pan because the automatic rake doesn't touch the bottom. It has to be continually scraped to clean it. Worse is the rake itself, which gets clogged with poop and cat litter. Really look at the picture and think how you would like to clean poop from between all those tines on the rake. The rake also pushes the sand everywhere into all those open nooks and crannies. It also falls down the thin line between receptacle and the unit. For this reason I myself would recommend the tent (unless you build one yourself) even though it is overpriced.Now that my unit has stopped working after 2 years,I am thankfully going back to the simplicity of a regular cat box that doesn't take me 30+ minutes to clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the idea, hate the hassle","review":"Ok, I'll admit that it is great not having to worry about scooping, and once I empty the tray, the house no longer smells like cat poop, BUT:The thing jams constantly.

This usually happens at night, or an hour before I have to wake up.Clumps stick to the bottom. I use Tidy Cats, and it still clumps. Actually, the best brand was the walmart generic.

It even wakes us up at night! In addition, when it cleans the box, it dumps a small amount of litter out on the floor each time (the loose litter that surrounds the clumps and falls over the edge of the waste container in the process) so over the course of a short time, I end up with litter all over my floor.I am surprised to also say that without a cover (which can be bought separately but costs half the price of the box itself), the smell is much worse than my old, cheap litter box that had a cover with it.If I thought you could return a used litter box for credit, I would.

The excitement, however, wore off when the cat stopped using the box and instead used the basement floor directly in front of the box. Our cat is somewhat large, so it is possible that he just felt too cramped or it is possible he was scared of the electric mechanism.Another problem we had is that the used litter and cat waste tends to get stuck to the plastic tines that scoop the litter as well as other parts of the box, including the floor of the pan. This despite the fact that we use a high quality scoopable litter (Tidy Cat) and is very disgusting and very hard to clean.

Unfortunately this is not the case. After a year of use, the motor assembly has broken and upon further inspection a small plastic piece was the culprit. Seems the entire assembly rests on two small plastic pieces that hang onto the frame. This is obviously a crucial part that is meant to break over time, just so the customer can purchase another. The motor is too flimsy and weak and should have been upgraded. Until they make something better I guess we are destined to endure its poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned It","review":"I had to return this machine in just a few weeks, Amazon was terrific, I printed out the label and got my refund asap.

I made sure the sensors were clean but that didn't correct the problem, neither did turning the switch off and on several times.So next I tried looking on LitterMaid's website for help but found nothing for this problem.

If you fill it slightly above the red line that says \\"add litter\\", the rake will not go all the way through its cycle. If you have even slightly less than the line, the urine clumps in a shallow pool to the bottom of the box, which cause a line of clumped gunky litter that the rake cannot get through. Not to mention having to touch the dirty waste receptacle to empty it. It is also very difficult to clean.I cannot wait for my Litter Robot to arrive next week...will be manually scooping from the broken Littermaid until then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This product is amazing. I had the same one except it was a little bigger. I have two cats and they still use it everyday ;) It is a bit smaller, but the cats don't notice and it doesn't effect me if it doesn't effect them! Great product and definitely a great buy! It has even come down in price from a few years ago!"},{"rating":"1","title":"In need of product quality improvement","review":"When functioning properly, this is a great product, however and unfortunately, the Litter Maids have mechanical/electrical flaws. Over the past 4 to 5 years, I have bought several Litter Maids (have several Kitties) and five of the units have failed. Of the last two I purchased (within the last 4 weeks) one of these has already failed. The rake will not go into park...will not stop. Thus the unit is of no use. These units have been on the market for several years. Surely they could have made the necessary quality improvements by now.

Kudos to the reviewer who mentioned the fix about placing a cupboard rubber stop below the toggle switch. Worked like a charm. Our unit worked ok for one day before it started running non-stop. When it works, it's wonderful. Hopefully it will last now.*Update:Well after a week of messing with the cupboard stops (still a good idea if I could get it to be consistent), I gave up and had to return it. It would work for a day, then would only go half way and stop at the receptacle or begin to run continuously again. My old one lasted 5 years. I'm disappointed with the newer models. Not made as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money! Stops working after a few months!","review":"Mine lasted only 4 months. What a waste of money! And the rake kept getting messy. Even if I only put a small amount of litter in, the cat would scrape it up at the back and cause the rake to keep running. Luckily I was always home to adjust the litter. Plus I still ended up scraping the front and bottom to get what the rake couldn't. The rake would break up the clumps and leave a mess for me to sift out. More work than ordinary litter box.

Honestly, Im using it because she would ask where it was if I went back to my sifting pan. My issues with this include: The motor is not strong enough to move the litter (its plenty loud, though); the collection trays are weak and break all the time; its IMPOSSIBLE to clean, unless you want to spend all day on it; it requires the most expensive litter on the market; The cover for the collection trays doesnt fit properly, meaning the smell can get out ...

In reality it's a mess.The first couple of passes of the rake are fairly impressive. However, after a few days of operation, you'll notice that the rake gets clogged with \\"the stuff\\". It's also prone to smearing \\"the stuff\\" on itself along the sides. A COMPLETE DISASTER TO CLEAN. After tolerating it for several months, I finally put the whole thing in the trash.I also found it to be too small for our cats. An adult cat is just to large for it, which is probably why the smeared \\"stuff\\" occurs. This thing might work okay for kittens. Forget it for adult cats. And because kittens grow into adults, just forget it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the Product, but...","review":"This is a lifesaver!

Great disappointment","review":"This was a great disappointment and a real waste of money. First, the rake is always jammed. We followed instructions and coated it with silicone spray, but it made NO difference. Once the rake gets clogged, dirty litter gets sprayed all over the floor when the unit trys to empty the tray. We tried everything to make this product work. We used 3 types of premium clumping litter, yet end up cleaning the pan by hand frequently each day. The rake needs to be cleaned everyday in order to keep the unit working. The end result is more dirty litter sprayed on the floor and more daily work than our old non-automated (hand cleaned) litter box. I'm cleaning this one today, and putting it on the pile of stuff to be sold at our next garage sell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bigger piece of garbage than what it is scooping","review":"This is an awful product. I have read the reviews saying to buy the \\"bigger, better\\" model but this is such a piece of junk I wouldn't buy anything else from this company. I got this thinking it would be great and what a hassle.I used the most expensive, premium scooping litter I could find and it still got stuck in the \\"rake\\". When the rake if full of litter and \\"stuff\\" it becomes a shovel. When the shovel is pushing the whole box of litter towards the end it can't make it and so it backs up and tries again, and again, and again...This is a great concept and I am looking forward to finding one that works someday but it won't be from this company.Fool me once, shame on you... fool me twice shame on me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Annoying","review":"This is the most annoying machine. If you overfill, even a tiny bit, the rake will go back and forth until you want to throw it out the window. If you put too little litter, then the bottom is filled with urine and sticks to the rake. They really need to fix this problem. They need to make it so that you can put enough litter in to actually fill the box and keep urine off the bottom and for the rake to not be so incredibly sensitive. Until they come up with a better one, for us this is just going to be an overpriced litter box."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm scooping by hand again <sigh>","review":"My comments are about the LM700. I have one cat, male, and I'll grant you that he's messy.But this unit was a monumental disappointment. I found it to be a lot of work to keep working well. But I stuck with it, because I was enamored of the idea. But the list of shortcomings is a long one, the most endearing of which was flinging urine-laden clods of litter against the wall. That was when it was actually able to drag it out of the box. Much of the time, the motor wasn't strong enough to finish the job. It got stuck trying.Still... I'd have stuck with it. But the electric eye died after only about 3 months, so I had to run it manually. But that worked only I was right there when he did his job. Otherwise, the motor was not strong enough to move it once it turned to concrete.I finally had to throw the thing out. I'd love to see an improved solution, but I won't be buying another one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking in Strength and poorly put together.","review":"In our household we have both the LM500 and the LM900. Don't even bother with the LM500!!! It is too weak to scoop the refuse out correctly and ,on ours, the rake hit a binding point at the end and would then 'catapult\\" the refuse out of the box. The LM500 didn't last 6 months for us and it sounded like it was on it's last leg everyday.If you are looking at the LitterMaid automated litter boxes, pass by the LM500 and go directly to the LM900. The 900 is larger, stronger, and just plain better."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST LITTER BOX","review":"I have had a Litter Maid for about 7 years with my 2 big cats. I have a Himalayian and a Main Coon. I have not scopped litter in 7 years, its great.

I am on my third one, the motor started to get weak on the first and the little eye went on the second. BUT I love it so much I bought a third!

I bought one of the recommended brands for litter, but filled the bin about 1/2 inch over the \\"full\\" line. Because of this, the rake didn't have enough power to do its job and couldn't \\"push\\" the waste into the receptacle. Once the litter was reduced to the \\"full\\" line(or below the full line), it's been working as it should. As some people have said, it's quite noisy when working. Mine's close to my bedroom and has woken me up a few times in the middle of the night.

Finally, about a year ago it started to leak. I would have put up with it, except it leaked a black-brownish liquid which would not subsequetly wash off the clothes. It does not leak continuously, but it would leak at least 3-4 times during a 30 minutes ironing session.

I am not sure what went bad but I am disappointed by the experience.I also just noticed that I am out of the return window that Amazon mentions, so could not even send this back.PS: After looking around carefully, there seems to be a small black switch on the underside of the top panel. In my case that switch looks faulty. I can make the motor run if I use a pen to press that switch, but it doesn't work in its own supplied Jar making the purchase useless now.Best,Ujjwal"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy chopper","review":"I used this chopper for carrots and celery, and its good only if you want mush and a few chunks in your salad.

The only thing I regret is not buying it sooner!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good chopper poor construction","review":"I purchased this item after reading all the great reviews. Most reviewers said it worked great and it does. It is far superior to many small choppers I have used in the past. It is a little awkward to load and foods like nuts and garlic can get lodged under the blade as they are loaded making it hard to attach the top lid, which houses the motor. While the chopper works great the bowl is cheaply made and the post that holds the blade started cracking after less than a dozen uses. The chopper is now useless and since Black and Decker does not really make the product (they sold the name) a replacement part has so far eluded me. I thought I was buying Black and Decker product, I now see that quality was for sale as well as their name. A shame. I can't recommend buying this cheaply made chopper if you intend to chop anything more than herbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed and returning mine","review":"I make lots of soups and got this to chop vegetables.I wanted something that will really chop vegetables into uniform sizes. This doesnt really \\"chop\\" vegetables though.For an onion it minced half of it and the other half was still in big chunks. So I had more of an onion paste with big unchopped onion chunks in it.It was the same result for celery.It didn't chop carrots at all, just had big cut marks in it. I had to still do those by hand.Also its a bit small. 1 big onion fills it up. Returning mine to get something bigger and more precise."},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven results","review":"This does a pretty good job on onions, although you have to chop them pretty small if you dont want some large pieces left. On other vegetables you will have a mixture of large and tiny pieces unless you chop them all into a mush of very tiny pieces. I am keeping it to use on onions but for other vegetables I'm am going back to hand chopping. Ive used it on onions, bell peppers, eggplant and mushrooms. It does clean up easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for price, a little hard to really get clean","review":"as others have commented, the top part is the motor, and while the food you are chopping will stick to the bottom of the top part, you can't immerse the top part in hot, soapy water or you might electrocute yourself. All you can do is sponge clean the top part.I've had the chopper for almost two years, it works well.

I've always used it, but not regularly. As time passes, I have used it for more and more things. I think I forget about it sitting on the shelf and chop onions, parsley, etc.. myself. The only thing that it won't do, is make small, even, bread crumbs from fresh bread. What it makes is good enough to use in recipes for filler. Last night when I was washing it in the sink, I put the blade into the base with the soap. Somehow it got twisted and the blade lodged into the sides and refused to budge. My husband worked on it for sometime, and finally removed the blade, leaving deep gouges in the plastic container. Aside from the 'scars', it works fine and I've promised myself that I will use it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better then slap chop","review":"slap chop is all one part making it impossible to clean. this item disassembles fully in order to put in the dishwasher to clear. also item works perfectly as intended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny!!","review":"This is a small but powerful item.

You can't really clean it well because, well you can't submerge the electric motor.-When you lift the top cover (with the electric motor) and place on the counter, the drippings from your creation spill from the cover.Anyway I'm pretty dissatisfied because of the above issues (used to be a product manager and this stuff show's that whoever designed it didn't think the whole process through) and I'm looking for another chopping solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"chopper","review":"I had wanted this for a long time and when I got it I was very disappointed. it chops great. but the top does not go in the water. so I never feel that I have cleaned it.

It also cleans up easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"functional deficiencies","review":"Pros - perfect size, simple to use, quiet, effective choppingCons -1) After my third use (total motor time perhaps 60 seconds and hand washed between uses), a hairline crack developed in the cup/base where a metal pin is molded into the plastic cup. I think this is a function of design and is unlikely just a freak manufacturing defect.2) The chopper is intended for use with liquids (it even has a liquid line on the cup/base), but with the least amount of liquid, it splashes up on the underside of the motor unit. This is very hard to clean. There is a little contact switch so that the motor won't turn if not seated on the base properly. Food/liquid always ends up there and in the drive shaft. The motor unit is not sealed underneath, so you can't rinse or immerse this.I don't have experience with any other unit, so I can't say what is better. But my suggestion is save your money and keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite things in a kitchen","review":"This is a second time I bought EHC650 Ergo 3-Cup Food Chopper.I used first one at least twice a week for 2 years and loved it.I gave it four stars because there was a problemwith a plastic bowl.First, hairline cracks appeared on a bottom, then cracks become deeper and wider, and then, stem on the bottom of the bowl was disconnected from the bowl and stuck (forever) inside lower plastic portion of the blade.Since becoming so addicted to using that chopper, I had to buy another one.I hope it will last at least as long as my old one.It worth the money because it really does a good job, convenient to use, looks very cute.I wish Black&Decker; would make some improvements to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"breeding ground for germs","review":"I read all these reviews and decided to buy this chopper.I have absolutely no complaints about performance.It chops and purees most things.I also like the way it handles.

I also picked out all the particles with a toothpick. Then I would wash it in hot water and soap.

The blade (at least on ours) starts very slowly and takes a couple of seconds to get up to speed. Thus almonds (only 1/4 cup, shelled of course) were bulky enough to make sure that the blade never got up to an adequate speed to chop them. This despite the instructions saying how to chop nuts with it. I don't know if it was defective or not; we returned it before trying anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"I really like this chopper, and I particularly like the fact that it wasn't $100 or more!

A nice product for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works ok, but fussy to clean, died too soon.","review":"It works ok, but was a disappoinment overall.I got this because I hoped for something more handy and easier to clean than my big food processor, especially for small jobs. Unfortunately, the top which containes the motor is not washable. So you have to sort of wipe it with a damp cloth or sponge and take a q-tip to the edges to get the gunk out. Which makes it more trouble to use than the big machine where all the dirty parts can be washed.Also, after a year or so of light use, it stopped working, which was something of a relief. Since it was quite cheap, I did not regret trying it, but I was not sorry to see it go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but clean-up a bit tricky","review":"I bought this to puree my sons baby food. It certainly does this better than i had ever expected for the price. The only warning i have is that the top piece which contains the \\"motor\\" is exactly that the top piece to the chopper which means that you cannot submerge it in water... or the dishwasher, and yes it does get dirty. It is easy enough to wipe clean (which you need to do right away or the stuff sticks and is hard to get off) but you cannot thoroughly clean the top. Overall it was worth the price and i love that i can store whatever i chop/puree in the provided plastic container."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal for the price","review":"Unlike most small choppers, this one has 2 blades at different heights, thus avoiding the problem of over-chopped material at the bottom and unchopped material at the top.

This chopper is perfect. There are 2 sharp blades that work perfectly on both speeds. The bowl is a good size too, although it's not perfect for chopping smaller sized nuts and things like that, but that's not a problem for me because I rarely need it for that. The contour of the top is a plus, and it's easy to take on and off of the bowl. There's no fussing with locks or turning it into a grove to lock it, but it's still safe because it doesn't work if the top if off. I highly recommend this chopper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty little chopper","review":"This chopper does a pretty decent job of chopping up most veggies. I can also make biscuit crumbs and have also tried to chop pecans (have not tried peanuts, which other reviewers seem to have a problem with). The biggest attraction about this chopper is that it is really compact and not difficult to bring out to use every day (unlike fancier, but bigger choppers). As someone else pointed out, the cord is pretty short, so be prepared for that. But all in all, a pretty good gadget for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Handy, dandy, fast & easy!","review":"I love this 3-cup chopper!

It chopped the food well enough so I could swallow without choking. Food would occasionally get stuck underneath the blade, but we would move it around and the chopper resumed chopping. Then, without warning, it stopped working after 3 months. When we called the manufacturer to help troubleshoot, they said it must be the power source. We checked the outlet, and it was working fine. Then, the manufacturer suggested that we were using the chopper too much. The representative said, \\"it's not meant for everyday use.\\" Um, really?

My favorite thing to make is salsa, just throw in the ingredients and press the button. You can even take off the base and use it as a lid to refridgerate the leftovers.

It is easy to clean either in the dishwasher or by hand. I needed it to chop canned catfood tuna into finer bits for a kitty that can't chew his food well. It gives me enough control that I can make the tuna very fine, or if I needed to, it would puree it. I thought the price was reasonable, and it seems to be well-made.

The top (motor) section does not lock down on to the bowel. I store my unit in a cabinet on an upper shelf (slightly above my head) and every time I go to get the chopper, the top wants to fall off. It would only take three tabs on the top of the bowel and three tabs on the bottom of the motor unit that could slide over & under each other and the lock down problem is fixed. Another problem I have had is leakage. If I want to chop something with liquid, the liquid leaks out between the motor and bowel. (Actually, splatters all over the counter is a better discription.) A rubber O-ring or some sort of membrain between the bowel and motor unit would cure that problem. Other than that, no real problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't risk it - broken when received. Absolute garbage.","review":"This product was broken from the start. The blades would churn a little, but as soon as you put food in the processor, it would jam up. The motor is so weak, it can't even chop onions, let alone something with tougher skin like peppers. I was once a loyal Amazon customer, but I will never again buy this kind of product from Amazon because the \\"Return Window\\" had passed before the recipient was even able to try it out! It doesn't work and now I'm stuck with this hunk of plastic. In the trash it goes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Part of the puzzle","review":"I bought this chopper as part of an effort to speed up making Thai curries from scratch . It performs well for chopping onions and other ingrediants like ginger and galangal. For dry spices we use a mason jar on top of a 16 speed Oster blender. That has the advantage of being glass -no odors or stains linger on glass. As it is most curries need a bit of liquid to turn into a paste and this is not the case if you use a mortar and pestle. The next stage is to move up to an Indian Mixie like a Sumeet , but the cost and reliability of these devices is questionable. For mundane things like nut chopping the Ergo shines. I just wish it was glass. Then I think it would be perfect . A year later I no longer wish it was glass -it is fine as it is and still works well."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't do it...","review":"there's nothing \\"wrong\\" with this product, but i'll tell ya...it's small, too small for most uses. and it's not really any more convenient or easier to clean than a full-sized food processor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lasted through three uses","review":"I was pretty excited when I saw this little processor was available.

It's really good at pureeing, but if you're looking to chop things, you'll have to be a bit careful. You can't overload it, or else it won't cut evenly. Nonetheless, it makes quick work of onions, tomatoes, bell peppers, etc. It's also pretty easy to clean, and it's small enough to fit in almost any kitchen. I'll never go back to a hand chopper again.The downsides? Build quality is a bit lacking; the blade doesn't move things around very evenly; it's a bit too small for any large project."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny if just to cut those onions!","review":"Like other reviewers, I hate cutting onions, and I was thrilled with the nearly instant work that this chopper made of two medium onions. I just chopped each in half, took off the outer couple of layers, and threw them in. A couple of quick pulses and I had dry eyes and very nicely diced onions ready for my cooking project.I agree with the complaints about the inside top of the unit being hard to clean because it is attached to the motor. It would have been so much better if there was some kind of a liner to toss in the dishwasher. But I am sure I will manage to get the top clean enough for my standards. The only problem will be taking care of it right away before food dries on it.I read through every single review to see how other people are using this little machine. Lots of great ideas. I hope to try them, and I will never cry alone in my kitchen again, no matter how many onions need to be chopped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Capable Food Chopper","review":"I've only used this once to date and so far so good. The only thing I do NOT like is that the top part does not click on securely you need to hold it down. I expected it to click/lock onto the container but it doesn't. It would also have been nice if it came with another 3 cup coverd bowl to chop in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unobtainable Replacement cup","review":"Functionally this little chopper works well. But the durability leaves a lot to be desired. After a short time the cup cracked and allowed the spindle upon which the chopper blade revolves to fall out and get lost. I eventually found the spindle and have since super glued in place. I'm pretty good at finding replacement parts for almost anything, but in this case it took me over an hour to find a replacement from a Canadian company at almost the price of the the entire machine. Black & Decker doesn't even include this device in their product list as far as I can see. I will be leery of Black & Decker products in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not a chopper, its a mincer","review":"looking at the overwhelming reviews i bot it without a second thot, but.......... this is not a vegetable chopper, its more like a mincer...i cant get it to chop a little bigger peices, its MINCES them .. and it always leaves some big piece hanging around in the cup which i have to take out n cut it myself, bcos if i run one more round it will cut the already cut pieces even smaller.if you ALWAYS want your vegetables or fruits minced out .. this is for you or else.. its not worth it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chopped only at blade level","review":"I was not at all pleased with the performance of this chopper. Granted, It could be that what I need to chop (fresh, crisp, sunflower sprouts) is not as easy to process as other ingredients, but I thought it would do just fine, and it didn't. The blade turned, chopping beautifully at blade level. But nothing moved around, so nothing above blade level got down into the blades. It acted like I would have expected it to act if I over-packed it. But if my light-handed filling would be considered over-packing, it's useless to me. Other people have given great reviews, so this unit's effectiveness may have to do with the kind of ingredients you want to chop..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A REALLY GOOD PRODUCT","review":"I purchased this product thinking that if it helps a little around the kitchen reducing the time it takes to chop vegetables (especially onions) it is worth it. Let me tell you, you are not going to get even cuts if you try vegetables like green pepper, carrots etc. I majorly use it to cut onions which it does a FANTASTIC JOB. It gets the job done in like 10 seconds. I really love it. I have tried chopping carrots, cabbage, onions. As for me, it is worth every penny and the product is very sturdy. Cleaning could be a mess at times, but i have learned to deal with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item for the kitchen","review":"I purchased this for my own kitchen. Found out how great it was.

My mother gave me one of these ergo choppers over 6 years ago... it may have been longer. Mine is even a color they no longer make. I have not once had a problem with it, have never had to replace a part, have dropped it several times, have chopped everything from meat, nuts, garlic, and anything else you can think of... the blades have never dulled, it still works like the day my mother gave it to me. I would not consider my kitchen functional without it. I have purchased several ergo's through the last years as gifts for friends, house warming gifts, weddings and the like. You can't go wrong. It is a handy size, cleans well, stylish, and above all the Ergo does the job fabulously. Make certain you buy one for yourself before you get anyone else one, you will not be disappointed. An excellent product~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very satisfied","review":"My husband bought this for me about 3 years ago & now its stil running very good. Easy to wash/clean. I usually use it to make paste (chilli sauce or peanut sauce or mashed banana, etc) for a small portion. And also to ground garlic, ginger, galangal, lemongrass, tumeric, shallot, and put them in the small container & store them in the fridge.

I don't really like how it's arranged with how the top is the mechanical housing, I'd like that reversed. If you have plans to use this for yourself and maybe another person I'd recommend it.

When I want something softer onion for instance, diced, I still have to use a knife. Disappointing. Works ok but it doesn't really chop because it loses its sharpness quickly. I have tried it with a few things and it seems to shred more than chop. Much better suited for hard or dry stuff, like prunes and figs maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Purchase","review":"I've had various food choppers in the past, but none of them worked as well as they were advertised to so ultimately I would go back to chopping food with a knife and a cutting board. One day I was shopping on Amazon.com and needed to buy something more in order to qualify for free shipping. I came across this product and after reading the reviews, decided to try it. It is everything it is advertised to be and I'm so very happy with this purchase! I've used it several times since then and once while making crushed pineapple from pineapple chunks, got carried away and ended up with pineapple sauce! LOL It is so easy to clean and I love that the food can go straight into the refrigerator in the same container that it was chopped in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"The design with top controls cumbersome and non-ergonomic to say the least. While it probably chops as well as most mini choppers out there, the difficulties with cleaning outweigh that benefit. The center pin under the blades keeps coming out and if you are not watchful you'll lose it rendering the machine useless. While it can't be compared to full size food processor, I find it can only handle small amounts at a time and chops unevenly at that. My prior Kitchen Aid mini was superior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chopper","review":"This chopper is very convenient. Strong base and cup. Its nice that it has two speeds.

After a couple of uses the chopper developed a hairline crack in the base that ran from the metal pin (that supports the blade) radially outward. We returned the chopper for an identical replacement item and the same thing happened again after just several uses (this time returned for a refund). As noted by another reviewer, this appears to be a design flaw rather than a manufacturing defect. My guess is that while in use the post must be exerting too much pressure for the thickness of the plastic base to withstand. This is unfortunate since in principle the product is a nice concept."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect, simple appliance (but one flaw)","review":"This is only the 2nd kitchen gadget I've liked so much that I bought a second one - it is perfect for small chopping jobs and cleaning it is really easy, you don't have to take it all apart like a regular or mini- food processor. Just lift the top, take the blade out, clean the blade and the cup and that's it (yes, you do have to wipe down the underside of the lid, but a damp sponge takes care of that in 5 seconds).There is a design flaw though - there isn't enough reinforcement where the blade spindle plugs into the bottom of the cup, so after several years of use, the plastic around the spindle cracked, and the spindle came loose. I glued it a few times but it didn't last, so that's why I purchased a second chopper (and now, the 2nd chopper is starting to have the same problem a year or so later)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker EHC650 food chopper","review":"I bought this for small jobs.

This one is okay but can't handle quite as much food. It also has no removable cover or lid between the food compartment and the base of the motor unit so food gets all over the underside of the motor unit and that can't be washed - just wiped off. It's small and easy to use/store unlike big food processors. However, it can't chop a whole onion - the onion parts have to be put in at least two batches. Overall, you can't beat it for the price and ease of use (but the DeLonghi was better!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"After a fair amount of skepticism that this product would not be any different or better than other small food choppers, I decided to give it a try. I love this small choppper (and I'm not known to be passionate about kitchen appliances). The small size is an advantage when chopping small quantities of vegetables. The bottom blade is placed almost at the base level and hence you won't have any large chunks of onion pieces stuck there. It cuts it nicely and without squishing out the juices. It also doubles up as a container when the blade is removed. its a great container that does not let any smell out. (tested it with storing chopped onions in the fridge). It is light and the buttons are easy to press and ergonomically located at the top.I would definitely recommend this chopper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor failed after 1 use","review":"I purchased this food chopper so that I could make Tzatziki sauce.

Frozen bread cooks amazingly.Can the toast catch fire? Yes very easily .....The very first piece of bread I put in it caught fire .... because one of the edges of the bread stuck out a little as it was home made bread and I cut it myself.I couldn't get normal bread from the supermarket to catch fire ... unless you are foolish enough to put an end piece in then fire is pretty much guaranteed if the higher settings are used.So what do you do if you want to toast bread that you make and cut yourself?The only answer it to take a pair of sharp scissors trim any edges that protrude even a little towards the elements and don't turn the power above 1/2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Thias Toaster!!!","review":"Thought this cool looking toaster by Black & Decker would look great in my new kitchen, which it does.

It the toast is not perfectly vertical (say the bottom curls out a bit) that bit will be black. The last straw was the toast that got jammed. The heater element does not shut down until the carriage reaches the top so no matter how many times you push the emergency release button, the heat keeps coming.

So you have to turn one of them sideways with the wide part vertical. Then this slice droops over halfway through, so part of it is untoasted and part of it is burnt, and sometimes gets jammed. Even if you do one slice at a time, it toasts very unevenly and inconsistently. It also toasts English muffins very poorly, usually burning parts and leaving other parts untoasted. The only good thing about it is that it's easy to clean out crumbs.

The beads are definitely glass; however, they appear to be machine-made rather than genuine Venetian Murano millefiori beads, and lack the precise design of hand-made Murano beads.Still, the bracelet is a colorful, festive addition to my bracelet collection, and one that I find wearing almost every day for its versatile colors.

I would be sitting there watching turd showers as they fell like meteors after being flung from inside my closet.The turd launcher, as I've come to refer to it, is now broken and assaults my home no more. After two purchases of this box over the last few years, I'm once again in the market and looking for a better solution. The most frustrating thing about the Littermaid model is that it's actually a reasonably good design which suffers only from miserable quality control during the manufacturing process.

Although I cleaned it thoroughly, and it worked for about a week after that, it soon malfunctioned again and I was unable to ever get it to work properly again for more than a day or two at a time.Bottom line: I wouldn't buy this product again. It was not worth the money, and I now own a very inexpensive \\"self-cleaning litter box\\" that rolls- no fancy mechanical devices, no fussing with litter depth or weight.

What a waste of money! We didn't have an electrical outlet close enough to the floor to plug the thing in so we had to use batteries which we went through alarmingly quickly. More litter was deposited on the floor than in the receptacle and every surface above the litter line got disgusting. To make it worse, there are a million little cracks and crevices, not even including the tines, that make cleaning the darn thing a time consuming chore.

The unit was never the same. Even waiting more than 10 minutes to run the unit, it would drag huge chunks of soiled litter across the box, only to then smash them under the rake when it retracted.I finally gave up and threw mine away.

The only down side, which I don't find too bad, is that some urine does clump on the bottom. I am not sure if this is because of my choice of litter. I just scoop this and dump it into the disposable container.

They seem to last just long enough for the warranty to run out. Our second one just stopped working and can't be repaired. Also, even if I get the hard clumping litter that comes with the litter box, the pieces often break apart or stick to the rake as it is sweeping the box.

No more daily litter clean up, right? Wrong. The rake thing is constantly getting stuck, and inevitably it's in the middle of the night, so we have to get up and get it unstuck. My cats don't like the noise it makes, and I think they've gotten scared of it, since one of them has started to poop just outside of the box, and the other one started to pee on the bathroom rug (he's 5 years old, and has never had a problem before). So I switched back to my old litter box, and the litter problems have gone away. I still have the littermaid, but neither of my cats will step one paw in it. Plus, Littermaid insists you use their brand of litter, and I think it's one of the worst clumping litters I've ever used.

Well, it worked great up until last September 2005. Now it frequently jams while trying to rack the waste to the recepticle. I spent about $200 on this and it did not last a year. I find that this is a waste of money. I am now replacing the Mega Box with the old fashion litterbox.

It is worthless. Seriously. This LM900 model is the best unit to date that any automatic litter removal system company have made thus far. Except for the cheap crappy plastic. The motor is stronger than the older model, which I owned prior to this model. I have 2 cats - 13 and 15 lbs - that use the box and it handles their daily business. It does get stuck once in a while because the kitties like to pile up litter in one corner at a time every now and then. A stronger motor would be nice in a future version. Actually, I need to design my own. I can already picture a unit that will blow away all of the existing units at about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"This litter box should be recalled.

BIG MISTAKE.One machine broke and the rake just flopped around and couldn't scoop. We were able to get a replacement - but it is still in the carton - because the other litter box is always jamming. And they sent the wrong model (a cheaper one).One of our three cats tends to pee on one side of the box and the clump is getting stuck to the bottom of the pan. We can only imagine that the urine goes down the side of the pan, under the litter, and then clumps and sticks - constantly. We tried EVERY recommendation in reviews to try and stop the sticking.I will give the replacement box away and throw away the used one. Maybe the next owner's cat will pee right in the middle.It's back to the old-fangled poop and scoop box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible- don't buy it","review":"I have bought 4 of these litter boxes for $100 each and ALL of them have broken in some way... sensor, motor.

They sure don't do the job that they advertise they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for kittens","review":"I'm so mad about this product. I did extensive research on the product online including the Littermaid home site and I talked to friends. I finally decided to purchase the product. After getting the litter box home I opened the package and started to read the instruction manual. On the first page in bold letters it says it is not to be used for kittens under the age of 6 months. Evidently there is a safety problem with kittens. Well, I have two kittens that are 2 1/2 months. In all of my research I never saw any information saying that it couldn't be used for kittens. I went back to the Littermaid website and I also reviewed the box again just to make sure I didn't miss something. So, now I have a $90 litter box that I can't even use for another 4 months!! I'm very angry they didn't publish this information on the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Automatic . . . frustration","review":"I'll begin with the bottom line. THIS PRODUCT IS GARBAGE.I bought this twice. The first time it lasted a year, and then the motor died. For that year, it still required a LOT of pesky cleaning, but it was less work than a normal litter box.But, die the motor did, shortly after the warranty ran out.So I bought another one. It failed to work out of the box. It was replaced on warranty with one that died in two weeks. This one was replaced on warranty with one that died in three weeks. At this point we thought we had the warranty procedure down, and expected to follow the same procedure, but on calling customer service a manager refused to send us another. So I'm out the cost of two of these guys and still I have no functioning littermaid. This is a bad product from a bad company.The Litter Robot, on the other hand, works very well, if your cats are willing to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like flying cat poop, buy this!","review":"I read several reviews before buying this product.

I, too, have seen the flying cat poop. In fact, the day some hit me in the face was the day I decided to return this!One plus: all the time I spent cleaning the rake and changing the waste receptacles created in me the discipline to sift my cat litter daily.

The \\"Elite\\" style had nothing positive about it from what I have seen.With this purchase, I did not get the ramp with the carpet insert as in the past.

I'll be happy for certain!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad that I found this model","review":"I had this model for years and during a move it was broken. I bought a newer LitterMaid model and HATED it.

The cats are happier too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Now being made with cheaper breakable parts.","review":"We have used this product for 9 years. The first two we bought lasted 4 years each. We just went through our third one this year. Seems that the company is using cheaper parts and the motor isn't lasting more than a few months. This last one less than two months for two cats. If they went back to a quality product I would buy it again, but not this cheap thing. Time to try their competitors. It can't be any worse. Also the company customer service is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked amazing for a week, ok for a while, then broke a month later","review":"It worked amazingly for the first week I had it. It was great. Then it started to get problems. The litter would clump to the rake every time. It'd have trouble pushing the clumps into the receptacle.Last week, it got stuck in the \\"all the way\\" extended position. The rake is blocking the receptacle so I can't take the poop out, but it's also holding the lid open so the smell permeates. It won't retract the rake, no matter if I fiddle with the on and off switch, try to push it back manually, whatever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Newer isn't always better","review":"My previous unit lasted 8 years. The cat loved it and even the kids didn't mind emptying it. So when the retracting spring broke and couldn't be fixed, I ordered a new one. This one has been problems from the start. The motor is weaker and can't always get the chunks into the receptacle, Litter sticks to the bottom of the tray and when it does rake it, it leaves some litter between the rakes on the bottom. I have to scoop it every couple days to get the stuff that stuck to the bottom. And now it won't rake at all. So we are back to scooping on a daily basis. At least it has a receptacle to scoop into."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T DO IT!!!","review":"My cat has blown two of these things up by peeing/spraying on the motor.

Thinking it was a fluke I returned it and got another one. The 2nd one never really cleaned the box. It would scrape everything to the edge of the box but never dump it in the tray. So I still had to go clean the box everyday anyway. Finally after dealing with that for 5-6 months I threw it away and went back to the old reliable litter box.

I previously owned a Littermaid Plus unit which is nearly identlcal but a little smaller. That unit broke after approximately 3 years. It would jam up occasionally and eventually the wire that is connected to the travelling head broke and was not repairable. The LM900 thus far has operated smoothly. I notice a difference with how much more the surfaces are polished and this definitely makes it easier to keep itself clean. I also use ScoopAway litter which I have found keeps the box cleaner and smoother.

Well, I spent more time scraping \\"stuff\\" out of the rake than I previously did just scooping and dumping with my traditional litter box. The rake would adhere to the solid waste while attempting to carry it into the waste receptacle. This would make the machine get stuck going back and forth repeatedly trying to dump the waste. Also, this machine is pretty loud. I had to turn it off in the evening so it wouldn't scare everyone in the middle of the night. One of my cats hated the screeching sound of the machine so much that she resorted to using one of my secondary bedrooms as a litter box to avoid the machine (she has NEVER done this before and she's almost 7 years old).

I bought two of these and I had four fully-grown cats. It worked (with lots of loving) for a little less than a year. They have both died. I cleaned the unit out all the time. The plastic inserts that you must buy are expensive. If you have a cat that likes to fling litter - litter gets everywhere. I think it is a nice idea if you have a well behaved cat - perhaps up to two. But this was not a good investment with four cats. Even though I cleaned them out every day - they would like one more than the other. It was too much for the boxes. They are both now in the dumpster. I have bought three inexpensive large cat boxes with lids (I now have three cats). I am hoping they will be a success."},{"rating":"1","title":"As good as what it is supposed to clean","review":"This is junk! Even filled only as much as recommended, the machine kept on getting stuck, and repeatedly attempted to clean out the waste. The noise drove me nuts.

I threw it away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a bad product","review":"I sent the product back. I received the product and it did not work right out of the box.

Littermaid wasn't interested in replacing it. DON'T BUY ONE. wait until there's a better alternative on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a waste of money","review":"I bought the littermaid in the belief that it would save time and effort dealing with the less pleasant aspects of having a cat. Nothing could be further from the truth.1) The machine itself is incredibly noisy.2) Cat waste often gets stuck to the rake.3) The lid of the waste recepticle falls from its holder and then the waste is occasionally dumped on top of the lid causing a huge mess.4) The rake does not pick up ALL of the waste no matter what grade of litter you use.5) The machine itself is tempramental and quite often will run backwards and forwards (great if you're trying to sleep) if it scoops the litter into a corner and can't get past it.Save yourself money and just get a decent normal litter tray. It's less hassle, less cleaning and less messy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting product needs major improvements","review":"I bought this product for $66 at Meijers. The cats loved it and so did I, for the first 6 hours. The kitty poo poo stuck to the rake, caused a jam and the entire rotating arm broke in a matter of hours. I was so bummed. It would have made life so much easier. Numerous reviews stated that the poos need to dry before they get raked. This is true! C'mon you engineers. This is the only product I would advocate animal testing on. Great idea but a real mess to clean up. It is getting returned tomorrow. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw mine in the garbage","review":"I did not like my littermaid at all - I ended up throwing mine in the grabage because I was so disgusted with it. It was actually more work for me to keep this clean then to keep a regular litter box clean. I also found that the motor on this was not strong enough and kept getting stuck - which basically defeats the whole purpose.Think twice before you buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"What a mess. Litter just gets everywhere...it gets stuck in the back, up on the sides and falls underneath the entire unit in various places. You need to run it frequently and it doesn't always get all the clumps. The containers for the clumps are flimsy at best.I wouldn't recommend this unless you want to sit by it all the time moving debris away from the back and sides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs improvement","review":"I might be reviewing an older product. But it looks just like the three I used to have.1. The box doesn't scrape the bottom of the pan like a handheld scooper. So, the bottom will get covered with a sticky mush that basically stays there forever. And as the mush makes it's way to the the poop container, eventually the rake will get stuck and no longer push the poop into the bin.2. The poop bin is difficult to change, and you have to wear gloves unless you want to touch you-know-what.3. The pan is extremely difficult to clean. They say it's removable, so this may be a newer model. But I know on mine, the tray was part of the unit, and you'd have to carry the whole dirty thing somewhere to clean it. And you wouldn't want to use water because of its electrical components.4. The bins are expensive and fragile. So, if you plan on re-using the bins (like I did), they will crack with repeated removal, because they aren't ideally designed to be removed and replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product for busy owners","review":"I have to say this is one of the best products we have ever bought for our cats. They love the fact that every time they get in the litter it's clean, and with everyone in household being out at least 12 hours a day week days, it save us coming home to the horrible job of scooping poop. Do I think the replacement recepticles are over priced, yes, but are they worth the investment, also yes. We love our cats, and now we love them more because we are not dreading coming home to a full cat litter tray.This product is also highly useful for those people that have neighbours come and look after there cats while you are away.

The construction is shoddy, the components are cheap, and the design of the litter receptacle clips can cause a full one to snap suddenly out of place while removing it, which can create a much bigger mess than the scoop ever did. I'll try lining the receptacles with plastic bags as one reviewer suggested... Also, I had to scrape litter-and-urine cement off the bottom of the old box, with the Littermaid I get to scrape it off the rake as well. Yaaay.

Unfortunately, it appears that my littermaid is officially dead and I'm annoyed that I'll have to return it and wait X months for a replacement.

I'm on my third one, and although my expectations of any product are that it should hold up far better than this, I am willing to accept the trade-off of high priced/low value versus bending over and scooping cat litter. Perhaps the manufacturer is betting on just that. New and improved does not always mean better. The prior model with a longer plastic rake actually worked much better and lasted longer. It is almost as if the manufacturer purposely lowered the quality standard of the product. Other similar products do not seem any better.

It wastes a LOT of litter, pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel, than a rake IMO.

First two weeks it worked pretty well, and then some flimsy plastic piece broke and it would no longer run on the tracks. Even when it was working, you'd still have to go down every day and make sure it wasn't caught. The comb that goes through isn't long enough, so sometimes it would pass right over larger clumps. Still nicer than cleaning it by hand though, and being able to dump it right into that little plastic container helped the smell a LOT. Filling it fuller than the line suggests helped a little. Unfortunately, I couldn't find my receipt, so neither PetCo nor LitterMaid would help me when it broke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Several problems put this litter box in the trash bin:- Kitties never got used to it.

All cats, esp. older ones, have days when their poop is messy and the rake on this machine gets covered with the stuff. Cleaning the rake is worse than dumping any every day litter box. If the box itself needs to be cleaned, it is heavy and hard to handle. If a cat has bad aim, there are no sides (as in covered litter boxes) to keep it from scattering, spraying or missing the box. The custom litter and liners are much more expensive and have to be bought from only certain dealers. Also, if a cat has problems (as in older cats) with their urine being strong smelling, it does nothing to help that situation as only clumps are scooped into the bag. Nothing about cleaning cat litter is fun but cleaning a covered type litter box regularly is a easier, less expensive and less steps than this device. I see it as a gadget for gadget people not a solution for the cat litter disposal issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large & Small models are awful!","review":"I have both the large & small models.

We contacted the manufacturer, but they won't stand behind their product and we could not return it to the store because we did not have the original box, although we did have the receipt.

Unfortunately, when I took it out of the box I could tell the product was poorly made. Everything from the litter box to the scoop appeared to be cheap.

This continued to be a problem so I sent it back and got a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothings Perfect","review":"I have had the LM900 model for over a month now, and I must say I am pretty content with it. It took some acclimating for my two cats, but after they started using it it became ordinary for them. The only flaw I have found with the model is that it sometimes misses the smaller clumps, namely the fragments of bigger clumps that break up while its cleaning. However, this might only be a symptom of the litter I am currently using, Arm & Hammer. So, in order to get the box completely clean, you will need to use the included scooper to sift out the smaller pieces and clean the blades of the automatic arm (some clumps get stuck between the blades). So you will still have to do some work, but compared to a normal litter box you are saving a lot of time and effort. I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither of mine worked for long!","review":"When I bought my first LitterMaid box, I thought it was a miracle -- no more scooping! Hooray! It worked so well for my four cats that a few months later, I bought a second one. Unfortunately, the second box quit working after just a couple of weeks (and I'd thrown the receipt away, so I couldn't get my money back). Soon after that, the original box quit working, too. So, within about 6 months, I spent close to $200 on electric boxes that no longer functioned.After researching better and more reliable options, I've settled on the Omega Paw box that you roll to clean.

All three of the LitterMaid boxes I've owned (one regular, two Mega) have broken down beyond any hope of field repair within a couple of months after the warranty expired. Customer service is next to useless for any significant problem; expect a lecture on selecting the proper litter no matter what you're calling about. Also, nobody I've talked to had any idea of how to order parts beyond a replacement comb. The bottom line is that these things are just too expensive to factory-repair or replace every 12-14 months, and I'm not going to do so a third time.

The thing is just a bunch of plastic with a little motor and a few sensors. It's not worth the $100 plus price tag. What your paying for is the conveniences. I would say $40 would be a more reasonable price.

My original box worked great for 6 years until the cable broke (and I was unable or unwilling to fix it). This new \\"improved\\" version is flimsy, it scoops twice as much litter into the tray as the previous model so you end up buying twice as much litter, the scoop is as likely to spill litter off the sides as it is to get it into the tray, no matter how I tried to snug the tray under the lip of the box (as directed) there would still be a pile of litter that had fallen between the box and the tray, and the interior of the box is smaller than the original - not great for a large cat.

The rake (part that gets sifts through the litter) constantly gets clumpy regardless of whether you use the recommended kitty litter or not. Refilling the machine with litter is also difficult seeing as it requires a very specific amount to function. Any more than that amount results in your rake being unable to sift through the litter and making failed effort after failed effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A nightmare to clean!","review":"This item works fine until it gets crudded up with dried on poop and litter. It's a nightmare to clean, and my box went dead after 6 months. I wrote to the company TWICE and got no response at all! I would advise against buying this product.

On the other LitterMaid the electric eye that triggers a cleaning cycle after the cat enters the box failed. That one I still have, but have to trigger manually by turning the power on and off. You must buy premium litter or the rake does not have enough power to move the litter. My Littermaids were worth while for the short (less than 1 year) time the functioned correctly, but I would not recommend them due to poor reliability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Poop","review":"I wish this thing would clean itself up and throw itself in the trash.

When it is near full, all I have to do is pick up the recepticle, pull up the grocery sack, tie a knot and take it out to the garbage.

I also did not like that the soiled litter would stick to the bottom, break into small pieces that the comb would not catch, and often missed the receptacle. I ended up having to clean it out manually to fix the mess left behind. I would rather just scoop it the first time myself and save the hassle....and money.

The litter sticks to the box most of the time, which prevents the rake from cleaning the box. In the end, most of the time I have to still clean out the litter by hand, completely defeating the purpose of even having the thing. In addition, the motor is really loud, and when it encounters an obstacle (i.e. clumped up litter sticking to the box) it makes three passes before finally shutting down and blinking the light that shows me that the box has yet again failed to perform. I even have to shut off the box at night. Otherwise I'll be woken up by the sound of the rake going back and forth, back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. Better to wait for the next model, which hopefully will be more advanced than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the trouble and money!","review":"I spent two months trying to get it right. Which brand of \\"recommended\\" litter won't stick to the rake? How much is just enough litter? (use too much and the rake can't return to its starting position and will keep repeating its cycle) How often should I add another cup of litter? My 2 cats went in the same location in the pan, so the receptacle overflowed after one day. Also, the rake would pull the clump and litter away and then they would urinate on a pan without litter! Not a good smell! This did not liberate me from cleaning the box, I was dealing with litter box issues twice as often!(...) PS: Don't bother with the privacy tent.

The electronic eye stopped working so the rack would not work, which is the whole purpose of this box.

I replaced it with the newest version and it was a disaster. First, the rake barely got past the rim of the waste tray so half the waste ended up in the tray and the other half fell back into the box. Then it wouldn't even get as far as the tray itself. After two weeks, I replaced the unit with another one. The rake on this one can barely make it through clean litter. When there is waste in the box, it grinds to a halt about half way through the cycle and doesn't even come close to getting as far as the dump tray. This purchase was a total waste of money.

My 2 cats are already using it! They are freaked out so we have it on manual right now, but we will soon have it on automatic so we don't have to fuss with it. My only gripe is that the automatic timer is set for 10 minutes and I don't think that's enough time for the clumps to become as hard as they need to in order for the clumps not to stick to the rake.. They should give it an adjustable timer for cat who pee like a race horse (my cat is 24lbs!) Also, I am using Fresh Step Premieum litter which seems to work fine if the clumps are dry enough..

A very good buy for me and my cats. 4 Star!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A mess","review":"I purchased the LM900 after we brought home our third cat so the litter box wouldn't have to be scooped 3x a day and to keep odor down.Although it does reduce odor by keeping the waste in the closed bin, it requires WAY TOO MUCH MAINTENANCE. If your kitty likes to use the corners as one of mine does, you will be scraping cement-like messes off the bottom, the corner and out of the rake on a daily basis, if not more often. I even use the silicone spray recommended by other reviews and \\"premium\\" litter... all to no avail. Litter all over the floor around the box as well as under the waste bin is also a problem.

My male uses it at least six times a day, the girl, who knows, but it's ALWAYS full!All in all, I like the product.. lessens the odors and if you keep up on it, it's a good product.

The comb jams more than it works. I found that I was cleaning this box more often than I was cleaning a regular box. The comb would get litter built up in it causing it to try to scoop all the litter into the compartment, causing a jam. The next problem I was having was the litter would get in the gear on the side of the box, causing the comb to jam. The litter box was so noisy that my cat would attack the box, and end up using the nearest plant as her litter box. This product suffers from many design flaws. The ramp broke after the first week.

Also if you have a cat that tends to go in the same place like I do, the litter clumps stack up in the tray all in one spot so most days I came home to a lid only half closed on top of a huge pile of litter on one side and none on the other.The 10 minute interval just isn't long enough for the wet stuff to clump so it ends up all over the tines of the rake.

When it does work, which is rarer than the appearance of most astronomical phenomenon, all the tines of the rake serve to do is spear chunks of cat feces and carry them back to the return position, leaving nothing in the waste receptacle. Spending just five minutes scraping it off is enough to make me want to stab myself with one of said tines, that I might become infected with a deadly strain of ecoli, and be permanently freed from this abortion of a product.

It will wake you up at night if it's located near your bedroom. You also have to buy new waste containers or reuse/wash the old stinky ones frequently. The attached rug/ramp does not completely eliminate the cat(s) tracking litter across the floor either. The cat pee along with small amounts of littler gets into the track and has to be cleaned every week or so. The automated rake gets clogged with cat litter and needs to be cleaned out every other day. Not as big as I would have like it to be either. Our cat is about 13 lbs and just barely fit into this. It does automatically rake the litter into a wast container but the maintenance is worse than just doing it manually."},{"rating":"2","title":"It woriks well for litter of 1","review":"I like mine alot. I am older lady with physical limitations and cleaning a clay litter box daily would have been too much for me. I've had this one for 8 months now and never a problem. I would suggest definetely purchasing the premium clump litter (I like fresh step)and also I have purchased liners for the receptacles, (makes it more economical) and makes the receptacles last much longer, or if u prefer use grocery plastic bags (works well as liner for the receptacle) I always ask my friends if it smells like i have a cat in the house, and repeatedly they reply \\"no way\\" and that alone is worth the price of this machine.

Granted, with 3 large cats the rake sometimes becomes clogged and needs a little help, but watching all 3 cats run to watch it work, look under the raising panel, swat at the rake is hysterically funny. Just make sure you use the recommended litter. I found the corn product made my house smell like corn and the cats would not use it. The arm and hammer baking soda super scoop is better, and I use less of it than I did with the cheaper brands in catboxes. The cats appreciate the ability to always step into a clean box. A plastic 99-cent paint scraper scrapes the bottom and sides clean with no damage to the box. I have recommended this to all my friends, and will probably start to make it a gift this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I might as well have a plain old litter box for my cat. More times than none I have to manually scoop the waste from this unit. It seems that the motor is not strong enough to properly push the waste to the pan. With the litter box filled to the proper level with premium clumping litter the unit doesn't work. When the cat uses it then covers up her mess, she scoops the litter into a pile that the motor can't get through. I have tried to vary the amount of litter in the box but there have been very few times that the system has worked properly. Once you get to the minimum level the motor has a hard time scraping the urine clumps from the bottom of the unit.

The clumps would stick the bottom of the pan, and it was a real pain to clean them off.

Don't Buy!!","review":"I am embarassed to say that I have purcased 3 Litter Maid Mega 900 Models and every single one died and untimely death right after the warranty period had expired. I liked the idea of the Litter Maid even though there were some \\"issues\\" with it. Like clumping of poo on the rake that would cause it to go over and over again. Cleaning the unit was a nightmare! I must say though I will not be buying a 4th one after the failure of the 3rd one I feel like the biggest fool in the world!

If your cat only has very firm \\"business\\" then it works well. Every \\"loose or wet\\" \\"business\\" sticks to the rake and becomes a huge mess to clean off. I would rather dump and regular litter pan then get in up close to clean the tines on the rake regularly. Also, if there is a big \\"business\\" the rake gets jammed. The first box died after 3 days and Amazon replaced it immediately! Sorry to say that the box has not worked for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes more time cleaning than normal litter boxes","review":"I'm giving this 1 star only because there is no option for fewer. Maybe this litter box works for cats who always go in the center of the box, but for those that go more towards the side, this is a real waste of money and I have spent more time cleaning it than I would have to spend on a regular litter box. Also, if your cat has large pees, the chances are that the waste receptacle won't close as the clump will get stuck and the lid won't come down - not pleasant for us or the cats. The rake and the sides are extremely difficult to clean properly. Besides which - this is so noisy that, if you have the litter box anywhere near a sleeping area, you'll want to switch it off at night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't...","review":"I had a littermaid a couple of years ago that lasted me for a year and did great.

I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of daily litter box duty."},{"rating":"1","title":"LitterMate a loser","review":"I have had three littermate kitty pottys. You'd think I would have learned after the first two. It's such a great idea to have a Loo which sweeps the poop into a closed container....wrong!!! My cat pees straight toward the back and gets the automatic rake soaking. When it moves forward, it accumulates a large blob of clumped litter which sticks in the tines of the rake and won't come off unless I go with the cleaner tool and manually clean off the tines. This happens once or twice a day. It works ok for solids, but terribly for liquid waste. Not a good design. I have tried to contact the company to no avail despite 60-70 minutes on the phone....from these waits, I get a canned response which has no bearing on my problem. They are impossible to contact by phone. I won't buy # 4 and am sorry I bought the first three.Wishful User"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"When we first bought this unit we thought it would be great. We had the older Litter Maid that lasted about 4 years before it finally broke down so we bought this as a replacement. It worked great for the first few weeks. After that the gears would slip and it sounded like there was a toy uzi going off in my bathroom. It would get stuck and just sit there and click. The older model's rake arm would just retract while this one would just keep trying and the gears would just keep clicking. I bought the Ever Clean premium litter that costs $20 a box and when that didn't seem to work, I bought the Litter Maid premium clumping litter, which didn't make much difference either. This unit does not work for a long period of time. BUYER BEWARE."},{"rating":"2","title":"LM900 Mega works for us!","review":"After reading many negative reviews, I was was skeptical. But once our LM900 Mega arrived, it has worked well, and CONSIDERABLY reduced the cat box smell that everyone couldn't help but begin to notice. We have three cats and had to scoop two of of form litterboxes at least twice a day. Who has time for that? I have read that people have better luck with the Mega, so check your model. You may want to consider upgrading. Our cats seem to love it. I gave this 4 out of 5 stars because sometimes the rake can't scoop up the tiny pieces of debris, but it isn't a dealbreaker by any means. Plus the waste recepticals and carbon filters are a bit pricey to maintain....but worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one out there","review":"When my original one finally died after probably 10 years of service, I tried to find the same thing only to find they have changed the style and the new ones are horrible.

This one was a Total Disaster. Never could get rake to work, Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is) was of little help and Orange Onion (don't buy anything from them) sucked. They couldn't care less, at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls). Keep in mind, if you buy it and return it, do it through Littermaid. You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire. To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid!), unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire, don't let it go! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment. I wasted hours and hours on this. If only they had a good competitor. They're sending me the only thing available, the latest model that most people here seem to hate. sigh..if it doesn't work, I'm giving up totally on Littermaid.

I have wanted a self-cleaning litter box for years now, with 5 kids and 19 animals to take care of on our farm. As one reviewer said, getting this litter box to clean up after my 2 cats is as easy as getting my 8 year old to clean the box. The motor is unbelievably loud and screechy - it wakes me up several times a night, and is not even in my room. Yes, you can program it to stop during the night, thank goodness.The rake only dumps clumps in the general vicinity of the collection box. It does a great job of dumping litter on the sides, and underneath the collection box, however. I spend a hour a day sweeping the floor under and around this heavy, cumbersome machine.It is also huge - takes up at least twice the space of a normal box.It's basically awful.

I have owned this product for years and wouldn't live without it. With 2 cats, it's great in keeping odor and litter tracking down and box cleaning to a minimum.I found over the years that a plastic grocery bag in the litter bin helps prolong the life of the plastic recepticals, and adding a bit of corn litter to premium litter aids in clumping and the overall daily cleanliness of the litter as well. Both tips have helped keep the costs of supplies to a minimum.I also suggest the privacy tent and filters as well if your litterbox is in an open area of any kind. If your cat is not a \\"digger,\\" an Oust Fan also does the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Littermaid Hints","review":"I bought a littermaid a year ago. I had to for health reason. I love it. I had one probably with it is that I had to empty the littermaid every other day because she like to pee a lot. A month ago I stop using premium Fresh Step litter and change to Fresh Step Crystals. It works in the littermaid plus I only empty the littermaid once a week. That because the crystals absorb the pee. I have one cat the goes a lot so I have to but in new crystals in every 3 weeks. It is great no smell or cat tracking litter everywhere. If you decide to try the crystals only fill to add litter line. Any over that, the littermaid will give you trouble.

I love the convenience of being able to let my 2 cats use the box and clean it only weekly. The motor has functioned perfectly over the lifetime of the box, and I reuse the plastic receptacles until they break. The only problem is the cheap construction of the rake. The wheels break off of the end of the rake without fail after around 6 months. I am currently on my 4th rake. You can order them from their Fox International website for $40 a pop. Each rake gets assessed a $10 shipping fee, so ordering 2 will cost the same which is an incredible rip off. After 3 rakes, you have essentially paid to replace the box. I keep ordering them though, due to the convenience of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years & going strong, 2 cats + natural cat litter","review":"I've had this for 3 years now & have had no problems.

It has done what it was supposed to do but did finally die. We went and bought the newer model (Litermaid Elite LME 9000) and found it to be a piece of JUNK! First it would not fit in the housing that the old model fit. Second, it only removed about half of the waste, leaving the rest behind the comb and had to be cleaned out manually and would pile up in just two days and trap the comb to make it completely un-operative. We found deaf ears at Littermaid. Then the wheels on the traveling comb broke and Littermaid did send out a new comb unit but by then I had had it and had ordered this basic Model LM900.This model is a dream and does what it is supposed to do even better than our older original unit. This is a great example of leave well enough alone as the Elite unit is JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"failed on so many levels","review":"This is FAR from a glowing recommendation. After having TWO, yes TWO littermaid boxes fail in the exact same manner and having to spend money to not only pay for postage on my equipment's parts to the company but also for their postage back I am told (after I call them) that it will take up to two weeks to get my replacement. This does not include the two weeks for them to even process the replacement.I owned a littermaid product nearly 10 years ago that was exceptional. This company has failed in its product quality, its customer service (an altogether different fiasco of not only a flat out lie but also erroneous information that would have placed my return in limbo had I not confirmed with another rep) but also complete and total customer dissatisfaction. Not worth the time, effort, or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive disappointment","review":"The first thing I noticed when our (2)cats began using the LitterMaid was the odor. We didn't have litter box odor before but when the mechanical box scooped the litter into the small receptacle, the odor became intense. Then there was the extra time we spent keeping the LitterMaid clean, and all the loose litter that ended up underneath the trap area. We began spending money on extra mats, canvas, screens, anything that would make the LitterMaid more private and cleaner. We realized we were spending excessive money to make this litter box work for us, and unusual amounts of time cleaning up the mess the litter box was making instead of simply cleaning up after our cats, which wasn't nearly as difficult or time consuming. We just bought a new box called Clevercat which we are very pleased with."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOULD RECOMEND","review":"Agree with other reviews, this product requires daily maintenance to assure smooth operation.

In less than two months time, the unsubstantial motor has burned out completely. Litter Maid claims that the boxes should need to be emptied every five days for one cat. Well, I have two cats and had to empty the box two times daily. The Litter Maid is good for controlling odors when it works, but it constantly jammed and then shut down (and I used a recommended brand of premium cat litter). After a few weeks of this load, the tiny (and very loud) motor simply gave up. I'm waiting to hear from Litter Maid regarding warranty repair/replacement, but I suspect I'll end up returning to a traditional $5.00 litter tray. The overall concept of the Litter Maid is good, but without sturdier components, it ends up being trash in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This litter box STINKS! (Literally!!)","review":"I wish I had read some of the other reviews of this crappy product before I bought it. We have two cats and thought this would be the solution to dealing with cat litter everyday. How wrong we were!!The rake was constantly getting stuck and clogged with used litter clumps - this requires you to scrape the clump off the rake (much more up close and personal than I like to be with cat crap). This will especially be a problem if your cats tend to use the bathroom in the same place in the box (which also requires you to redistribute the waste in the receptacle at least once a day). This, combined with the relatively small amount of litter that you can use, made the odor much worse than with a regular box we cleaned every day.So, as I see it, this thing is actually MORE work than just cleaning the litterbox once a day...with no payoff. Not to mention the cost of the thing and its pricey receptacles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stops Working","review":"I purchased this product and after three months the rake would not stop--according to the manufacturer, it was a dirty sensor.

Nope, it is put together correctlyRadishes got all over the counter.I used masking tape and saran wrap to direct the chute properly. The radishes got backed up and mushy. I put the chopper on a large cookie tray to catch the radish shreds. That worked.Am I missing something? Did I lose a piece?

I purchased this new one and am only half pleased with it. I think that Black & Decker needs to go back to the drawing board and build a better shredder/slicer continuous flow chute. It dispenses more stuff down the sides and front of the unit than it gets in the bowl.Also the plastic bowl is of real flimsy quality compared to my other mini processor, so one better handle it with care when attaching and removing it from the unit. The one thing that is OK with this processor is the chopping blade. It does as good of a job as the other one that I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy","review":"Very disappointed. Was given the food processor as a gift, waited a year to open it so had no receipt.

I placed it on the counter and had to take both hands and plug my ears while it pulverized cereal, yes just cereal. Either they crammed too large of a motor into a too thin case, or it's just the design that lends itself to amplify the noise. There are also too many pieces and nothing to hold them all together, so it's not convenient to store. I'm glad it's at the pricepoint that it is, as I ended up donating it to a local thrift store after one use."},{"rating":"1","title":"B and D Mini Pro is too loud!","review":"I owned the first generation of this product and still use it at another residence.

As others have noted, the shreds fly everywhere unless you very carefully cup your hand around the spout. That's assuming you can get the carrots to shred. The unit is designed in such a way that often the carrots or pieces (you usually need to cut them to get them in the tube) will catch in the space between the tube and the blade. It's a hassle to have to fish those parts out and try again. And eventually, pressing carrots down to shred leads to a bent, then broken blade.My previous mini-food processor handled this work for years before it faded. The B&D; unit is a great example of poor design and poor quality materials."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini pro food processor","review":"Would not recommend this to anyone.

While this is an improvement, it begs the question, why does Black and Decker feel they must be in the food business when very clearly they can't design products that work for the consumer. The big issue here is getting the parts to fit together so you can use the product.

After carefully examining the instructions, I thought it was pretty clear how to use this coffeemaker.There is a drain hole in the back and if you accidentally overfill it or have it filled to the max line and need to move the coffeemaker, water pours out from the back through this hole.When I made my first pot of coffee, everything went well. The 2nd pot wasn't so good -- I had coffee grounds literally sputtering out all over the place (walls, counter, all over the machine.It is a messy unit as well. When removing the basket to empty it, i've noticed that the basket is often still filled with coffee that hadn't drained into the pot.I've had better coffeemakers in the past that brewed into a carafe; the coffee doesn't stay hot as long as some of the more expensive units, the spout isn't that great; it dribbles.I would strongly suggest spending the extra money on a better quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this one!","review":"I purchased both the white and black models of this maker (not sure why a price difference) and use them at work. I use one for tea and the other for coffee. I have had constant problems with the one used for coffee. The water either comes thru faster than the filter will process it thru the coffee OR the spring mechanism that allows the water to drip thru the filter into the pot is not lined up exactly right and in both cases...we get 40 oz. of coffee and grinds flowing over the edge of the coffee basket. If I have to stand by the coffee pot to make sure it works properly each time I start it up, it's not worth the money I spent on it. Like most things in life...spend cheap, get cheap.

This is an excellent purchase for someone that doesn't drink a large amount of coffee at any one time. The entire device is easy to clean and maintain, and the timer is easy to understand and operate. I have found that with a paper filter the coffee maker requires what I consider a fine to very fine ground in order to make the coffee \\"strong\\" enough. Other coffee makers that I have used have not required such a fine ground and therefore some adjustments may be required in one's coffee making style. The carafe keeps the coffee warm for at least the advertised four hours.

Krause pushes you take risks, shoot lots of subjects, and carry a camera around with you wherever you go. I can't wait to get a pocket digital camera in addition to the SLR one I already have, just so I can stop thinking about my expensive camera more than the potential photos that I could make.

The blast of static is so loud it wakes us and the baby up all through the night. We called Fisher Price and they said the blast of static was most likely cellular phone and cordless phone interfernce.....but after reading all the reviews and how everyone has this problem...I'm guessing this is just a poorly made piece of equipment.

It is truly a high-tech piece of equipment and so clear it sounds like the baby is in the room with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MONITOR!!!!

Don't waste your money on this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor performance","review":"The montior has an intermitant clicking noise that is very loud. The monitor also has a significant amount of interference. The light show function has mysteriously turned on during the middle of the night (no the 1.5 month old did not turn it on). The baby does enjoy the light show.... but for [the price] the money would be better spent on something else. We are still searching for another monitor to replace the Fisher Price \\"keep the parents up at night\\" monitor. 1-20-03 purchased a sony monitor off of the the sony web site (27 channels and 900 mhz) Monitor works well (very quiet and clear reception) and includes a voice activation mode. We still use the fisher price monitor for the light show but for [$$] you are better off buying the sony monitor for a good night's sleep. Too bad amazon does not carry the sony moniotr."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"We registered for this product despite of all of the bad reviews. I thought if it is from Fisher-price and has all kinds of features to it how bad can it be? Really bad. The monitor clicks loud enough to keep you awake whenever it is on and the base picks up static in bursts that wakes my daughter up from a sound sleep. My daughter enjoyed the light show, but we no longer use even that. It is supposed to go on whenever the baby cries, but it shuts itself off with the next scream. So if she is crying the monitor goes on and off -it does not help to soothe anyone. Even the night light is too dim to do any good. If you are thinking about buying this monitor think twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Only Good for the Light Show","review":"This monitor is not worth the money! The ticking that goes on through the night is enough to make you go through the roof! And it drowns out the baby. The only thing we use it for now is the light show when we're changing our daughter. She loves to watch it and listen to the music. It was rather disappointing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH IT AT ALL!","review":"I bought this item for my toddler so I would be able to hear when he woke up in the middle of the night, but the static and clicking sounds are awful on my reciever end (sorta sounds like a clock ticking loudly)I can't even hardly hear my son over all the noise unless he is crying super hard. I had to go out and buy a new monitor to hear him.My son does like the picutre show on the ceiling we have to set it on the floor near his bed so it will position right.I expected more from Fisher Price this item was a huge disapointment I think they should lower the price to about $13 at the very most."},{"rating":"1","title":"We returned ours to the store.","review":"We bought this monitor as a replacement for the monitor we currently use for our 3 year old son which was getting staticky after 3 years of continual use. We only used it for about 2 days before packaging it up and returning it to the store. When the channels are set correctly the monitor clicks and it is not nearly sensitive enough for our liking. My current old monitor allowed us to hear our sons breathing while the static on this model barely allowed us to hear other noises in or out of the room. We thought the lights and projection might also entertain our toddler but he was not very fond of them at all and insisted that we turn them off. Overall, not a good buy and I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure disapointment","review":"I traded one disaster for another. I started with the safty 1st 900MHz and it kept beeping on me even when plugged it. So I traded it for the Soothing Dreams Monitor. I could not hear anything except static all night. And the projector has to be so far from the wall just to see it. To top it off there is no vol control on the music All around a very dipointing experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Click, Click, Click....","review":"I loved the idea of the lightshow and being able to talk back to my baby, but when I plugged it in the reciever end continuously clicks, to where it is cutting out parts of the sound from the babies room, SUPER annoying!!! I liked it so much, I took it back and got another one, SAME problem. Now every once in a while the end that goes in the babies room make a very loud static sound. I have not had my baby yet and if that scary sound would have woken her up I would have been a very unhappy mom! I guess I am taking it back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love it, but...","review":"I had the same problem that one of the other people had. It (the music)turnes on and off when my baby cries and it's not voice activated. I just bought it today and I guess I will be returning it tomorrow. Maybe the next one will work right. I will be exchanging for the same product. The rest of the features are great! As long as you don't have the same problem I've had - this is the perfect monitor.I'm giving this a second review! I returned the first monitor for another one and it too didn't work. I gave up on it and I'll be doing some research on getting another. I did notice more static on the second monitor. This I guess is just a poor product. Usually I am very faitful to Fisher Price. I guess they can't always have the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this monitor!","review":"I received this monitor as a gift for by baby shower. I registered for it because I liked the fact that it played music & had a light show. Well, where I had put the monitor, the light show wouldn't be over my son's crib for him to see it. It didn't adjust very far. Also, the noises that the monitor & base would make were very annoying. The base would make a loud screeching noise every 20 mins or so and would wake up my son. The reciever also made very loud noises that it was hard for my husband & I to sleep at night. I called Fisher-Price and told them of the problems and they said it was probably some type of interference on my end. It wasn't the monitor. So, I sent it back to Fisher-Price & they sent me $$ back ... The above monitor [stinks], don't waste your $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"My husband and I recieved this monitor as a shower gift,(I did register for it) in the store it sounded so good with the light show and the two way communication and the music, but first off the music keeps my son up instead of putting him to sleep and it is hard to get the light show to go directly over the crib without having to put the monitor on a slant, i leaned it on a teddy bear. I find that it has alot of static, the static gets so loud in the night it wakes me up and then i lower the volume to get rid of the static but then the volume is so low i cant hear my son. Also when i unplug it even with a battery in it, it clicks a very very loud click that i have to just plug it back in and even sometimes when its plugged it it still clicks.I am defintly returning this monitor and i would not recommend buying it, even though it sounds enticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Fisher-Price","review":"We bought this monitor because of all the great features. Unfortunately the only one that worked was the picture show and that was so bright, it kept our son awake. The static is so loud, we couldn't hear the baby cry. The volume control doesn't work. It's on loud all the time. And to top it all off, it broke after just two weeks! Great concept, but it needs much improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy Monitor","review":"I have this monitor and I thought for the price that I would be getting a good one. I was wrong. It's not a great monitor at all. It is very noisy and makes a loud noise every once in a while (I guess it's static). The receiver is VERY loud. I've had to adjust it sooo low so that it won't keep me awake at night. I've tried both channels and neither one is clear. It is very annoying and most of the time I just leave it off and use my motherly instinct to hear her anyway. I can't even hear the little noises she makes - I only hear her crying. I wouldn't recommend this monitor. I love Fisher Price toys and have never had a problem with them but I will buy another monitor for the next baby!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a good monitor","review":"This product is a good toy but NOT a good monitor. My daughter loved the light show but the monitor had so much static that I could not hear her in her room. My husband went into the nursery and talked to me and I could not hear him either not to mention I could not sleep with all the noise this monitor made. There are other product to buy that provide the light show. The most important feature of a monitor is to provide safety for your child.I was told that these days it is hard to find a monitor that will work with all the cell phones and other electronics of our times. We bought the Sony monitor with 27 channels and it works really well, NO static and is very clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"We expected much better from Fisher Price","review":"What a wonderful concept if only it worked. We purchased this monitor because of all the \\"great\\" features. The light show and music are great but the monitor itself was horrible. We had nothing but static. We could not even hear our son. The monitor would shut on & off on it's own. The intercom mode would be great if it worked properly. Voices come through very distorted on both units. This feature should be to reassure your child not scare them.My personal opinion for anyone would be to NOT buy this product if your looking for the security a monitor should give you. If you are looking for a light show for your child then this is for you. We have since purchased the Evenflo Constant Care monitor ~ We love it! It gives all the security we expected from a monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"We bought this because of the additional features it offered compared with other monitors. Several problems:1. There is a constant pulsing on both channels (my friend's monitor works fine in our house so we don't have a local interference problem).2. Yes, you can talk to your baby using the handset but it's distorted so much it's scary!3. The light show is nice but there is no focus adjustment so it doesn't look that great.4. The soothing sounds are not soothing due to the constant background buzzing. In fact, it just sounds cheap and nasty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"I thought that I would ignore the reviews I had read about this monitor, \\"It couldn't be that bad\\" I thought to myself, well I was wrong! This monitor is terrible! There is so much static and clicking in the receiver that I couldn't hear my son and my husband and I couldn't sleep with it on. The reason we got a monitor was to be able to hear our baby and all we could hear was interference with this monitor. Not only was the static bad but you can't position the projector where you want it so pretty much the only way to get the image on the ceiling above the crib would be to put the monitor in the crib. When I returned this monitor to Babies-R-Us the sales girl told me that no one is ever satisfied with that monitor and they almost all get returned. I bought the Constant Care 3000 2-way Communicator by Evenflo instead and it is WONDERFUL!!!! I can still talk to my son when I'm not in the room, with the 2 way communicator and the reception is clear as a bell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Technology","review":"I was disappointed with this monitor for three reasons: 1.)The unit for the child's room takes up an exceptional amount of room. 2.) The light show is useless unless you have a table positioned at least 2.5 feet from the wall. 3.) The constant clicking on the parent's receiver drives you crazy....forget about sleeping if this is on! Fisher Price honestly agrees that the clicking cannot be fixed. I traded mine in for the Fisher Price 900 MHZ Vibrating Monitor....it is so clear and concise I can hear the birds sing in the front yard."},{"rating":"1","title":"The monitor keeps us up more than the baby","review":"Actually most of the negative reviews we have read about this product are seem to be a bit understated. In order to hear the baby, the monitor must be turned up so high that the bedroom sounds like the proverbial evil scientists laboratory all night with all the buzzing and knocking. After spending a few nights with this monitor I suspect that Fisher Price has received government funding for research on a special sleep deprivation project on new parents. In short, if you want to be an irritable insomniac then this is the monitor for you. However if you enjoy your sleep at night then I would urge you to look elsewhere. My wife and I will be headed to any place that is open to get a replacement today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great, if you don't need a monitor","review":"I wish that I had as much luck as others with this product.My baby loves the light show& soothing sounds but this isnot enough for me to keep this product. When the system is in use a \\"heartbeat\\" noise can be heard through the remote. This noise is loud enough that the baby can BARELY be heard through it (the base being only 12 inches away from her. I have been told by the manufacturer this is a common problem with this product. If I didn't need a monitot this product would be wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"My husband and I have been very disappointed with this monitor. I am currently looking for another. The static and noise is terrible and keeps me awake at night. We really can't hear our baby all that much better than without it. Also, the design is very poor. It does not stand up well. The buttons for the light show and the voice activation are also very poorly placed. I find that every time I pick it up I hit one of the buttons by mistake and panic that I will startle my baby with light or sound. Finally, the volume dials are recessed and very difficult to use. I agree, the light show doesn't work well unless you have it in the crib. So far, we have never used this and many of the other features. I would have to say that this was a big waste of money. Are there any better monitors out there???? What I really want is to hear my baby, I'm willing to do away with all the gagets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not happy at all.","review":"My wife and I registered for this monitor thinking the projector was a great idea. Problem is, if you don't have a piece of furniture right next to the crib, the baby can't see the moving pictures on the ceiling. It would've worked better if there was some sort of bracket to attach the monitor outside the crib railing. However, this is not the only problem. The interference is so bad that you can barely hear the baby. There is a constant clicking and hum. We are currently shopping for a new monitor set."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!","review":"I thought the monitor was awesome...in the box. Since the monitor has come out of the box it has been nothing but a hassle. In order for baby to see the light show, it has to be right next to the crib. So, we have a Wooden TV Tray next to his crib just for the monitor. The monitor will turn on and off in the middle of the night even when you don't want it on. The receiver has so much static it just clangs and clicks all night long. I can't hear my son whatsoever in it. When I want it on to soothe him, I'll push the button and it will turn off 30 seconds later. What a waste. We have returned it 3 different times, thinking it may just be the specific monitor, but NOPE...it's ALL of them. DON'T BUY THIS ITEM!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"We had high hopes for this monitor. We thought the features were great. The pictures on the ceiling the noise of the crickets. Then we actually tried to use it. The receiver made a horrible clicking noise and the reception was not clear at all. I could hardly hear my child. Also the soothe button did not work well at all. We returned it and bought the Fisher Price Vibrating Monitor instead. That is great. We actually bought two. That is my next review to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clicking and Buzzing","review":"Do not buy this even if your life depended on it! The static and clicking noise coming from the reciever was just too much to handle. The stupid thing even cut out a number of time during the night. The only thing it is good for is a light show. But even that does not justify the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst monitor on the market","review":"This monitor is nice for the light show but everything else is horrible.

The baby cries and I don't hear a thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"possessed monitor","review":"I bought this monitor and the first night my son woke up crying in the middle of the night. There is a DEFECT in this monitor, when it is off and a loud pitch sound (CRYING) goes off near it, it turns on. All of the sudden anytime my sun cried or even talked the light show and music would go off. I called FP about this and they said that they know of the problem but have no way to fix it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Troublesome Monitor","review":"This may be the worst electronic gadget we've ever owned. The biggest problem is with the sound quality of the monitor itself. On one channel we get major static, on the other channel we get a high-pitched background whine with occasional tapping sounds which come through loud and clear. It sounds like someone clapping and it's very disconcerting to hear that coming from the baby's room in the middle of the night. We can't hear the baby unless we're so close we don't need the monitor. We're also having the same trouble other reviewers have had with the \\"light show\\" coming on spontaneously. On the whole, we're not happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Monitor!","review":"I am down stairs at this very moment listening to this annoying thing (Tic, tic, tic). Most of the reviews that I have read thus far have been right on it. I thought that it would be a great thing to have a monitor/toy for my baby's nursery. You cannot hear your child when he cries unless he SCREAMS. The point is, this is supposed to be a monitor with added bonus of sounds and lights for the baby. It's not a monitor at all! My 4 month old son just recently recovered from RSV. When we brought him home from the hospital we needed to keep a close ear on his breathing day and night. It was not possible to hear him cry with this monitor, much less cough, weeze, and choke. I am being quite dramatic I know, but the reason for this piece of equipment is to hear your baby when he needs you. If you want it as a monitor, YOU DON'T WANT IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Money","review":"I really wish these reviews were available when I registered for this item. Unfortunately, we also did not use it until we moved our son into his bedroom and had long since gotten rid of the box. The clicking and static on the receiver are intolerable. The base is not stable and we have to keep it in his crib to be remotely effective (fine until he can actually grab it!). The soothing feature is ridiculous. I am actually on my way to the store to purchase another unit and throw this one in the trash as I wouldn't inflict it on anyone as a hand-me-down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so soothing.","review":"There is a loud static noise that wakes my baby during the night. I finally went out and bought a different type."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy only if you enjoy the ticking and buzzing!!!","review":"Like others have said, the receiver makes a constant buzzing sound when on, and a repeated ticking noise when it's plugged in. Not a good monitor to waste money on! It also falls over very easily, and so far has been of no use in comforting my 4-month old son with the added features. Especially because of the rather high price, I feel foolish for having bought this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice concept","review":"Registered for this because of the light show. While that is a great concept, it is so staticky! There are constant noises all night, and it has woken my baby up. I can barely hear her if she wakes up in the middle of the night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"I put this moniter on my registery, and when I received it and set it up, I thought it was the cutest moniter in the world. I loved the soothing lights and sounds feature and the talk feature, but after the baby came home from the hospital, my opinion changed. I noticed that the moniter barely picked up the baby crying, and there is no way of turning off the music so you can just have the moniter going at night. At 2:30 in the morning, the baby wakes me up and then the loud music playing wakes up the rest of the family. Plus, the handset started making this really loud knocking noise, much louder than the regular noise a moniter makes. You can't even turn down the volume to make the knocking stop. The moniter is going back to the store today, and hopefully I'll find one that is more practical and works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"I returned this product 3 times","review":"My son loved the light show. The first monitor I bought lasted one month before the light went out. It wasn't the bulb so I returned it to Toys R us. The next one I bought the light show did not work at all. I returned that one too. I tried one more time and the light show only lasted for five minutes. I called Fisher Price to complain and they haven't heard of any problems with it. I also had a problem with the clicking noise but only on the third product. So now I am in the process of looking for another monitor. I wouldn't waste any time or money on this product. It was a good idea if it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Disappointing...","review":"Great concept, the light show would be very entertaining for my baby. However, the monitor does not work well as a monitor. I agree with everyone else about the annoying clicking sound. Not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good","review":"I like the light show and the music. We can hear the babies fine, but there is a lot of interference on both channels (the next room away) and such a HORRIBLE clicking noise that comes from both the receiver and the base unit regardless of if we are using new batteries, old batteries or have it plugged in. I wish I wouldn't have thrown the package away before we used it for a while first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, miserable product","review":"We were so excited about the concept of the light show, remote activation, and 2 way communication....but alas, the only part that worked correctly was the light show. As a monitor, we had to turn it up all the way just to hear our son cry, and the constant loud electrical pulsating snapped my nerves in about 5 minutes.....We tried 3 of these monitors, hoping it was just a defect in one, but unfortunately, the pulsating was there in all 3. I hope they improve the technology - I'd be right back to buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems galore!","review":"I bought this item mostly for the two-way communication feature (for my husband and I to use when on different floors, not for me to talk to the baby). My husband immediately noticed the clicking noise on the receiver. I had never had a baby monitor before and thought this was normal--based on all the reviews below, I guess it isn't!I had a problem that no one else seems to have had. . .not always, but several times, when I turned on the music/projector show, it acted like it had a short or a loose wire and cut in and out very quickly. Instead of being soothing. . it was scary! I took it back to the store and got a new one, but it did the SAME THING! So I took it back again and am looking for something else. Ironically, my neighbor who has twin girls that are just three weeks older than my son bought it and she had problems with it, too. She also returned it and got a second one that still had the problems.Don't buy this product--waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"My wife and I tried to do as much research as possible in an attempt to give our baby the best. Out of all the purchases for our new daughter, this item is definitely the worst and cheapest made product. There is a continuous clicking, humming sound that cannot be deleted no matter what channel you put the monitor on. There is also continuous feedback from outside interference- sometimes you may hear people talking. We live in a small neighborhood w/o a lot of air/mobile traffic etc, so we can't understand where the feedback comes from. The clicking sound is worst of all because it drowns out the babies noises/cries. The light show is ok but not a great picture. The soothing sounds, as someone else wrote, is very annoying and cheap. Please look into other brand names. This one is a dud. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Annoying!!","review":"I purchased this monitor because I thought it would be nice for the light show and two way radio.

Well they were all wrong! This monitor is the worst monitor. It has terrible static as well as a terrible loud buzzing sound. I was determinded that something must be wrong with the monitor so called Fisher Price and asked and come to find out that famous buzzing that everybody is complaining about is the motor that is in the base and it is being transmitted through the receiver. There is nothing that can be done about it. This keeps me and my husband up more then the baby crying, if we can even hear her! Terrible product big waste of money.

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this monitor- it is a definite waste of money!!!","review":"We registered for this monitor before I could find any reviews because it was so new. I was unsure but I really thought the options would be great! Boy was a ever wrong! This thing is so loud with static that it actually wakes up my baby. I found this to be true with or without a cordless phone in the house. To add to my mistake, I like some of the others no longer have the box.

The projector and music seemed to go on and off with my baby's crying and sometimes for no apparent reason. Its going back to Babies R Us tomorrow... still looking for a good monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE NOISE! DO NOT BUY!!!","review":"My husband and I registered for this monitor when we were expecting our son. The Fisher-Price name and great features lead us to believe it was the best monitor on the market. Boy were we WRONG!!! The light show enamored us but the clicking noise, buzzing and constant interference (especially with our phone) drove us crazy!!! We immediately returned it and bought a new one thinking it was just a \\"bad apple\\". No such luck! We returned the second one and bought the less fancy Fisher-Price Sound 'N Lights monitor. It has NO interference, buzzing or clicking and it comes with two monitors-very helpful regardless of the size of your home! It's great not having to constantly unplug and move a receiver when you're moving from room to room cleaning or whatever. GET THE SOUND AND LIGHTS MONITOR INSTEAD!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointment","review":"After lots of research on monitors my husband and I chose this one for the extra gadgets like the light show, two way intercom etc. However, we too experienced after a few times using, an annoying pulsing noise that according to fisher price is always going to be there and is on all thier two way receptor monitors.Secondly the light show and music will go on automatically when my son exerts a high pitched noise AKA he screams. The problem is the lights stop after a few seconds which causes my son to scream louder until it comes back on. Now he has figured this out if he screams he quickly looks up to the ceiling to ensure he was successful, if no lights show he screams again. This as you can imagine is annoying and does not allow him to sooth himself back to sleep! Fisher Price said this was an \\"added unintentional bonus\\", not in my book!! I suggest a different monitor, unless you can get used to annoying pulsing and a possessed monitor which comes on and turns off by itself!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL","review":"Can't decide what was worse, the clicking noise or the fact that it turned itself on, or that I could not hear a THING on it!!

There is a constant clicking sound in the monitor. My complaint is the so-called \\"soothing\\". When you have the monitor set to \\"soothe\\" the light show or music or both comes on when the baby cries. The problem is, everytime it hears a loud noise it starts over again. In other words when a baby is crying, \\"Waa waa waa\\" The monitor stops and starts over and over again. This makes a frustrated baby even more frustrated and does not soothe them in any way! I like the light show but I think I will exchange for a good monitor and something else with a light show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"My dad bought this for our newborn son. I was so excited about all its neat features esp. the light show which my son enjoyed from day 1. However, as its main purpose as a monitor- it stinks! We could hardly hear my son who was in the other room due to this clicking noise. It didn't disappear even if we changed its location or outlet. As I read the other reviews, everyone complained about the same clicking noise. I was so disappointed since my son loved it. We had to return it and I purchased the 900 mHz vibrating monitor which was awesome.

Save your money, babies cost to much to throw away money on junk like this!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"static","review":"We took the monitor back twice. Then we finally called the fisher price hotline. The hotline told us that this monitor would have the static in the background because of all the fancy stuff it does. Seems strange they know it causes an interferance in hearing baby...but hey, you get the fancy sounds and light show, etc...safety wise, this monitor should be put in the toy aisle and not with all the safety baby stuff. I plan on buying a different one, probably a fisher price with it concentrating on baby and not all the other fun stuff. I can entertain baby without all that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It has a mind of its own!","review":"When baby cries the monitor's lights and sounds go on and off and on and off.... (It's supposed to go and and stay on to soothe baby) There's too much static and when you have the parent unit on battery power it makes a LOUD clicking noise.Baby does like to look at the projection on the ceiling but we had to get another monitor (900 mHz - love it!) to monitor.Don't waste your $ on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"No use","review":"I could not use this monitor because it had a lot of static, and it kept making a knocking noise, so I could not hear my baby at all! Sometimes the soothing sounds would come on by itself, actually waking the baby. I bought a different monitor (the vibrating model) also by Fisher Price and it works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Features - BAD Static","review":"The features that prompted me to register for this item seemed so baby and parent friendly. I was hoping I would be one of the lucky few that had this monitor work as promised. However, the rhythmic static I experienced was unbearable. I exchanged it for the Fisher Price Sounds N Lights with 2 receivers and I am very happy I made the switch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static Machine","review":"This monitor has alot of nice features but one feature it is missing is clarity.We have a quiet baby and a monitor thats noisy.There is a constant hissing and whirring when you turn it on, unlike the new 900mhz one we bought and can hear a pin drop in the babies room."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is horrible.","review":"Like many folks, my wife and I bought this monitor for the cool light show. Well, that's the only good thing about the monitor. The constant static and the clicking noises made it very difficult to filter out the baby's noises. We took this back and bought the FP Sights and Sounds for [less] and got an extra receiver. The Sights and Sounds monitor is excellent, very sensitive, and no interference. It is also smaller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was so disappointed in this monitor. It is so noisy!!! The only good thing about this monitor is the soothing button that allows you to play music to the baby. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"new mom","review":"I bought this monitor for all the fancy features, but I ended up returning it the very next day. There was a constant clicking noise, that sounded just like a LOUD clock, which kept me up all night. I called the company and they said that this is a problem with all the monitors of this type. I ended up buying the Light and Sound monitor from the same company, and I'm very happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Boat as Everyone Else","review":"We received the Soothing Dreams as a shower gift about 8 months ago. When we started using it about 6 months ago we had the same problems, terrible reception, static and constant bulbs burning out. Last week we saw the same product under the name of Sweet Dreams (also from fisher price) with a New Arrival sign on it. I purchased the new unit on 12/27/03 and it burned out on 01/02/04. I tried to call FP and was disconnected due to heavy call volume after waiting 10 minutes on hold. They need to seriously review this product and offer some sort of compensation for owners who no longer have the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It!!!","review":"I registered for and received this monitor and unfortunately I already threw the box away so I can not return it. I too heard a clicking &amp; buzzing noise that I could not get rid of. I do like the music &amp; light show but the &amp;quot;nature sounds&amp;quot; it plays sounds more like static. The biggest reasons I wanted this was to display the light show for my baby boy and to hear my him while he was sleeping in his crib but it only picked him up when he was crying which everyone can hear without the monitor! I was just going to keep it until I tried a unit that was simpler and $30 cheaper and the cheaper unit enabled me to hear even the faintest cooing noise he made. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS UNIT, you'd be better off buying a sound and light show machine in addition to a cheaper monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost useless","review":"I was given this item and found the monitor aspect extremely poor quality. It has terrible reception and the listening device clicks constantly. The ceiling projection is very sweet though, so we bought a Clear and Near monitor with infinitely better sound quality and a rechargeable receiver and I leave the Fisher Price monitor set up just as an image projector."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$","review":"This product should be recalled!!! Within two weeks of bringing our son home, the light bulb burned out. We quickly discovered that the bulb can not be easily replaced. There was a constant clicking sound from the first day and within six weeks, the reception worsened to the point of pure static. The interference with our cordless phone was obscene -- far worse than the new monitor I've purchased since."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Baby Product","review":"We bought this for our new twins and have regretted not buying a simple monitor. The two way feature works so poorly it's useless. It has startling loud bursts of static (great for sleeping babies!). The background static on the reciever is annoying, and the receiver is bulky and hard to clip onto your belt for mobility. The one good feature was the light show (in quiet mode), but it quit working before the twins were a year old. Also in one year we went through 3 light bulbs. It's one of those items that you wonder if they ever product tested before marketing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very poor monitor at too high a price","review":"Terrible reception! We live in a one bedroom apartment and the reception is horrible from a mere 15 feet. Very poor sound quality. Plus there is in fact a continuous clicking noise that never stops (see other reviews). This monitor was a complete waste of money and sadly we had to purchase another. We've tried cheaper monitors at friend's and family's houses and they are all far superior. Also the light and sound features are not all that great...you'd be better off using a different monitor in conjunction with a sound machine. I recommend that you do NOT buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea very bad reception","review":"I had recived this as a gift and of course wanted to try it out before its to late to bring it back in case of any problems. The features were great and being able to talk through them in neat. But the reception is HORRIBLE. we kept hearing this constant clicking noise that wouldn't go away. We tried to move it and to switch the channels but that didn't help. I think the features are nice but i think thats what causes all the interference with the product. I am going to take this back and get something else. For $50.00 you would think that this would work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLICK-CLICK-CLICK","review":"the thing is neat but, it has this constant click--click--click! if the click would stop i would be satisfied but it is so annoying! sometimes the click is low but other times it is so loud! i also have a friend who is having the exact same problem. it is not interfearence and there is nothing i can do to stop it! i try to turn the volume down some but if it is too low i can't hear my baby! i am seriously considering returning the product. too bad, my daughter loves the light show but as a monitor it is not very good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Agreeing with the masses!","review":"(sigh) We TOO, have had trouble with this product. We have all the same problems...the spontaneous light show, the static, the clicking sound..my husband spent 45 minutes looking for the source of the clicks only to discover it was the projector unit causing the interference with our phones and computer monitor! My son loves the light show. I'm so grateful he's too young to miss it when it's gone. Luckily we read the reviews before we went back to Babies R Us to exchange for a third time. This time we're just gettin' the Geoffery bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features...Horrible quality","review":"I purchased this monitor, mainly because of the neat features and because of the manufacture. The features of this product are wonderful but the main idea of a monitor is to be able to hear your baby when you are not in the same room. The receiver makes a horrible loud clicking sound making it nearly impossible to hear the baby. It also becomes very annoying when you are trying to sleep not only because the clicking noice keeps you awake but the fact that you are not sure if it is picking up noises your baby may be making. I returned the product immediately and purchased a cheaper Fisher Price Monitor called Sounds N' Lights and it works fine. The Soothing Dreams Monitor would be great if Fisher Price could fix the bugs in it. I would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"All it needs is to be 2.4 Ghz","review":"This monitor is really entertaining BUT it does not work well as a monitor because of the loud static. It sounds like you are trying to tune into a radio station on AM. If you want it for entertainment it is great, but if you want it for a monitor don't waste your time buying it. The best monitor I have found after trying 3 different monitors is the 2.4 Ghz monitors. Ours works perfect!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, Bad Monitor","review":"The idea of this monitor sounded great; a light show, music, being able to talk back to the baby. However it has very bad reception. As does other monitors I have tried. Forget about trying to get your baby to sleep, I couldn't sleep with the constant fuzz sound and clicking. You can barely hear anything unless something is talking right into it...Spend your money on something more practical and more efficient like a set of intercoms..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"We regesitered for this monitor because we thought that the \\"soothing option\\" was neat. What a waste of money. The monitor would turn on by itself, playing music and it's light show, in turn waking our sleeping baby. When it was not turning itself on, the clicking/buzzing noises were keeping me awake at night. I strongly recommend a different monitor. I am so happy I kept my receipt and was able to return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste!!","review":"I got this as a shower gift because I registered for it. I wish I had read the reviews before hand. I also wish I had saved the box so I could try to take it back. The soothing feature doesn't even turn on when my baby cries, and the static and interference make it impossible to sleep. I also can't hear the baby until he is crying hysterically. Kind of defeats the purpose. I sure wish I could trade it in for something else. After all this was not the cheapest monitor around. I just feel bad because my friend wasted all of that money on it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"CLICK CLICK CLICK","review":"i have done everything to stop this horrible constant clicking noise on the hand set..sometimes it gets so loud i turn the volume down! it clicks constantly and you can hear the baby unless she is screaming loud to over power the clicking. i am dissappointed about this especially for the price of it. too bad, my daughter loves the light show. she is 2 1/2 months old but i cant take this clicking anymore!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soothing Dreams Monitor","review":"My daughter loved having the projections on the ceiling as a baby; so I was thrilled to find the projection/monitor for my son. Unfortunately, I ended up returning this item because the projector did not work after a few days, I changed the light bulb (which took forever, with all the unscrewing the tiny screws they use) but again a few days later it went out. I gave it a second chance with an even exchange, but the second projector did the same thing. I ended up returning it again and went with a separate monitor and projector which ended up costing less."},{"rating":"1","title":"And they call this thing a \\"monitor\\"???","review":"Horrible - I can't believe Fisher Price actually markets this as a \\"monitor.\\" If all you are looking for is entertainment for your baby, then by all means, spend the money and buy this. If you are concerned about hearing your baby when he/she needs you, DO NOT BUY THIS. The noises and light show are nice, but if you can't hear the baby to know when to turn them on, what good is the monitor?? Just as the other reviews state, the \\"clicking\\" noise the receiver emits when it is on is incredibly irritating and drowns out any noises your baby may be making. To avoid interference and static, the receiver's volume has to be so low you can't hear what's going on in the nursery! We returned this and bought the Sony Baby Call monitor and it is PERFECT - NO static, NO background noise, NO interference. AND, it's cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Soothing to who?","review":"This product is great for the light show, and the FX. But it is not very good as a monitor. The sound is static filled, and there is no way my husband or I could sleep with the receiver in our bedroom! We kept it because our daughter loves to watch the light show, but had to buy a second monitor so that we could hear her. I wouldn't recommend for anything other than a nursery toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be deceived!","review":"I loved the description of this product and did not take the time to research it. Yes, my baby loves the light show (I personally have not had difficulty with positioning it) and I like both the night sounds and the songs. BUT the two way doesn't work on ours, there is intermittent loud clacking no matter how we adjust it, and there is a constant hum no matter where we place the receiver. We have been really disappointed with this product. I wish I had kept the box so we could return it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree - don't waste your money","review":"We registered for this monitor and thought that the projector and music features would be nice.However, we can't get beyond the constant humming heard in the monitor, which sometimes makes it difficult to hear the baby.Definitely a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME!","review":"We got this as a gift and could not wait to use it. We were very happy with how well the remote worked for the night-light/music and light show. Our baby loves to fall asleep to music and we could be in the other room to turn it on for her. But, as a monitor we could never hear her over the loud click. We returned it for a new one and it happened again. We called Fisher Price they told us it's ment to do that so you know the unit is on. Then one night our friends came over with their baby and monitor(another product) and we were shocked how clear it was. So we returned ours and got the 900 MHz Vibrating Monitor. This one is very good! Now we play a cd for her each night and she is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Monitor","review":"This is a bad choice for a monitor. For the price that this monitor cost, I expected it to pick up my baby and rock him back to sleep! However, it didn't work as a monitor and was impractical as a light show.ALl i heard was static on the monitor. I couldn't even hear the baby above the static. So, we quit using it as a monitor.Light and sound show....it's eerie....it goes off all by itself...so we have to leave it unplugged or it wakes the baby. We use it once in a great while as a light show. And to do that, we have to balance it on the crib so the baby can see it.I would highly recommend another monitor...especially one a little cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend product","review":"I had a problem with bursts of static coming through the transmitter of this monitor in the nursery. I could understand there being static on the receiver, but not the transmitter that was in the nursery. I called Fisher Price who said that was normal and it had to be interference within my home or around it. I had already tried everything - positioning it differently, changing channels, disconnecting cordless phone,etc. I gave it to a friend who had the same problem and returned it. I purchased another 900 mz monitor (First Years) that works perfectly in my house. I was very disappointed with the Soothing Dreams Monitor and Fisher Price's response to my concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointed!","review":"We registered for and received this monitor at our baby shower. Thankfully, we followed the instructions and tested it out before our baby was born. We were thoroughly disapponted in the performance of this monitor. The sound clarity and reception were terrible - it only picked up loud noises, not faint ones (so the baby would have to be hysterical before we could hear it) and the receiver had a constant clicking noise that didn't go away no matter what we tried. We've returned it and bought the Safety 1st Super Clear monitor, which we already tested and were completely satisfied with. Don't be taken in by the extra features of the Soothing Dreams Monitor, stick with the basics and you'll be better off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE NOISE!","review":"I am not happy with this monitor. It makes a loud clicking noise through the receiver and has made a loud static noise that even woke up my baby. I was told by the company that the clicking noise is a trait of this particular monitor. The only thing I do like is the light show. I definatly do not recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby friendly, not parent friendly","review":"This was my second monitor in a 2 week time. My son loved the music and the light show, but mom and dad could not take the loud and unbearable static noise at all hours of the night. I first tried the safety first monitor and that was horrible with the amount of static it produced, tried this one with no luck, and finally ended up with the even flow monitor that works beautifully with no clicking or static to be heard"},{"rating":"1","title":"I like Fischer Price, however,,,","review":"I put this baby monitor on my registry without really looking at other monitors because I thought the light show would be interesting for the baby to look at. I really like Fischer Price products, however, I would not recommend this particular monitor to a new parent. We never took the opportunity to use the light show and there is a constant hum that drones from the monitor. There are also sudden bursts of loud static from the receiver portion that is kept in the baby's room.I went to Toys R Us to purchase another monitor and ended up purchasing a Sony monitor that I am extremely happy with. There are 27 channel settings on it, it has excellent clarity and it is super quiet. I wish the Sony monitor was listed online so that I could write a review, I would give it 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's to bad!!...","review":"It has a great light show, the sounds are terrific, but between the static, and the constant clicking noise, and the sudden burst of some horrable static, that all of a sudden comes from know where that wakes everyone in the house, I say bring it back, it's just to bad they try to improve these monitors to make them better, and end up making them so bad that you don't want to purchase them any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"This monitor is horrible!","review":"The monitor has tons of static. The receiving end ticks in an annoying manner and it is not loud enough. The monitor needs to be right next to my ear in a silent room for me to hear it. The lights and sounds show goes on automatically when the noise level in the baby's room is high enough whether you like it or not. Also, the receiving end sits on three legs and falls over easily. I have to reach for it gingerly to turn it off and on when I feed my son at 3 am. I hate it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this monitor!!","review":"We bought this monitor for our newborn because it seemed like a really neat product. However, the receiver has an ANNOYING clicking noise that absolutely drives me crazy!!!!! Forget about sleeping with it in your bedroom. The clicking is so loud you can't hear the baby! Also, the two way button it didn't always work! We took it back for a refund and bought a less expensive model with better clarity in sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"900 Mhz Phones, monitor, etc.=STATIC","review":"As with any \\"cordless\\" product of 900Mhz or the new 2.4 Ghz, it interferes with other cordless items in your home.

I registered for it because of all the cool little features (light show, night light, songs, talk back feature). Yes, the light show and songs are good, but the monitor part is terrible! The quality of sound is so staticy!! You can hardly hear your baby and you have to listen really good to determine if they are crying, grunting, etc. I thought that maybe it was just my particular monitor, so I took it back and got another one just like it. Yes - this monitor sounded just like the old one! IT was awful! ... The night light feature too stinks - it is so dim, we too had to put a regular night light in the room. Don't buy this monitor if it's a clear, good quality sound you want. You won't get that with this monitor. It needs to come off the shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there anything less than 1 star?!","review":"This monitor is the worst ever I think. There is so much noise coming from the receiver that my husband and I couldn't sleep with it going. We slept on a couch outside of our baby's room till we could get a new monitor. Don't waste your time or money on this. The light show is pretty neat, but the noise cancels out anything good about the special features. I feel guilty we put it on our registry and someone bought it for us. I feel like giving them their money back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible reception","review":"We registered for this monitor based on a recommendation from a new first time mom. I received it as a baby shower gift and it is going back to the store. We plugged it in and placed it next to the crib. I walked downstairs and turned on the receiver only to hear static and clicking. We tried the other frequency and only heard more static. The light show and music is cute, however I can't listen to that static. It is going back ASAP!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great monitor","review":"My son LOVES the light show that this monitor puts on the ceiling, and the cricket sounds seem to relax him. My problem with this monitor is that there is a constant clicking noise in the receiver, and the main unit has VERY loud bursts of static. It is very diificult to hear my son over the noise that the unit makes. I was told that the clicking noise in the receiver was beacause of a low battery, but I have taken the battery out and just plugged it in and it still clicks. Another problem is that when the receiver is not plugged in the batteries die very quickly. Overall I would not recommend this monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and un-reliable","review":"Constant static clicking noise heard from remote end when on.

Unfortunately, the static and continual clicking has drove both my husband and myself crazy! If you plan on using the receiver without the AC adapter, stock up on batteries! It continues to go dead after only 8 hours of use on battery. The light show is cute, however the music is too loud and cannot be adjusted. I'm off to Target to buy a new monitor...this one will be going on sale on Ebay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Feedback, static, not flexible enough","review":"I was disappointed with this monitor on several levels. The first complaint is that on the reciever end, I heard a continual beat of static. It goes on and on. Then after about 20 minutes or so, feedback bursts across my daughters end, waking her from her peaceful slumber. I really enjoyed being able to talk to her from downstairs. That is why we bought this one. The images that project onto the ceiling didn't go on our ceiling. We have angled walls and the projecter just wasn't as flexible as we needed. It should go not only back and forth, but side to side as well. Love the soothe mechinism. Hate the draw backs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend a little less and get a better quality monitor","review":"I loved this monitor when we 1st got it. It was nice because of the music & the lights. Then I realized there was no volume control for the music. My son was born a year ago today and a month ago the handset stopped working properly! Lately the static has gotten so bad its been almost impossible to use. Someone else said something about clicking constantly, which is VERY annoying. I am getting ready to throw mine away & buy a new one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ready to throw it out the window at night!!","review":"I have used this monitor for 7 months and I'm ready to throw it out the window at night. My baby sleeps through the night but I don't because of this darn monitor.

We bought it in spite of all the bad reviews that I read about on the website. I was intrigued by the light show that it projects on the ceiling. First of all, the feedback is terrible, and with all the clicking you can't even hear the baby! One night, I was awaken at 3am with the sound of Beethoven in the next room! I walked in to the nursery to find our baby wide awake with the music from the monitor blaring and a light show on her ceiling! It look me over an hour to get her back to sleep. I strongly recommend that you do not buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a dream come true","review":"I have read all the other reviews and quite frankly I am in shock! I have a three month old baby who absolutely adores the light show on the ceiling, it puts him right to sleep! I don't find it noisy at all, and the convenience of the remote control to turn it on from your bedroom is an added bonus that gives mother's like me(who love there sleep) an easy extra half an hour in the morning!!

I tried to get some help from Fisher-Price and they said that's just the monitor and it's not covered by the warranty.

I put a battery in the monitor the first night so I could take it in the living room, and bedroom without the hassle of plugging it in and out. The battery was DEAD in 1 night and it was clicking so loudly, I had to turn it off. In the middle of the night while, the baby, my husband and myself were in a sound sleep, the music and light show went off 2 times, startling all three of us awake.

I will keep it soley for the light display, but I have purshased the Safety 1st Crystal Clear monitor ... and it is 100% better. Sometimes you can't trust because it costs more means it is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"stop..read this before you think about buying this moniter!","review":"my husband and I thought this moniter would be great with all its soothing features for our daughter...so we registered for it. What we found is this moniter is terrible! All you hear when the moniter is on is this horrible clicking noise.. and the volume has to be pretty much maxed to even hear this! When you do hear your baby its hard to tell if it is a cry or just a cough! The soothing dream features are great my daughter loves the projection, Its a great TOY...but we wanted a MONITER! Unfortunally, we can not return it for another since the box was thrown away by well meaning relatives who cleaned for me while I was in the hospital. So we are stuck with this one untill we have extra money for a new one ..untill then I depend on my hearing which has inproved 100% since I cant depend on my moniter to help out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good! by a mom in New Jersey","review":"Like the other reviews, the bulb blew before my daughter was even born!, the music will start playing by itself (I thought a ghost was turning it on), and there is a clicking noise and some static from the receiver.

It sounds like a great product because of all the neat features, it just doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"We got this monitor as a gift. It has a ticking noise that is annoying, sometimes you can't hear your baby crying and sometimes the music will start playing or it will suddenly come on with a loud static noise. Sometimes it wakes my boys up with the sudden loud static noise. The only thing I like is the lights on the ceiling and the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was very excited when I received this product at my baby shower! Once I used it my feelings changed. We get so much static, humming and pulsing that it has to be turned down so that we can sleep. The monitor also starts playing music when the nursery is quiet, waking the baby. I tried to return it to Fisher Price but they would not take it because it technically is not defective. I do like the light show and am looking forward to using it when my daughter is a little older."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible clicking noise","review":"This monitor looked like it was going to be really good. I really liked how it had the projector and the soothing music/noises, however, those features are not worth the horrible clicking noise you have to listen to while trying to monitor your child. I called Fisher-Price and told them what was happening and they told me that the reason this was happening was because it was a two-way monitor. In other words you can talk to your child through the receiver. They told me that they do make a different model of this monitor that does not have the talk feature that does not make this horrible clicking noise. Fisher-Price was very helpful and they will let you send this monitor back for a refund voucher for other Mattel/Fisher-Price items. I definately do not think this monitor is worth the $50 it costs. I will definately be sending this monitor back to Fisher-Price for a refund voucher and will be buying a different monitor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Soothing","review":"I bought the Soothing Dreams Monitor for my Grandson when he was a baby. The light show on the ceiling and the music that it plays is wonderful. Now that he is two years old, he can push the button to play the music and lights on his own. This is how he falls to sleep every night. When we took him travelling, we brought his monitor with us and he went to sleep in the strange room and strange crib just as though he was at home. He now talks about the stars and the moon when the lights are shining on the ceiling. This has been one of the best purchases that I've ever made. I would recommend this to anyone with an infant."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have that clicking sound too!","review":"I bought this for my daughters nursery and my monitor has the same clicking sound that others are talking about.

My daughter (four months old) absolutely loves to watch the lights. I don't use the music, I play a classical music cd instead. However, the monitor part of it is HORRIBLE!! Our bedroom is only three feet from my daughter's and I cannot hear through the monitor. There is a constant clicking sound and a high-pitched buzzing. When my daughter does make a noise, I can't even hear it through the monitor because of the loud clicking. We haven't used this since we received it (as a montior), just as a light show. I would definitely recommend buying a different monitor and then buy one of those new &quot;light show&quot; toys that are available from many different companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE","review":"Apparently if you have a cordless phone in your house (and I don't know many that don't) you can't use this product. I called Fisher Price regarding this issue and this is what they told me.

SO I followed her instructions and moved it right into the garbage. Get a different monitor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much static!","review":"While the walkie-talkie feature of this baby monitor is nice, I am very disappointed in this product due to a static issue. Nearly every 15 minutes, a burst of static (loud enough to wake a sleeping baby) emits from the base monitor unit (in the nursery). I am going to attempt to return the product to Fisher Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, terrible product","review":"I registered for this monitor mainly due to the Fisher Price brand - thinking that the quality would be good and that the biggest difference between monitors was the features. Boy, was I WRONG! I agree with other reviewers - the clicking noise is not only non-stop, it is quite loud and annoying. We also never did get the \\"talk to your baby\\" feature to work AT ALL. The light show was nice, but not worth all the other drawbacks and honestly, the \\"soothing sounds\\" (mainly cricket chirps) were pretty annoying and not soothing in any way.We returned ours to BRU yesterday and came home with the Sony Baby Call Monitor (also available from sony.com) - what it lacks in \\"features\\", it more than makes up for in clarity and range! Although, our baby hasn't arrived yet, we tested it with whispers and it's FANTASTIC! A much better quality product (for the same price)!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't use it as a monitor","review":"I received this as a gift at my shower and love the idea of it. However, we live in an apartment complex and the static is so bad on both channels that it is unusable as a monitor. Additionally, it has a ghostly tendency to turn itself on. While someone's garage door opener is the likely culprit, it is very unnerving to hear nighttime cricket sounds start coming out if it -- especially when you are on the opposite side of the room. Still, my son likes the light show, so we are probably going to hold on to it and play with its other aspects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static....","review":"I received this monitor as a shower gift that I registered for. Well, I love the idea of the light show and nature sounds, but the monitor just didn't work in our home. I am not sure if it is our plaster walls or just the monitor but I heard nothing but static since I turned it on, even right outside the baby's room. So now I have to return it, hopefully I'll find something that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"A few glitches...but still totally worth it!","review":"Over the course of two children, we have used about a half dozen monitors - either given to us or ones that we have purchased. I am convinced that this monitor got my second child to SLEEP THROUGH THE NIGHT! Once he was old enough and I was confident he could go without eating for more than 2 hours, I would remotely turn on the light show when he would start crying...within a week, he was sleeping 8 to 9 hours. At 2 1/2 months I think that's pretty good. Ever since, it has been smooth sailing. When he wakes up and starts to cry, it goes on by itself. I have noticed the clicks and buzzing noises occasionally, but for us it hasn't been a problem. All the monitors I have used have had some issue - whether static or volume or range. Some issues are worse than others. This monitor's benefits outweighed the negatives for us. Give it a try!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!","review":"I was excited when I first bought this monitor because of all the features it has. Well, first of all in order for the baby to even see the light show the monitor has to be very close to the crib and it has no crib attachments. I ended up having to put it on a shelf and angle the monitor just right and brace it up just so that the picture would show above the crib. Also, it has a nightlight. You might as well have a separate nightlight because it's not enough light for ANYTHING. I can hear my baby well in the monitor....that is when the monitor doesn't start clacking. It has a loud clacking noise that starts for no reason and it doesn't stop on either channel. Even when it's not clacking it has a constant loud hum. I will be taking this monitor back soon. Please don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The light show was great - my baby really enjoyed it. However, the monitor feature was terrible. There was a constant whirring/clicking sound that would sometimes get very loud. It was impossible to sleep with this monitor on.

I called Fisher price and they said that their testing also showed the monitor problems I discussed (but not the light show going on by itself)..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Idea but very POOR quality for now.","review":"I'm a broker of electronic computer parts and accessories. I test and review items before the company I work for sells them. This item is being returned due to it's poor quality and will not be resold by the company I work for. It constantly has a pulsing noise to it and you can not hear your child over the noise.

The monitor does not stand up well - we have knocked it over several times in the middle of the night. 2. The volume dial on the monitor is difficult to turn and has contributed to the monitor falling over whenewver we try to adjust it. 3. It makes a clicking noise when it is on. 4. Every once in awhile there is this loud blast of static coming from the nursery monitor that has woken up the baby on more than one occasion. I would recommend that people look at some other monitors before deciding on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Choose another monitor!","review":"This monitor is very poorly designed. For starters, I could really use a second receiver and there are several models out there that offer this option. Secondly, when you pick up the receiver to move it from room to room it is very difficult to avoid the \\"soothe\\" button and the \\"talk\\" button. Unfortunately, the sudden soothing music is enough to wake them from a sound slumber. Finally, the cute stand for the receiver does not do it's job and in order to get the receiver to stand upright you have to place it down very carefully. Most importantly the static is very loud. I have grown accustomed to falling asleep to the pulsating sound of the static of the monitor but when I have it in the living room I need to turn up the volume on the television to drown it out. I almost have a hard time hearing my baby over the sound of the static. There are plenty of choices of monitors out there and I would highly recommend choosing another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea bad aounds","review":"While I think that Fisher-Price had a great idea while putting this monitor together. Something is not quite right about a monitor that receives a horribly annoying clicking\\\\static sound on the receiver, no matter where it is used.We had a cheaper model of an unnamed Monitor that went bad on us. We decided to get this unit to sooth our baby with the video, sounds and my wife's voice. Unfortunately the interference was so loud we could barely here anything out of the monitor when we tested it. My wife talking into the monitor produced a extremely muffled choppy sound on the other end. We tested this monitor from all different locations, including our house, my mother in-laws house and the store, with two different units, when we tried to swap the unit for a new one.

The soother (projector) feature of the monitor turned itself on all the time and it was also extremely easy to bump the button on the parents handset and turn it on accidentally. My other complaint is how noisy it was. Constantly, the monitor would make a horrible scratching sound in the middle of the night and scare both me and my baby. The handset also made a clicking noise on several occasions. My last complaint about the handset is that it is too bulky to clip on to your pocket and carry around.

The good feature is the light show it projects onto the ceiling. The bad ones are:* loud static background noise* loud knocking noises (usually when you're trying to sleep)* the talking feature because it just freaks the baby out when they can hear your voice and not see you (plus it sounds warped, so it won't sound familiar to baby)* the \\"soothing\\" light show & music feature turns itself on without warning causing a sleeping baby to awakeGet the Sony, \\"Baby Call\\" monitor.

I do take it outside and hose it down and give it a good scrubbing every once in a while.Overall, holds up very well. No problems with the zipper. I did break a piece of the frame. (my fault)FYI..this is a good stable product, for what it is. If you put it in an area with a lot of foot traffic, and your like me and could trip over it, go for something with a sturdy build.

I had purchased the multicat littermaid and the unit barely fit inside. I can not easily add new litter as it will not pull in and out. I also had to cut the front panels with a razor to flip up the entire front panels in order to pull the unit out even an inch.No way will I be able to take it apart to clean the plastic or the litter that has fallen to the floor of the tent.

The pieces were cut too small; the gap between the two sections was over an inch. When I pulled and pulled to make the two sides of the zipper connect, it barely touched.

However, I am still able to use the tent with one corner broken (this is actully the only reason I can zip it).

The only good thing I can say is that we have had the tent for about a year and a half and my (big-boned) 15 lb cat makes the top of the tent a regular hang out spot. I won't tempt fate by saying it hasn't b-r-o-k-e-n yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugly, flimsy","review":"The tent is made of two parts assembled with a zipper, that fit around a structure made of flimsy hollow plastic rods. The problem lies in the structure, which is not strong enough to withstand the weight of an average cat. If your cat likes exploring and climbing on top of things like most cats do, the frame will break quickly.If you're minimally handy, you can very easily make yourself a much better structure using PVC piping and joints (they're inexpensive and can be found in the plumbing section of any hardware store). If your cat is heavy and a climber, I would strongly suggest not even bothering with the supplied frame and building your own right away.Another irritating problem is that replacing the waste receptacles is extremely inconvenient when the littermaid is in the tent.All in all, unless you absolutely have to hide the littermaid, this tent is poorly designed and more trouble than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Littermaid","review":"Well, I can't believe I was gullible enough to buy this.

And it's quite large, so if you're storing the litter box in a closet, for example, this item is not for you.However, I found that it does give the cat some much needed privacy if the box is in an open area like a garage or laundry room. It's also great for disguising the box, ditto. Definitely suits my needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frame for the Littermaid","review":"The tent is great and does help keep litter down. The frame is cheap and cats do like to hop up on top of the tent plus you can't buy just an extra frame anywhere that I have found.

We recently ordered a new tent because we moved. The new tent poles are thinner (cheaper) and some of them actually arrived slightly bent. After assembly they bent more radically and finally after about two weeks the framework was bent and collapsing. I contacted the manufacturer and sent them photos. They told me they didn't have any of the older more substantial models and all they could do was ship out another tent. I also tried a do it yourself fix by trying to locate new pvc pipe at the hardware store and guess what!?... the diameter is neither 1/2\\" or 3/8\\" - it is non-standard. This product has become totally useless. Don't wait your time or money or emotional energy with this purchase.

When I put the tent together, it tore as I put it onto the plastic braces. They sent me another one (after an extremely rude customer service agent). About March, the zipper began to seperate. Tonight, it seperated completely. Unfortunately, there is no way to change the litter in the box without unzipping the top and removing the cover. So, the zipper cannot withstand the wear and tear. I'm going to try to get customer service to send me another one, as this is the only tent that will fit my model of littermaid.

We ordered this for our Litter Maid Elite and after 45 minutes of trying to get the zipper zipped on this \\"tent\\", we come to realize the litterbox will not fit in this thing and cannot be taken out easily for cleaning. Forget about being able to unzip to clean the box- the zipper does not come together in some places so you have the chance of litter making its way onto the floor.I always read reviews and try to not pay too much attention to the negative reviews, but this thing truly deserves no stars insted of the one I had to give it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive piece of junk","review":"The things that broke before it was done being assembled:1. The cheap plastic frame2. The cheap flimsy zipper3. The cheap plastic canopyI wish I had kept the box so I could have returned it. In addition to it being cheap and flimsy, once it is on, it is so difficult to clean the cat litter box that it renders an automatic litter box useless. Just cleaning out the litter box would be a backbreaking, messy task. A cardboard box placed over a litter box with a hole in it would be a better investment than this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect, but does the job.","review":"The tent was relatively easy enough to assemble - but one end of the zipper broke almost immediately.

The description said that it fit LitterMaid boxes and most others. This is not correct. We have a LitterMaid Elite which will not fit inside the tent. While assembling the tent, three of the very cheap plastic rods, designed to be used as the frame, snapped and were unusable without repair. The top section is connected to the bottom section with a zipper. The zipper does not seem very sturdy at all. Bottom line is that you get what you pay for. At least we are only out $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy again!!!","review":"Putting this tent together was ridiculous, the tubing was too big for the vinyl wrapping so when trying to put it together the tubing kept cracking and breaking and finally my fiance just took out the majority of the tubing.

All in all it was a nightmare and I feel like I wasted $35."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and Doesn't Fit my SmartScoop Litter Box","review":"I bought this item thinking that it would fit over my Smart Scoop Litter Box (as amazon said it would) but it does not fit. The plastic cover is cheap and ripped while I was trying to fit it over the rods. The plastic rods are cheap and are not very sturdy. When I finally got it put together the zipper would hardly touch together so I could zip the top piece to the bottom piece. When the motor to my litter box would run, it would get stuck behind the side rods and move the entire tent across the floor. So I was unable to use the tent and now I am stuck with it, cause it ripped on the side while I was trying to put it together.

The plastic cover fits VERY tightly over the plastic rods, and it was impossible to zip the bottom of the tent to the top as either the rods are too long or the plastic is too short. Because we could not fully assemble the product, we didn't use it over the Littermaid box; however, it would be so cumbersome to use that, even if we had been able to assemble the product, we would not have used it due to the difficulty of maintaining the litterbox. A company who designed such a practical, time-saving product as the Littermaid litterbox certainly failed in the design of this privacy tent. It is frustrating to assemble and would add a considerable amount of time to the maintenance of the litterbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helps reduce the odor, but not very sturdy","review":"I've had LitterMate automatic litter boxes for some years now, but this is the first time I had had the tent. On the positive side, it does an amazing job in reducing the odor.

Fortunately, the small gap doesn't seem to make any real difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's great!","review":"I've never been more pleased with a product!

The two vinyl sections had a 1/4 inch gap between the zipper strips. Calling LitterMaid customer service (NOT)was a waste of time. The service rep refused to acknowledge a possible defect in manufacture and said to return item to AMAZON. Says a lot about their product.

It looks much nicer, especially because the litter maid litter box is so big and bulky."},{"rating":"1","title":"...don't waste your money","review":"We love the LitterMaid litterbox but the tent is beyond bad. Everything about it is of poor quality. The zipper breaks easily and is difficult to zip up because the plastic tent is slightly undersized for the tent structure formed by cheap plastic rods... Flimsy to the core, the plastic rods met their death when our average sized 10 lb cat decided to explore the universe from the top of the tent.The concept is great -- privacy for the cats, spares us of seeing them do their thing, and it helps with the odor. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply made - Frame breaks easily","review":"The first time I assembled this, my cat jumped on top of it and the whole thing collapsed. I took it apart and discovered that one of the CHEAP plastic corner connectors had snapped. It's now held together with duct tape. Does Littermaid expect that cat's won't jump up on something like this that's flat on top and begs to be explored? If they do, then why is the frame made out of such fragile and flimsy plastic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget about it","review":"the privacy tent is a very clever item.well made, out of good materials, but highly impractical.the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue thanbeing able to keep the electronic cat box clean and workingproperly.this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what's happenedin the box, and to smooth the litter around now and then.this is something you'll need to be able to do.i bought it, but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket, and a few toys.my cats sleep and play in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!!!","review":"Nice concept, poorly executed.

I found the directions a little confusing to start things off and then when it came time to pull the ill-fitting vinyl over the cheap plastic frame forget it! The frame broke in two spots before I even got close to getting the vinyl on. The vinyl, after being tugged cause it just isn't the proper size is now barely in place and the stitching is coming out in different spots starting holes.

It took us about an hour, which wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so expensive. Also, it blocks the door that you have to open to empty the tray. The zipper broke. In order to clean the pan, you have to unzipper the top, so we're completely screwed. I have never seen such poor engineering and materials. Littermaid should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed!","review":"Because I have the older version of the Littermaid self cleaning litter box and have 2 cats, the privacy tent is kind of a necessity to keep the litter confined to the box. However, for what they charge for the tent, it is not very durable. I have had the Littermaid for a little over a year and a half and this is the third time I have replaced the tent. The frame is made of plastic tubing and connectors. Both my cats like to sit on top of it. One of my cats weighs about 9 lbs and she has broken the connectors several times jumping up onto it. The zipper is cheaply made as well, and it took me 20 minutes to get the teeth to mesh around the whole circumference of the tent. So when I clean it, I don't dare unzip it because I don't want to spend the time to zip it again. Unfortunately, because I need to have the tent, I have to keep replacing it. Littermaid has a newer model now which has a different tent which I hope is better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor, poor quality!!!!","review":"This tent is wonderful in theory. I was very excited when I found this product because I have a cat that likes to play in the litter box occasionally. In the process of him playing he slings litter everywhere. Well the first tent I received was missing pieces and some of the pieces were broke. I sent it back and received another within a few days. The frame assembled easily, but the tent was a pain to get on. The zipper is hard to get together, the tent sits on the frame very snug ( too snug), and my litter box didn't fit in it properly like it said it would. The frame poles snapped in two when I tried to get my litter box in it. ( I have the littermaid elite multiple cat.) I do not recommend this product at all. The quality of the frame is poor and it doesn't fit almost any litter box like they say it does!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea... Bad product","review":"I bought this product to try to cut down on the litter spread. It is a great idea to contain the litter and the smell. But the cheap plastic rods are smaller than the connectors and every one of them broke while I was trying to put it together. I had to build a new skeleton for the tent myself. I spent $30 on the product and another $30 replacing the skeleton of it. The tent is great, but not $60 great. My advice, build your own our get a pre made cabinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect privacy!","review":"This privacy tent was exactly as described and pictured.

My cats weigh 17 and 12 pounds, and it took them all of one visit inside this tent to break the cheap plastic poles.

This used to be a really good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction - bad product","review":"This product is poorly designed and difficult to assemble. The plastic rods are very weak and break easily. It was very difficult to get the tent over the rods and more difficult to zip the two tent halves together. The zipper was under stress and has weakened at several major points. The zipper 'handle' did bend under the stress. I can only imagine what stress the plastic rods are under. I worried that if one or both of my cats decide to walk on top of the tent, there will be an explosion and I'll have cat litter, plastic and cat fur all over the place! It was also hard to get the box (which is a Litter Maid box) into the tent and more difficult to get the power supply plugged back in to the box. The design would have been slightly better if Litter Maid had added a window on both sides and back of the tent to more easily accomodate the power supply.

The first tent cover tore as it was fit to the cat box. The second tent cover's frame cracked and then tore the tent cover. Because of the privacy the tent provides and the necessity to keep litter from going all over the place, this third tent cover was again necessary.

This is NOT a book about the characters in TFM, nor a behind-the-scenes peek, nor even interviews with the people involved.This is a light-hearted, frivolous look at the world of male strippers. There are silly quizzes and opinions from ordinary people but hardly anything directly referring to the movie, apart from a number of low quality black & white photos.But even if you were seriously interested in the art of male stripping, this book is just too shallow to consider. Honestly, you are better off spending the money seeing the movie again instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"An american overview of the subject viewed without any irony","review":"This book really is the type of publication that gets you no closer to the subject. If you enjoyed the film then this book just won't be for you. The words 'jumping on a bandwaggon in the hope of cashing in' come to mind. Far better to read the screenplay of the film, which is fully illustrated and contains contributions from the director and writer Simon BeaFoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for newborns","review":"I received this product as a gift and it is great for newborns. I ended up also purchasing one of those foam cushions for about $5 and it made bathtime so much easier on me since he didn't slip. He is perfectly content and LOVES bath time. Unfortunately it is now getting a bit too small for him at 7 months old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tub, but fast outgrown","review":"I love this tub. The only down side of it is that it can be outgrown really fast. My son is 3 months old and I wish the tub would be bigger for him.

I didn't feel I needed anything fancier to bathe my daughter and I'm very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Safe for newborns!","review":"Great neck support for the newborn provided by the blue cushion shown in picture. The newborn will feel very comfy in this. There are two open spaces to put soap or anything you want in them. Comes with a container to put water or soap water, anything you would like to use for the baby. Stable and won't tilt over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect tub for baby","review":"I purchased this tub for my third child. I think it's great, the padding is much better then the foam that was used a few years ago (it doesn't get cold)on baby baths. It fits over the kitchen sink so draining is easy and after the bath you can easily rinse it out and it dries with a towell. The little cup holders are great for holding the soap and shampoo. The thermometer is a handy idea, once you have figured out the right temp that baby likes just look at the thermometer and remember the degree for the next bath. The angle of the tub is perfect, baby doesn't slide down and the water doesn't come up to high. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for about a week and a half...","review":"This bathtub sounded like a great idea, and when we brought her home for the first time and gave her her first bath it *was* great. The second time, she had enough muscular control to arch her back out of the water - She absolutely HATED being on the pad in this tub! We used it very sparingly for about 4 months, being too broke to buy another one until she could sit up on her own reliably. Now she takes a bath in the kitchen sink or a big plastic tub. I'm sure other babies would like it, but ours didn't... Anyone want to buy a barely-used ergonomic baby bath?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get it, spend more for a better processor!","review":"I wanted an inexpensive food processor that I could use occasionally for preparing fruits and other foods for storage.

If you don't want the food to come out the chut well TO BAD because it does anyway! Its very frustrating! Also it does smell like something burning when you turn it one.

When it finally went to the big repair shop in the sky, B&D had earned our Brand Loyalty. So we purchased the Q&E. BIG MISTAKE!! It was noisy, flung liquids, put more veggies on the counter than in the measuring cup. It seemed I was spending as much time unjamming the &!*%!!! thing as I was trying to get items chopped.

I was wrong. It is very noisy and not very durable. In less than a year, the bowl shattered and the attachments (with the base) broke off. Cheap plastic - otherwise the motor and everything else were working just fine. A replacement bowl from B&D would cost almost the same as I paid for the whole unit. So I decided to try a more expensive Cuisinart DLC-2007 Prep 7 7-Cup Food Processor from amazon.com. It has 3 year warranty on the unit and 10 years on the motor.

I was looking for an inexpensive food processor for the occasional job that requires a food processor. Black & Decker usually makes very good appliances, and for the price I paid, I said what the heck. What a mistake! This processor sounds like it's heralding the apocalypse and after 3 uses, one of the bowl clips snapped right off. I also tried to use the continuous flow chute. About 1/4 of my chopping ended up in the processor bowl. Thankfully, it didn't explode like the other reviewers!

Grates well if you use a small amount of food at once, but forget it if you want to try to hash a couple of potatoes at once. You'll wind up with some potato mush and some potato chunks. And speaking of CHUNKS....the reason I really don't like this thing is because the slicer/shredder disk doesn't just shred, it slices all at the same time! If you want cheese shreds, be prepared for shred/chunks. The problem is that as the food passes between the shred holes on the disk, it slips down into the dull side of the slicer hole and slices at the same time! This is my first processor; maybe all of them with the reversible disk work this way. I know processors are supposed to be multi-taskes, but only when you want them to be. Geesh! This one's going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"cracked plastic","review":"Bowl made of thin plastic which gradually cracks out. Also leakage problems. Wouldn't buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very robust. Replacement parts cost MORE than the whole boxed unit.","review":"The reviewers who complain of cracked plastic are all too correct. The plastic top piece cracked under pressure (grating asiago cheese) and the bottom tub piece's edge broke as well (albeit after numerous uses) that made using it difficult.But the top piece shouldn't have cracked. Not when it's meant to grate cheese.Note, I had bought a second unit after losing the slicing blade. Ordering directly from B&D;, they wanted $35+S&H; for just the slicing blade. The local store (not walmart) had the whole unit NEW for $30. (prices may have gone down since then.)I'd buy a unit with a better tub and cover. Regular usage is going to render this an oddly shaped paperweight fairly quickly if you use it for anything more dense than onions."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.....","review":"I have only used this machine a handful of times and each time it scares me! It shakes and is dreadfully loud! The first time I shredded cheese it did fine, but each time after it got worse and worse. I could smell burning, the cheese wasn't shredded it was a paste and the plastic on the blades ended up shredded more then the cheese. It makes me wonder if I am not supposed to shred cheese in a food processor!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is horrible","review":"I used this food processor 2 times before it broke. I put a potato in and the middle of the grater blade shredded into plastic shreds. I called Black and Decker for a replacement shredder - and found out that they charge $20 for the replacement part on a $30 machine! Don't buy this - it's not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh.","review":"Amazingly loud. And the cup thing is a pain in the... to get on and off.

Then progressively, the whole bottom lip part on one side of the bowl completely cracked off. then the latches on the lid also broke, so I have to guess now when my top is latched. All of this happened within the first month of me having the food processor. I am an avid maker of hummus, and I have noticed that the motor is extremely loud(you'll want to wear ear plugs) and the hummus I made isn't even close to being smooth. It is ok at first, but the blades dull and it smells as if the engine is going to blow up. If you are only processing in pulses this machine works better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hassle","review":"I received this food processor as a Christmas gift. After the first use, I notice a crack in the handle of the bowel. If you shred anything it clogs up the chute. Carrots turned the plastic orange;I had to use bleach to remove the stain. When I tried slicing green peppers for salads, they turned out like mush. The cucumbers we fine.Over all, you get what you pay for. I like to cook, so this product is not for me. If you seldom cook and are not picky about the cut of your food, buy this. I, however, returned the processor to the store for a full refund. I am saving for a Cuisinart or Kitchen Aid, which are much more sturdier than the Black and Decker. Good Luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick n' easy it ain't","review":"Food processors are not exactly known for ease of use, but this has got to be one of the worst. It is awkward and unwieldy, leaks at every seam, and fails in what I assume to be its primary task: to chop and blend with some measure of consistency. Pay the money for a decent machine, or you're better off with mortar and pestle."},{"rating":"1","title":"A piece of junk","review":"I have had this item for about a year. I used it mainly for light things like mayonnaise, small batches of biscuit or shorthbread dough. Recently, the bowl shattered while in use. Large shards snapped off from the base and a lid clasp broke off. I investigated the cost of replacing the part and found that it was within $5.00 of the cost of a new unit. I am not shopping around for a new unit - from a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I hoped for...","review":"It does have just one rotatory blade for slice/shred.

I carefully read the ad and could find nothing stating whether it was a whole box or a single container. I concluded that no one would put a photo of a box with 12 containers if it weren't the box. I was wrong!It's too expensive to return it, but you all need to be warned that it's a single little container.

It is not elastic, it does not bounce, it doesn\`t make any noises, you can not mold it. If your break into pieces, it is not easy for a little kid to put it together again (not very adherent).

I agree. It's the cleanest, easiest, and fastest design I've seen in a long time. Carafe is drip free and the filter basket is a simple easy to use/clean design. My only quibble is that the brewing process is just a notch below the best coffeemaker (Braun KF400). I had the Braun but got fed up with it's drippy carafe and quirky filter basket.If you have little time in the morning to fight with your coffeemaker and don't want to waste a lot of time wiping up spilled coffee, this is the coffeemaker for you. I'm a cream and sugar type so the brew quality is good enough for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We have gone through three of these Black and Decker coffeemakers in the past three months.

I'm now looking for a maker with a cone style filter and a flavor selector or setting for brwing less than a full pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sounds like a truck backing up","review":"This coffee maker works just fine. My problem with it is that after the coffee is finished brewing it lets out 4 REALLY LOUD beeps that sound just like the back up warning on a garbage truck and they are that loud no exaggeration. You get treated to one more BEEP when it shuts off. I know when the coffee is ready or the coffee pot shuts off even if I'm 40 feet away outside in the garage with the door closed.

I had my last coffemaker for 13 years (Mr. Coffee). Another reviewer here says she had 4 good years with this one. 4 years is not a lot...you shouldn't have to replace your coffeemaker every 4 years...yes, this was reasonably priced and it's nice to see the water level, but other than that, I haven't been happy with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaky spout","review":"This coffee maker can brew up a good cup of coffee.

Try another model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic Idea with a Bad Design","review":"I bought my Smart Brew Plus at Target about a year ago and loved the idea I could snatch a cup of coffe while the pot was brewing. I think this is a wonderful concept that has great merit. Sadly, the carafe that comes with the system doesn't hold up to even my light daily use. The flimsy clips that hold the carafe on, broke off during the first month. I limped along for quite a while with this problem. Now, the plastic ring around the top has separated from the glass part of the carafe. As it brews, coffee gets trapped in here and is impossible to get out. A replacement carafe costs almost as much as a new pot! Additionally, the burner ring became warn after about 4 months of washing with only a damp cloth."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd Look Elsewhere","review":"We too have had awful leaks with this machine - the clock stopped working after the first leak - just a couple of months after I purchased it.

Water just stopped flowing from the reservoir into the basket all of a sudden. It worked fine yesterday.It's OK for the price, but if I had been using this thing regularly it would probably have broken after three months. Also, the carafe is cheaply made; the handle is wobbly and the lid doesn't sit on it correctly, so sometimes there's some spillage. It's also very hard to clean.If I can't fix the one I have, I might buy another one of these, but chances are I'll spring for a more reliable model, especially since I'm going to start making coffee at home a lot more often."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"This was given to us as a christmas gift(Dec 25,03), and as of this morning(march 12,04) it 'WENT HAYWIRE'!

It is easy to set up, simple to use - the timer is great. I really like the way they designed it, so that you just lift the top to put in the coffee and water. You don't have to worry about getting the filter basket back in place properly. The unit does not leak water, as some coffeemakers do; neither does the carafe. The wide pour spout on the carafe is definitely a plus. The unit is attractive, and does not take up very much counter space. Use good-quality, fresh coffee, and it will make a great cup.

Now, try taking a cup mid brew and the coffee keeps pouring out and doesn't stop like it's supposed to! It's such a lovely feature don't you think? NOT!

The plastic rim around the top of the glass carafe fills with coffee and pours out on the counter as you pour into your cup. You cannot get inside the rim to clean it, so it looks dingy. I wrote to Black and Decker about it and they say they don't actually make it at all. They farm it out. So when I wrote the appropriate company, I had a response: Tough going, we have our money-don't like it, too bad. As a result-I will not buy anything with the cover name Black and Decker again. On a more positive note: You can spill coffee faster with this pot-it makes it amazingly fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over flows!!","review":"My mother and I bought this coffee maker the same day and we both have the same problem... The filter basked over flows!!! The \\"sneak a cup\\" no-drip filter basket works TOO WELL! In fact, it doesn't allow the coffee to flow into the pot and therefore overflows all over the counter! If you like coffee and grounds all over your counter and in your coffee this is the one for you! If you fiddle with the drip baskets & coffee pot for an hour or so and make sure it doesn't get bumped AT ALL, you might save yourself a mess (or you might not). With my mother's machine it happened 100% of the time. With mine, I fiddled with it long enough and babysat it while it brewed, so it only happened 90% of the time...

That came a couple days later...and the lid was broken. Needless to say, I'm not asking for another replacement.I'm pretty disappointed in this machine because the coffee brewing aspects seem to work well.

If you spill coffee or water on them they will soon stop working. They are not as waterproof as they look, and even cleaning the area around them with a damp cloth can ruin them. If you want a more reliable coffeemaker, buy one with different style buttons, or better yet, one with the buttons on the top, not at the base. My Smartbrew stopped working after one year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"We've only had this coffee maker for a few weeks and it's overflowed at least 4 times! It makes a huge mess.

It's really annoying! We have tried experimenting with different grinds of coffee, from fine espresso to regular auto-drip, and it doesn't matter: we still have to scoop in more and more and MORE coffee to get anything beyond a wan, watery cup.

It only took one small drip to completely short out the control panel. It doesnt matter how many great features if the product doesnt work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spout on carafe is off center","review":"The glass carafe is poorly designed because discharge point is left of center and encourages spills. Previous models of Black & Decker coffeemakers featured a very stout and more elegant looking carafe. A carafe from an older B&W models will not fit into this coffeemaker. I'm very frustrated with this design change. I enjoyed being able make and serve multiple pots of coffee with interchangeable older B&D carafes over the years, so I am doubly disappointed with the design features in this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate this coffee pot","review":"Have been using this coffee pot for 2 months at work. Coffee isn't hot enough and absolutely hate the automatic shut off after 2 hours. I am always pouring a cup of luke warm coffee. In addition, when the top is opened after brewing, water from condensation runs down the back of the pot onto the counter. Would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Coffeemaker ever!","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS MACHINE!! I have never written a review on any product... but I feel so strongly about this that I felt the need to warn others. This is the worst coffeemaker I have ever owned. I have gone through two of these machines in the past year. The first one I owned simply stopped working after about 3 months. I called Black and Decker and they agreed to replace it... if I paid for shipping and handling. They assured me this was not typical. However, now on coffeemaker number two, I came downstairs to grab coffee before leaving for work and this one has simply stopped working as well. Will not brew coffee by turning it on manually or setting the timer. Save yourself the headaches and do not buy this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"When I received the coffemaker the sticker used to identify the switches and their functions had peeled off. I tried to put it back on but it would not stick. I tried to use the automatic timer feature so coffee would be ready when I woke but it didn't work. I could set time to start brewing but when the clock hit 12:00am it stopped. When I would wake there would not be any coffee prepared. Although it was just a matter of turning it on manually, I bought it for the automatic feature. I suppose I could have gone through the process of returning it but the hassle and turnaround time to get a new one was not worth the purchase price. I needed a new coffeemaker so I went to the local department store and bought a new one."},{"rating":"1","title":"water waster","review":"We purchased 1 of these and it broke in the first week, so we got another one. One year later, it is ready for the trash for 3 reasons: 1.It leaks about 2 cups of water onto the counter. Put in 12 cups of water and get 10 cups of coffee. The rest is leaked out from the top. 2.The beep to signal it's done brewing goes off whenever it wants, no longer signaling end of the brew time. 3.The warming plate is not hot, coffee needs to be reheated in microwave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design, but hot pad rusted through!","review":"I got my Smart Brew Plus 2 years ago. It makes a good cup of coffee, and I like the design and ease of use of the unit. However, now my hotpad is almost completely rusted through. The rusting started about a year ago. I thought it was coffee on the hotpad and tried to clean it. I previously owned a Mr Coffee for 10 years with no problems, and decided to upgrade to a machine with a timer. I am disappointed to have to replace this unit so soon. Consumer Reports gave it a great rating, but I will be buying another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Rated but an Awful Leak","review":"I purchased this item based on its very high Consumer Reports rating (a CR Best Buy). I made one pot of coffee with it and the coffee is very good. However, the carafe is made of two pieces, one part is plastic and the second is glass. Where these two parts join, I had a significant leak that caused coffee to spill all over the kitchen table. Back it goes to Amazon (who by the way has a very easy to deal with return policy). Granted, this coffee maker is very reasonably priced. However, I would be very happy to pay more for it if B&D had better quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Consumer Report, wrong on this one","review":"Consumer reports rated this coffee maker at the top. First of all going to this coffee maker from my other model you notice the coffee is not hot. After 3 monthhs the brains in this thing went nuts, shutting off when ever it decided. When I called to return there was a $7.50 charge to return the product. When the new one arrived it is lopsided and dont sit on the counter correctly. Gets very hot on bottom and not worth having a fire, you get what you pay for!!!! Sorry Balck and Decker I cant even sell it at garage sale because I dont want somebody's home to burn down!"},{"rating":"1","title":"known clock malfunction","review":"The clock does not follow normal hourly patterns. I called the Black and Decker number and asked about it. They laughed and admitted that they certainly knew about it. They were not very helpful, but Amazon refunded automatically. The coffee was not very hot either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-designed product","review":"I haven't had it long enough to judge its durability, but I am impressed by the common-sense thoughtfulness of its design. The carafe doesn't drip. The carafe handle fits your hand better than many. Markings on the carafe show both the quantity of water to put in and the corresponding quantity of coffee to expect to come out. The carafe fits closely below the basket to reduce evaporation. When you pull out the carafe in mid-brew there is no drip onto the hot plate. The basket comes out easily to dump the grounds. The water level in the resevoir can be checked from either side without opening the lid. The styling isn't quite to my taste, but I'm glad I didn't spend an extra 20 or 30 bucks on something else. And it works, and quickly. Good work, B&D."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can not get charcoal filters","review":"The machine works great. But when you need to replace the charcoal filter in the water resevoir. you will not find them in stores, You will spend the price of the coffee pot to order the filters online,when you include shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing Reliability","review":"I was attracted to the SmartBrew because of the wealth of features for a modest price. My experience proves that the old saying is right....you get what you pay for. The entire unit shorted out after being used 5 times. It seems that water can drip off the underside of the top when you open it to pour in water. It then trickles down the back of the machine and finds its way inside the electronic module in the bottom of the machine. Hence, electrical failure and possible fire and electrocution hazard. STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap for a reason","review":"As I type this, I'm drinking a cup of instant coffee that I had bought for just such an emergency: Our B&D; Smartbrew gave out after 4 months of use.The best thing about it is the pouring spout, the look, and the programmable start/stop time. After that, it's all downhill.It's very easy to put too much coffee in and get grounds overflowing and sticking to the lid. Trying to use the full 12-cup capacity with this limit on grounds makes for very weak coffee.To refill it, you have to open the lid and watch stale condensation from the previous brew spill back into the reservoir. Before long, you'll find old grounds floating in the reservoir and sticking into uncleanable crannies.The final straw came this morning when I filled the reservoir and it drained immediately onto the countertop. Can't explain it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A design disaster","review":"This lasted one day. The pour spout on the carafe has a flat spout that causes the coffee to splash everywhere when it is poured into [and around] a cup. Consequently, the cup must be placed in the sink to catch the splashes otherwise the coffee splashes would be all over your floor and counter. Worse yet, the tiny spring that should stop the brewing coffee from dripping when you pull out the carafe, simply fell out of the basket the first time I emptied the filter into the garbage can. With the cheap plastic stopper gone, there is no way to get a cup of coffee until the whole basket has been completely brewed. Unluckily. I threw away the receipt because this model replaced a previous adequate model and I assumed this model would be of comparable quality. FORGET THIS PRODUCT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I've had it","review":"My number one pet peeve with coffee makers is overflow from malfunctioning drip baskets when the coffee pot does not get seated well into the burner area. I was ready for this when I purchased this moderately priced coffee maker and was pleasantly surprised when this didn't seem to be a problem after several days. Then it happened...and it turned out not to be the coffee pot problem at all...it is the filter basket on this little gem that gets out of whack. If it gets bumped *just a smidge* it will fail to seat itself down into the well and release the drip valve and the next thing you know you have coffee all over your counter. First time it happened I thought it must have been a fluke, but no...it's happened three times now and this pot is going into the trash. The last thing I need to be doing is spending my morning mopping up coffee and grounds \\"before\\" I've had that first dose of caffiene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Criminally Stupid Design","review":"What do you get when you combine a persnickety shutoff valve with electronics below the coffee carafe? An overflowing basket, an electrical short, and three pounds of plastic and glass for the landfill.The \\"sneak-a-cup\\" feature of this pot is a good idea, but the switch that shuts off the flow is so finicky that the carafe can look and feel centered under the basket, but not allow the coffee to drip through. This means that when the auto-brew feature goes on before you wake up, the brewing coffee fills up the basket, pours out over the top, and puddles up on the counter.Now, this is a mess, and hardly what you want to face before you've had your morning cuppa, but that's not the worst of it. The soft-touch keypad is centered under the carafe, and it is not sealed around the edge, so the coffee that spills over the basket leaks directly into the electronics.In my experience, this has a permanent, negative effect on the function of the coffee maker.Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself the time, money and headaches","review":"I am an avid coffee drinker and bought this machine with hopes of a dependable coffee maker in the morning. What an absolute dissapointment! The first time brewing the brew basket clogged creating quite a mess of coffee grounds. Next effort produced quite a leaking problem. The next morning the machine completely shorted out. What an absolute waste of time and money. My impressions of Black & Decker have been dropping over the years, but I thought \\"how can they mess up such a simple design?\\" Surprise! In my estimation, Black & Decker has reached a new low with inferior products.

The sound quality is horrible, and the fans seem pretty clueless to me (sorry San Francisco); when B Levy tries to break it down with his soulfull \\"Vice Versa Love\\" (one of my alltime favorite reggae songs), you can sense his frustration with the lack of attention and respect from the fans.

Serkin brings the same radiance he delivers to Beethoven's \\"Emperor\\". Self-effacing, Serkin noted, \\"We are nothing next to the immense pieces we play... nothing, we are mere dwarfs\\". A challenging piece by any measure, Serkin's performance is well balanced with that of the orchestra, which play in harmony to produce elegant sound on this well-recorded Sony edition. While Curzon's (Decca Legends), Fleisher's (Szell/Cleveland) and Gilel's (Berlin/Jochum) stand among the benchmarks for Brahm's First, this preformance certainly holds its own. You will not go wrong owning any of the aformentioned performances.

In college (@1980) I must have listened to it 200 times. It was always my favorite. When cd's came out I was disapointed that I couldn't find this edition. I've listened to many renderings of this concerto since cd's have made their appearance. None made it to my favorites stack. Other performers sounded so perfunctory, with none of the nuances that Serkin and the Cleveland Orchestra have, so I decided my memories of the piece were better than having to listen to second-rate performances. When I found this, I ordered several to give to my musician friends who value music played well. To me, this is the best performance on record.

His latest tale of the minotaurs does not feature Kaz but his descendent Aryx. Aryx is an impressive character, but instead of developing, he constantly acted as the reluctant hero. This was a little annoying. Also there are a few parts that really drag. But what I liked was that Knaak unlike other authors in the series, he gives us new creatures. The crustacean creatures are very cool and interesting. I was glad when I found out it wasn't just going to be another book where the heroes would fight fire dragons and shadow wraiths(That was getting boring after four books of it). Other authors should learn from Knaak's creativity. Instead of sticking to the same formula, Dragonlance authors should expand their imagination in the world of Krynn. Knaak is truly one of the best, keep um comming Richard."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Dragonlance \\"Saving Private Ryan\\"","review":"Richard Knaak is a great storyteller. He knows how to keep the reader glued to the story and Reavers of the Blood Sea is a great example.The characters are well fleshed out, and you can really understand why they feel the way they do when peculiar events take place.The hero of the story, Aryx, is happy being a hired hand on a minotaur ship when he suddenly finds himself wrapped up with dark knights, Gods, war, political unrest, ominous horrors, and the possible destruction of his planet. What's a minotaur to do?This book is not for the faint of heart. Unlike other Dragonlance novels, the battle scenes here are numerous and as graphic as they can get.

Well, my first problem with this coffee maker was the filter. I usually bought pre-ground coffee, but that was too fine, and I ended up with grains in my coffee. I had to buy whole bean coffee and get it ground so it was less fine. My second problem was the mug. At first,I couldn't figure out why the coffee I made tasted really awful. I tried several different kinds of coffees, expensive bags too. But then I realized,it's the plastic inside the mug. Believe me, you can taste it. I'm sure I could have found a better mug to use with this machine, but at that point, it had become too much of a hassel and I went back to my ol' faithful Mr. Coffee. Sorry, maybe I'm picky about my coffee, but I like it strong and black, without a bit of plastic mixed in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine Broke After Four Months","review":"After four months of use mine stopped working.

The mug tray is a bit low to use with other mugs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes good coffee","review":"It does make really good coffee very quick. Go ahead and order the #1 filters to go with it, or just 1/4 a paper towel as the filter to eliminate the grounds going everywhere with the basket. I use the select-a-size (1/2 sheet), fold it in half and push it in with my knuckles. I am going to order the #1 filters from Amazon as the price is good on them, and you can't find them in stores. Or at least I haven't had any luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It makes something close to coffee","review":"It's convenient, and great in theory, but in practice, this Brew 'n Go falls short.

I guess this is yet another product made somewhere other than the USA!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performance","review":"for something that supposed to be made by the reputable Black & Decker company, the make of this item is extremely poor. it leaked the first time i used it! in fairness to them, however, what would you expect for $20? The on-off switch is also quite odd - there's no label that identifies which direction you need to push the switch towards to turn the coffeemaker on, and you don't know if you'd actually activated the item until it starts to gurgle the hot liquid into the cup. it also made things worrisome when i attached a timer to the item so the machine would turn on in the morning - the on-off switch did not stay turned on, so of course i woke up to a cold, empty cup in the morning. suffice to say i gave the item away to someone who might be able to find it useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Time Only","review":"I used the coffee maker once to run the clean water through it.

Don't bother with this one.","review":"If you really enjoy your coffee, but think you can handle this little maker for emergency, travel, or office/workshop, it may NOT be worth a try. However, at less than 10 dollars, you can get coffee out of it and by using an additional filter and strong beans, you may be able to slow it down enough to get a half decent cup. You can use your own cup if the plastic one included doesn't suit you. It is probably a perfect item for someone who likes quick, weak coffee one cup at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black & Decker DCM18S","review":"I didn't like this item from the beginning.

My problem is with the size of the mug; it's way too small for travel (even my 20 minute commute to work), and the outside of the mug gets extremely hot to the touch, so hot that I have to be careful if I have to hold the mug by the body instead of the handle, which makes me wonder if it's keeping the coffee hot long enough.

Otherwise my wife loved the coffee it brewed. So we got another one and this one's power switch lasted 5 weeks. We called Black & Decker about the first unit and they did say they would replace it if we had the original sales receipt (we didn't), but since we paid $17 plus tax it wasn't a big deal. Bottom Line:- Decent return policy but shoddy merchandise."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a deal!","review":"I like getting freshly brewed coffee and didn't like having to boil water with the grounds anymore. All that cleaning drove me crazy. With the 12 cup coffee maker, you can't get a decent single serving unless you make at least 2 to 3 servings. What a waste! With this Black and Decker Personal Coffeemaker, all of my aggravation has turned into happiness!! I highly recommend this for people who just need to brew one cup. I only wish it came with an extra mug or allowed customers to purchase extra ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"This used to be such a good product","review":"This coffee maker used to be so good. It used to deliver a great cup of coffee. However, I suppose all good things must come to an end.I recommended this coffeemaker to my friend who is single and isnt going to be drinking 8 cups of coffee in the morning before work. We took this home ran a cup of straight water through the machine, cleaned all associated parts and filters and then attempted to make some coffee.The machine worked fine, however this was the worst tasting coffee I've ever had. It tasted burned and weak (I have no clue how you could have burned weak coffee!). I thought this was a fluke and tried another cup. Same burned weak taste. I tried adding more coffee, ok now its regular strength and burned tasting.I have 2 of the older versions of this coffeemaker at my house and they've been nothing short of a delight for me.

Black & Decker has nothing to be proud of here."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Second One Still Works...","review":"Great idea, but poorly implemented. My first one worked ONE TIME, then refused to turn on again. B&D's customer service wanted to charge me [$$$] to replace the unit (\\"Yes, it is under warranty - the charge is simply for shipping.\\"). I don't think I've ever paid [$$$] for a single cup of coffee, and after several emails back and forth with customer service I had given up. Unexpectedly, a new unit appeared in my mail. It has worked for several months now. Coffee grounds are nicely distributed around the insides of the unit by the steam as the brewing ends - nearly impossible to clean throughly. On the plus side - the unit brews good coffee (dependent, of course, on what you put in it) and the mug does a good job of keeping the coffee warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taste is an issue","review":"Yes it fits perfectly in my cubicle thanks to its compact size, yes, it is easy to use, yes it makes coffee, but no, the coffee does not taste good.

It's a shame! :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Bad","review":"I usually do not write reviews however I had to this time. I have one cup of coffee each morning and this seemed like the solution to waste. I read most of the reviews and decided to go ahead. I am disappointed in this product. I will say that I like my coffee strong (stronger than most) so this is not the coffee maker for me. To get a strong cup of coffee I had to fill the filter almost all the way to the top and then each day I had to clean not only the mug, but the entire coffee maker as well. It has to be the fact that there are multiple holes where the water comes out into the filter that causes the spillage. The only thing good about this coffee maker is the mug. This coffee maker will be good for someone on the go who does not like strong coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brewing problems","review":"I have used this coffee maker for several months. The coffee brewed is smooth...when the maker itself works. My major complaint is a consistent problem I have had since I bought it. There is a black plug (or whatever) that fits into the water chamber. Works fine...until the plug falls out for no apparent reason. Of course, you don't know it's happened until you go to drink your fine coffee and realize most of the water has remained in the pot because this plug (or whatever) has dislodged itself and is floating in the water. When this happens, the pot gets hot and turns itself off. Turn on. Drip a few times. Turns off. Repeat cycle until the water is finally cool and/or at a level where you can put the plug in its proper receptacle. Over and over again. I think I definitely got what I paid for but was hoping it would last longer since I only use this about ten times a week. I'm giving it one star because it's pretty useless if the plug (or whatever) won't stay in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brews coffee","review":"I like the fact that it has reusable filter.

The down side - it lasted two weeks - then toast. So this is where B&D quality has gone."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK while it lasted","review":"I bought one of these about 3 months ago. Produced coffee as advertised. Then it started to leak water from the tube that brings hot water from the heating element to the drip head, back into the water reservoir...Great, it is under warranty.

I have yet to enjoy a cup of coffee from it, I deal with it, but with every sip I think of how weird it taste. Also it makes LOTS of noise brewing. I have it at work in my cube, it is NO secret when I am percolating.

I just dump the grounds in the trash and use my sink sprayer to rinse out the filter and pop it back in.I saw one review said they got grounds in the coffee, but I don't see how that would happen if done correctly.My only complaint... it does drip for a few minutes after it's done brewing. I tend to put a paper down in place of the cup to catch the mess or just clean out the filter right then and it's not a problem.I'd buy again in a heartbeat!

Each of them lasted about six years with daily use, which isn't bad for such an inexpensive little machine. It makes acceptable coffee. Not bad, not great. You can't tell much difference between brewing Maxwell House or a fresh ground gourmet coffee, but since I'm OK with Maxwell House for my weekday morning cup, it's fine for me.If you use the mesh filter that comes with the Brew 'n' Go, you'll get a bit of sludge in the cup. But a no. 1 filter is a little small for it, and a no. 2 is a little large. I usually used a no. 2 filter and mashed it in to fit.Since my last Brew 'n' Go died, I decided to try a small percolator, and so far, I prefer the percolator: hotter, stronger coffee; easier to clean; I can tell the difference between cheap pre-ground coffee or freshly ground \\"good\\" stuff; takes up even less counter space than the Brew 'n' Go (and looks cuter).

I cleaned it all out and used a vinegar solution to see if it needed to be cleaned; no improvement. Then it started making only half a serving and turning off. I can get it to finish by turning it back on. I don't remember when the thing started flooding the counter, but it was soon. The coffee was filling from the side instead of the hole, therefore flooding. I checked and the hole was clear of grounds.

This is a HUGE design flaw that could be corrected with an inexpensive filter cap that could snap onto the filter unit (I hope someone from B&D; reads these).Overall I would not buy this unit again. With such a simple system as a coffee brewer you have to get every detail right and this unit's overflow problem is huge. Using fresh ground coffee is impossible and to me, that is the only type of coffee to EVER use.Lastly, what is up with the price on this thing?! I just bought this a month ago for $23 and now its only $17?! Around Christmas they were selling here for a whopping $60!! What is it, a commodity??"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T LAST","review":"I had good results with my coffee maker. Made a decent cup of coffee quickly and was easy to clean and use. After about a months use making 1 or 2 cups a day it died. Coffee maker employs two thermal fuses in the heating element circuitry, mounted on the heating tube to prevent overheating and a possible fire hazard. I have read other reviews where the coffee maker turns on by itself, which would be a real problem if there was no water in the coffee maker and no fuse to limit the temperature, I suspect this is what happened to mine and caused the thermal fuse to blow. I disassembled mine out of curiosity and the fuse was indeed blown. Now I know why the tell you to unplug the unit when it's not in use. Judge for yourself, if you unplug it when it's not in use it would probably last a while. It IS very inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for my college student","review":"I bought this coffee maker for my college age daughter for x-mas. I haven't given it to her yet, but I have tried it out a few times just to get the hang of it due to reviews about grounds spill-over, etc. If you put in the correct amount of water and coffee it brews beautifully with no spill-over; however, it does take a full 5 minutes to finish the last few drips/drops. If you wash the mug the first time you use it you get no rubbery taste. The coffee tastes as good as the much more expensive Keurig, you can put a tall cup underneath, and clean-up is a snap. This is perfect for those who don't feel the need to spend money needlessly. I gave it four stars as I don't know how long it will last, but if it lasts her for the next 2-3 years I will be happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! and takes #2 paper filters also","review":"Just the right maker for my morning cup. Quick and easy.I'm not a fan of the permanent filter for the coffee grounds, I find it messy to empty and not easy to clean.Instead I prefer using a paper filter in the basket. Ordered some #1 filters with the maker, as mentioned inother reviews, but they're not the only ones that fit. I'm also happy with using the commonly available #2 cone filtersin this maker. Just a fold along the edge, a fold along the bottom, and pop it in the basket. There's 1/4 inch or so offilter over the top that can be folded back or just left alone. It's never flopped over to cause spillage or leaked grounds.And it's a snap to dump the used filter and grounds in the trash can with no mess.My only wish is that the base were a little taller, to be used with a variety of travel mugs. My 22oz doesn't quite fit.Still, better than I had hoped. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little coffee maker","review":"First brought a Brew 'n Go about 6 years ago when we were looking for a small coffee maker that we could use to make one or 2 cups of coffee a day with. It fit the bill prefectly. It was used every day for 6 years. The coffee is brewed at a high temp which makes great coffee and it only takes 2 1/2 minutes for a cup. The reuseable filter works great which saves on paper filkters and the mess that can come with them. Another great feather is that the coffee brewed goes directly into the cup you going to drink it from. We also use less coffee because you only brew the amount you want. After 6 years of fatefull service it finially wore out so we brought a new one. And it works just as good, very happy and would recommend this little work-horse to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice while it lasted","review":"I loved it until it failed... It lasted 2 months.

The first one pooped out after three months and the replacement unit just gave up the ghost. I suppose $20 for 8 months of use (only one cup per day) is fair, but what a pain in the neck to have to keep replacing it. I'm on to a different brand this time.

I guess when you buy cheap you get cheap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job its supposed to.","review":"Other than being just a little bit difficult to pour the water in it seems fine. I have owned and used it for about three weeks now. No problems with the filter or construction. Instructions suggest to put milk in the cup before pushing the start button. Not a good idea as hard to judge just how much room there will be for the milk. Not a problem, just don't listen to them unless you like just a small dab of milk/cream."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"No longer works after a little over one month of use!

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom Is Smiling","review":"My mother's previous travel mug coffeemaker broke (different company).She wanted something similar. This was the closest I could find.She loves it. It fits the car mug holder. Would only recommend themug be a little larger like the one she previously had. A largermug provides just the right amount of coffee for the morning.This mug is just a little too small.Overall, great product. Thank you for providing my mother with a smile.Have a blessed year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Overflow problems","review":"I tried the coffeemaker twice. Both times the water overflowed back into the water trough. The problem is the hole that allows the coffee to go into the cup. If it is not lined up correctly the coffee backs up. On my unit the only way to get the holes to line up is to manually hold the 2 inserts off to the side. On some units these holes probably line up correctly and then you don't have this problem. This one is going in the garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best little coffee maker ever!!","review":"Absolutely love my Black and Decker Brew 'n Go.

The only problems I've had with it were things that I caused. IE: the sprayer separating from the lid - put it back and no more water outside of the machine. Or grounds in my cup - the grind was too fine and clogged the filter causing it to overflow. Grind too course causing weak cup of coffee.I have a burr grinder and after much trial and error have come up with a great cup of coffee.I love my Brew 'n Go - try it and I think you will also!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good single cup maker","review":"I purchased this coffee maker because, I like to have the first cup of coffee that gets made everyday but that's it. When you make coffee that sits in a pot it doesn't taste as good as the first fresh cup, it sits there cooking, ruining the flavor. This product works great for me, it makes a great tasting cup of coffee and cleans up easy with no paper filters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"The Brew N Go makes very good coffee for a portable.

It was leaving half the water still in the coffee pot and not brewing it fully! I thought maybe if I ran HOT water through the machine a couple times it might start finishing the full cup but I was wrong. The cup is the only thing good I got out of this product as for the coffee pot itself well, it was worth what it gave me for the price. I threw it away!.. Very disappointing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brew & Go by Black & Decker","review":"My last Brew and Go personal coffee maker lasted almost 20 years.

After a while a burning smell came through with every coffee I made, but would still make coffee so didn't bother me. Then, the coffee maker stopped working after 3 months.

Also the coffee just doesn't taste very good. I think that I could have dealt with by experimenting more with ratio of coffee to water but the lid breaking was very disappointing. I like the concept of this coffee maker though. I needed something to bring to work and I liked having the mug already built in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Fine, Auto Shut-Off A Big Plus","review":"This coffeemaker works well. It is inexpensive, easy to fill, easy to clean and fairly fast. The only minor drawback is the lack of an externally visible fill level. The internal fill mark is just about impossible to see, so you really have to measure the water you put in. The automatic shut-off is a big plus. I previously had a similar Toastess model (Toastess TFC-326 Personal-Size 1-Cup Coffeemaker, Black) which was also a good coffeemaker. It had an external fill indicator, but it lacked the automatic shut-off. I kept forgetting to turn it off after making coffee, which probably contributed to its early demise."},{"rating":"2","title":"My humble opinon","review":"I love this little machine.

I did not clean it properly or often enough so after about 2-3 years ordered a new one. It came and one of the feet was broken. Returned to Amazon and they sent a new one. This one will not brew a complete cup of coffee on one flip of the switch. It takes about 3-4 and then all the water does not come out. I did not return because it was \\"used\\" at this point. Will definitly look at another brand of coffee maker now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little inexpensive coffeemaker.","review":"This coffeemaker is a good one but it doesn't make as much coffee (15-oz) as stated in the ad.

I like the fact that it turns itself off after brewing and the convenience is appealing. However, the plastic/chemical smell in both the unit and the mug has persisted despite numerous washings in hot soapy water. I have twice run straight vinegar through the brew cycle and have even tried brewing baking soda water; neither approach reduced the smell in the unit. The odor from the the mug is so upleasant, I don't use it at all--even so, I noticed that my brewed beverage (coffee, tea) has a very unpleasant chemical taste even when brewed into a glass mug. I haven't been able to find information on the type of plastic used for the unit (i.e., BPAs?), but the persistent smell and taste impact my confidence in its safety.Two stars: great idea, questionable outcome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasted","review":"While it works it makes really good coffee, really fast, the problem is it only lasted 2 months, had to throw it away today, what a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"For all you coffee drinkers this is a MUST HAVE.","review":"Absolutely fantastic. Takes longer to put the water and coffee in than it does to make a wonderful cup of coffee. We timed it and it only takes a minute and a half.

I've used mine hundreds of times and it is still going strong. The re-usable filter shows no sign of wear and is still working great. The travel mug that comes with the unit is very cheap and not even worth using...but what do you expect for 12 bucks for the entire package? This is an incredible value even after you throw away the crappy travel mug. For best performance: grind your beans fine and brew directly into a coffee mug.Word of advice: don't cheap out on your coffee grinder. Get a quality grinder brand like Bosch and the grinder will last for many years and the motor will stay strong. If you get a cheap grinder you'll end up replacing it and spending more in the long run. If you want good coffee, you can cheap out on your coffee maker, but not on your grinder or beans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything done WRONG!","review":"Burned my thumb (bad design)!Stopped working after the first brew... product is extremely cheaply made.There is no Auto-Off switch (meaning, u can't just stop brewing.. must wait for the carafe to empty out)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of value for the money","review":"Used this every morning for several months now.

The permanent filter and the travel mug were great selling features. I stopped using it after only a month because it wouldn't brew coffee strong enough.

Saw the other reviews about grinds getting into the coffee and have never had this problem. I use two scoops of coffee per cup (scooper from my old coffee maker, must be a tablespoon per scoop) and in a minute I have a great cup of coffee. No timers or gadgets here. The built-in filter works great, no grinds in my coffee at all. You can use any cup, you dont have to use the one that comes with. Of course there is no warmer to keep the coffee warm.

It takes about a minute to start brewing once you've pressed the switch, and it is noisy (which I like....lets me know my coffee is brewing). I don't use a paper filter as the mesh basket seems fine to me. Once the coffee is done, I wash out the filter and the pot is ready to use again. Can't get any easier. Well worth the price.Update 10/1/12: Have been using the coffee maker for 8 months now. Still makes a fine cup of coffee. One peculiar thing, you can't use a coffee filter with this coffee maker. I tried it (since I had the filters), and the hot water will overflow while brewing. You have to use the provided mesh basket (without any added filter).

It won't ever brew all of the water I put in the reservoir- only a portion of it. Then I have to go back and press the start button down again and it brews a little more, then I do it again, etc. until I finally have a full cup of coffee. I've tried cleaning it, running some vinegar/water through, etc- but it still won't brew a full cup in one cycle. I'm not heartbroken since it was so inexpensive, but I still expected it to last at least a year! I've since ordered a french press to try something different :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, not good coffee!","review":"I purchased one of these for my office and although coffee is hot, it has a weird taste.

Great idea, lousy execution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in performance","review":"Had an older model that had a much larger water chamber which made it easy to fill. This one is so slimmed down that it's a real challenge to fill. Another big disappointment is the large quantity of silt that is at the bottom of your coffee cup...EVERY TIME. I've gone to grinding my own at the largest grind available, and still the filter basket disappoints. When I called the company, they acted like I must be doing something wrong - like they'd never heard of the problem. Funny, but my four siblings have one too, and they have the same complaints... Also, if you use a regular grind, the grinds overflow massively so you have to rinse out the entire machine after you make a cup of coffee. So much for B&D servicing the customer and acknowledging their shortcomings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very fast, very easy... bad tasting coffee","review":"Don't kid yourself about this machine.

I was unable to replace it; and settled for the above device as an affordable substitute. \\"Affordable\\" is about all I can say for it. I really am rather disappointed.(1) a phone call to the manufactrer reveals that no carrying case is available. (2) It has no warming unit. Coffee must be drunk Immediately before it cools off. (3) The accompanying mug has a persistent \\"plastic\\" flavor which a couple of dishwasher treatments have yet to relieve.

I fill the travel mug to about a half inch below the top and fill the coffee maker with that amount of water. I've since seen this coffee maker in stores for slightly cheaper, but it was still a great value through Amazon. I was buying a cup a coffee a day and bought this to save money, and it's already paid for itself. I wish it came in white, since that would match my kitchen better, but it's compact and not distracting. The cup is slightly oddly shaped for my car cup holder, but it still fits.

One reviewer made the outlet hole bigger to let the coffee come out faster and he said it made the coffee maker a great little one cup maker. I suspect his theory is correct that the water cannot get through the grounds fast enough and that is what cause the coffee grounds to come out all over the place.

It worked maybe 8 or 9 times and then simply stopped working (\\"Q.C Passed 26\\"). No explanation other than quality failure. Moreover, its difficult to attempt repair as the plastic bottom is secured by not only 4 phillips head screws but also one proprietary screw (noting in a normal toolkit will turn it). There is no reason for this other than to prevent the owner from attempting repair, and this is simply unacceptably evil.

I just ordered one for my own house.My favorite features, that it is so small it hardly takes up any space, and it has a Permanent filter. The permanent filter is the greatest thing to me because I am constantly forgetting to grab filters for my husband. He is the coffee drinker.It's also very affordable, priced under $18.00. I love this great Black and Decker coffee maker, I hope you will too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like a champ for under $20 bucks","review":"I needed a small coffeemaker that could make one or two cups of coffee on a daily basis without having to worry about buying those pods or other proprietary stuff. When I read the reviews about the Brew n' Go I was a little worried that I might have issues with the filter or water heating mechanism, but I decided to go ahead and purchase because the price was so low.I have had my coffeemaker for about two months now and I have to say that I am very pleased. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the coffee cup lid sealed completely to avoid spills and also I find that when washing the cup out, water occasionally gets trapped between the metal and plastic portions of the cup.If you are looking for a cheap, spartan coffeemaker, I recommend picking up one of these machines. Even if mine craps out in a year or so, I intend to buy another one because of the value."},{"rating":"2","title":"An RV Essential !","review":"Bought for my travel trailer... liked it so much I now use it every morning.

If the coffee grinds are very fine you'll want to use a paper filter instead of the one provided. And yes, every few days it needs wiping down because grinds, of any consistency, do get all over. And the seating of the filter/basket is important to avoid complete grind/water spill over; but, it's so obvious how to place it correctly I had to laugh at the 1-2 star reviews complaining about this. You can't close the top if basket isn't set properly.After a about 2 yrs, our first one broke...don't remember how or why, just pulled up Amazon.com and with a sigh of relief, ordered the same one again at the same price!. Now THAT'S impressive. I removed 1 star because I thought it should have lasted longer than 2 years.

Also, the price was great.Alas, on the third use, the unit would not turn on. We tried another outlet, tried another appliance in the same outlet, which worked.Needless to say I'm extremely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would Not Recommend","review":"I purchased this one cup coffeemaker since I am the sole coffee drinker in my family. However, it is not as convenient as advertised. The built in filter is great but after brewing you have to unplug the unit and rinse the water strainer completely to get all the coffee grounds that have accumulated on it off. Also, it is not easy to pull the filter out to dump the coffee grounds. You have to pull both the basket and filter out and it is easy to forget and throw the filter out with the grounds. Do not recommend. I will probably sell at a garage sale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work!","review":"After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase the DCM18s Brew n Go coffee maker. I followed the instructions on how to use from the start.Had a difficult time pouring the water into the reservoir because of how the door is placed on the unit. The first step to to purge the unit and run just clean water into the unit.That worked and I did a second purging. That's when I notice the unit ran longer than the first run. Finally the unit shut off. I unplugged the unit to make sure everything was okay.I plugged the unit back in and it will not operate. I thought it may have a safety fuse or some kind of overheat prevention that caused the unit to shut down. I read the manual instruction and waited for the unit to rest. No luck. It simply will not turn on after many attempts. So, this unit is going back to amazon.com for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but poor design. Grounds everywhere!","review":"Purchased this item and and it worked fine for a few weeks. Then it started to overflow the grounds outside of the basket and into the water tank, water spreader and into the cup of coffee. Black and Decker replaced the coffee basket but that did not help, when I called them back they offered to send a \\"refurbished\\" replacement for $7.50 (the original price for the brand new unit was only $15) if I sent them back a piece of the power cord. And if the replacement unit does the same thing, then I would only have $22.50 in a non-useable unit. No thanks! I would suggest you stay away from this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great for six days!","review":"Liked the coffeemaker a lot until on the sixth day instead ofhearing the coffee dripping it started to hum and smoke was streaming out of it.

Will just buy a coffee maker here and use the mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replacement for 4-cup coffee maker","review":"So far; so good with this 1-cup coffee brewer & a fresh, hot cup of coffee every time. I'm saving money not having to use paper coffee filters anymore. However, it is much handier to remove grounds in a paper filter rather than dumping from the plastic reusable filter that comes with this product. That said, I can always try a paper filter inside the plastic one & additionally, it may eliminate the fine residue that is in the bottom of the mug. All in all, I would recommend this product to anyone who lives in a household where they're the only coffee drinker."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical Black and Decker crap","review":"I don't know why I keep buying Black and Decker stuff. Yes, this coffee maker only cost me $17 on sale at Target, but it only lasted about a month. It just stopped working. Push the button, and nothing. I bought another 1 cupper from Brookstone that cost $40, but in the long run it was cheaper because it still works after 6 months and I expect it will last several years.Oh yeah, one more thing. Never use those permanent screen type filters. They make the coffee taste like crap. It is not a filter, but just a device to keep the grounds out of your coffee. To make good coffee, use a natural brown paper filter, like the Melitta #1, which fits this and all other 1 cup coffee makers that use cone filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"BLACK AND DECKER BREW AND GO.DCM18S","review":"I was very exited to receive my new coffee maker, but from the first time i used it , it started leaking badly.

The problem is, it doesn't make good coffee. No matter how fresh my coffee grounds, the coffee comes out tasting burned, watery and stale. I have not been able to figure it out, but after reading other reviews I think maybe the problem was that the coffee grounds may have splattered into the water reserve, and I can never get the taste of old stale coffee grounds out of my new coffee. I finally got rid of it after trying it 10 or 12 times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks every time I use it","review":"I purchased this for my apartment, figuring it'd be easy to make my coffee before class.

In fact, I've had it for many years and it still works fine.You just fill it with water, add coffee or a tea bag in your mug, and simply walk away.

I use normal (cheap) filters - fold it in quarters and voila! it's in the shape of a cone!It's also great for people who may forget to it turn it off -- no warmer plate, and the brewer shuts off automatically.My only disappointment is that it only lasts about 2-1/2 years.

That's very helpful if the mug from yesterday is still inside the dishwasher."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for coffee AND tea!","review":"I absolutely love this thing! Mine brews very hot (but you can always fill your mug with hot water before brewing to ensure your drink stays hot) and quickly. I use about 2.5 tablespoons of grinds for a cup of coffee, and also use a regular filter instead of the gold (it made a huge mess...probably the grind of my coffee, but I still prefer the paper filter).In addition, the Brew-n-go is WONDERFUL for tea! Brews hot water quickly...I just stick my tea bag in my cup and brew:)Okay, the only downside, thus far, is that the travel mug is 5'' high. I have yet to find another travel mug that is 5'' high!

The problem is Black and Decker had a very bad design for the filter system. The coffee grinds in this system almost always overflowed. This constantly left a mess, not to mention the coffee was worthless because it was full of grounds. This might be caused partly by the fact that I like using fresh ground beans. The system might work better if you bought Folgers/Maxwell House/ETC. Or this product could probably work ok with tea-bag style coffee bags.

It brews very quickly and while the coffee itself does absorb some of the water it leaves just the right amount of room for creamer (I suggest using chocolate milk :-) Overall, I'm very happy with it. The only suggestion I would have is to make the handle on the mug a little more sturdy, it bends a bit and feels a little flimsy. I would also have been willing to pay a little extra to have the mugh all stainless steel instead of plastic in the inside. My Mom can also use it when I'm not here to make hot water for tea or hot chocolate, and it's small so it won't take up too much cabinet space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Small but great coffee maker","review":"Makes one hell of coffee in a few sec.Go personal travel mug is great to carry out the door!It's well worth the $15 that I had paid for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it!","review":"I like this coffee maker because I like to make BIG cups of coffee and this allows a big mug to fit underneath.

Also, the quality of the coffee used at the office (an inexpensive brand name from the local warehouse club) leaves something to be desired in my opinion. With this little machine, I can control all the variables, and always enjoy fresh, great-tasting coffee.

Only the $300 Technivorm coffee maker can match that temperature. All other machines brew aroung 175-185 F making a weak lifeless cup.2. The brew basket is cone shaped which best allows all the grounds to brew evenly. I suggest removing the peremanent filter and using melitta paper #2 filters instead for better brew times and easier extraction. This also leaves more room for the grounds to \\"bloom.\\"3.

Not once has it overflowed, although I must say I don't use the lid and I use less coffee than the recommended amount. It's quick and makes just the right amount of coffee. At first I thought the mug was a little small, but after checking it against my regular mug it actually holds the same amount!

Summary: the earlier version made a perfect 10 ounce cup of coffee EVERY time until it wore out. This model is iffy - when it works right it makes a good 10 ounce cup of coffee, but it's not good for a bigger cup, and even the 10 ounce cup is unreliable.

They would mail anoter unit back. No refund for the return expenses and of course no guarantee the new one would last any longer than one use.

The shelf the cup sits on is way too small and it makes the cup unstable when in place. I reached for the cup and it tipped over and I had horrible burns on my tummy where the hot coffee hit that took over a month to heal and now I have a nice scar from it. It was the worse burn I have ever had and although I know accidents happen, I am not a careless person at all and I didn't bump the cup hard enough that it would have tumped over.. Also the cup is top heavy because the bottom is so slender which contributed to the accident. It is just a terrible design on this item that makes it very unsafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Acceptable, if you don't expect much -","review":"I have had this for about a month and it makes only acceptable coffee.

But my two recent purchases both suffered from the same problem that, I think, resulted from a design change to the water feed tube. A pressure relief feature in the swivel portion of the water tube spills about half of the boiling water back into the water tank, with only a portion reaching the coffee. The spilled water gets recycled into the cold water, causing the thermostat to trip before all the water is boiled. This greatly increases brewing time because two or three cycles are required to fill the cup. I patched the relief port with tape, and tilted the unit forward to minimize spillage from the relief port. This helped somewhat, telling me that the spill port is the problem. This is a cheap coffee maker that used to be a good value. But not anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 2 months!","review":"I purchased this product towards the end of December.

If you don't mind having to thoroughly clean the inside of coffee grains, you won't mind this. Trust me... you won't enjoy it!

I dont know why it stopped. It was well taken care of. I must have made almost 240-250 times, so I still think like I saved a lot. I still have the travel mug though, not a bad deal for the price.

I purchased a Brew'n'Go about a year ago now, and while mine works fine, my sister had purchased one and had to return it because the switch didn't work properly. When she replaced it with a new one, it had the exact same problem and just recently broke down altogether. One problem I've had with mine is the ever increasing amount of coffee grind residue passing through the filter. I mainly use my Brew'n'Go now for hot water when making tea or hot chocolate. If you just want good hot water that doesn't taste like the microwave, then this is a good purchase. If you want fast and good coffee, search on."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have bought several, very useful","review":"I bought my first brew n'go several years ago and it lasted a long time. I use it every day and the reusable filter is nice. The only problem is replacing parts, the filter finally ripped after several years and to replacing it is hard. Hard to find the part online in the first place, with shipping it cost about $13 for 1 filter. Since the full price is almost as expensive you have to wonder if it is worth it but I don't want extra trash in the landfills. The one I had finally broke, at the hinge level where the water enters the top it finally cracked and was leaking water back into the fill compartment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed!!!","review":"Since I usually drink only one cup of coffee a day, it was kind of a pain to use my 12 cup coffee maker for a single cup. I have used my Black & Decker Brew 'n Go several times now and I am completely delighted with it. I read several of the other reviews and I have not had any of the problems mentioned in the low star rated reviews, such as over flowing water or grounds going everywhere.

What is funny is that I replaced my $179 broken Kuerig with this...Works just as great in my opinion and saves me money too because I'm not a heavy coffee drinker anyways! Great Product and highly recommended!

You are supposed to be able to push the button down once and the brewer should stay on. After about 3 months, my button stopped working. Sometimes there is a small point that the light comes on. I have to hold the button at that exact location for it to brew. Other times, I can't get it to light up anywhere or end up with half a cup of coffee. I assume that there is a short somewhere but I can't get in the coffee maker to check the wiring. I only make coffee once or twice a week so at most I used this about ~25 times before it stopped working correctly. I'm on today to buy a new coffee maker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Money","review":"Makes good coffee fast, and keeps it hot as long as the top is on the cup.

I wouldn't go back to my old pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy coffee","review":"Based on the majority of reviews here, I bought one of these about 6 months ago for those occasions when brewing even a small pot with my regular coffee maker would be wasteful. Using the same coffee that gives a great brew in my regular coffee maker, this makes something barely drinkable. It seems to me that the plastic from which the unit is made imparts a flavor to the coffee, because it tastes the same way the plastic smells. Anyone who thinks this unit makes a great cup of coffee can't possibly have any sense of taste. A waste of $20. If I could get my money back, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"Bought this coffeemaker about two weeks ago for my office and am really enjoying it. Pros: AFFORDABLE, small size, can use almost any regular size mug or disposable cup, uses pods or loose coffee, has permanent filter, brews pretty fast and coffee is hot, automatically turns off. Cons: a little too noisy for the office but it's not on very long, can't find any pods except for Senseo and Folgers in the grocery store - everything else is cups or disks so I'll have to order some online ([...] is an awesome website for pod and other info btw), the included mug isn't all that great - the plastic is rough in some places and the handle and lid are flimsy/cheap - but I use my own mug anyway so not really an issue. Just a note, the cord is VERY short...only about 23 inches so if you have it on your desk, you'll need an extension cord. Overall I'm very happy with it.

When water is all, tea is done.Good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to use this product","review":"Wanted to note that this coffee maker will put grounds in your coffee if you use the amount of water and grounds that the package instructions tell you to. The package instructions say to use about 2.5 tablespoons of grounds and almost a full mug of water. When I did that I got grounds in my coffee. When I use about 2/3 or 3/4 a mug of water and 1 scoop (about 1 tablespoon) of grounds, I got a great tasting cup of coffee with no grounds. NOTE: I use fine ground coffee though - which means I get a stronger taste with less grounds.This is the perfect little coffee maker to sit on my desk at work. The mug does a great job of keeping the coffee warm long after it is brewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"love the travel mug brew 'n go","review":"Perfect single brew with reusable filter...only minus is it's a little awkward pouring water into reservoir if it's already plugged in...you need to turn it around for easier access."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Single People","review":"I bought this because I live alone and have 1 cup of coffee in the morning getting ready for work during the week. I tried a Keurig and hated it! I saw this one and said why not. Its inexpensive, comes with a travel mug and comes with a reuasable filter so you get to use your own coffee. I have only used it 4 times so far, but I like it. It will take a few cups of coffee to figure out just how much coffee to use, but it brews quick and it brews a hot cup of coffee. I'm glad I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"User Alert!","review":"Bought two of these, one for wife and myself, after about 10 uses mine now comes on when it feels like it. For no reason, no water, nothing, it will come on and get hot, shut off then maybe an hour later do it all again. Even though booklet warnings say to unplug when not in use or for cleaning, you would think something with this brand name and an ON switch could be left plugged in. Note I checked the warnings on my toaster and it says the same, to unplug. I guess that covers liabilty. Anyways I just wanted buyers to know in this case you better keep it unplugged when not monitored. No problems with coffee maker other than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great....for a little while!","review":"Loved this idea of a small, one cupper into a travel mug. You can make a cup right into any mug, actually. However, after only a few months of use it has started to leak quite a bit.

It's still working otherwise, but what a mess!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"I was really excited about this coffeemaker. I work in an office with no real kitchen facilities, plus I am the only decaf drinker, so this was perfect. Unfortunately, I have been quite disappointed. Contrary to what other reviewers have written, yes I do have half a brain and yes I do know how to brew coffee. I used the proper amount of water and coffee (even less than the recommended amount) and it still got coffee grounds *everywhere*. It sort of defeats the purpose of being \\"convenient\\" when you have to take the whole unit to the bathroom and rinse out the water reservoir to get the coffee grounds out. It brews a great cup of coffee, and I like the travel mug a lot, but if you're looking for a single-cup coffeemaker, I'd recommend passing on this one and continuing on your quest.

The coffeemaker is compact, attractive, easy to use and affordable. The problem is, I've used it 12 times now, and still haven't figured out how to prevent the coffee grinds from flowing into the cup. I've tried using less water, using less coffee, etc. I think it is probably just a poor design. It is typically just a few grinds, which can be easily fished out with a spoon, so you can still drink the coffee, but it's a hassle. Also, when all is said and done, it is not a very good cup of coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"MUGG IS BAD!!!","review":"I gave it only a 2 star, because you cant use the mug because it leaks all over you when you try to drink from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept! but it broke right away.","review":"We bought this coffee maker for our trip last week.

I have purchased three additional ones to take on 2 - 3 week cruises and they have worked well for the time while I was on the cruises (I left them for crew members). I have now purchased three additional ones for use at work, but all three(Purchased over a period of seven months) turn themselves off when only half of the water has heated, resulting in 1/2 cup of bad coffee. I had thought that I just happened to get a lemon - but three in a row indicates a poor product. The last one I was only able to get to work for a week. Of course I did not save the packaging, so cannot return. This was a really nice product until Black & Decker sold it to a company that seems to have cut corners in production. I just cannot recommend this product as currently produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be careful about size of coffee grind","review":"I received one of these as a gift and loved it and used it every day (I am the only coffee drinker in the house). Then I bought some bulk coffee and ground it myself and tried that. It kept getting grinds out of the filter and into the water reservoir and I kept having to clean it. Finally after three months it just died. They sent me a new one (after $7 shipping and handling) and this one is doing the same thing. Now I am almost convinced it is a problem with the grind of the coffee itself (the instructions do not specify which to use). I used an auto drip grind but perhaps that is too fine. Before I was buying pre-ground coffee and had no trouble as long as I did not add more than the 2.5 Tablespoons that the instructions specify. If I added more by accident or did not measure carefully, I had trouble even with the pre-ground.

The coffee smells awful when you're making it, which is a pretty good indication of how it's going to taste. And it tastes pretty bad. I purchased this coffee maker because I thought it was convenient that it comes with a cup and it brews right into it, and the permanent filter is a great idea. Unfortunately the filter lets coffee grounds through (I buy ground coffee, maybe if I made a coarser grind myself it would be different, but why bother). Just to make sure it wasn't a bad batch, or that I wasn't using the right amounts of things, I bought 3 different brands of coffee and tried different amounts from 2 tbsp up to 6.

I was able to brew about ten cups of coffee before it broke this morning. You might be asking \\"What did you expect for $18?\\" I expected a coffee maker that made coffee. It wasn't quiet to begin with but I don't have to worry about that anymore since it is in the garbage can. Black & Decker used to be a respected name, what happened? DO NOT BUY! From other reviews I see that it isn't even worth trying to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great persal coffeemaker","review":"This coffeemaker is the best thing since flavored creamer. I love it. I am the only coffee drinker in the house and it's easy to use. I read the other comments and was a little leary about buying it but I thought what the heck...let's try it. It did smell a little when I opened the box. But washed everything and the smell went away. I love the permanent filter. No more bothering with paper filters.

He has used it every day for several months and it is wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for....","review":"It's inexpensive because it's very low quality. The whole thing smells like melting plastic when it brews, and I'm guessing it's because the plastic it's made out of is so soft and flimsy. Makes me wonder how many chemicals are getting into the coffee. It also makes a mess as the grounds tend to overflow from the strainer. Oh well, at least it was cheap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After One Week","review":"This coffee maker worked fine for one week, but then suddenly stopped working.

Invest in a higher quality unit!","review":"Background: used in a dorm.Bottom-line: I'd recommend a higher quality unit.Pros:InexpensiveConvenient (especially no paper filters)3+ months of good(-enough) coffee.Cons:Plastic + Heat... every mug of coffee was probably a contribution to the cancer fund, if you catch my drift.Cleaning the machine WELL is impossible (it will still work fairly well if not thoroughly cleaned daily).Cleaning it every 3 months, as recommended, while a good idea in theory, can potentially spell disaster for the unit (did for mine at least). I followed the directions to a tee and the next cup I brewed steamed tremendously and at the end of the cycle I was left with more water in the reservoir as in the mug.No point trying to repair the unit since it seems like Applica is not interested in the consumer."},{"rating":"1","title":"stopped working in 3 months!!","review":"The product was all I needed and it was great.

After making lots of noise, the water just won't come down. And system automatically shuts off. A big let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"After using this single serve coffee maker for a month, I was delighted it how it worked. Now, however, it seems to have changed it's mind on how it wants to work. The coffee grounds spill over into the rest of the unit with every cup that is brewed, resulting in coffee that needs to be 'chewed.' I need to rinse the entire unit under the faucet after each cup brewed. Not at all what I would expect from Black and Decker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Value","review":"This product is a good over-all value and serves the purpose for which it is intended. The brewed liquid has a robust flavor and requires only about 1 1/2 scoops of coffee grounds. The only problem I experience is that it does not hold the entire 15 oz. of water as indicated - and all of the water does not automatically process before the unit shuts off. Thus, it is necessary to depress the \\"On\\" button 2 or 3 times to empty the water tank. The ***** features - that I like best are the easy use, easy cleaning of basket and the automatic shut-off. The stainless mug is DEFINITELY NOT submersible and serves only as an insulated carafe for a short period of time. I transfer the brewed coffee to my favorite coffee cup for consumption. This item replaced another Black & Decker one-cup coffeemaker that I used for 19 years. I do not expect this unit to last that long as things made in China are not the quality that I expect or would like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy electric switch","review":"As usual, I procrastinated past the 30 day deadline to return this. It worked great for a few weeks, but then it wouldn't turn on immediately if you pushed the on/off switch (very crappy design). If I kept toggling up and down, eventually it would come on. Sometimes it comes on first try, other times the 3rd or 4th try. I know that eventually it will not come on at all. Otherwise, it would be a great personal 1-cup coffeemaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brew & Go personal coffeemaker","review":"Very good product and hard to find other than thru online services.

I also really liked the idea of not having to use a filter. This product works OK, but the plastic construction makes my coffee taste like...plastic. Yuck! Thought this problem would go away after a few brewings, so I gave it another few tries. After my 20th cup still tasting strongly of warm, burning plastic I gave up. Cheap construction, cheap product. I guess I will need to buy a regular old coffeemaker with a filter for my one cup of coffee. Makes me wonder what kinds of chemicals I may have ingested... :/"},{"rating":"1","title":"Chemical odors","review":"Made in China. The brewing function works ok, but the entire thing is made of plastic except the cup. The cup is lined inside with plastic but is thin stainless steel on the outside. The first time I used it I ran water only through the system to clean it out. The water came out smelling like plastic chemicals. I poured separate hot water into the cup and the water tasted like plastic chemicals when it became cool enough to drink. I don't know what causes these chemical odors, but I do know that it probably isn't good for me. I'm not sure if China cares what harmful materials they use to make their products, or that these materials are ingested by human beings. I will not be using this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black & Decker Brew 'n Go personal Coffeemaker","review":"I have used the Brew 'n Go Coffeemaker for years. They make the coffee fast and hot.

The coffee tastes great and is very hot. I am using fine ground coffee and have had no problems with the grinds going into the water. I have had a pod maker and even thoguh it is quicker & easier (the pods eliminate the cleaing of the grinds) I prefer it because I can use whatever coffee I want and make it as strong or weak as I want to. Yes, the travel mug is on the cheap side, but it woks good. Just make sure to wash it in soapy water upon first use to eliminate any plastic smell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for one","review":"I think this is the greatest for someone like me where nobody else in the house drinks coffee -- each cup takes maybe two minutes to brew, and it's hot and fresh. Plus, this takes regular old ground coffee, not those expensive pods where it's $4 or $5 for 18 cups of coffee. I agree that the mug provided is awful, and actually it's quite tippy in my car holder. I found a taller ceramic mug that is perfect for it, and that's what I use at home. I was an old convert from their \\"Cup at a Time\\" model, and this is an adequate replacement for it. No other brand has a single-cup maker that doesn't use the pods that I know of. I will definitely buy an \\"extra\\" one for the time when this one finally gets old."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Coffeemaker Ever for single cup!","review":"I don't know what's wrong with the other reviewers either. I am on my second model of the Brew N Go and I think it's great! If you want a fresh cup of coffee, this is the simplest way to make one. Maybe some of the other reviewers got defective merchandise? I have never had any trouble with either of mine. The reason I bought a new one was that the filter in my old model was worn out and I didn't think a replacement was available. I kind of wish I'd looked harder because the old model had a better shape that made it easier to pour the water into the reservoir and that is why I gave this 4 stars instead of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has a mind of it's own!","review":"I received this coffeemaker as a gift. I constantly drink herbal tea and thought it would come in handy with the loose herbs. It works great due to the built in filter. The problem that I have with this product is that if I do not unplug it as soon as it is done, it will reset and try to run another cycle without any water in it. The first time this happened, I noticed a burning smell, like plastic. I think that this product is dangerous and I cannot turn it on and get in the shower in the morning for fear that it will burn my house down."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just brewed my first cup and ....I absolutely love it!!!","review":"I love this coffeemaker.

I am saying bye to all the instant coffees in my house.I can enjoy starbucks or dunkin donuts coffee now whenever I want.Like the permanent filter.My cup brew in one min and before I lifted it up I rinsed the filter, so easy.Once again, I love this coffeemaker.I highly recommend it for 1 person coffee needs.Wonderful to have it.I am enjoying it very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"it burned up","review":"Darn thing caught fire and burned up.

It was difficult to open the lid at first. When I finally got to open it, the plastic \\"screw-like thing\\" at the back broke. When I started to use the machine, it seemed like it was going to explode. It was making this really noisy gurgling sound that scared the hell out of me -maybe it is normal but I have never experienced such a thing from other coffeemakers. The first time I used the product, it produced 1 mug of coffee - at least that pleased me. But after that first time, it was only producing 1/3 of a cup. I have to re-start the machine again and again in order to fill my mug. Since I live in Europe, there is no point in returning the product and wasting more money. Maybe I got unlucky - I don't know. I would NOT advise anyone living outside the US to purchase this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dribble Cup","review":"Congratulations to Black and Decker. They have managed to design the perfect dribble cup.The coffee maker itself works fine and makes a nice one cup serving which certainly reduces the amount of coffee that I normally would end up throwing away. However, one cannot drink from the cup/lid without coffee dribbling down one's chin and/or ending up on the front of one's shirt. This is particularly frustrating, if not downright dangerous, when one is driving. Cannot recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"no quality control","review":"The coffee maker would not be bad IF they bothered to match the seams up properly for the reusable filter. This causes coffee ground to get EVERYWHERE and plug up the machine. Additionally, a replacement for the filter is near impossible to find, unless I switch over to paper, which I can only get onlineI may as well just have bought a standard mr coffee pot for the price, and then just bought a reusable filter.Very unhappy with this purchase"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"The coffeemaker is very speedy and efficient with it's coffee making process. You can fill up the travel mug in approx. 3 mins of turning it on. The filter is also very convenient because all you have to do is rinse it out, then you can reuse it.The travel mug does the job and no complaining there for how much I spent. It doesn't hold the heat too long though, I'd say you'll have a cold cup in no more than 2 hours. The handle is made of thin rubber so I feel like it will break off eventually. The most difficult feature is the sipper, it's kind of odd and very difficult to keep it neat, you will most likely drip down the side of the cup before you master it.For the price you're paying, you're really getting 5 stars worth of product. My only concern is in the future if I use a slightly taller mug than the travel mug (it doesn't have to be much taller), then it won't fit under the brewer."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for college student","review":"much less expensive than a keurig; no exposed heating element so complies w/dorm regs and you can use any coffee or heat water for tea"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, utter disappointment","review":"I really wanted this to be a good coffee maker. Ive used it for 2 months now but i cannot solve any of the problems with it.1. the coffee takes pretty bad. its got a rubbery tangy taste. i figured it was plastic oils post manufacturing but it isnt. ive cleaned it countless times. ran soap water, vinegar, used paper filters, different mugs, tried using too much coffee but nothing would get the taste out.2. its terribly loud. try using this in a dorm room and youll wake up your roommate with all the unnecessary noise this thing makes.i liked the idea of it and maybe mine was just a lemon but i tossed this in the garbage it was a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect one cup coffee maker","review":"This makes hot coffee fast. I use it at work. The cord is extremely short, so I have an extension cord on my desk for it. I used #1 paper coffee filters instead of the reusable filter because the reusable filters usually allow coffee dust through. The only thing I would like to see is a taller coffee mug. I use a larger mug so there's enough room for milk, so I pour the coffee from the shorter mug into my larger travel mug. If you drink your coffee black, you might not have this problem. The mug gets very hot, which probably means all the heat is escaping from the coffee. I don't know how long the coffee stays hot because I don't drink it from the original mug. If the coffee brewer was taller so I could use my own travel mug, I'd give it five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad execution","review":"I am very disappointed with this product. It is a great concept -- brewing a single serving into a thermal mug. However, it doesn't work well, at least not for me. The hot water is expressed very forcefully into the filter basket where the coffee grounds are. So much so that it scatters the grounds throughout the entire inside of the product -- into the water reservoir and into the brewed coffee. Cleaning this mess up is a real drag. You end up with a cup of hot coffee that is filled with coffee grounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I wanted this coffee maker for a long time before I finally bought it. What a disappointment! I have had coffee grounds in my coffee almost every time. I have tried different brands of coffee, different levels of water, everything.

I don't use the mugs that come with it, although they are fine - but it works wonderfully with my extra-large ceramic mugs. One caution - don't overfill the coffee - one heaping scoop is plenty. If you like it extra strong, use less water and make a second cup when you are ready. Too much coffee will overflow into the water reservoir and break the machine (maybe not the first time, but soon). This has happened twice to me when relatives came to visit and didn't know what they were doing. B&D replaced it the first time.

I saw the negative reviews on this coffemaker, but figured if it made a cup of coffee, I'd be happy. Well, it couldn't even do that and I'm not happy. When I cleaned out the coffemaker with vinegar and water it worked fine. But, when I added coffee grinds, the thing backed up and got water all over my counter. I'm being 100% honest when I say there was more water on my counter than in the mug. Plus, the coffee grinds ended up in the water reservoir and all over my counter, to boot. I tried using this a few times, figuring maybe the mess was a one time thing. WRONG. The coffeemaker was delivered yesterday, and I already have it packaged for a return today.

With the expresso machine, you have to stand right there the entire time you are making the cup of coffee. With this, you push the botton and go do other things--it will shut off when the cup of coffee is made. Another thing I like is the SMALL footprint. It takes up very little space on the counter.

And my favorite coffee always tasted bitter. Disappointed after all the review reading, mine was such a dud.So, I spent more time searching and ordered the 4-cup Mr. Coffee. I like it soooo much better. Coffee tastes much better, All the water is siphoned out in one brew. Pause and serve is very nice plus. Very easy to rinse glass pot and pour into reservoir.

My husband played with it a little more and it still wouldn't work properly so we returned it. We received our replacement quickly and tried it. No matter how much water you poured in it would only make about half of the amount and the rest of the water stayed inside the machine.

Admittedly, I'm not the most discerning coffee maker, but my first cup tasted watery. I noticed the supplied filter lets water through it very rapidly. I read reviews where people put an additional #1 filter in there to reduce clean up and enhance flavor. I went to Wal-Mart and could only find the number 4 and I cut it down to size. I only brew about 7 ounces and it didn't spill over and it tasted stronger with the filter. I did notice that you have to be careful when placing the filter into the unit, because if you get it wrong, the holes won't line up, possibly causing the overflow. That would not be a fun way to wake up!So, if it holds up a couple of years, I think it's great buy.

He uses 1 or 2 scoops of coffee with 1 travel mug full of water, sets it up the night before, and he just flips the switch in the morning before he heads out to work to have coffee in a few minutes. The only drawback so far was the ugly tan mug ours came with - I wish I had seen this one with the silver mug. We've had this little guy about a month and no issues.

I got about maybe a half dozen uses out of it, and then one day it stopped working. I plugged it in, and the little red indicator light on the side lit up right away--that light should only come on when you depress the switch to start the brewing process--and I found this odd. I unplugged it and tried again, and the light came on every time it was plugged back in. Well, I filled it with water and got it ready to brew, and plugged it back in, and the only sign of flowing electricity was the red indicator light. Its brewing days seem over. Read the other reviews and you'll notice that this happens rather frequently with this product. Buyer beware.

It is ok. Nothing special. It takes about 4 min for all the liquid to pour through. It is nice and hot. The only real problem is that the grounds tend to overflow a bit, making cleaning a little more than just emptying out the permanent filter That part has annoyed me at times. The other real problem is that the lid on the cup leaks. It does not make a seal so I end up transferring the coffee to another mug."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good coffee maker, poorly designed travel mug","review":"The coffee maker is great. It's quick and easy and makes a fine cup of coffee. The only problem with this product is the travel mug that it comes with. Most of the travel mugs I own have a plug of some type that I can cover the drinking hole with. This mug does not. And so when I'm driving to work, coffee spills out. Or I brew coffee into this mug and pour it into a better one to take to work with me. An unnecessary step if the mug was designed right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convenient","review":"It's perfect for an afternoon quick, hot & fast cup of coffee.

I like dark roast coffee. I use more than 2 tbs. for my brew. The foam covers the hot water spreader and leaves a residue of coffee oils and grounds that is hard to clean off. I am also in a wheel chair. Maybe standing makes pouring the water in easier, I usually make a mess. I also wish the cup was more insulated. The coffee gets cold too soon.

However, it never went beyond an inch remaining in the well and I simply adjusted the amount of coffee until I had just the right coffee for me. Normally I'd give a product just two stars for failing to work in accordance with it's own instructions but given I've had it for well over a year now and it still works and makes a great cup of coffee, I have to concede that in this case, I got a fair trade for my $18."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good","review":"I thought this was a good idea since it sounded convenient with a travel mug included and no filters to add. But I realized I would much rather have a paper filter instead of the basket/filter that comes in this product. My coffee mug always has sediment on the bottom when I finish the coffee. I also hate to hand wash dishes so I hate to hand wash the filter too. I would love to just take out the paper filter and put in a new one. I also realized that this coffee maker does not make hot coffee if I put cold water in it. I have to put luke warm water in it and then the coffee will be hot. It's just a cheap product, I'm going to buy the coffee maker that has paper filters and a 4 cup pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"It worked great....until it magically stopped working!","review":"I LOVED this coffee maker, I'm not a big coffee drinker, but once I got this, I became one. It made the coffee fast, and was easy to make. And the travel mug was a pretty cool add-on. I thought the price was pretty cool too. Well, you get what you pay for. I usually don't write product reviews, but with this product, I'm very upset. There is nothing like REALLY craving your coffee to find that the machine doesn't work anymore. Just stopped working, done. I've used it under 20 times! I go to use it, and I push the switch, and boom-nothing. The light doesn't turn on and it just doesn't work. I read the instructions, tried different outlets around my house, tried using less water, then more. I even took the machine apart. $15 is a good deal, techinally if I went to starbucks, I would've ended up paying the same for the same amout for coffee.

When I opened the reservoir cover to clean the showerhead and snapped it back into place a little piece of the plastic clip broke off.

This is only my second purchase with Amazon but when they email you the delivery date shouldn't it arrive on time? Amazon needs to crack the whip on their shipping department.

There are no high production values to speak of in 'The Dawns Here Are Quiet', the cinematography is workmanlike but the direction is deft and the performances solid. 'The Dawns..' is the compelling story of a raggle taggle artillery unit and their wartime misadventures. Yuri Sorokin plays the hard bitten sergeant who is lumbered with a new unit to knock into shape - to his horror it turns out to be entirely made of women. Imagine Clint in Heartbreak Ridge having to adopt a crew of girl rookies into his crack recon unit....that gives you a good point of reference for the humour and drama that unfolds in this highly under-rated movie.

This is one of the few moisturizers I have ever used that actually moisturize extremely well with a totalling greaseless feel and appearance. I'm only giving it a 4 because I was led to believe that it helped with aged spots. This is simply not true. It does nothing for age spots. I have some redness on the brige of my nose and this serum seems to enhance the appearance of the redness, but it seems to subside some after a short while. Moisture qualities scores a perfect in my opinion. Doesn't do anything else. If you are trying to fade age spots and even out skin tone I highly recommend Virtual Laser (it comes in a bottle...it's not a procedure).

I had to have it removed with a scalpal. I am not saying this is definately from this product but these did appear during time of use and since they regenerate new skin it is seems this could be the possible cause.

It goes on nice and light, so that was surprising.Today as soon as I left work all I could think about was rushing home to wash my face! What's worse, I have broken out badly - big pimples that also itch, so not sure if it's a breakout or an allergic reaction - either way, no thanks.

I love this stuff- I started using this stuff four years ago and I was sold from the very first use. It goes on nice and easy and spreads over your skin. It doesn't feel oily once it is spread on your skin and leaves your face feeling firm and soft. My skin tends to get a little red when I spread it on, but that quickly disappears after a minute or two. I love the way this stuff makes my skin feel!I have noticed that they now make a version of this serum that has no fragrance, but I actually prefer the fragrance!Definitely a five star product that I highly recommended.

The first problem is the smell. I had purchased Olay's quench lotion before and hated the smell, never imaging they would use the same sent for the face. The second problem is the texture - it just felt like thin lotion and when it dried, it felt itchy. I didn't even try using it on my face because when I put it on my hand and smelled it, I knew I would not be able to tolerate that fragrance all over my face.

I had problems for years with white bumps around my eyes before I started using this product, and they have all cleared up and not returned.

While it worked, it was a good can opener although it seemed to struggle at times and has a very...plastic feeling to the whole thing. The charger/mount is difficult to use and you would not want to use the Gizmo in the under cabinet mount with anything heavier than a small can of soup.

I'm a techno-geek, and I couldn't figure out a way to reliably and easily lock it onto a can. My wife and mother-in-law fared no better.Also, the cutting head keeps comes off for cleaning, but it wouldn't lock in very well for actual use. It kept coming off the unit all the time.Finally, when I bought this thing, I assumed that the wall mount was a charging cradle. It's not. The wall mount is a piece of plastic. If you want to charge the thing, you've got to pull the adapter out of a drawer somewhere and leave it plugged in for a day. Definitely not anywhere near as care free as past can openers I've used that were always on, always available, and always clicked into the can relatively easily.About the only good thing I can say about it is that after you do finally get it charged and locked onto the can, it does actually open the can.Ours went into the trash after about 5 minutes of attempted use."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Pain!","review":"Okay, I have to first defend B&D; products by saying that this is the first one I've ever actually had trouble with, but boy when they flop, they flop!The charge life is good, but the charger itself is a pain to get the can opener in and out of. The blade assembly comes off, which was a good thought for cleaning but terrible when it flies off the can opener while you're using it. The magnet isn't strong enough to grab the lid, so you're fishing it out of the soup when it falls in. Mine finally just stopped completely opening cans after 7 months and I threw it in the trash.

Today, the unit will no longer hold a charge and is completely useless. No problem. I figured I'd call Black & Decker's toll free number and invoke the product's \\"full one year warranty.\\" Just one little catch. The warranty is based on a date code stamped on the unit's electrical plug, not on the date the gift was received. Apparently, our unit sat on the store shelf for a few months before it was purchased, and the \\"full one year warranty\\" is suddenly reduced to 3 months of coverage.

So when it came time for a new one I got B&D. What a mistake. . .I'm sure that B&D designed it without a handle to avoid it from knocking things off the counter. However, for me It's hard to get out of the charger, is not easy to put back in the charger, which means it often is not charging when it should be. It's too big to work with one hand, and too compact for two. I appreciate a company that continues to try and improve their product. But B&D needs to send this one back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Stay away from this one if you want something that lasts more than 3 months.

It looks neat and goes around a can quickly, but has lots of problems in design. It was difficult to detach or attach to the base without both hands and would tip over small cans when it was used off the base. Within 4 months, the black plastic bracket that holds the blade assembly in place cracked when I took the assemble off to clean it. Super-glue repaired it, but then the thin plastic strip holding the magnetic lid holder in place (on the blade assembly) broke when the arm swung too far while taking a can off. The lid hadn't completely cut and stayed on the can. The plastic parts are too fragile for a family's use and replacement parts aren't available. After just 9 months use, the unit is crap. B&D is taking too many short cuts with products now."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gizmo","review":"This is the best can opener that I have even owned.

I bought the first Gizmo, and it lasted less than a year. The second, a gift, lasted a little longer -- then it just stopped charging. Even before it died, it took a lot of effort to fit it onto the can, especially a narrow one. We didn't use it all that often, either, what with most cans having flip-top lids. I do like the way you can save space by hanging the charger unit from a cabinet, but I can't recommend this product.

On one hand I like the way it takes less space by wall mounting and giving me more space on my countertop. I didn't really like using it that much, it was messy. If you let it cut completely around the can, the lid would pop up and sauces or whativer would splatter, or the lid would fall into the can. We kept the opener on the charger and so never really lost the charge. However, after less than a year the can opener seems charged but doesn't have enough power to cut the can after it pierces it - just doesn't move.

That feeling didn't last long, unfortunately.I can't remember how many tries it took to get the Gizmo on the can correctly. Finally, though, I did and it was fun to watch it work. Unfortunately, that was the last time it did. Afterwards, I was never able to get it on the can properly - usually the part that cuts the can lid would fall off. (Or fly off, more accurately). I finally gave up and tossed the ole Giz.I thought B&D; invented the Gizmo for people who couldn't use a manual can opener - the elderly or disabled. If this is the case, B&D; really blew it.

But, my husband gave me this for Mother's day so I decided to give it a try. This can opener is more trouble than it's worth. The main problem is that you have to position the \\"gizmo\\" perfectly against the can for the blade to make contact. This usually me takes several attempts. During these attempts \\"the easy for cleaning\\" removable blade falls off.

I have expierence many ocassion where I cannot get it grip onto the can, after several tries it finally does! Also the battery life of the gizmo seems very short - even after the first charge! So there are a few things that make this great:1. Size2. The magnet the keeps the lid from going in your food3. Price4. It has rubber grip for better holding5. Automatic6.

I just ordered the separate adapter kit and hopefully that does the trick. I'm hoping these work because the OEM shocks are junk and I've been through 3 sets (luckily all died just before their warranty expired) and I'm hoping these last longer once they finally get installed.Amazon should not say the adapter lines come with these shocks, as it does not, and also recommend the separate adapter kit (Monroe AK29 )be purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocks","review":"Easy installation, great ride.

I really did... makes good coffee... can set the auto off from 2-4 hours, has a timer, and is pretty cheap.Really cheap in fact. 4 months after purchase the auto-off feature stopped working correctly shutting off after 2hrs no matter what the setting. Then, last week, 6 months after purchase, it just stopped working. You push \\"on\\" the little light comes on... and nothing happens... nothing...At least it still turned off after two hours.I wouldn't recomend buying this.

I followed the instructions, and that was the last I heard until I tried to get back in touch with them. I had been a good four months. When I finally got a response to my emails, the only thing they could tell me is I would have to phone their customer service line between 9 and 5 Monday to Friday. I work 9 to 5 Monday to Friday.

I chose this model because it was a Black and Decker, it was mid-price at the discount store where I bought it, it promised good coffee plus it was attractive. Since the very first cup it ever brewed, this machine has been a disappointment. It spits and sputters as though it's on it's last breath, and it's SLOW. Two days ago I pushed the \\"on\\" button and it flew sparks at me, I believe the switch is burned out. I contacted the manufacturer and was told to return it to them for repairs, to me this is a huge inconvenience. If you're considering this appliance, my advice is don't buy it. Read the reviews...I wish I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pile of junk!","review":"I bought this for my RV to use while on vacations. It was only used about 20 days a year, but took a dump after just 2 years. If you buy this for your everyday coffee maker, expect about 3 months of use before it breaks. The switch stopped working and would not light up nor start the machine. I know it was a cheap unit, but using it as little as I did, I expected it to last longer. I will stay away from Black & Decker products in the future as I used to think they produced decent stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, it still kinda works","review":"We've had ours for a little more than a year, and the switch is broken.

She is a little distructive at 3 and has broken a few of the head bands that came with up but they were really cheesy anyway. She loves having some place to put all of her jewelry and hair things. We hang all of her hats on the wall next too it so she has a little dress up corner. Over all after 6 months it still works great and is in one piece. It was a little time consuming putting it together but well worth it to see her happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best vanity","review":"The assembly for this toy was ok---some of the screws aren't placed in the best spot, but the items that come with the vanity are junk!!

My daughter is easily impressed at 4, but I wouldnt give it to an older girl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daughter Loves This!!","review":"My 2 1/2 year daughter loves this toy and so do all the kids that come over. The only thing is the electronic accessories that make noise are ok. My suggestion is to buy the cheaper American Plastic Toy Beauty Salon without sounds and just buy a Disney Princess hair play set seperately (that makes noise if you want noise). Otherwise I couldn't be happier with the purchase. It did take my husband and Uncle a little while to put it together but it went together fine. I do highly recommend this product for your little girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a replacement blade!","review":"My wife bought me this grinder about ten years ago and I've had nothing but good luck with it. I do not grind spices or anything else with it, just coffee, for that purpose it works great. However, the blade recently cracked and fell off. This seemed like a simple problem, just get a new blade. Ha-Ha silly me. The motor still cranks but the grinder is worthless without a blade. I know just get a new one its only $20.00. I'm funny that way, its the principal. If anyone knows where I can get a new blade (...) If not I'll buy a new one, no biggy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your $20, and choose another better one","review":"I have used it for one month, and I have bad experience.

The coffee you made will be suck.Save you $20, and choose a $50 one, such as Braun KMM30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grinds fast but not thoroughly","review":"This grinder grinds very quickly, possibly due to the slanted bottom surface. However, I have found that it is difficult to get the beans evenly ground. If I grind for a short time most of the grind consistency is just right, but somehow I always end up with a few beans that have gone untouched. If I grind a little bit longer, the beans get too powdery and this does not make good coffee. Also is somewhat small on capacity and as someone else said, the lid does not fit tight at all. One additional minor point - the cord does not have any strain relief. I would guess that after a year or two of wrapping and unwrapping it around the grinder, it will begin to crack where it goes into the base of the grinder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than Delighted","review":"I liked this book less than either of its predecessors, Captivated and Fascinated. The Nikki Donovan story worked best for me; the Bertrice Small really didn't. I don't buy these anthologies for great romance -- I'm looking for a hot, interesting collection of stories. Here, frankly, the stories just weren't hot and interesting enough. I don't know whether the editors have changed since the first two historical erotic romance anthologies, but I was disappointed in both this and the first contemporary anthology put out by Brava."},{"rating":"1","title":"I, too, wasn't \\"delighted.\\"","review":"Perhaps the major flaw with this anthology is that the authors [and publisher] haven't caught on yet that many women require more than coupling in their soft porn. Yes, I too like the steamy sex and wild ideas I've never personally encountered. That said, I want story with my sex. There was little here. For me, it's not a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough","review":"The book is a very thorough historical review of priestly celibacy in the Roman Catholic Church.Without an avid interest it may become tedious. It does not have the sound byte style by means of which the modern reader is used to sourcing information. However if a committment is made to read it from cover to cover the reader will be enlightened by a new understanding of the disciplinary rule of celibacy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love those candy bars!","review":"Very interesting book, but I'm not sure that the Ann Arbor police got their man. Isn't anyone else suspicious of the Dean, or Kath? The book moved along real well, but I thought the ending chase was a little too long. I read the book on the train everyday, and couldn't wait for them to conclude the chase.

Not So Great Subtitles","review":"First off, I'd like to state that I give the anime itself a 5 star rating. The box housing both the DVDs and Blu-ray discs looks great. As far as video quality goes, I'm pretty pleased with it. There was one scene (I believe it was in Kosuda's room) that I noticed a little bit of banding (still watching the rest of the episodes). I can't say I have any issues with the audio. My one big complaint is the crummy subtitles! The text could stand to be a little larger, but that isn't my main issue with them. The main issue I have with them is that they are solid white. I never had much trouble reading these subtitles while watching FMA: BH, but there are a lot of scenes with lighter colors that make reading most difficult in this release. Seriously, I don't think it's asking much for some nice, quality subtitles... I've seen plenty of animes released by fansub groups that have amazing subtitles (good size, awesome colors, cool fonts, etc.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely for teens","review":"Yamada is a girl who enters high school with one goal: to have sex with 100 boys. Loaded with a dirty mind and naughty sense of humor. The thing is she is a virgin who has never has had a boyfriend. So her shyness always steps in. She meets a boy named Kosuda who is your typical average Joe, ordinary in every way. They begin to date and Yamada begins to discover love in its true form. This anime is a pure laugh a minute, with sexual inuendos, misunderstandings, jokes, and situations. But underneath the teenage sex comedy is a love story about 2 teens new to relationships, and their feelings toward each other. I will warn that this anime has nudity and language, but the nudity is not tasteless its more pure and explorative. I do not recommend it for kids or young teens. This is a great anime for those who love humor and romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a chance","review":"When I watched the first episode I thought this anime was just gonna be another full-on fan service anime, But the more I watched it, the more the characters grew on me especially Yamada.

I've pumped some work-out music to the garage stereo and some of Chuck Swindall's online teaching thru the living room TV. Unfortunately the receiver must be moved if you desire transmission to different spaces (This is the only reason I didn't give it a 5-star). For the price, it does what it is supposed to do. The quality of construction seems a little less than it could be, but I don't intend to play badminton with it. If you're listening thru Windows Media Player, you can use the remote to adjust volume (and move thru the MP3 tracks), but if you're sending straight from website to receiver, then you can't (unless I'm doing something wrong).

I had music! Then I went ahead and loaded the software and was impressed at all the options... including the ability to set up a whole house network with several of these gizmos (sort of like a poor man's Sonos system).I rarely give 5 stars, but this product deserves it.

The receiver device was easy as well.Took me a moment to coordinate the volume control on the computer with the volume control on the Logitech receiver and the volume control on their stereo -- so there wouldn't be a dramatic volume change switching from the Logitech input to others.Mom was thrilled.Then it just quit.
