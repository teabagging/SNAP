The unit contains a flexible, bi-shape (one shape on -- one shape off), stamped metal switch that seems to either wear or loose its precise bi-shape memory. The result is that either the switch does not make sufficient contact to deliver sufficient power to the motor, or it always maintains a slight contact that drains & ages the battery. Manually reshaping this \\"switch\\" restores proper function for a short time. But, such cold reshaping further deteriorates the metal's shape memory and the same type of failure follows sooner & sooner as additional fixes are applied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A product to avoid","review":"I purchased this product about 6 months ago.

I use it in the shower, as was also recommended to me. I find that I have to fill the reservoir twice per use. Filling the reservoir in the shower is relatively easy and the entire process takes me only about 3-4 minutes. The waterpik seems to hold a charge for a reasonable length of time.

It's much easier to handle, the reservoir holds more than enough water, but to my mind, the biggest thing is the customer service at Waterpik.

It lasted for about two years and then sprung a major leak. So I saw this version and thought, great! Less counter space and it's portable.Every time I use it, the nozzle pops out while I'm cleaning, which sprays water all over and requires me to stop, refit the nozzle and then continue--for another few seconds until it pops out again. By then, the chamber is empty and has to be refilled with water. The regular WaterPik holds enough water to last for two minutes. That's about the amount of time needed to do a thorough cleaning. This device runs out in about twenty to thirty seconds. And the dial at the base of the nozzle, which you're supposed to turn to direct the stream where you want it, tends to ensure that the nozzle pops out.This is almost useless. I'd like to find whoever designed it and send him or her for a check up with the dentist from Marathon Man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks Good, but is Poorly Designed","review":"After a few months the metal plug for charging the battery, which inevitably gets wet, begins to corrode and you can't charge it any more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let them pik your pocket","review":"Battery dies after about a month.

After that I can't tell if the motor is freezing-up, or the battery is going out. I was really hopeing to defy the odds and have this model work for me but alas I am not the chosen one. Returned to the store and bought the upgrade. I see that this new model is as loud as a leaf blower with a bad cylinder, and has more leaks than a water hose after it was run over by a lawn mower. we'll see if I have luck. If not I will be forced to buy the Panasonic. Funny how these oral irrigators become \\"must have\\" after a few days. It still hurts my gums like heck. Hopefully this is a result of it working. Anyway wish me luck!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"better than nothing","review":"This portable model gets the job done. it is not meant to replace your home model.

Don't buy this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money.","review":"Last year, my dentist told me to buy a Water-Pik. This model seemed to be the best buy. I've had a problem with charges not lasting long, but now, the power button has to be pressed repeatedly before it works, then it has to be held, as it will no longer stay on without being held. It is very hard to use this way. I can't send it back, as I can't find the slip. I can't really afford to buy another one, but I can't afford to lose my teeth, either. I hope to find a better model."},{"rating":"1","title":"great, for a few weeks...","review":"A cordless gadget you can use in the shower is a great idea. But the battery in this thing is really poor. I've gone through two of these now, and I'll have to buy something different. The first one was great at first, then worked for shorter and shorter periods after recharging. (Yes, I ran the battery all the way down before recharging to avoid the Nicad memory effect.) The central post in the socket where you plug in the charger corroded away after a month and a half. Bought a second one, and was careful to keep the socket dry. But it still works for shorter and shorter periods. Now it won't even last for one session after charging overnight. Buying a 3rd would be too dumb even for someone as stubborn as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I give up","review":"This is the 3rd time I have bought the handheld cordless WaterPik. I love it when it works. It really helps, my periodontist has really noticed a difference. The 1st one lasted about 6 months or so, the 2nd about 3 months, and this last one I bought July 6th and here it is Sept 12, and it's ready for the trash bin. Works great when you first get it, but after the first charge wears down, it just gets weaker and weaker until it dies completely. I have followed the charging instructions to the tee, and it still died.... I really need this product, but it looks like I will have to try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"My long-term testing results: good idea but poor reliability","review":"The Water Pik WP-360 is a great product concept and I enjoyed using it regularly, especially in the shower. Pressure (using the expert tip) is good while the unit is new and the batteries are fresh. Unfortunately after owning four of these over two years, I can say with authority this product is simply not built to withstand more than a few months of regular use regardless of how well it is cared for. If WP addressed the issues of poor battery characteristics and unacceptable reliability, this product would be a winner. Instead, I recommend the Panasonic EW1270AC Portable Oral Irrigator which is not rechargeable (uses AA batteries), has a smaller tank, and does not create as much pressure. However, it is well made and travels better since it is collapsible and does not need a charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This item is a total rip off. I bought a waterpik on the advice of my dentist - I already brush twice daily and floss several times a week. Had not owned a waterpik for many years, not since I had braces and owned one that had the tank reservoir that sits on the bathroom counter. Well this rechargeable model is very clumsy to use. The on/off are not easy to manage when it is spewing water. One \\"tank\\" is not enough to clean all your teeth for even a second each, let alone 5 secs per tooth. You will have to stop and refill it at least once, if not two times, to clean all your teeth. Definitely not worth the trouble and it will end up in a cupboard somewhere after I fumble with it a few more times in disbelief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Batteries last 6 months","review":"I used this twice a day. Worked great for 4 months. Then over the next 3 months the battery charge lasted less and less time. Now it is totally dead. Great design, poor battery quality. I will not be buying another to replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold charge","review":"The battery does not hold a charge and is not replacable. Like most Waterpick products a good idea poorly executed by a company trading what was once a good name for profits. I took it apart when it was apparant that it had become worthless due to the battery failure and found it cheaply constructed with plastic gears so I was bound to break down in otherways soon anyway. I think the marketing idea here is to make a quick buck off an impulse purchase. Stay clear of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I got this because I thought it would be more powerful and better than the Conair that I had. It is more powerful but the water reservoir is so small that you must keep refilling it again and again if you are going to do as the instructions suggest and spent 5 seconds on each tooth. The water reservoir is less than half the size of the Conair that I already had and it probably empties in around 5 seconds! After refilling and refilling and refilling I put this thing back in the box and shoved it away, I went back to using my Conair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"This item does not work as described.

Buy something different such as an oral breeze and don't waste your money on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money...","review":"Despite the negative reviews, I purchased this product because there are no electrical outlets in my bathroom. I should have heeded the advice! The product did cease to hold a charge within a couple of months of purchase. The resevoir is indeed too small. Mine ended up in the garbage.

Rather than throw way $20.00 I eventually removed the platic Perry clips and installed standar metal clips (wich work much better even when clipped to a belt) Perry uses an over agressive email advertising program that begins before they ship your merchandise.

Unlike many performers, the members of Gaelic Storm intentionally take time for their fans after each concert.

This isn't it! I was SOOOOO disappointed. Basically, there are two songs on the CD--one with words and one instrumental. All the instrumentals sound so similar as to be almost indistinguishable.

This does not qualify, I promise you. I don't condemn anyone for their personal taste, but if anyone recommended this to me as Irish music I'd be insensed. It's very standard American Pub fare at best. At worst, that is, as it would be to one who appreciates traditional Iriah music, it's utterly repellant."},{"rating":"1","title":"You do not get what the picture shows","review":"I expected to receive what I saw in the picture and thought it was a very fair price.

Dave needs the chipmunks to maintain his posh uptown lifestyle, but when the chipmunks try to exercise their entrepreneurial spirit and open up a photo booth, man, do they catch a beating. Dave doesn't want the chipmunks to make money unless he gets his 98%. After Dave discovers Alvin gave his prize harmonica to a sick child, his cold heart melts, and he allows Mrs. Claus to buy Alvin a new harmonica. Actually after watching this 200 times this year, it's starting to grow on me. It's one of my wife's favorites and my 2 year old likes it as well. All of that doesn't help the piss poor animation cheesy story but i guess there are worse Christmas specials."},{"rating":"2","title":"Josh Harms Alvin and the Chipmunks Christmas W/ the Chipmunls Reiew","review":"I really am a huge fan of the old school \\"Alvin and the Chipmunks\\" TV show. I purchased this item because I received a large amount of enjoyment from watching it with my sister's children over Christmas. Here is the reason I only gave it four stars. Throughout several of the episodes on the disc, large amounts of black watermarks appear on the screen. I know this is because several of the episodes are made from the mid 80s, but the watermarks are very distracting to me when I watch the shows. I always think something is wrong with my DVD player. If you love the old, \\"Alvin and the Chipmunk\\" show, you should definitely purchase this item. You will receive much enjoyment from watching the Chipmunks old holiday themed episodes.

The stopwatch function is easier to operate than any I have owned before.The only thing I would have had Invicta do a bit differently is the day numbers. There is all kinds of room to have made them bigger and I wish they were.I like the watch and think it to be good value for the money.Update: Sept. 29,2010. The watch kept good time and was durable.I liked it, but its stopwatch sweep hand stopped resetting to zero position. It would return, but not to Zero. this function is important to me.

I also have owned an Invicta Russian Diver Watch which I have had to send back to the company twice this year alone for repairs... I also have owned an Invicta Oversized Corduba Watch that has had so many defects that I don't have the time or patience to list them all here.I have not seen an Invicta design that I have not loved but the reality of their craftsmanship does not rise to the level of their design...

I love their storied and star-crossed history, and this book gives me new insights into the baseball culture and system. It's told from the perspective of a fan who gets the \\"once in a lifetime\\" job to mingle with the players on his hometown team. There are tremendous locker room scenes, and the players appear to be more human than we really see them when they are just on the field. Even Roger Clemens appears likeable, which is almost amazing! A close read of the book reveals that the writer was not too thrilled with the front office Sox organization, but it's the old story that familiarity breeds contempt. This is a book all baseball fans, and those who enjoy a well written book, will love! Read it, you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"a walk on Yawkey Way","review":"Scott Olivieri does a great job of describing what it means for a lifelong fan to move to the inner circle of the Red Sox. While baseball fans will find plenty of stats and baseball analysis, the casual baseball fan will not feel bogged down in numbers and technical terms. The human story of a young college grad having a chance of a lifetime is compelling as well. Particularly amusing is the story where he can't cash a check from Roger Clemens. Can't wait for the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not high quality","review":"This is a very cheap item. The watch pillows are tiny... I wear invicta watches and these pillows are small to the point of almost seeming like a mistake. And make no mistake the outside does not appear to be real leather but imitation.

It's unusable, for me anyway. Additionally, the latch was locked (!?) when I received the item. That wouldn't have been a problem had the key not been inside the case. It took me 20 minutes to 'break into' the brand new case. Locksmiths may enjoy the challenge but I didn't. Thank goodness the latch is more for show than to actually secure anything...

A good son, honorable man and definitely a tender lover. It is a refreshing read since it does not have complicated twists which makes it a more romantic read. There are also very interesting possibilities in the secondary characters. I hope Jamie and Sam would have stories of their own. I am still looking forward to Ms. Sattler's future books.

The gang from Ebb is back, but in book two we experience the reality and complexities of big city life creeping into the fabric of this small town. The good and the bad are not so easily distinguished. We are forced to accept the fact that \`things just aren't the way they used to be'. It takes the entire community to begin rebuilding lives and, ultimately, the town.

So I guess Pasquini has really simplified the subject, breaking it down into tables and diagrams and simple texts. it even has \\"clinical\\" boxes so you can appreciate what you're studying! if you're a first year stude, it'll help you become familiar with a lot of diseases, IM or IV sites,etc. My classmates find the pictures very cute (as w/ many others). I'm restudying it right now to prepare for surgery. it's just been a direct, miracle book.

For the size and cost, you get a lot of sound. The bass is incredible and the satellite speakers provide a full, clear sound. When you are sitting in front of your pc, the sound is amazing. The sound can also easily fill a typical room or two.One nice feature is that there is a line in on the wired remote. This allows you to connect an external device to the speakers. For example, I have a \\"boom box\\" which I use to listen to the radio. It has a nice sound, but since getting these speakers, I have plugged the boom box head phone jack into the line in on the wired remote. You can do the same with any portable device like an IPod or Walkman. Also, since you control the volume via the wired remote, you don't have to place the satellite speakers right next to your monitor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great small speakers.","review":"Im very impressed with these speakers. They have great sound, they are small, and they weren't very expensive. I wouldn't recommend them for big rooms, more small bedrooms. In my opinion, they sound great. I would have liked the tower speaker cords to be a little longer so that i could experiment with them a little more (see if they sounded better spaced throughout my room) but I don't really care. I had never seen speakers like the ones in the tower before, so i really was impressed with them.For sure I would buy them again if i had the choice. In fact, just because i like speakers and a lot of surround sound, plus some more bass, Im thinking of buying another set. My ears aren't sensitive to hear tiny differences in sound quality, so sorry if you hear them and hate the speakers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slow start! Great finish","review":"When I started up these speakers I had high hopes, which came crashing down immediately. The sound was only slightly better than the $30 speakers I was replacing.

However, I have experienced continual problems with it staying connected to the phone unless they were within 12 inches of each other and had line of sight.Then, it works fine, the sound is good and the functionality good too. However, the battery life is quite short, lasting only 16 hours on average with very little talk time. Then, it takes 5 hours to recharge it.I've decided to purchase my second Bluetooth headset, in this case, a Cardo Scala 500. Hopefully my luck will be better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good product","review":"Positive: Converts negatives and positives into digital photos very easily. Recognizes more than one photo on the scanner and creates a separate image. The included software is excellent especially Adobe Elements. Set up is very easy. Tech support at Epson is very good.Negative: Price - a bit high, but I think worth it. Software setup had a very old driver. Required download of the current driver after a call to tech support. Takes time to convert negatives/postive slides to photos (but worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Difference between sub-$200 and this baby","review":"The obvious difference between this $500+ vs sub-$200 scanners is better construction and much longer bulb life. I bought this model for scanning mainly family photos but it much more capable than just that.Epson's own scanning app is easy to use and UI are easy to understand. The free Silverfast scanning app work fine until it crashed during a cancelled scan. For unknown reason after the crash, it won't accept registration again. Which is fine...I can live with out it.I gave this scanner a four star because this kind of quality used to cost over $1000 in semi-pro range for professional usage. Granted it's no drum scan, but that would be a total overkill."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pricey, but worth it!","review":"I did a lot of research on scanners before I bought the V700. My requirements are to be able to scan everything from 35mm slides and negatives to 4X5 transparencies and negatives. This replaces an older Epson flatbed/film scanner that I thought was doing a good job, until I scanned the same negative on the V700. Holding the resolution constant between the two, and scaning the same 4X5 BW negative, the scans seem sharper with better contrast. Controlling a scan is easy with the provided software. I have scans from a dedicated 35mm film scanner and find that scans from the V700 range from nearly as good to better than the dedicated scanner results (all run at 3200 dpi). It installed very easily into Adobe Photoshop CS3. I definitely recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great find","review":"I had thought I would buy the Nikon slide scanner but I was cautious because of the reviews and the ability to only handle one slide at a time on the $500 scanner. Then I tripped over the Epson \\"film scanner\\" (I was searching for slide scanner) and saw all the positive reviews. The product came very fast (in a huge box surprisingly) and has worked well from day one. One curious trait is that if I select auto dust removal, it sometimes removes the eyes from people - very bizarre. When I turned off that option, things worked fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enhance those old slides, negatives, and photos","review":"The technology is finally good enough to digitally preserve the deteriorating photos, slides, and film that may be laying around house. The v700 more than adequately handles them all, even allows for some enhancement of images from old slides and negatives. Before you buy, read the extensive testing and review of the v700 at http://www.photo-i.co.uk/Menus/reviews.htm, which includes detailed instructions and resulting photos. I'd really give this about 4 1/2 stars, as the scanner is slow and the included software is a little weak. I found that the professional version of VueScan brought out the best performance from the v700 for black and white negatives. We need to digitize the old family photos for the generations to come, and the v700 makes this possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good scanner, not such a good company","review":"The scanner is pretty good, but Epson no longer deserves a high reputation as a company. They advertise, for example, that your package includes Adobe Photoshop Elements, but what you get is Elements version 3, which has been obsolete for 3 years! Elements 6 is the current version. And,if you check their website there is no provision to make general contact to register a complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor documentation","review":"Poor documentation for the Epson V700 scanner, in fact there is no written documentation.For example, to get instructions for loading and scanning a film strip you have to wade through a cumbersome file-a so-called User Guide.Considering the price of this scanner, the least Epson could have done is furnish a User Guide on a CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a fine and mature product! A clear winner!!!!","review":"I own a Epson high-end scanner 2 models back. This model is a clear winner and upgrade as I see it. The software installation is just perfect in my Vista 32 Dell Workstation. Right out of the box -- put a photo on the flatbed - press the one button scan and you will be amazed. The digital-ice as we all know is amazing - a real edge is hardware assisted restoration. All the manual and fine adjustments are available in the professional mode. The build quality is clearly excellent.Good software package with Silverfast. Support is good at this level but it is not their pro-level support.This is a great choice to sum it up! It does as good a job on 35mm film as mu Nikon coolscan 4000. That is a major achievement!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Epson ok","review":"The Epson V700 does scan at a high resolution, which was my first priority. I will say the holder system for transparencies and negatives could have been designed better. For $500.00 I would have liked a little more elegance. It also would have been nice to have a firewire interface.Overall - it will do the job of scanning my 1000's of legacy film images."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good- constantly warming up","review":"Epson discontinued it's 1680 scanner and this seemed to be it's replacement. I'm not sure if the one I received was broken, but it stalled for 1 minute to \\"warm up\\" every time you changed between reflective to transmissive scan methods. The 1680 did not do this.Maybe I'm in the minority, but my normal usage is to scan a document, then 1 or more associated transmissive images. This was a show stopper for me, so back it went."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complicated software- support has not responded yet.","review":"Epson Perfection V700 scanner seems to make a very good scan.

It has its problems (the scanner doesn't capture everything in the scanning area), but for the most part, it has always produced high quality scans from both negatives and positives."},{"rating":"2","title":"great scanner","review":"Bottom line; I am not a professional photographer. I wanted a scanner to digitalize slides, photos, and negatives. The V500 seems to do that. I loaded the Silverfast dvd and it seems over my head at this time. Any enhancing of the photos I do with iPhoto and that seems to work at this time. Maybe in the future I will use Silverfast.I have found that sometimes photos age better than negatives and slides.I am having fun learning to digitalize.The V700 is doing well by me. A good investment."},{"rating":"2","title":"epson V700","review":"Received in good shape, double boxed. I use this scanner for TEM 3 x 4\\" negatives, and it does a better job than my previous Afga Duoscan T2500 whichworked well for almost ten years before developing vertical banding.Scanner is fast (two negatives in 2.5 minutes). One speck of dust under the glass unfortunately, will have to live with that as no luxury of sending back.All and all, a great purchase at the price, now let's see how long it workswithout any issues"},{"rating":"2","title":"topnotch","review":"this scanner seems to be so good (after a months use) that I'm tempted to start shooting film again after 8 years of nothing but digital. At 4800dpi,(6400 seems like overkill and photo-i's reviews indicate 4800 seems to be optimal) from a 35mm transparency you get approximately a 50mb file! Unless your printing murals, this is probably overkill too. To get that kind of file and resolution from a digital slr, be ready to get into the 20-24megapixal and 7 to $8000 dollar range for a camera. Of course, this is speaking from a position of strictly dollar for dollar resolution and file size.AI's software is adequate to get a image into photoshop. stay away from any manipulation in scanning software unless no other choice. Not at all impressed w/ Digital Ice. It removes dust on color photos only, but upon magnified inspection of scanned image, leaves large pixilation where the dust was.Great scanner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Clarity & Great Batch Capabilities","review":"I shoot a lot of medium format and this scanner is incredible. Absolutely incredible. The clarity, even at 600dpi is outstanding. On top of that, it makes very light work of batch scanning.

I can say that this is a beautiful mixture of aggressive riffs and charming voice plus progressive beat and virtuoso solos. Plus a taste of Hindu in the lyrics. Sean Reinert - excellent form (not formless, thanks God :)Absolutely a must for Cynic, late Death and Canvas Solaris (turns out that last.fm recommendations are 100% accurate in my case again). You won't be disappointed with this record, I listen to it more than new Metallica's and Cynic's CD. It has a strength, beauty and great drive, forcing you to return to it.

If it were straight instead of curved (it is not bendable BTW), it would be 3 ft in length. It weighs a lot (can't really hold it for long), is too noisy, has 1 setting, and vibrates too much (for intimacy or to massage body parts). Best use seems to be to place it under the mattress to vibrate the bed, but it is really good at this. Good gag gift (I'm still laughing over it), and there might be some physical therapy uses.

Although it bears no resemblance to Bowie material, this album, (once you get past the band's silly name and the comic book cover art)actually turns out to be a rather tasty collection of mid-70's power pop. The songs are quite catchy, usually sporting a heavy riff tempered by Beatle-y chords and vocals. Bowie completists will probably want a copy, as well as anyone who enjoys \\"roots\\" power pop like Artful Dodger,Topaz,or Badfinger.Remastering is excellent;part of a series of Bowie-related reissues by a British label."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large, Clunky Design","review":"mousie didn't like this at all, aside from a cusory glance at the dangling mice.the ball is very large and constructed of a heavy material. it is covered in wrapped strings that have plastic glittery strands poking out.the 'pop up' mice don't actually pop up, but they hang by strings inside the holes of the ball.the 'tweeting' device is a large cardboard cylinder with a metal and rubber squeaker (as the cylinder rolls, the latex rubber compresses and forces air through the metal grill to make it squeak). when mine arrived, the squeaker device had fallen apart into three component pieces. additionally, the squeaker is not attatched to anything inside the ball, and just clunks around and could possibly fall out."},{"rating":"1","title":"different instruction - not differentiated","review":"This does not address differentiated instruction regarding activities for different levels of abilities in the same classroom.

The best thing about this book is that it offers a lot of problems in many areas so that a student may quickly find and target areas for review. My biggest peeve about help books is that the reader is bound to see problems from their own text time after time, and each of those problems is wasted energy. Always consult your text and then supplement this text for variety, but not authority. Learn from the in class text as much as possible because this book is the cut and dry mathematics.

Being a fan of such progressive rock groups like Yes, ELP, Magellan, Jethro Tull, UK, and more, I am very very enthuisiastic about a bigger focus on progressive rock here in the 90's. Trent Gardner wrote all the songs, and I must say he is a prolific writer and performer these days. I was impressed with John Petrucci's performances as well, he is a virtuoso guitarist on a par with Steve Morse and Al di Meola!I give this CD 5 stars!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"i tried to like this.....really i did","review":"With all the names that are on this disc and all that talent it really made me wonder why i had a hard time getting through a second listening of this wasteful piece of crap....i can only hope that all those guys can look back on this and swear to never lend their names to anything like this again.

The shoe box centers also take more time to construct but are easily used by the children. I recommend this book. I was able to quickly add new centers to my collection. The centers are colorful and engaging. A worksheet is included on which children can record their work.

I completely agree with a couple of the reviewers who claim Gary's books are just recycled material, over and over again. I couldn't agree more.... until this book.I have to say, I got A LOT out of this book, that I hadn't in some of his other books. There are plenty of new ideas presented in this book, and I also like the format of this book. His writing style is much more fluent in this book than in books of the past. Also, his message is as clear as ever. In addition, this is one of the first books that I've read of Gary's, where he recommends eating fish. I believe in early 2000 or so, is when he started promoting fish, after 20+ years of promoting a vegan diet. But I hadn't seen it in print until this book.All in all, I think this is Gary's best book yet. I'm still kind of surprised with some of the reviews on here. Maybe they didn't actually read the book; it was more of a skim through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recycling Personified","review":"If you've read one Gary Null book, you've read them all. He is no doubt highly knowledgeable and dedicated to his subject, but when I buy two books with different titles by Gary Null and find they are the same, I'm pretty annoyed.

He is not a mainstream artist, and that is a wonderful thing. He has his own sound, and is someone who will withstand the test of time. I own all three of his CD's and I can tell you that to not have them, my collection would be incomplete. He tells a story in a manner which many artists simply cannot. This is a CD truly for the mature folk who like to groove to a sound that has no time limitations. It sounds good today, yesterday, and in many years to follow. Definitely one of the top 5 artists in the neo soul arena."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank GOD!","review":"This album is the manual for real R&B. A number of these songs will sound familiar because 112, Case, Musiq among others have used songs written by Eric Roberson.

The unit was DOA and never powered up so Thomson sent me the M2000 512 as replacement. Believe it or not the new unit wouldn't turn on either. Of course we tried new batteries, reversing the battery, battery tester and holding the on button for over a minute. I was sent another identical replacement unit. This one consumes a brand new energizer or duracell battery in less than an hour. When you remove the battery and put in a tester, it still reads very good! So this one is also being replaced. I went with the RCA because I keep everything on SD Cards. I like the looks and feel of the unit. When it worked, I had no complaints. Support has been responsive. Judging from the other reviews it looks like I have just had a bad run of luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, I guess, for short pieces.","review":"Pro: inexpensive. Secure digital card slot.

However, as a continuation of the Badge of Honor series it was a severe disappointment. The continuity problems described by other reviewers were jarring, to say the least. Also, the intricate descriptions of everyday modern electronics (cell phones, digital cameras, laptop computers) made for a very tedious read at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've heard of literary license...","review":"...but this was kind of off-putting.Full disclosure: I have read every single WEB Griffin book available (Brotherhood, Corps, BoH, etc.) and as a rule love each and every one of them.But the singular sensation of having a storyline that for all the previous books was so obviously early 1970's ripped into the present day wasn't a very satisfying one. Part of the thrill of reading the early BoH novels was seeing the characters deal with the 'limited technology' available in 1975. People actually could drop off of the face of the earth for a day if they weren't near a phone - now Griffin has to invent weak explainers as to why the persons cell phone didn't get answered.For someone who picks this up at the airport bookstore it's going to be a great read but for those of us who have followed the careers of Matt Payne and Peter Wohl through the series it's disconcerting at best.Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Final Justice","review":"It was Griffin's usual good read. Although he appears to be well versed in law enforcement protocol and hierarchy, Mr. Griffin is a little remiss in his American history. Neither Stonewell (sic) nor Stonewall Jackson participated in the Battle of New Orleans. Rather, our troops were led by Andrew \\"Old Hickory\\" Jackson. This certainly won't stop me from reading his stuff, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's have a little consistency here.....","review":"I expected a lot better here. The first novels in the series were set clearly in the early to mid 1970's. All of a sudden, Griffin shifts to the present, with the cell phones and laptops and the Buick whatever (???). With that glaring time shift, and nobody getting any older (i.e. Matt's still in his 20's), it made the plot and storyline fade into the background. I spent the whole time reading it looking for timeline inconsistencies. I'd really like to know who actually wrote this one, because it wasn't up there with the rest of Griffin's works and didn't read like his other novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absoloute Junk!","review":"The characters have been weakend. The plot is so convoluted, it's not even funny. Don't even get me started on the total lapse in continuity!The time line has progressed 30 years with no aging of the main characters. The series has gone from the rich vibrant atmosphere of 1970's Philly to 2003 cliches! They even made a refrence to the Soprano's for God's sake! This book is a joke! It was obviously written not only by an author who is not W.E.B. Griffin, but this guy didn't even read the previous books in the series for character details!As the title of my review states; ABSOLUTE JUNK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why was this book written?","review":"I was really surprised to see this latest installment of the Badge Of Honor series. I figured that Matt Paine had killed any hope of a police career after his screw-ups in The Investigators. How does a cop go against the advice and orders of his superiors, get a witness/informer killed and still have a job? I don't care how high in the police establishment your rabbi is, he may help you avoid jail time but your job would be toast.Another thing that I didn't like about the novel was my growing dislike of Matt Paine. If an author is constructing a series of books around a central character shouldn't he try to make the guy likeable? In the last few books I started to find myself wishing the spoiled rich kid would actually start paying a price for his arrogance.After I read this book I just stopped reading this series. I jumped over to the Presidential Agent series and find them a good read, wordy in parts, but I still like the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Author?","review":"I started reading this series after having enjoyed other Griffin series. As was the case with the other ones, I truly became addicted to this one, that was until this novel. Within a few pages I could not help but wonder if it was actually written by another author, since the story (timeline, characters, etc.) had changed significantly. Perhaps, it would be a good book by itself, but as a fan of the series I now find myself looking for the differences in the characters and the storyline instead of reading the book. How can one go from needing to find a phone booth (in the last book) to now having a cell phone available...a 30 year jump in time but the character's ages remained the same...frustrating. If you are going to read the series, don't consider this as part of that read."},{"rating":"1","title":"EDITOR WANTED-PLEASE!","review":"IT IS OBVIOUS THAT NO ONE WHO EVER READ A PREVIOUS BADGE OF HONOR SERIES NOVEL HAD ANYTHING TO DO WITH EDITING THIS ONE.NOW THAT I THINK ABOUT IT, I WONDER IF ANYONE LITERATE EVER READ THIS BEFORE PRINTING.

But oh my, the let down. I feel as if Mr Griffin has treated me like a fool. The change in the time line of Final Justice was just too glaring, why was it done? My disappointment is overwhelming. In his Corp novels I could accept his misconceptions of Australia and our armed forces (we drink our beer cold unlike the English and our naval personnel do not salute with the palm outward but in a straight up and down style similar to your servicmen although our army salutes the way Mr Griffin describes) since they were by an American authorI digress. I felt as if a ghost writer had taken over for Mr Griffin as there were subtle changes to his style and language as well.Please put the next book back into the original timeline and get rid of the technological wizardry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing book in a great series","review":"I loved all of the other books in the series, but this book was very disappointing. The time frame of the book was placed in modern day, versus in the seventies, yet the characters are all of the same age. The seventies time frame made gave the series some flavor that this one was missing. The series was great until this book as it was realistic. In this book matt Payne becomes a super cop and is using his gun more often than any other cop. The other books were good to not make it a Hollywood gun battle, but this book was no where as creative or enjoyable as the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Enough","review":"Anacona was a pretty good book.

It is not fully bluetooth compatible, there is not a direct interface with a PC which forces you to use monthly billed products known as VCast. You cannot directly download MPG files without purchasing a USB interface and a memory card. I have run numerous Bluetooth headsets. The sound quality of the headsets is poor. It does not have any of the 1.2 bluetooth features available. Like mute and call waiting. It feels like verizon went to Samsung and said design me the cheapest phone possible with supposed features. (all limited). Do not make the mistake I did if you want a technically savvy phone the A950 is not it. The retail price dropped from 299.00 down to 80.00 on this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crippled Phone so Verizon can upsell services","review":"This phone has had most of its functionality disabled so you have to buy additional services from verizon so they can make more money.1) You can't use a USB cable to synchronize contacts with Outlook. You can however use verizon's $19.99 wireless sync service to do this.2) This phone only has embarrassingly unprofessional ring tones on it. AND you can't upload your own for free--you have to BUY them from verizon.3) All of the Bluetooth capability is disabled except for handsfree--you can't transfer data and you can't control your phone from your PDA or PCThis doesn't appear to be Samsung's doing because after talking with the verizon people it appears that they are crippling all of their phones to try to force people to spend more $$$.

It is big and heavy. The mp3 player is a pain to use and has poor sound quality. Hands down, worst phone I could have bought. I plan to cancel with Verizon, even if I have to pay the fee.

These boots are a very nice compromise! While they probably won't ever be confused with real leather, they are attractive and don't look super cheap like other non-leather boots I've seen. They're well-made, with good grip on the tread, and are surprisingly comfortable. I'm a pretty reliable size 8, and when I first tried them on I considered ordering up a half size since they fit a little snug at the top of the foot, but it wasn't too bad, and they actually settled in after a couple weeks. They are pretty much a perfect fit now. I have average size calves and they shaft is not too loose or too tight. Overall, very happy with this purchase and you cannot beat the price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boots for Comfort","review":"I really love these boots, their classic! I love the fit and the way they strech. I normally cannot wear any shoes/boots with heels but, these were a breeze. I can stay in them all day, I guess it's the rubber soles.

I am able to walk with these boots anywhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The boots tore up in a month!","review":"I do not like these boots. I have a job where I have to walk for 7 hours a night, and I needed a boot that would last. Well, these boots didn't even last a month. The bottom of the heel is already completely off of both boots. They also hurt my back and knees. Definitely not like walking on air. My advice... buy Clarks Diamond Glow. They work wonders for people on their feet all day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice combination of comfort & style--Great for slim calves","review":"This is the third pair of Aerosoles boots that I tried & the only ones I didn't have to return. The other 2 (Cardinal & With Love) were too wide in the calves. The shaft measurements given were not accurate. Lasticity are stated as being 14 inches around on Amazon, but stated as 10 inches around on the Aerosoles website. The size 9 is about 13 inches around, which is almost perfect for me especially if I wear thick tights. I like that these boots are dressy, but also comfortable & practical. The rubber sole has nice traction. The shaft has a cloth liner & the insole has moderate cushion. I debated on whether to get wide width, because some reviewers said these are narrow, but I went with regular width & they fit fine. They are not the most durable, though, so probably not a good outdoor or heavy use boot. The outer coating is thin & peeled around the ankles after repeated use. But overall these are good looking boots for around $50."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a boot that fits!","review":"I am 5'7\\" and 135 lbs.

Although my primary recommendations for this concerto are Grimaud's and Perahia's (especially with Davis and the Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra) brilliant, almost transcendental, performances, Brendel offers a lyrical, highly introspective performance that deserves listening. He is backed by the great German conductor Kurt Sanderling and the Philharmonia Orchestra. The Philharmonia Orchestra's performance is first rate; most noteworthy are the wind and string sections. Although Philips' recordings of both Schumann pieces are quite good; the recording quality improves substantially for the Fantasy. Devout Brendel fans will certainly want to acquire this fine recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"pure","review":"I was sure that Brendel could do something great with this work. Altough it sounds grey, that's probably the sort of color of what we're hearing here. Anyway, I believe that this piece can be a bit better by clashing important melodies between the piano and the orchestra, and maybe it does need a bit more warm and colour (like Abbado recordings with DG). Somebody should try a smaller orchestra, like a chamber orchestra. The fantasy in c is a great complement and adds more information about Schumann's literature. A worthy cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Find another book","review":"It is a good thing that this book is out of print!

Always had some issue with the door zipper not working smoothly from the start but overlooked because I needed the greenhouse for winter. However, having used it for 12 months now, there are serious issues with the outer zipper door sticking because it is wrinkled up in the opening, the sewed part is actually lumpy and causes it to grab. On the interior screen door, the net material is already deteriorated to the point you can stick your finger through it when you put a very slight pressure on the fabric.

My favorite stories are \\"Speaking in Tongues,\\" \\"Brownies,\\" \\"Our Lady of Peace,\\" \\"Drinking Coffee Elsewhere,\\" and \\"Geese.\\" The aforementioned stories are enriching and empowering. I love ZZ Packer's style. Her style is a cross between Zadie Smith and Toni Morrison. I will look for this author's work in the future. I cannot recommend Drinking Coffee Elsewhere enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"it's missing something.","review":"Maybe I'm just too different from ZZ Packer to fully appreciate her book. But all the people in her stories are so different... and none of them really clicked (I kinda liked the little girl who ran away though).In fact, some of them seemed like unfair characterizations. The people weren't real - they're maybe what you'd guess someone like that might be like. Not well rounded enough to catch you and draw you in.Some of the stories were hard to get through, especially the first one. At least one of them didn't seem to have a point (although that's typical of short story collections).But again, I want to say.. maybe it's because I'm not enough like her. Maybe I can't fill in the blanks the way that someone who is like her can. Maybe you have to have some of these experiences in order figure these people out.If you're intrigued by the types of charcters she writes about, I'd encourage you to give it a try.

In this book Packer would end a paragragh with one thought and start the next paragraph with a different thought that did not connect with the previous thought....

I've been using my last remaining Hummingbird for a check after doing my best with the Waterpik flosser and it consistently removes particles missed by the Waterpik.

The back teeth are nearly inaccessible to the head because of it's angle.

I have been on the lookout for an alternative. This looked good on paper, so I decided to give it a try. For me, this has turned out to be useless. First of all, the angle is such that you cannot reach the back teeth at all without contortion. Also, unless you have wide even gaps between the teeth, this does not go in. So, I can floss about 50% of my teeth with this thing. There is an old joke in dentistry \\"You don't have to floss ALL your teeth everyday - just the ones you want to keep\\". So, this is a great flosser for people that don't want to keep all their teeth (unless you happen to have nice even large gaps between all your teeth).

Good thing it is not too expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAPPY","review":"Now I know why this product was only $6....because it works like crap.If you purchase this product it will be the worst choice you have made.It says \\"waterpik\\" but the only water you will be using it the water to wash the blood out of your mouth because of it puncturing your gums.I tried it once and will never use it again nor will I buy another WaterPik product because of this.If you like the feeling on something stabbing your gums and the taste of blood, you might like this product ,but otherwise there is no use for this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING WATER PICK","review":"THE PRODUCT IS DISAPPOINTING, I HADTHE IMPRESSION THAT \\"WATER PICK POWER FLOSSER\\" WORKS WITH WATER NOT LIKE A CONVENTIONAL FLOSS.THE FLOSSER IS QUITE FLIMSY."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother with this flosser","review":"this is such a wimpy product.

I was surprised when I tried it for the first time. It has a very thin plastic probe that vibrates, but to no effect. It does not remove the plaque between the teeth and the probe is so fine and limber that it does not do anything around the gum line. Sometimes the end of the probe closest to the handle gets too close to the teeth and is very uncomfortable. I cannot see any use for this item. I tried it twice and went back to conventional floss.

Yes, in the last 20 minutes or so of the film it does become a carbon copy of the original Last House on the Left BUT the filmmakers do throw in a twist ending. The film over all was brutal but not as brutal or well executed as [...]. Both far superior revenge films. The opening \\"message\\" seemed kind of silly as if the filmmakers were trying to justify the brutality they were about to subject you too. The torture did make me squirm at times but again, Hood Has Eyez knocks this out the box. Recommended for those who like rape/revenge films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not cool....","review":"As a fan of the horror/exploitation genre, I saw \\"Last House on the Left\\". As disturbing as that movie is it does offer the revenge and retribution angle at the end which offers some solace to the audience. Also, it wasn't quite as sickenly graphic in its depictions of brutal violence. \\"Choas\\" even felt the need to subsitute the very effective rape scene in \\"Last House on the Left\\" with a truely puke worthy rape of a corpse scene.On a positive note, the acting isn't bad. The victims are effective and the bad guys are believable. Its the changes to the script that are what ruins this movie. If it was a straight remake it may well have worked with this cast..Where \\"Last House on the Left\\" left the viewer wanting to take a long shower, \\"Choas\\" leaves the viewer wanting to take a bath with a razor blade. Alas, this movie will not make it into my DVD collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"...watch out - even the cover is a fake!!!!","review":"roger ebert never said this in that kind of context. he gave the movie \\"no stars\\". that says it all. even the cover is a fake. save your bucks... falco go home!!!! we don't need trash like that!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"Don't waste your money, it STINKS!!!

I'll admit, I love gore and that's why I decided to buy this movie but this movie only had two \\"gore\\" scenes that we poorly scripted and as well as acted. In fact, the whole movie had corny dialogue, ammeter actors, and on top of that a stupid ending. I like movies with a cliffhanger or even bad endings but movies that just cut you off with no hope of anything good or bad (like this movie had) is what grinds my gears.

In this case, the cautionary tale is something like - don't get involved with dirty strangers cause they may cut off parts of your anatomy and force you to eat it. If it wasnt so low budget, it might have been OK for a gore flick. But when he supposedly cut off the nipple..you could see it was fake blood and that booby was bigger than the other one(hidden nipple and top of breast). What a snore!I love horror movies and am not offended by violence, as a matter of fact, I love the Saw series, but this was garbage. And if DeFalco thought the ending was \\"realistic\\", then he's a bigger idiot than I thought.This film has no character development no advancement and no real lesson to learn except the one they have to blatantly tell you at the beginning of the movie.This flick belongs on television(basic cable) at 3 am"},{"rating":"1","title":"CHECK OUT MAYA BAROVICH IN...","review":"One of the girls who plays a victim in this film also showed up in the first season of the Jamie Kennedy Experiment as the girl he played a dating game joke on.

Much scarier than anything in this film.As for this film, yes, it's a copy of a much better film but instead of railing against it, just ignore it. There are worse films out there and the more attention films like this and Hostel get, the more we'll see of them.

The actors who played Angelica and Emily were just awful. In fact, most of the acting in this movie was bad - I have seen better acting in B movies. The only disturbing thing about this film was David Defalco prancing around the coroner's office talking about how his film is so brutal. Another reviewer compared him to a WWF guy, and that reviewer was right on point.The bottom line, if you are looking for a film to disturb you, DON'T go with this movie.

It is played with daily. The kids hop everywhere - down the hall, in the kitchen, around the yard...I look for toys that are fun, educational, and fairly quiet. I want toys that are easy to play with and have more than a button you push to make something happen. I want toys that encourage exploration of the world.This toy meets those requirements. I would say it is very educational in that it encourages large motor skills, balancing, eye and hand coordination etc. It is also educational in that it encourages imagination- hey, I'm a Kangaroo mommy!

I ordered 2 of these and 1 of a name brand that was one size up for my tall kid. This is just as durable as the name brand and the name brand one was huge, big enough for me to bounce on and I am 5'9\\". Keep in mind when sizing these that your kids legs should be bent when on them - for balance and to be able to hop.

I tried to rinse it, but of course the water made no difference. So it was a waste of money for me and a big disappointment for the kids. I just chalk it up to the risk we take by ordering online for the convenience of shopping at home. Once in a while we waste our time and money with bad products."},{"rating":"1","title":"small and deflates very quickly","review":"I read a few bad reviews of this product before buying. There were so many good reviews that I thought I would take a chance. Well, this item got returned. We gave this to our 3 year old son for Christmas and he was so excited when Daddy inflated it, but it did not last long. It deflated to the point that it would not bounce at all in a matter of an hour or two. We tried inflating it again, but the same thing happened again. The ball also seemed very small. My three year old is short for his age and it seemed just right for him. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description","review":"By the description, this ball should have been big, and fun for my 8 yr olds....not so much.

The product desscription lead me to believe that the ball would accomodate a child between 4 and 17 years old and up to 100 lbs. It is too small for a 5 year old. I don't know any 5 year old that is 100 pounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for all ages! (adults, too)!","review":"I bought one of these Hedstrom Fun Hop balls a few years ago for my two young kids, and it is one of very few toys that have gotten regular use from both of them ever since we got it. As they've grown, we've added a little more air to it to accommodate their size, since it says you can inflate it up to 53\\" (which is over 4 feet high, if you do the math!). However, upon the most recent inflation, which made it a little over 2 feet in diameter, they bounced on it a few times, and then it developed a leak near the handle. The ball was very taut, so I just wanted to warn people that the 53\\" diameter limit is probably too high. Other than that, this has been a wonderful toy, and I'm planning on buying another one since they've enjoyed it so much and it's good exercise, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Small and poor quality","review":"I work with 3 and 4 year old childrenWe have purchased several hopping balls in the past,for inside use during cold weather.These were very small.

I remember having them when I was a child, they were Hoppity Hops then.Why am I writing a review on it now, 6 years later? Because our Ball Bounce comes out of the basement over and over and for the past month, my 6-year-old daughter has been using to get around the house. She bounces from the living room to the bedroom, the bathroom to the kitchen table, and everywhere else in between.I thought it was worth revisiting the product and letting others know that it has lasted for a long time and through multiple children.We have had to top it off with air over the years but it really maintains its shape. Since we filled it, it has never been deflated. The seams are strong and there are no signs of wear.It has not been used outside since our driveway is gravel but I'm sure it would work well on macadam (blacktop) or on the grass.My daughter is 45 pounds and has no trouble getting it to bounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item arrived with hole, quickly deflated....","review":"As soon as my husband blew this item up and my kids used it, it deflated.

It is just as I remember as kid. My daughter is a little short for it yet but She still has fun with it and once she's tall enough to sit on top and not the side to bounce, I'm sure she'll love it even more. My ONLY Problem (and it's a small one) is the rod that plugs the air hole has to be checked every so often to make sure it's not coming out. But other than that small problem, it's wonderful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money.","review":"This was recommended along with a mini-tramp for up to 300 pounds.

He hops around the house on it all the time. When we first blew it up Christmas Eve, we were surprised how small it was (I bought the medium thinking he could grow into it) but he doesn't seem to mind. I would suggest going up a size when ordering. Overall, one of his favorites. It's nice to see a good ole fashioned toy wins out these days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived greasy and considerably smaller than description","review":"Arrived covered in grease, even the box has grease spots on the inside.

Really disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a","review":"Our kids love these, but the one we had was too big for our two-year-old, so we got this for his second birthday. He's just big enough to use it, so I would say this is probably just the right size for ages 2-4. This seems as sturdy as normal for these kind of things, so as long as it's not abused it should hold up just fine. The valve to inflate it is easier to use than most balls. It works great on carpet or hard floor (or outside), and is a great way for kids to have fun and use some energy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Slimy","review":"Product arrived promptly.

We figured it would save us a lot of fights in the future and allow both children to get some exercise indoors. The durability seems good, but the ball is much smaller than our five-year-old's. Our son was disappointed and has pretty much ignored it for the week he's had it. He is about 42 inches tall. I could see this ball being good for an 18-month-old or even a two-year-old, but it did not work for an average-build four-year-old. We'll be giving it to our niece for her 2nd birthday in a month and replacing it with a bigger one for our son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small to be fun","review":"I guess my kids are larger than average (they are 3 and 6), but this was so small, they could not even use it.

We received our first one as a gift when our first child was 4 yrs old. Four of our children have enjoyed this one ball over the past 6 years and it is still going. We've tried buying each of them their own but none have held up like Hedstrom. So this year they each have their own Hedstrom ball. Most people use these indoors, but our kids have always played with them outside, they pretend they are horses. This is the only bounce ball I would recommend for outdoors. And if that were not enough - with this merchant you get excellent service too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to hop on","review":"Lasted for a season, but kids really enjoyed it.

In this darker, melodramatic season, there were a few times you could notice the actors actually struggle in their performances. There are also a few moments of poor editing. Season 4 really shows how well done the first three seasons were. By not being that well done.The two-part episode was Castle's \\"jumping the shark\\" moment for me.

And the boring, boring, annoying, boring, stupid show that is Season 4 resulted.I ended up actually despising Beckett, disliking Esposito intensely, and wanting just to slap Gates. And wth happened to Lainie? Did zombies come and suck her brain out? And Jenny is all of a sudden practically a 'ho? What? Castle and Ryan were the only 2 that bore any resemblence at all to the characters from the first 3 seasons.

Basically a crime of the week premise, it is also a love story. And just as criminal investigations rarely run smoothly, neither does the quest for love. Nathan Fillion has more natural charisma than the law allows and in the persona of wealthy, best-selling author Richard Castle the scripts give him wide latitude in exploring all facets of that personality. Stana Katic's Kate Beckett (my god, she's gorgeous) over the four seasons and into the fifth has matched facet for facet those of Castle. Beckett is yin to Castle's yang - and may well be the strongest series character leads going.The support players have strength and depth in their own rights and all meld well creating a solid tapestry to provide enjoyable episode after episode. So, what's not to love? Maybe that they only do 22 or 23 episodes per season?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Castle, The Complete Fourth Season","review":"I found this fourth season of Castle very entertaining, and look forward to more of Castle episodes.

In this episode, Castle has pretty much decided this latest case will be his last. So...he wants to go out with the coolest case ever...and the city of New York complies in classic fashion. A professional is attacked and partially eaten in a parking garage by a.....zombie! The only witness was also bitten and thinks he is going to become a zombie as well. What more could you ask for, lol. Castle has that wide eyed child like look on his face when the suspected zombie is revealed, which is awesome. Coolest case ever? Maybe.

Every episode is worth viewing over and over so as to learn more about each character. The interplay between characters becomes much clearer when you view all the eposides from the beginning.

I look forward to the new season to see how the writers handle Beckett's leaving the force and the reaction of Alexis and Martha to what developed over one night.

This item did not succeed for us. As others have mentioned, the diameter was too small for our two standard shower drains (the 5\\" measurement listed is the outside edges, not the size of drain it covers), so the suction areas overlap the drain edge and won't hold. This leaves the cover to slip around from a nudge of the foot or a direct hit from the shower flow. When it actually stays in place for a few minutes it will catch some hair, but not enough--we still got a clogged drain from the hair that slipped past. The positives I can mention are the fact that you get two covers in the pack and the covers are soft and squishy, so they do not get broken or hurt your foot if you accidently step on them. But we are still on the hunt for a good drain cover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not suitable for a shower","review":"I have recently bought this item thru Amazon.I have installed it in a shower to catch hair which blocks the drain.The item is unfortunately not very robust and the suction cups do not hold it very firmly in position with the effect that it is easily disturbed and then moves away from the drain outlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Haircatcher does not catch hair","review":"I bought this haircatcher as Bed, Bath and Beyond no longer sold our beloved previous haircatcher. This one doesn't work and allows most of the hair to pass through. The hair actually slips under the suction cups and the suction cups catch probably about 10% of the hair.

I have been using it for about a week, and it is catching about a 10% of the hair that other drain protectors I've used in the past have collected. When I first got the product, I suspected that the huge slits that are all over the top of it would be a problem, but interestingly, most of the hair isn't even passing over the top of the product; instead it is simply sliding underneath the product, around the suction cups, and right into the drain. I think this would be better suited for those looking to catch chunks and particles rather than hair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't stop hair; mildew grows quickly.","review":"This product didn't work for my needs.

I kept one for my shower stall and gave one to my daughter for hers. We both have found this product works really well. I place it over the drain when washing my hair and afterwards lift it up, carry it over by the trash can, remove the hair and put it in the trash. This handy device is easy to clean at the same time the shower is scrubbed, with the same cleaning agents.Unfortunately, though, it's a little big for the shower that is part of a tub in our second bathroom. I had to get a different type ofdrain protectorfor that. This type is best for a shower stall.Before I realized that about tubs, I got one of these for a friend's somewhat large pop-up drain in her garden-style tub which is a bigger popup than ours.

Also the texture of the tub seems to reduce the effectiveness of the suction cups. But most of the time I can get all but one to attach.

The manufacturers of this CD were sued by the Beatles, because the cover might lead one to think it is a Beatles album. So, what is this album really?

It featured Beatles tunes barked by dogs, with other animals chiming in from time to time. Of course, it was fake, with synthesized animals sounds doing the actually \\"singing\\". Good for a few laughs, though. Anyway, in the mid-1990s someone reissued the album with a deceptive cover, promptly got sued, and the CD was withdrawn. Here is the track listing:1.

I like this one over Kanji de Manga for two main reasons, 1 being that you get a lot more Kanji for the price, and 2 being that when they show you how to put two kanji together to form a word or phrase, it only uses Kanji and characters that you would have already learned, assuming you start from the first kanji in the book and go from there.I don't necessarily like it for learning Kana, since as far as I could see, the book doesn't cover Dakuten and Handakuten, which is pretty important. For learning Kana I would strongly recommend buying Kana de Manga, though it may feel patronizing if you're older than 8, it's a great book for learning the nuances of the Japanese phonetic writing characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away From Kenneth Cole Shoes","review":"Don't buy Kenneth Cole shoes!

Being a fan of science fiction, fantasy, anything but realistic fiction, I found this book to be horrible. HORRIBLE!! The writing style was very annoying and the events seemed to be jumbled up. AND IT READ SO SLOWLY!! How can a 310 book seem so long!? Basically, it's about a 14 year old girl who is betrothed to some guy that had gone off on the crusades and their wonderfully exciting pilgrimage to Santiago. There was no action at all! The only exciting part was when I finally finished it and began The Light Fantastic (Terry Pratchett, it's a lot better than this! Read it!!). The book dragged on and on and on and wouln't end!!!

They weren't really looking forward to anything nor did they have to stop anywhere to do anything on their pilgrimage.This book lacked action and suspence.I would never recommend The Ramsay Scallop to any any readers especially young readers because after they read a chapter or so they will not want to read it they will want to lock it up in a closet.

It's not obvious from the pictures or the reviews just how short it is.The chain is too short to first load the belt, then put the belt on. Putting the belt on first and then loading lots of small plates is awkward. The plates are too small to rest on the ground (the short chain strikes again) so you kind of have to juggle them while you load them. Aggravating. Also, put a 25lb plate on and it might hit your groin.There are U-shaped connectors that attach the chain to the belt on one side and the chain to a clip on the other side. The U-shaped connector is of such a size and shape that it and the clip get locked together at a weird angle and it takes a bit of wrestling to unfreeze them.The quality of the rest of the belt is great though. If they would fix the chain length and the design of the U-shaped connectors, this belt could be a winner.

Gedge's words typically weave a fine tapestry upon which her work is set. Her characters are rich and complex. The reader feels transported into the world she has created and never wants to leave. I have had this experience so often with Ms. Gedge's work, to her credit, that I have grown to expect the pleasure each time I open one of her novels. Unfortunately, this is just not the case here. Stargate does not stack up to Child of the Morning or the Twelfth Transforming at all. It is in fact a disapointment. The book is wordy, difficult to read and not at all engaging. I am hopeful Ms. Gedge will stay with Ancient Egypt. She excels so in that time period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"An interesting twist on the doctrine of Original Sin.

It is written in very simplistic form, with little character development and an implausible story - there's no explaining why some of the characters are basically gods and others just rabble or why the gates between the worlds are there.Worst of all there's no delicious detail like the Twelfth Transforming - in fact Stargate appears to have been written by a totally different author.My advice is that if you like her Egypt books, don't get this one.

Unfortunately, that's about all it had. After a great beginning, the plot meanders (the characters run around endlessly in the author's world with no aim other than trying not to die), and generally make themselves less and less sympathetic with each passing page. The internal logic of this world is incoherent and inconsistent (magic is gone from the land, yet magical things happen all the time), and things happen apparently to serve the author's whim. When the climax finally came, it was as if the author had finally hit his target word count or gotten tired of writing and pulled out the granddaddy of all deus ex machinas (none of the characters actuallY DO anything; they just get their butts saved by some nameless, faceless magic that's been waiting to return to the land).This one's a real yawner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dusk made me sleepy...","review":"DUSK is usually the kind of book I would love.

He is not clear on descriptions at all, making it hard for a reader to envision what the world and its environs look like.Characters were one-dimensional, for the most part. Not as riveting and well worked as some writers can do.But this world-building scenario, along with its concepts, was intriguing.

Focussing at some length on both Heidegger and Benjamin - two thinkers whose political views could not be more opposed - Osborne attempts to show that the connection between individual temporality and historical intersubjectivity in the former is potentially as politically productive as the exploration of aesthetic, redemptive temporality in the latter. This is of course a massive project, and as such Osborne's necessarily dense prose can become overwhelming. What does come through quite clearly howewver is the author's commitment to highlighting the political and eventually practical implications of some of the most influential twentieth century thinkers, at a time when 'theory' itself can appear as so much literary play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for traveler's Turkish","review":"Please take my advice and get the Lonely Planet or other language guide for Turkish.

Having said that I picked it up last year having read a favourable review somewhere which tweaked my curiosity. Every track is unique and memorable, the thing that gets me is the maturity and lyricism of the music, sure Malcolm's lyrics are fantastically dour and deeply self-deprecating, clever and moving but the layers of compexity, the suprises at every turn and the breathtaking beauty that underpins the album never wear thin or outstay their welcome. It's a great drinking, sing-along, heartfelt beast of a thing and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone who has a heart, a wry sense of humour and an adventurous musical ear.

My only complaint is that in an effort to make the machine super-safe they've made it more awkward to use. An old model I had had a feed tube with a \\"pusher\\" that could be removed, making it quick and easy to add more vegetables, crackers, etc. The new model has the \\"pusher\\" permanently fixed to the feed tube, making it necessary to remove the entire cover in order to add more food. Does the company really think we're so careless that we can't be trusted with the removable pusher? The new version is slower and more awkward to use, and I wish they'd go back to the old system.

If you saw FIFTH ELEMENT I imaged that Shatner's Jake Cardigan was a futuristic scruffy, PI more like Bruce Willis than Stacey Keach. When the TV series started starring Greg Evigan I thought Evigan did a fine job.Shatner and friends have done a great job creating this futuristic world where Tek theatens to do real harm to humanity. Cardigan, after spending years in a deep freeze coma prison is released and goes to work for a detective agency.

If Shatner was trying to resurrect the pure testosterone appeal of his lost youth, well, I'm not biting - he should have read Burrough's Martian Tales to see how pure testosterone is done. If he was going for torture and internal conflict, he could not have failed more miserably. If that's what you're looking for, forget Shatner. Try Feintuch's Hope series.

The soft part of the cushion is mounted on a rigid piece of plastic which hurts the tailbone of the occupant when seated. Despite the rigid mounting, the cushion is not well supported when placed on the bucket seat of an automobile, and rotating is difficult. We tried raising the height of the cushion by placing another seat cushion beneath it, and this caused both cushions to slide toward the console, and rotation was impossible. We plan to return the cushion to its source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very uncomfortable","review":"The swivel cushion is a good idea, but it is so uncomfortable to sit on. The seat is hard. It would seem that it could have a soft seat & yet swivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I got the grey one","review":"I didn't think my requirements were that strenuous: I wanted to use it to sit on the floor and swivel. It just doesn't work. The foam is really cheap and the plastic frame deforms (I weigh ~150 lbs). I think to be a serious product, it should use some sort of ball bearings around the perimeter, instead of cheap plastic on plastic sliding action. There's too much friction. Well, I can't imagine that some people are trying to use this on top of their car seat, I just can't see how that could work.I'm glad I bought the grey version since it was ten dollars less; I would have been even more disappointed if I paid 25 bucks for this! I just donated it to Salvation Army since it was not worth the hassle or the shipping cost to anyone to return it (even though I'm sure Amazon would have paid it). I suppose though if you can't find anything else anywhere, you could put some oil on the sliders and hope for the best.

It didn't help at all. The seats in a 2003 Buick LeSabre are too soft so the swivel seat sinks into the car seat too much and it then can't swivel at all. I tried using a silky pillow case on the car seat and that worked much better.I can't say for sure as I have not tested any other surfaces, but I think the swivel seat would likely work okay on a flat surface (e.g.: hard wood chair, metal bench)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiel seat cushion","review":"I bought these as presents so I cannot really rate them at this time.

The height of the cushion adds to the difficulty of climbing into the car. Almost impossible to SLIDE onto the car seat and on top of the swivel seat and be in the right position to swivel.

Then if you sit on them for any length of time whilstdriving it was causing me to have a foot cramp on my left leg. Removing the cushion solved the problem. The only advantage in the car I could perceive is that you sit higher, but when you get out you hit your head on the door jam. That should have knockedsome sense into me, but it didn't.. They work good on regular bar stools where you have a flat surface. I guess I could use themfor frizbees or something.

It only will work on older cars that have the bench seat or a station wagon type with seat across. I tried it in my Ford Taurus and 2 family members cars and it doesnt work at all. Most cars have seats that the back of the seat tilts downward and so the cushion doesnt swivel at all. Most cars dont have a flat seat they have contoured and/or sides that cushion outwards for comfort. That makes for an uneven fit and no swivel action.

First off, this toy is great for the FIRST year. But its durability just SUCKS after that. Also, if you've already bought it, and you're having trouble with putting it together, here are a few tips:1. When attatching the safety foam, you need to poke holes YOURSELF!2. There is a difference between the attachment poles!3. When pulling the tarp over, it is 100x easier if you use the tools given.Please think before you buy this: How long do you want to keep using this product?

The trampoline was fine and remained outdoors the entire time until the leg welds broke off. My girl is 8 years old and my boy is 6, so the trampoline was not severely abused or heavily used. We were happy with it until the day it broke. I was with the kids when the legs collapsed and I sadly had to tell them the trampoline was done.

About the only thing going for this episode is the interesting image of a red double-decker bus in the desert and a fairly cool alien monster. Our family actually found the behind the scenes documentary of how they got the bus into the Dubai desert more exciting than the episode itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes he is! Frequently!","review":"I love it! The tenth Doctor at his best, with a mix of some old time classic sci-fi. Brilliant! Can't wait for the next special!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A splendid Easter treat for Doctor Who fans","review":"In this, the first of David Tennant's remaining specials--or the beginning of season 4.5, as some like to call it--the Doctor is not within the TARDIS, but rather aboard a bus with a crew of characters we'll come to know a bit better as this episode progresses. Also aboard this bus is a thief that the police are pursuing, Lady Christina de Souza. As they drive through a tunnel, a wormhole opens, and the bus and passengers are whisked away to an alien world much like a desert.There are many good, solid performances in this episode, and many funny moments (most courtesy of Doctor Malcolm with UNIT, who I do hope returns in a future episode). If you are a fan of Doctor Who and David Tennant, this will not disappoint. The only disappointment is having to wait so many months for the next special to air!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can David go wrong.","review":"David T. does it again with his good looks and charm as Dr. Who. This is a wonderful little set. Michele is fantastic as his side kick. Watching her grow up as Zoe on Eastenders and then on Bionic Woman, it is only fitting she gets to be with the Dr. We are going to miss you David when you retire to the Theatre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decidedly mediocre","review":"I'm a big fan of the new Doctor Who series. This episode was not one of the best; in fact it was decidedly mediocre.

There is no compelling reason to buy this as a stand alone item. It has been shown pretty much everywhere the BBC reaches.A agree with the lack of originality mentioned by other reviewers. Plus, contrary to the comment about the picture quality is was unimpressed. Michelle Ryan is a goodish actress, but the part was over the top. It almost seemed like a stereotype & parody of itself. The anti-Bruce Wayne (i.e. thief with a ton of money).Save your $13.99 & get the whole set next Spring. That way, hopefully, you'll have at least something good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull rehash of prior episodes","review":"This was a very disappointing episode for sure. It was pretty much a rehash of several previous stories (the Doctor on the shuttle without Donna last year, and several others come to mind). The characters were not developed well and it was a very mediocre episode. I hope the final two of Tennant's specials will be better than this one. Tennant needs to go out with a bang, not a whimper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible episode.","review":"Given that the BBC is only producing a handful of episodes of Doctor Who this year, you'd think each one would be crafted with care and skill. Alas, that is not the case. The plot of this \\"special\\" is nonsensical bordering on nonexistent. Some people on a bus (including the Doctor, of course) end up on an alien planet thanks to some flying manta rays that are zipping around in swarms really, really quickly. Or something. Oh, and there's an international super-thief on the bus, too. As there often are. And an old psychic lady for good measure. This whole people-trapped-on-a-bus-bond-and-bicker scenario was done better last season of Doctor Who in an episode called \\"Midnight.\\" In fact, the Doctor actually makes a joke to that effect in this episode. Calling out that you're plagiarizing your own stories doesn't make it okay.... Don't waste your money on this DVD. Hopefully next year's \\"reboot\\" of Doctor Who with new writers and a new showrunner will step up the quality of the program."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!","review":"One greatest Sci fi programs of all time! I don't see what the big deal is with everyone and the price of the DVD!! Most of the original Who shows with tom baker and john pertwee will run at least $20 or more for one DVD..

This one does not come anywhere near the quality of the Gold. It is closer to the pricier balsamics from Trader Joe's (which are around $5 instead of $20) than to a nice balsamic. The Silver is fairly sour, the sweetness barely comes through. As for viscosity, it's very thin - if you're looking for the more syrupy kind of balsamic, this is not it.Given the small increase in price, it is completely worth it to go ahead and buy the Gold and not waste your time and money trying the Silver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elliott IS AWESOME","review":"This IS the Elliott that all of us came to love on AI!!!

Although I was for Taylor Hicks all season long, his cut is not the best of this collection. That goes to Elliot Yamin's \\"Moodys' Mood for Love.\\" It is such a smooth rendition. Paris Bennett also shines with her version of \\"Midnight Train to Georgia.\\" Hearing this collection may cause many to wonder if Idol turns out as it should. At any rate, it's a toe tapping, feel good musical adventure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOUL PATROL!","review":"I was going to purchase the CD through Amazon but after the unprofessional review that was obviously mean-spirited and biased against Taylor Hicks AND his fans, I have decided the following: I will still buy the CD but will buy it through Amazon's biggest competitor.

You lose!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD, Disappointed on Amazon","review":"First the review \`controversy\\" Ridiculous. People grow up. It is just an opinion, right or wrong like your own. That's all. I'm disappointed that Amazon did not support its employee and actually removed the review from the site. And for all of you threatening to boycott Amazon, really get a life.This was by far the worst AI season. No contestants stuck up. Nobody had anything new or different to offer. People were stunned that Chris Daultry was let go before the finals. Well, if you think about it, the guy is light years behind from the Bo Bice of last year.As for the rest of the final twelve; mediocrity was the pattern. And this CD release painfully reflects that mediocrity.Let's wait for the next season and hope for the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"AI5 = Amazing Group of Idols!","review":"This year's American Idol produced some great talent.

However, halfway through the first verse of Father Figure, which is one of my favorite songs,I literally ran at top speed to find the original lest I go crazy. Ace Young's version was awful-especially the background vocals- and on top of that, he forgot some of the words!I wonder why none of the judges ever pointed that out when they were performing. After that, I couldn't listen to this. YUK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"one shining star","review":"as a fan of american idol....i was delighted with the album.however, only Elliott Yamin's rendition of james moody's \\"moody's mood for love\\" was an outright STANDOUT.looking forward to hearing more from this young talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ever","review":"I have gotten all the other Idols CD's, this one by far is the best.

Its funny that people say stuff like that just becuase they like a different gene of music.

I absolutely hate the version that was given him of this song, but I absolutely love the voice that goes with it. The man can sing...apparently no matter what song he's given. I think he needs a few lessons on vibrato and the like but the guy just has such a tremendous voice that overwhelms the rest of the \\"Idols\\". The CD is worth buying just to hear his song; although not a pop song, a very worthy easy listening song. I salute you, Elliott. You \\"done good\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"band & editorial review stink","review":"band is not the best, but as one reviewer stated it is a great reminder of the show. The editorial \\"review\\" is stupid and unfair to someone who watched the show and wants to enjoy the \\"Idols\\" music. Most of them won't ever go on to be Barbara Streisand, Elvis, etc... but cut them some slack. I'm quite sure they would have recorded different songs if it had been up to them AND had better people backing them up.

But I wanted to understand all the brouhaha garnered by these idols, so I decided to hear and judge for myself. What a mediocre recording...horror of horrors! I thought I was in disco night at the local bar. The only recording I found redeeming was Dead or Alive by Chris Daughtry. I loved this guy's voice. The rest were completely forgettable. So would I buy a CD for just one song?? NO. I'll wait till Chris Daughtry sign with a reputable recording label, hopefully with all that makes rock special and not a load of crappy, cheesy pop. I can only think that America made him a favor when they voted him off, saving him from this type of abysmal music, and thus failure. I think I'll pass on this one.I was intrigued also by Mandisa, but since I can't stand to hear \\"I'm Every Woman\\" once again, I couldn't validate her voice.

Chris is great, but I hate his song on here. \\"Memories of us\\" would have been a much better choice for this CD. He sung that song exceptionally well on the show.All of that is secondary however.

And, Elliot - can't really sing along to this one. This one is just for the joy of listening.

He also writes about birding. All the stuff about Koeppel's father is maudlin drudgery. A lot of the birding stuff is enjoyable and interesting.It's not that Koeppel is a bad writer--he's not--but the topic was just too hard for him to write about without engaging in dismal reflection. He works hard to explain his father's avian mania. It's tough for us, however, to care about Richard Koeppel's psychology nearly as much as Dan does...because he's not our dad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"So much for the bargain pricing.

Instead, Beland has created a gentle and romantic little work, chartering the development of his relationship with a Puerto Rican radio DJ he met at a bustop in Disneyland.The artwork is light and likable and Beland is funny, warm, uncontainably romantic and eager to examine his own faults.

The drumming is also lighter--is the drummer using brushes?-than in the vast majority of free jazz.The written lines stick in the ear, based on chord changes that remind of Dolphy.

I wanted a book that would teach me step by step on how to edit with Premiere Pro. Never having any knowledge on how to use Premiere Pro, this was what I needed to start editing Wedding Videos.The book covers everything, from basics to more advance tutorials. The great thing about this book is that it comes with a DVD with all that you need to get you started. It comes with free trial versions of Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, Encore DVD, Photoshop etc... The down side is that the Trial Versions only last 30 Days after instaling on your PC. So that means you have only 30 days to Complete your Tutorials. It's a thick book, but it's 100% comprehensive. Great for Begginers..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Content good, but...","review":"Clearly this is a well orchestrated presentation to learning Premiere Pro. Nice also because it covers more than the video application, with excerpts from Audition, Photoshop, After Effects. However, I was disappointed it did not cover importing stills adequately. Exporting stills from Premiere is covered well. But in a book of this scope it should certainly be comprehensive - something I cannot claim it is.

Its SO easy to read, not preachy, practical & amusing. Reading it, you feel like you know Chad Foster personally. I in my mid 40's (much belatedly) started incorporating his ideas about starting up conversations with strangers. I have a friend who teaches HS who actually did read this book to her class on Life Skills, which is how I heard about it. I even recommended it to 2 people on our local school board, unfortunately to no avail, but I will not give up.

Having not heard the originals from which these songs are based, the only real critsism I can give is that of a fan of this sort of music--and in that case, this is a dissapointment. The first song is pretty good, a wash of synths and beats, but after that every song sounds very similar...too similar...as if they recycled the synths for every song. I can't conclude without a few examples of mixes where this sort of music is pulled off with glorious effect: check out Sasha and Digweed's _Northern Exposure_ and _Northern Exposure: East Coast_ albums for trance and pH blended to the utmost degree, or some Renaissance Worldwide imports (pricy but worth it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangerine Dream - 'The Dream Mixes' (Miramar)","review":"Basically,ten tracks that are remixes of songs that Tangerine Dream has on their 'Rockoon'('92) and 'Tyranny Of Beauty'('95)efforts.Reason I'm giving this CD a four-star rating is because I thought it was just SO well put together.Cuts I liked best were the dream-like \\"Little Blond\\",\\"Virtually Fields\\",the somewhat hypnotic \\"San Rocco\\" and \\"Changes Of The Gods\\".Top rate '90's techno-meets new age.Not a bad pick."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Workout tunes","review":"I've always compiled my own workout music.

I called Sea Coral and was told to send it back. They would have to receive the broken unit before they could ship a new one.

It has a single brush that turns like a vacuum sweeper which seems to smear the water instead of picking it up - the Spinbrush has several that turn horizontally. You can't remove the brush to clean it so for those of us with dogs the hair gets trapped between the brush and the top and I have to stick my fingers up inside it to get the old nasty hair out.

Now,to be realistic, you can't expect it to do jobs that require elbow grease, like caked on dirt, but it sure makes daily cleanup and maintenance a breeze! What I love is the fact that you don't need to drag out the vaccuum cleaner, mop and bucket, do the labor and then wait for the floor to dry or drag a bathtowel accross the floor. It is incredibly easy to fill the unit, take it apart and clean it, and put it away. Also, the older model is very reasonably priced, and I don't think the newer model is worth the extra money for the features.

Plus you have to go sooooo sloooowwwww. And it is loud. This machine loses suction at the slightest quick movement and you have to turn it off and back on again. Also, the water it does pick up is dirty so you have to handle it with your hands to dump it out. I have a 2 year old and infant - I don't have time for this ridiculous contraption. Try a steam mop instead, like the Reliable Steamboy.

I for one was able to prove that a dress I bought worn by Jayne Mansfield was the real mccoy by Faris's research. The book is a great tool for your collecting on Jayne Mansfield and a must if you are a Jayne fan. It is well worth every cent you pay for the book. Enjoy, you will not be disappointed. However, if you are looking for a 100 page picture book of Jayne, then you will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"good product","review":"Nice convenient product for tying out your dog.

I personally produced a slew of extras which include a photo featurette, New York auditions and a trailer, plus my directors commentary.

I had wished there were more reviews or even a plot summary posted by Amazon.com, but I thought, \\"What the heck, sounds like a movie I'd enjoy.\\" Well...it wasn't what I thought it'd be at all. Maybe I was expecting too much or just expecting a different type of movie, but I hated watching it. The acting is a little off, the characters aren't likable, and the main character's friend, another horney teen that likes to steal magazines, seems like he'd be happier chasing guys. I didn't live in the 70's or early 80's but if these kids were how teens acted back then, I'm glad I grew up in the \\"far more complicated\\" time.

I'm horribly disappointed with this machine and caution others against it.Additionally, the exhaust kit doesn't fit my standard window opening and the exhaust tubing gets super hot.

And, set up was a breeze. My only complaint is that the unit can be noisy- it makes quite a bit of noise when the cooling system kicks on and off; so much so, actually, that after two minths it still wakes me up if I am not in a deep sleep.

Although the focus is on the largest groups: Chinese, Japanese, and Filipinos, he also examines the arrival of Koreans, East Indians, Vietnamese, Laotions, and Cambodians.Many of the stories and incidents related are deeply moving.

In the dedication she thanks her \\"patient, proofreader husband\\". I laughed out loud. I have never seen more typos in any published work, nor any language guide with so many ridiculous translations that are NEVER used. One, two, even a few would be acceptable, but this is out of control. This book will get you bewildered glances from French speakers from Quebec, to Port Au Prince to Paris. Stay away.

Its coverage of dead factories, rail-yards, harbors, and aircraft boneyards is a disappointment. Manfred Hamm's inconsistent mixture of black & white and color photographs give the book a disjointed feeling. The quality of the photographs themselves is inconsistent. A few rise to the level art exhibited by Stanley Greenberg (Invisible New York) and Christopher Payne (New York's Forgotten Substations), while most are no better than I (a decidedly amateur photographer) might have done in a hurry with my trusty Pentax K1000 and a roll of T-Max 100 or Ektachrome 64. The accompanying text by Rolf Steinberg is noisome -- perhaps a victim of a less-than-artful translation into English. I haven't yet decided whether I will hold on to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Pictures; Overly Emotional, Whiny Text","review":"I just got this book today. I flipped through it and was not at all impressed with the photography. Any amateur could take those shots. Then I started to read it. The first section of text, \\"The Ruins Complex\\" by Robert Jungk is terrible. As a scientist I was unspeakably annoyed at his melodramatic, disparaging attitude towards R&D and his overall theme that all technology is facing imminent breakdown resulting in possible inconvenience but more likely disaster. Throw this book on your coffee table if you want visitors to think you have poor tastes. On top of it all, the book seems to be poorly bound.

What Sarah does is miraculous. Some of the songs are a bit weak, but, she makes them better and the great songs, she absolutely soars. Her phrasing and incredible range (some say 3 octaves, but, it sounds more like 5)make this album worth every penny. Dreamsville, Slow Hot Wind, Mr. Lucky are, for me, the highlights.

However, when I received the harnesses they fit terribly: they were HUGE and my dogs could practically step out of them. Their website says that there are size adjustments, but this is not true: there is only a very small adjustment (~1.5 inches) across the front of the chest, which did not help me at all. How can it be safe to have a dog in a harness this loose? When I contacted the company, they apologized and recommended I buy the much more expensive roadie!

I don't really agree that this is a \\"listing\\" of all the rock musicians from 1951-2000: once I took the time to actually read it in chronological order, Scaruffi's bold, seemingly unsupported assertions about Elvis, The Beatles and others made much more sense, and I had the feeling that I really understood how rock music has evolved over the years. It can be so hard to look for all this information in other sources, and this book really layed everything out clearly.But a warning: this is no coffee-table book - the information is presented in a no-frills, sterile way that compares to a textbook. Threre are books out there that are much more fun to read, but if you're serious about really knowing rock music, all its sub-genres and other musical styles that influenced it, this book is gold.

He forgets that true art (wheter it is popular, folk, or \\"aristocratic\\") must appeal to a great range of people, not only a few weird critics. Just from the begining he falls in the \\"format mistake\\". He says that 3 minutes format is just commercial and with no value, and in the other hand, 21 minutes vanguardist suites are a more valid art, which is absolutely false.

I thought there would be dividers for the Barbies to stand up from the pictures, but there are not. The compartments on top are not very deep and larger accessories that we have (snow boarder helmet for example) will not fit.

I have loved Bill Cunningham since high school, when I discovered his photos in an old issue of the Times that was lying around my parents' kitchen. I will continue to love Bill Cunningham especially after seeing this documentary. I can't quite eloquently put into words the respect I have for him. He is a legend and an artist. This little snippet of his life is edited perfectly. It's charming and funny, yet, at moments, sad and melancholic. You must watch it curled up in a blanket with some popcorn and a glass of champagne. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Fashion Perspective","review":"I loved this DVD because it gave me the perspective from a photographer that owes nothing to anyone, doesn't perform his job from someone else's perspective but from his own.

True, it lacks the character sketches and early work present in most Japanese-release artbooks, but the selections are excellent for the series and Takahashi Rumiko's comments are interesting for the heavy Ranma 1/2 fan (or even fans of her other works, such as Inu-Yasha or the Mermaid Saga).The simple nature of Takahashi's art doesn't make it any less enjoyable. It's whimsical and charming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Very Pleased","review":"The reviews on amazon.com made me nervous about buying the vax x5, but don't take these reviews too seriously. The issues people complain about are petty, the vacuum handled a months worth of dog air from a Lab and a Dalmatian with no problem and made the carpet look almost as clean as the day it was installed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars was because I don't know if it'll lose suction or not, but I will re-review in about 6 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaper for a reason","review":"I also bought this as a cheaper version of the Dyson. The suction for the main vacuum is ok, unless I'm using it on a hard floor, but the hose and attachments are horrible. They do nothing. The hose will not pick up anything much less the attachments. So, yes, it's cheaper than a Dyson but it's not worth what you pay for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Vacuum Ever!","review":"I purchased this vacuum 2 years ago and I've regretted my decision ever since. Unfortunately, I cannot justify getting a new one because of my bad decision. Here's the problems I have with this vacuum:Suction: Either it has too much so it sucks hard to any floor surface making the vacuum almost impossible to move (after the dirt cup and filter have been cleaned) or hardly any suction at all. Also, the hose has No suction so using it is a waste of time.Edge Cleaning: The edge cleaner doesn't work at all. It won't even pick up lint or a feather from near a wall.Hight Adjustment: It has none so going from bare floor to a carpeted surface is a joke. You have to literally lift the whole thing up to make the transition.I would not tell anyone to waste their money on this piece of junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This vacuum sucks, and not in a good way.","review":"After years of buying disposable vacuums, we thought perhaps spending an extra hundred or two would provide improved performance. It does not. The Vax X5 is cute and that's where the accolades end. The filter clogs after each room in my house and loses suction. Twice I have had to go head first into the dumpster to retrieve the bottom of the dirt cup because it is flimsy and came shooting off after I pushed the release button. The wheels scratch my hardwood floors. The mini brush attachment is super flimsy, does not have any sort of position lock, and the brush doesn't turn with even the slightest resistance. We also had a problem with trying to find an authorized service provider. The shop listed in our zip code had never even heard of a Vax. DO NOT BUY THIS VACUUM."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird but washed out","review":"Be warned that the colors in this dvd are exceptionally bright and washed out.

Posing as a would be immigrant he infiltrates the ring and along the way runs into Hedy Lamarr who is also seeking illegal entry. The first two thirds of the film are shot in Havana and show lots of local scenery and music. The chemistry is pretty good between Lamarr and Hodiak who you may remember best for his leading role in \\"The Harvey Girls\\" with Judy Garland. There are some good slimy villans and a fair amount of tension as the film winds up in the mist shrouded Florida everglades. If you are a Lamarr fan you will want this one as it is one of her late leading roles. Not a great film but good in a sort of \\"noir\\" way, but the characters here are a little more clearly defined as good and evil. Hodiak is the only one who has to face some inner conflict as the immigration agent in love with an illegal."},{"rating":"2","title":"not bad","review":"very good running shoe, I would recommend to any average to hardcore running enthusiast with low arches.The only issue I hard with the shoe was due to my part and not noticing the regular width of the shoe.

If you are a student like me who cannot shell out truck loads of money at one go....go for this.....and on the other hand, If you are a professional guitar player...there are better guitars out there...I see plenty of people crib about tiny imperfections when it comes to entry level guitars...do not buy this and expect it to perform like a gibson LP studio....Having said that, this is THE BEST beginner's guitar pack out there in the market...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guitar...Amp SUCKS!","review":"I have had this guitar for a few years now, and it still plays and sounds great. I had gotten away from playing for awhile and wanted to get back into it so i picked up this kit. The Guitar is wonderful. It sounds great, plays great, and feels great. However the amp is falling apart. For the money the deal was good, but if you can afford a better amp, do it! I just upgraded to VOX Valvetronix and couldn't be happier.

Now, I am living and working overseas, so normally when I order things from the states, it could take up to a month to receive. To my surprise, the whole kit came within 10 days, which is totally awesome. There was one problem, however, and I do not blame the company one bit. The box had to go through customs and as usual, they made a meal out of the box and scratched up the guitar in certain spots. They look like they can be buffed out, but still, I was a little disappointed by it. So, heed this warning, if you live overseas, have a military address outside the U.S., be wary of what you might receive as to what you expect.

I believe the consumer should not have to read the insert to get clarity and understanding of the words. James is good, but I think he should listen to Richard Smallwood and Thomas Whitfield when it comes to clarity.

James Hall & WAP have surpassed the unsurpassable. This album is as outstanding as it is eclectic, using so many styles to glorify God. There's gotta be something in there for everyone. James isn't known all that well over here (I'm doing all I can to rectify that!), and those who do know, adore everything he does, but if you haven't heard, you are seriously missing some blessings. My favourite songs are Jesus Lives, Hold To God's Unchanging Hand, I've Got To Praise Him.I've got all the JH&WAP albums and I eagerly anticipate 'Messiah' (due out 1 Jan 2000 for those of you who didn't know).

The author seems to have a bias towards Andrew Jackson but he tells a good tale. He gives a thorough account of Jackson's history of the indians from the early years to adulthood. Though Jackson was a racist, it is easy for us today to judge with the perspective of today's views verses what people felt like back in Jackson's period when people were living on the border region and were constantly at war with the indians. The reason why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because the author stated that General Jackson saved the indians with their removal.

Fans of Chick Corea's ARC trio or Circle group would be well advised to pick this up. Bracing, venturing deeply into dissonance at times, but also surprisingly pretty and lyrical, \\"Bold Conceptions\\" is the battle-cry of a young warrior in the company of musicians who understand where he wants to take things. The version here of \\"Nardis\\" -- perhaps the most haunting jazz melody every composed, written but never recorded by Miles Davis -- is at least a decade ahead of its time, as James reaches into the piano to pluck chords, taking the melody as far out as it can go. A stunning record. Only a couple of the bonus tracks -- \\"Ghost Riders in the Sky\\"? -- are less than inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen King","review":"Being retired, I have taken up cooking as a hobby. This skillet is verything the company said it would be. It is excellent when frying meats especially chicken, has even heat and crisp the chicken (or other meats)without burn spots.

I am so impressed with this skillet, have ordered a 10 inch same material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice none stick","review":"Works very well for eggs, fish. The none stick surface does not come off over time but it can be easily scratched. Need delicate care so don't use it for everything. We dedicated it for only like egg and fish cooking. Life time warranty allowed us to get a new one after 3 years usage because it got too many scratches over the years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money...","review":"I bought this 13\\" skillet about 2 and a half months ago and am very disappointed to find that there are nicks and chips in the inside surface of the pan. I never used any metal implements sharper than a table fork and didnt scrape hard with that, mostly only used a plastic spatula on it. Cleaned only with a Scotch-Brite pad as recommended by the manufacturer.Pan still works fine but I have stopped using it because of the damage to the cooking surface since I don't want to eat the advanced polymer. Plan to send it back to Calphalon with a letter of complaint.I thought these pans were my dream come true, a semi-nonstick pan that would stand up to everyday use without damage-- but it's really not much better than a cheap teflon nonstick counterpart. Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fast!","review":"I really disliked this program. They were speaking so quickly and never stopped to enunciate. There was a good deal of material where you listen to conversations and they don't say what was said (just an idea about what they're saying). They were spitting out phrases, twice on average, at a very fast speaking speed and I couldn't even get 2 of the words much less the 4-6 they were throwing at me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Times and Seasons","review":"This book was awesome. It is the third book in a series. I was never a reader until I read the first book of this series and then I read the second I would look on the shelf for the third book every time I went into the book store. Even though this book is classified as fiction, Cedar Circle in Breezwood really exists in my life. I enjoy forgetting life and sinking into the lives of these four families. I feel like the authors keep the lives very realistic and they apply the word or God to the situations in a way that ministers to you. I never looked at the story about the Prodigal son the way the book did it. I learned something about God and him being my father. I can't wait until the 4th book is released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a really good bronzer.. It blends in well & glides on smooth. It reminds me of NYC's sunny bronzer. I'll use this on top of my Chanel Soleil Bronzer sometimes and it'll stay on all day. It doesn't make my skin look orange or anything, just a sun kiss look. I'm a medium with a beige undertone skin & I absolutely love this. For me, shipping took a little while and the only thing I was kinda annoyed about, was the fact that there were no tracking on this so it made me nervous... However, I received it on the very last day as its \\"promise shipping date,\\" which took almost two weeks..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best bronzer","review":"I have been using this product for at least 4 years. It is a great color if you want something in between pink and bronze. I either use it as blush or as overall bronzer and both are effective. I especially use it as blush when I have a healthy glow in the summer months. This product is easy to apply and goes on smoothly. There is no caking effect as there is with some other powder products. My only small complaint is that this product breaks easily when dropped, although I'm not sure that is specific to this product alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Bronzer.","review":"Just so you know, I cannot live without this bronzer!

The Sony Ericsson engineers should have known better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Particularly useful for phones in custom cases","review":"I have SonyEricsson W800i with a custom silicone soft skin case (brand Pivot). The case added enough thickness to the phone so that it would not fit in the car holder (HCH-61) designed for the W800i. I needed a different solution.This universal holder HCH-60 is flexible enough in which my phone with the case fits. The arms you see is actually a single spring-loaded piece that rotates at the middle and clips onto the side of the phone (e.g. top-left and bottom-right, or vice-versa). Ends of the arms are rubberized and holds the phone well. It does not hold the phone from the top, but with the arms activated (clipping from the sides) the phone stays in place firmly without issues. The HCH-60 holder also does NOT have the little hole in the back that's used for external antenna plug (see HCH-61, which does). But that feature is not important to me.Overall, the holder serves its purpose and is more accomodating if you use you phone with a custom case."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most comprehensive stencil book to date!","review":"highly recommended! this book is beyond your pretty picture book. the author's essays give an excellent overview of stencil graffiti, and his list of bibliography and end notes provide the best starting point ive found for further research.it's missing one star simply because i find tristan manco's \\"stencil graffiti\\" more interesting in terms of the art work selection.these 2 books are essential for stencil graffiti lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"An amazing retrospective on street art.

You start off as frodo wandering around the shire doing tasks for other hobbits. Now granted this isn't the funnest thing in the world to do, but there was almost no fighting, which was good. From that point on the game just got progressivly worse and worse. It just turned into an all out face enemy, button mash until it was dead, face next enemy, repeat. I only made it about 3\\\\4 of the way through this game because I just couldn't handle it anymore. I would say wait for the ea two towers game but I have played that one too and it is equally as bad as this one. When are they going to make a Lord of the Rings game that actually has exploration and adventure. I know this game promised that but beyond the first 20 minutes its nothing but fighting mindless enemies until your finger hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"On the XBOX Lord of the Rings is incredible!!!","review":"I've never seen JRR Tolken's work be presented so well.

Anyway, this game is definitely for \\"kids\\", mature players beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fellowship is not a strong one here!","review":"Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings brings us ever so deeper into the world of Hobbits and wizards. The game is design to be a RPG, but doesn't deliver. The game lacks aside elements that make a complete RPG. The game could of use more interactivity with the environment, more things to do(the game will take you about three hours to beat!) and the graphics are not up to X-Box par. With that, it does include the adventure with Willow and Todd Bonbadil which is a little good addition to the game overall, but is forgotten later in while you progress.Although it may lack in dept, it makes up with a fun engine, supposily a RPG, it reminds me of a platform: Worriors of Might and Magic, a good game, but not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy it, wait for bugs to be fixed or choose EA version","review":"I eagerly looked forward to this game. From the minute I installed it I had problems. The beginning intro would usually play but it always froze when the game actually started. I couldnt even get to save a game. I had to reinstall drivers for my Geforce2, which were a Balrog to find, then change the resolution to 800x600, then reformat my hard drive and do it all again, then when I finally got to play a little I found the game was boring as a Christopher T book.I also payed list for the darn thing. Bummer! It also crashes. This an example of rushing a game to market to precede the EA version in order to capitalize on the xmas rush. JRR is probably turning over in his grave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just too slow","review":"For this game you need more pateince than anyone in this world has.you will spend hours at a time trying to find your friends in the forest or collecting water lillies, while being atacked by 1 of the 3 enemies in the game .this is much like the book where the characters will spend 90 percent of the time just walking from 1 place to another.I played this for 5 hours and then took this game back because it was driving me to the brink of insanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game gets one star because I have to","review":"I admit that I haven't gotten very far in this game. The reason is that I don't like to play this game. When I turned it on during the day, It was fun when I was helping the hobbitt village people with the little tasks they needed, but then night fall came and I couldn't see jack. So I thought I would put the game away and play it later that night. My place was black as pitch except for the light coming from the television and I still couldn't see a thing. I'm supposed to be avoiding those black riders, but I couldn't see anything. Somehow I got past that part. Then more helping villagers. That's the best part of this game. I don't remember exactly where I'm at with this game, but I doubt I'll go back.There are far better games to buy for the XBox than this one. OddWorld, Blood Omen, and Enclave just to name a few.

I play video games because they're exciting and fun (i.e. Halo).This game is pretty slow and boring. You do *ALOT* of wandering around looking for stuff that's *REALLY* hard to find. This equals BOREDOM for me. I played the game for about 15 hours or so and most of that time was spent wandering around and around the same small areas.I would only recommend buying this game after renting it.

IGN didnt give it that good of a review, i dont know whats up with that, i think it deserves an 8 overall for sure. the old forest part is probably to least exciting part of the game but after that its pure fun! nothing is better than killing trolls with aragorn in the troll shaws and then taking on the wraiths. bottom line........GET THIS GAME.....plus gloin makes an appearence in Rivendell!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"First, if you are thinking about buying this, DON'T! I kno people on here have been saying it is really fun and all, but it isn't. I am a teenager, so maybe these others are younger then me. I was so excited to see this game, I mean it was LOTR how could it not be good? Well after about 5 minutes of playing it I saw how it could be. The graphics, number one, aren't that great. What makes it even worse, though, is how it has no action at all! I played for about an hour, got to Tom Bombadil, and was bored out of my mind. There just isn't anything to keep your intrest in the game, you just wander around trying to find pipes for the mill owner or a bell ringer to warn the people. I advise you to not buy this unless you enjoying falling asleep while playing a game. In my opinion it shouldn't even be allowed to be called LOTR because LOTR is awsome and this is no where near that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game is not stable","review":"Playing this game has been mostly frustrating.

It has excellent graphics, cut scenes and sound. The story is 95% true to the book, and its that part that may turn off true hard core gamers. Itrs certainly not long, but it includes all of the book, any attempt to make the game longer would probably have taken away from the adventure.

The orcs and trolls look very cool , and the ringwraiths and balrog of Moria look awsome. All of the other characters in this game look cool too. The characters you can play as are Frodo the hobbit , Gandalf the wizard , Aragorn the ranger , and more. This game has nothing but pure action in it , and there are thousands of enemy orcs and trolls to kill on your way to destroy the evil one ring of power in the fires of Mount Doom in the dark land of Mordor.

It is only Jan. 18th and the puzzle is breaking. The top of the plywood is breaking away from the bottom so I have had to glue one piece and looks like I will be gluing more very soon. Also the puzzle board is extremely warped. This all is of no surprise to me because I have had little luck with Melissa and Doug products. They either break or the paint chips badly.

At every available opportunity Barnett slams Napolean who he makes out was slap dash in the battlefield and relied on the brilliance of some of his generals. Also the author tries to demonstrate that Napolean had little directly to do with the reforms found in France today. Maybe it was just in style that the book is written, but I just found it to be too one eyed to be taken too seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"*NOW* we're cooking.","review":"If this is the first Destroyer novel you pick up, you've gotten it right on the first try. This is where the hysterical banter between Remo and Chiun really hits its stride, and you get character development in an action novel that readers had no right to expect back when these were written.Lest ye forget, the Destroyer novels competed with \\"The Executioner\\", \\"The Butcher\\", and \\"Edge\\" for rack space at the drugstore. While Mack Bolan is rightly the inspiration for Marvel's Punisher character (it's so blatant they should cut a check to Don Pendelton's estate each time Dolph Ludgren makes his sewer soliloquy on late-night cable), the Mack Bolan character doesn't stand the test of time, and after about a dozen or so, it's all the same novel.\\"Chinese Puzzle\\" sets the stage for an enjoyable twnety years of Destroyer novels.

However when the narrator makes comments about \\"lowering the welfare rate\\" by killing Black men or \\"lowering the crime rate\\" if these men happened to be coherent; I couldn't go along with that. It gets one star because I'd like to love the series; it is fun, but I can't sacrifice my self respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than book2","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable!

Now more than ever i know that i am prepard to join the peace corp and i am really glad that i bought this book. i would recommend it to anyone who is thinking about applying to the peace corp, or someone who is in the appplication process.This book is just questions and answer which is great because although the author gives us his experience, that does not dominate the book, he answer questions that everyone has about the peace corp, using his experience and the experiences of other Return Peace Corp Volunteers.

Los problemas que presenta esta novela son múltiples; aquí sólo menciono los principales:- Un desarrollo tedioso que nunca atrapa al lector. La trama no existe, es un encadenamiento de historietas sin interés.- Una protagonista carente de todo atractivo y cuyos sentimientos nos pasan de largo; sus razonamientos y conclusiones parecen sacadas de una revista femenina de cuarta.- Un lenguaje que hace alardes de profundidad y se pierde en un enjambre inentendible. Y cuando no está tratando de impresionarnos, el lenguaje se pasa al otro extremo y es deslucido a más no poder.- Una miríada de personajes que al final se confunden, porque ninguno está lo suficientemente desarrollado como para identificarnos con sus historias.Realmente, un libro decepcionante por donde se lo mire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Una desgracia","review":"Lo mejor que puedo decir de Marcela Serrano (de quien he leído, por curiosidad o por trabajo, tres libros incluido éste)es que no ha cometido el error de hablar sobre mundos que claramente no conoce. Su tema son mujeres de cierto nivel, moviéndose en ciertos lugares, conociendo a cierta clase de hombres, y siempre sufriendo y filosofando sobre los mismos temas. En todo lo demás, este libro es una desgracia. Aburrido, cargado de pretensión, de lenguaje limitadísimo y con una historia que parece sacada de un reportaje de revista femenina. Si -como dice la publicidad- este libro sirve para entender a las mujeres, eso explica un montón de cosas sobre mi vida sentimental."},{"rating":"1","title":"eugene malson","review":"this vise is a total boat anchor the castings were not finished nothing seem to be straight could not adjust gibbs and get it to work right"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maple Syrup","review":"We love the real thing and this meets all our expectations.

It has been a while since I last read it, so I don't remember much, but it is always enough to make me cry and laugh every time I read it. I never get bored of it! Bill Wallace is my favorite author too. I have read many books by him, and I loved every one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book for optimists","review":"As a child this was a book that just made me angry. I read this when I was eight years old. I remember reading it because I loved horses as a child, I was one of those little girls, enchanted by them. My best friend, also a horse lover, told me the ending (when I asked) and I was upset by it. Not upset in a sad way. I was angered by it. It pissed me off, for a lack of better words. Even as a child this contrived ending offended me. The fact that this author would recycle an ending like this, and expect children to buy it so easily. I didn't bother finishing the book after that. In fact, I threw the book away, because it made me so incensed. There is a difference between writing a classic, where you learn things from it--Old Yeller, and simply manipulating a reader's emotions--Beauty. Even as an eight year old I knew the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book in the world","review":"This book is one of my favorites. I think that ever kid needs to read this book.

Once you start, you an hardly put it down!Luke, a young city boy, is the son of divorced parents. he lives with his mom on his grandfather's farm. because his mom lost her job. Luke never wants to do anything at the farm because his mom made him leave all of his friends when they moved.After a long summer, Luke befriends an old horse called Beauty. They share a special bond with late summer walks and secrets. But when a terrible accident happens, Luke does something that may break that bond.This book is great for children and adults. It has adventure, suspense, and funny, laugh-out-loud moments, too. It shows that when you have a bond with a clase friend, keep it for it will become one of your greatest treasures. I give this book a four out of five star rating."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book so much that I cried!","review":"When I first read this book I knew it would be good but not that good!

Friends of mine who hadn't ever heard of Attachment Parenting commented about the support for their parenting choices that they found in these pages.I wish this book had been around when I was pregnant. There are things that I have read that I would have wanted to do - and hope to do if I am blessed to have baby #2. Thanks to Tiffany Palisi, I keep learning more and more ways to be a Loving Mama!"},{"rating":"2","title":"earnest. very earnest.","review":"I enjoyed these essays written by mothers practicing attachment parenting (AP) techniques, but I thought it was way too earnest and quite humorless.I think I would really have enjoyed this book more if I were pregnant or a brand new mom and unfamiliar with principles of AP, so if that's you, this is definitely worth a shot. I thought I would enjoy it as a mother who had, like these women, had the joy of discovering that there was another, better, way to raise my children, but I found it to be too humorless and repetitive to be truly enjoyable. Short, two to three page, articles detail the experience of a new mother, frazzled, trying to follow traditional ideas of parenting, finding a better way, and everyone being mostly happy afterward."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, but not the best","review":"Although the notes contain helpful explanations of the mythology in the Aeneid, their grammatical commentary is a little sparse. I wouldn't recommend either this book or Williams' Aeneid VII-XII to the beginning Latin student. When I was beginning to study Virgil, I found this book to be incredibly more helpful:Virgil: Aeneid II (BCP Latin Texts) (Bk. 2).For the more advanced student, however, the notes should be adequate. I like especially that this book and its sister edition (Virgil Aeneid 7-12 (Bks. 7-12)) contain the entire Latin text of the Aeneid in two neat packages. It is frustrating to try to piece together Virgil's complete text with expensive Latin-English translations of single sections of the Aeneid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best vitamins, but way too expensive and must SHAKE with juice","review":"When I've taken All One, I never got sick. I've compared their ingredients and amounts quite closely with all others worth considering, and they come out #1 every time. But they're far too expensive for most of us -- and far more costly than the versions of All One for younger people. Seems stupid, inconsiderate and irresponsible, to me. Our excellent local nutrition store carries All One, but not the Active Seniors Formula, because nobody will pay that much. You also must SHAKE it (not stir) in juice. If you can't swallow pills, this is an advantage. To me, it's a hassle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it all the time","review":"This series is the absolute best. I have them all. Recipes are reasonably easy, creative, and meal menu suggestions are a big help. For those cooks who need pictures to tell them what the heck they are eating, this probably isn't for you. But if you are into any sort of forward meal menu planning, then pick this and the other years' editions up. An experienced palate also helps so that room temperature dishes are not a shock, but a style to which the Italians and French have become accustomed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great disc","review":"Shaun Verrault has a lot of energy on stage, and it shows up in this album.

Boy was I wrong, I fell in love with both characters right away and could not put this laugh out loud, feel good story down! When I was finished I wanted more! I have always loved Jude Deveraux's books especially the series book's and she scored another A+ from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't get over how STUPID the Hero is","review":"The Hero, Leander, cannot tell one twin from the other. He knew them most of his life. Houston's hero, Kane, could tell just by looking at them, and he just met the ladies. He even slept with the \\"wrong\\" twin! Not very believable!

I love most of Jude's books but this book left me super dissapointed!! This book was a total let down from Twin of Ice,which was an awesome book! I hated Leander,I tried to like him,but just couldnt. I also found it hard to like Blair. This book also really irratated me b/c it seemed like every time it mentioned Houston, it did nothing but diss her and made her seem like all she was was a Little Miss Priss that only cared about her manners and the way she looked. Which there was WAYYY WAYY more to her than that.The only time I liked this book was when I was able to close it at the end and put it back on my bookshelf. Dont waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blair & Lee just aren't Houston & Kane!","review":"One of the problems with this book is that when I read it I expected it to be as great as its counterpart: TWIN OF ICE. But it just isn't as good. I finished reading it just to see more about the characters from the first book. I suppose my biggest problem was that the heroine, Blair, slept with her sister's fiancee. Also, I was upset that the hero actually didn't know the difference between the sisters! Give me a break! I never felt the same feelings I had for Kane and Houston. Had the characters gotten together in a more honorable way, I could have possibly felt something for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin of Fire & Twin of Ice--2 must read books!!","review":"In \\"Twin of Fire,\\" Ms. Deveraux continues the story of Blair & Houston Chandler. Twin of Fire concentrates mainly on Blair and her growing relationship with her sisters ex-fiance, Dr. Lee Westfield. Blair was studying to become a doctor in Pennsylvannia. She went back to Chandler, Colorado to be in her sisters wedding. There her sister concocts a scheme that winds up putting Blair and Lee together. This story of Houston and Kane is continued in this book, in which I thoroughly enjoyed reading more about their relationship. The hilarity of how the relationship between these four people develops will keep you laughing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houston has the better story","review":"I liked Twin of Ice better, but I was glad Jude Deveraux provided us with Blair's point of view as well as Houstons. It was like reading the same story just with the other twin in the background. I related with Houston more than I did with Blair, although I liked Lee as a man more than I did Kane. I felt Lee was a stronger and more handsome character. I liked Twin of Fire, dont get me wrong, but it wasnt as good as Twin of Ice.I recommend to all those who want to read about the dynamic Chandler twins to start with Houston first."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book if you're already a fan...","review":"Deveraux essentially wrote one book when she wrote \\"Twin of Ice\\" and \\"Twin of Fire,\\" but split it into two packages. It's the story of twins and their searches for love. You MUST read \\"Twin of Ice\\" first, as it sets up the story fully. The majority of \\"Twin of Fire\\" is to remind the reader of what happened in the first book, then giving the same events from the other twin's perspective. It's classic Deveraux, and a fan will like these (particularly \\"Twin of Ice\\", the better book). Be sure to read \\"Twin of Ice\\" first, and read \\"Twin of Fire\\" directly following. I didn't really like the \\"playing catch up\\" style of this book, but it was interesting to see the same events from many sides without muddying up the stories. If you're not already a fan, don't start with this one: read \\"Sweet Liar\\" or \\"A Knight in Shining Armor,\\" my personal favorites (and I've read all but two now). \\"Twin of Fire\\" was not her best, but it was a nice book to cuddle up with on the couch."},{"rating":"1","title":"really lame","review":"This represents everything bad about punk rock.

The two are working together on a silkworm project that they hope will be displayed at the state fair. Unfortunately, Julia, whose parents came to the United States from South Korea, is less then enthusiastic about the project because she feels that silkworms are too \\"Korean\\" and so she attempts to sabotage their project. What makes this book unique is not only Julia's voice, but also the discussions between Julia and the author in between chapters. Any aspiring writer would do well to read this book as Park offers excellent insight into the writing process, while those who just enjoy a good story will also be satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I came across this book a couple of times and felt compelled to buy it and check it out. My mistake! The long section on spirit communication, while intended to be straightforward, comes off as simple-minded and, at times, precious. Unfortunately, I was also put off by Dr. Harding's take on spirituality. She has every right to her beliefs, but I have no time for apocalyptic christianity in any form. I don't believe we're living in \\"the end times,\\" and I don't believe we are punished in the afterlife for misdeeds committed in this one (neither does Dr. Harding -- or so she says, since she contradicts herself several times on this point).If you're interested in this topic, I'd recommend Robert Monroe's books, or Bob Petersen's."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbeleaveable","review":"mostly fiction, If it were true we all should hear more from god, and if we did , this world would be much better.

The circumcision part was especially disturbing, suggesting that really your child would prefer to be genitally mutilated so he can look like his other 14 year old friends.

It is jam packed with little tidbits that make me laugh out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Souls","review":"Dostoevsky's \\"The Idiot\\" is a work with which the author himself was never truly satisfied, but even in its 'unrefined state' it is complete, masterful, and deeply moving. It vies with \\"The Brothers Karamazov\\" in my mind for the title of greatest novel ever written, and is in my mind a must-read. The depth and insight into the human soul is a fascinating product genius.The pace of classics is different from contemporary novels and takes some getting used to, and Dostoevsky is no exception. For people who wonder whether they will find the work tedious, Dostoevsky's works are long, but very rewarding.The Penguin Classics edition has a helpful introduction and is less expensive than most other editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who could deal with such a Christlike character?","review":"The answer ,of course, is no one. Think of an innocent (the simple Prince Myshkin) sitting in the same compartment as the romantic wastrel, Roghozin on the Petersburg train. Both know some of the same people, and the name of the seductive Nastasya Fillipovna is brought up. Roghozin is obsessed with her and has lost his patrimony over the temptress.Myshkin, a mystic and an epileptic, makes his way thru various stations of the Cross, while Roghozin( a combination of Peter and Judas) undergoes his own failures and temptations.Truly this is a multicharactered, philosophical novel with a tragic ending that exposes all the follies and foibles of humankind. In other words, a typical masterpiece from the master of masterpieces. Read Dostoyevsky, or deprive yourself of the greatest novelist ever. Even in translation he comes across as the Shakespeare of prose. Don't be an idiot; read The Idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible tedium","review":"The Brothers K was a masterpiece.

I was looking for instruments to purchase for my 10-month old son and found this tambourine. We are in a music class and he loves playing with various shakers and noise makers and I thought this would be perfect. I loved the price and the smaller size. When I took the tambourine out of the bag, I gave it a shake (not even that vigorously!) and the plastic head popped off along with all of the pins and coins!It will cost me more to return it than I paid for it, so I am stuck with it. I may try hot gluing it together or else it will go in the trash. I completely agree with the other reviewer about this item being a choking hazard.

I bought \\"To the Roof of the Sky\\" a couple weeks after it came out. Soon after it became my companion for a 1200-mile solo trek in my beat-up Toyota pickup truck.

A serving of champagne is 4 ounces, so I was excited that I would be able to fill my guests' glasses most of the way while still giving them a reasonable portion.The glasses arrived this morning, and I could tell my looking that they were not 5-5/8 ounces. If you fill one to the brim, it is 8 ounces. I can't imagine how they arrived at the very specific (yet apparently arbitrary) 5.625 number.My two key criteria were that (1) I was looking for a glass that would hold around 6oz and (2) I wanted it to be tall and slender. So, I can only give this glass 1 star. It is tall and fat, and holds nearly 1.5 times as much as they say it does.Other than that, it is as described."},{"rating":"2","title":"No damping","review":"This product does have the strength to close light doors and even heavier ones, however it offers no damping.

If it were for me I would have to given it much lower rating -- since I am from the old school and the symbology had some logic behind it this make little sense unless I took the time to converty all that I know then start from scratch.. It appears that all of the newer math books are copies of others work with just differenmt symbology -- more to confuse and not to standardise. Seems the Hypotenuse, adjacent, and opposite are no longer in vogue. The new make things up as they go along, then with its Mediocrity , it becomes a standard. Too bad, we have to continually be confused. No sense, no logic, no worry how it affects out fellow man.But, since the person had no previous background, they did not notice any differences -- so they thought they would find good use for it.As usual Schaum is a pretty good reference and representative book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book!!!!","review":"The preface claims that the book can be used by students who are studying trig for the first time. What a load of bunk. As a \\"first time\\" trig student, I couldn't get through the first chapter without getting confused. I moved on to the second chapter, and the information was just as muddled. This book may be more useful as a study guide to be used together with a real trig textbook, but I don't believe it is useful for the beginner. Kahn Academy on Youtube gave more clearer explanations and examples on the subject.

That is definiely my biggest gripe about the book.However there are many pluses to this book as well. Each theoreom comes with examples, pictures, and definitions so you can easily understand them.Also, every concept is well defined and in a way that is helpful and concise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution - There are Mistakes","review":"I bought this book to use with my daughter for added drill and review of Geometry and was shocked to find an inaccurate mathematical statement after the Commutative Law of Multiplication (3a X 5 = 5 X 2a = 10a) and three errors in the solutions provided to practice questions in the first eight pages. I haven't ventured further, but based on my experience thus far, I will need to review every example and problem for accuracy, something I hadn't planned to do and shouldn't need to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good review of concepts - Poor Editing!","review":"I am using this book as a refresher while studying for an upcoming qualification exam. In just the opening chapters covering Algebra review, I was appalled at the number of errors made. These are not typographical errors as is the case where the book says that something weighs \\"11 km\\", but flagrant syntactical errors that produce a muddled understanding of the underlying concepts.Luckily, I am still fresh enough with Algebra to catch these errors, however, I have to question their ability to clearly convey geometry material without confusion.This is not to say that the text is a total wash, but I do expect a certain level of accuracy from outline materials such as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant- Perfect for Any Major Fan","review":"What an awesome book! I loved it, it was so carefully written with tangible theories about concepts that you knew were there but weren't sure what they meant. There were one or two things, in hindsight (after Book 5) that I think they could have picked up on, but the things they did were amazing- many I had missed during the times I'd read the first four novels. It's incredible how many running bits there are- cabbage, 12- in the series, and that's all mentioned in here. Coincidences that were really meant to happen from the get-go, \\"insignificant\\" details you thought were unimportant were really keys to the plot- they have an awesome system they let you in on, four rules to picking up on clues. This is an insanely great piece of work, for any Potterhead. :) I'm definitely pre-ordering \\"New Clues\\", to accompany it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for HP fans","review":"This book is a remarkable labor of love. If you are a true Harry Potter fan, young or old, you should have this book in your library. I read it cover to cover and wished there were more.

Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible RUBBISH","review":"This is the worst Harry Potter \\"slueths\\" book ever.

If you are going to buy it you must take care of it. Hand wash and don't use metal utensils. When stored I put plastic bubble wrap between pans so nothing gets scratched. I also have the 3-qt saute pan with glass top. Cooking with quality pans etc. can actually be fun cause you feel like a pro. BTW I have had my pans since 2005 and they are in great shape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly Australian cuisine","review":"What an unfortunate book from authors who should know better. The book could far better be called 'In celebration of the New International Cuisine' because I can't tell the difference between what the authors claim is Australian and what is often presented in up market and hotel restaurants in Tokyo, New York, LA, London, Dubai, Mumbai or Singapore. This 'nice' food book has little to contribute to its intended audience and certainly little to do with what Australian food is becoming - unique, authentic and characterised by a wide range of indigenous ingredients.For anyone wanting to really know what Australian cuisine is all about, get the Dining Downunder Cookbook (order it through Amazon or find it online). Other related books on the topic are The Bushfood Handbook and Uniquely Australian, both by Vic Cherikoff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the quality I would expect from Lorex","review":"I'm a huge fan of Lorex products. I've had two quad observation systems, a 4 channel DVR, and baby monitor. All of these products beat my expectations and ran perfect. But not this camera. It runs perfectly for 3 minutes and then scrambled lines began appearing. This behavior is repeatable using different monitors and power supplies. So I suspect it has some faulty circuits. Too bad, because Lorex is generally reliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"I would recommend this documentary to anyone interested in history, FDR, and/or the news of the time. The film was well coordinated; the composition of the film flowed with steady interest. I showed it at our Historical Society's annual meeting, after which we heard many positive comments. Very well done, and I recommend it to anyone interested in the 1935 Depression era. It gives great insight to the tempo of America then."},{"rating":"2","title":"good","review":"Just about exactly what i needed.

It helps manage the ganglion of cables I have under there. The door and hinges seem a bit cheap but shouldn't be a problem unless you open and close it a bunch. So just plug in and leave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 2 days!","review":"Ordered two, loved the idea. The hinges were tiny & they were a bit difficult to assemble. Within two days both covers were cracked & the hinges were broken, and now everything looks messy again. I'm very disappointed, but will try other brands in hopes of a better result (Ikea & Bluelounge make similar products)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hides items nicely - but with some minor oversights","review":"This item has done a number on the mess I had around my entertainment center; it does conceal the electrical cords (as advertised), but the tabs are a bit on the weak side. I also wish they would have made the cover a little bit deeper; I have some pressure on my plug from the TV set (Toshiba), though it does manage to close OK. My replacement plug from my original XBox also does not fit in the large capacity area due to the small area allowed to plug in the larger plugs (xbox plug is too long to fit properly), however it does plug into the 11th outlet (outside the concealed area) just fine. It did the job I wanted, but not in a lavish style. Oh, also I'm a bit bummed that it didn't included surge protection for 2 separate coaxial cables (have TIVO, uses 2 tuners, this only has 1 so I am still using the old surge protector this was supposed to replace just to ground the cables out). It is a good product, just not \\"outstanding\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product - Slight Design Flaw","review":"I bought this product a couple of months ago and so far it has done everything I thought it would. I am a Graphic Artist and have a OCD for my desk to be clutter free at all times. With this surge protector i can route my cords where they need to go and hide the excess. The only problem that Ive had with this unit is that hinges for the door are weak and broke withing the second or third week. Had to use screws and screw the door back on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent idea, poor execution.","review":"The hinge on one side broke the same day we bought and installed it. I had read other reviews who commented on the same issue and tried to be careful, but it was impossible.Getting the cables through the cable holds was a nightmare for anything that had to do with high voltage (XBox) and the space was not there to hide the cables - simply the electrical plugs.There is no way to secure the top closed, so we ended up zip-tieing the entire thing and groan when we have to pull any plugs out of it.There isn't a lot on the market right now for this type of product, so this might be the best one out there, even with it's design flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serves its purpose","review":"This product is great in that it *does* conceal all the plugs, but it could be a bit more verstaile accomodating various sized plugs. These days it seems as though every plug for A/V components, modems, routers, and the like all block the adjacent outlet. It would be great if surge protector manufactuers realized this and left enough space adjacent to each outlet. I would prefer that this product be 1.5x or double the size in order to have use of all 8 outlets. Regardless, it works well and definitely made the floor next to my home theater more organized looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed product","review":"This is my first product review ever. But as a product designer, I must comment. As other people have commented, this product is a nice idea, but too many things--like a charging cord for a MacBook Pro, simply don't fit. Yes, there's one external plug into which the MacBook Pro charger can fit, but that hangs on the verge of falling out. Some real amateurs must have put this thing together without really looking at space needs. Shame on Belkin for not employing better designers--or putting their name on lousy merchandise developed by others.Also, I think the market would bear a few more bucks to have made this a bit less thin and crappy-feeling."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't conceal anything, looks hideous","review":"The surge protector works fine. BUT getting all the cords to fit where and how they're supposed to is a joke. I bought three of these after looking at the photos and descriptions. Short of stripping wires to make it fit, it doesn't fit. In 20/20 hindsight I noticed the photos didn't have plug-ins for office/electronics items ... they're all for small electric items. What I want a surge protector for is (home) office gear ... computers, printers - the stuff with the large round cords - that does NOT fit into the \\"Concealer.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Product","review":"I agree with earlier comments that the construction could be better. While, due to its design, the cover easily falls off when lifted, it is also easy to put back on. Once on, I have had not problem with the cover falling off on its own.The product has helped to reduce cord clutter. That's why it was bought, so I consider it a very effective product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large but good","review":"This is larger than I was expecting, but I have not seen anything better. It keeps the wires neatly out of sight so my baby is less interested. Belkin is a great company. This is a very nice product for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a disappointment","review":"This was a complete waste. I was very excited to find this, and it is a great idea. However, the actual proportions of the outlets and their placement are very inflexible. Modern plugs, especially the ones you are most likely to be plugging into a surge protector, are sided, occasionally having a third prong, often bulky (computers, phones, wireless router). It was impossible to fit these three items into the 6 outlets on the surge protector."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks decent, works well but has one flaw","review":"There are 11 outlets but I am only able to use 7 due to reason stated below and I am fine with that. It looks decent than open surge protectors but there is one issue. The video shows that it hides all the cables and chargers and thats what I exactly wanted. However, I was able to attach only one charger out of 4 I have got, because of the socket design. As you can see that the sockets are fixed and it can take only standard chargers shown in the video. But other than this this is really a good one if you consider 7 sockets instead of 11 + it conceals"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap","review":"The tiny plastic hinges on mine were broken straight out of the box.

Great stories to read, and a wonderful CD set to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grandkids love these CDs!","review":"I ordered this CD set for my grandkids to listen to. They have \\"joint custody\\" of the set. It rotates from house to house by the week. This is part of a circulating set that they listen to a bedtime. On busy nights, when Mom and Dad don't have time to read, this satisfies their desire for a bedtime story, plus it lasts longer than a short story or two. They sometimes drift off to sleep listening to the CDs. With 11 grandkids, this comes in handy. I'm very glad I bought this set and am so impressed that it is read by the author. This way we get the intended inflection and each nuance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Roald Dahl","review":"Roald Dahl is hands down the best author I read as a child (I am now in my mid-twenties). I bought this CD set because his stories are amazing and I do a lot of driving. I would strongly recommend this set, however, there were a couple small disappointments that led to my 4 star rating (these would not likely affect the average person):1. the stories are abridged, so while still fun to hear, some parts of the stories are missing detail.2. I am familiar with the English (UK) books, so I was disappointed to hear a couple North American tweaks (ie. Charlie found a dollar bill in the snow rather than the British coin he found in my book).Overall, this is a great set that I would recommend to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome collection","review":"I bought this collection for my son's fifth birthday, it is a year and a half later and this collection is still on a nightly rotation.

A rushed job live album appallingly edited and mixed it takes too many tracks and cuts them in half. Most notably Industrial Revolution is around 5 minutes instead of the 15 on the studio album.The synth sounds used are 'too digital' and thin, there's no decent acoustic instruments to warm it up although Hank Marvin does provide good accompaniment on Rendez vous 4 and London Kid.China and Houston/Lyon are much better as live albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first 20 minutes are good","review":"The 4 first parts of this live album is very good.

Jarre Live!","review":"This performance is very very far from being the worst performance by Jarre, very far. It may feature less creativity and no new tracks, but the variations and innovation, not to mention energy, that was to this work is magnificent, just like the Jarre tradition.

My daughter was so excited to begin painting, and she loved it! When you first look at the paint colors, they seem dark, but once she added a little water with the brush, they were perfect! The pink was just the right shade for Stephanie's hair and clothes, as well as the aqua-blue for Sportacus. The other reviewer said her paints were cracked - well, ours weren't, just a little creased which it normal. Anyway, a little water on the brush blends the paint back, so it was fine. The pages are porforated so you can remove before they paint if you'd like, and the story is very cute. The only thing is that the paint runs out quickly, but I'm sure that most households with children have plenty of paint on suppy. I recommend this paint book to all your little Lazytown fans out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Think You'll Like It","review":"Heroes, by the Isaacs, is an overall good project. The 'First Family of Bluegrass Gospel' definitely found their niche with the progressive songs \\"Friend 'Til The End\\" and \\"Heroes\\", as well as more mainstream songs like \\"Peace\\". I personally think that \\"Peace\\" could be a hit on country radio, because it's kind of Allison Krauss and Union Stationesque. But don't worry, die hard 'old school' Southern Gospel and bluegrass fans-- songs like \\"If That Don't Make You Want To Go\\" and \\"Great Is Thy Reward\\" will surely be pleasing to your ears. Though I feel there is a little bit of a slump at the end of the album besides \\"Peace\\", very good project. A must have for the Christian music and/or bluegrass fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I were an Isaacs!","review":"The Heroes Album is great. I am not a review writer but I have this album and went to buy another Isaacs album and was offended by that other woman's hostile review I had to counter it.

So, I want to say that I love love love the Isaacs family- all of them. They are all talented and a blessing to this fellow servant of the Lord. I can't get enough of them, I wish I were an Isaacs! They have beautiful harmony in their voice and in their ministry and in their hearts. I have seen them off the stage and they are real and lovely. So, yeah this album is great. Love the Heroes, If That Don't Make You Want To Go and Sweet Holy Spirit those are my favorite tracks, but really I love them all.

It is perhaps the worst piece of cinematography I have ever seen. Everything is pitiful--from the acting to the costumes. Even the sound quality was lacking! The script was RATHER pathetic. The music was insultingly cheesy, and the acting was...well...embarassing to say the least. The historical significance of such an event happening at a later time was completely disregarded. I was embarassed to have found myself watching this movie and was overwhelmed at the pitiful quality with which it had been put together. I cannot argue that the intentions of those who made this movie were pure and sincere, but the intent does not make up for the quality. I had wonderful hopes for this movie, but was completely dissappointed. It's too bad that there isn't a \\"0 stars\\" rating. This movie was utterly and completely a failure."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unanswered Question","review":"The movie is based on one question: \\"What if the saga of Jesus happened today?\\". The problem is, the question is never answered. What this film is, is simply a modern day re-telling of the saga of Jesus. It is too literal an interpretation. The 12 desciples are still all men. They are all named the same as the original 12. \\"Jesse\\" (why not Joshua???), as the savior is called, feeds the hungry with bread instead of something modern like pizza. Jesse is executed on the cross instead of by lethal injection or some other modern method.Although most of the story was a bit judgmental and anti-semitic in some aspects, the special effects were good and the crusifixion scene was intense and very dramatic."},{"rating":"1","title":"It Just Gets One Star Now!","review":"Jesus never called anyone a son of hell or a lying coward!

Following that is an acoustical version of \\"Just A Girl\\". And there's a bonus video on the CD but you need Real Player (or compatible) to watch it.Obviously, Gwen Stefani had a lot of fun making this CD and this is apparent when you listen to the songs. She has to be one of the most versatile singers in pop music today. Every time I listen to one of the songs here, I refresh my amazement at Stefani's control, pitch, restraint and pure playfulness.Best import I've bought in a long time. This is just a great CD.

You'd do better to select the individual programs that interest you. This is NOT the complete set of all 26 Judy Garland Show programs (some sellers will give you this impression). There are only THREE programs on four discs (not counting the so-called bonus material). These are hardly the cream of the crop either. There are photos on the package of Judy with Liza Minnelli, Dean Martin and Frank Sinatra and Lena Horne, NONE of whom are included on the discs (Dean and Frank never guested on the program at all). The package doesn't tell you which programs they are (other than mentioning the guests Bobby Darin, George Maharis, Bob Newhart, Jack Carter, Leo Durocher and The Dillards). You can do the math by finding online program guides. Extremely disappointing and unnecessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"tom forsyth","review":"I agree with the info in the first review.

However, the joke was not subtle, but blatant and I imagine that it is being played by Sony Music. Evidently, one these \\"rappers\\" has a relative at Sony Music because nepotism is the only way I would ever let the rest of the world hear this garbage. The US military could lure Osama Bin Laden out of hiding by blasting this noise pollution through the mountains of Afghanistan/Pakistan. Rumor has it that's how we got Saddam.

It was weird enough that America became obsessed with three singing chipmunks... then the girly counterparts showed up. Why, you ask? My only guess is that the universe felt the need to balance itself somehow, and forced us to suffer in the process.And these Beastie Boys wannabes are, I think, another product of the universe-righting mechanism.

However it has one flaw that can not be overlooked and has caused me to stop wearing it. As mentioned in a previous review, the second hand is REALLY LOUD.

Five months later I have a watch that runs slow by 15-20 minutes per week. So today I phoned Timex to discuss a replacement. Timex wants me to mail the watch back to them and include a check for $8 to cover their expense. The watch had cost me $25+tax. I considered the likelihood that the replacement watch would also be junk, and decided to forgo the return, thus perhaps minimizing my loss.I told the slow-talking folks at Timex that having me pay an additional $8 on account of their faulty product was too much to swallow, that I would write this poor review and that I would never buy a Timex watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"INDIGLO DOESN'T GLOW","review":"There are two reasons I bought this watch.

I received it within 3 days. Wow! what service. Unfortunately when I press the crown - NADA! The glo does not work so I'm a bit bummed out. When I emailed Timex they said I should contact the vendor.

No complaints about the watch itself, but about the 3rd time out I was perhaps overly hasty in strapping it around my wrist. I couldn't get the pin to lodge into one of the holes in the leather band--and then I discovered that the pin had bent in the middle by 180 degrees. I held my breath and was able to straighten it without breakage. I'm still breathless each time I strap on the watch.Cost-cutting by employing a cheap pin for the strap may not be the best place to start. Even a watch that runs a tad slow or fast is better than one that won't fasten to your wrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Simple or Classic Watch","review":"I like it because it is easy to read, comfortable to wear, looks good (to my taste), can use it almost anywhere (yard work, sports, shower, beach, etc...) and is very reasonably priced. The negatives are the small size for the date (barely ok for reading), having to reset the date depending on the month and it maybe too simple for a more formal occasion (it may be too plain for many people so its looks depend on your taste).I like a watch that is easy to read and that I can leave on and use anywhere and this fits that criteria for me.Almost forgot a great feature it has; indiglo night light. The best night light I have ever used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could wake the dead","review":"The Good: Watch is attractive, and Indiglo works well.The Bad: The ticking sound is so loud it could wake the dead.

Now I admit that I am used to large watches and have a large hand/wrist. But this watch could either be perceived as extremely elegant or too small, like a women's watch. I'm trying to love it and there are many reasons to love it, but I just can't get past the 35mm size, maybe if it was 40mm like my other watches.The design, shape, and feel of the watch: is fantastic (outside of size).

I love the simple face of this watch. It is a lot smaller than the modern watches out there, which gives it a better, more classic look. The leather straps are very comfortable and great quality. The loops to secure the band are tricky and stiff at times, but that is given with any watch of this kind. The face is stainless steel and looks and feels solid. I loved this watch from the moment I put it on. My only qualm is the second hand can be heard if it is dead quiet. Around office noise or outside you can't hear it at all, but in a library it can make a subtle click. Some people may find it relaxing, but I thought anyone who might be annoyed by it would just like to know (I'm fine with it). For the price I would highly recommend this watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex","review":"My old simple Timex, which I had had for 20 years (and had to replace the battery only 2 times), finally died.

I replaced it once because of it, but the second one came in with the same defect, so I decided not to bother with a second replacement.Overall: A watch I don't mind wearing at work and putting through hell.

Works well, simple enough (it is a watch) though there are some issues that I can live with:- Thickness was a bit of surprise. Seems that Timex has stuck to the early 1990s design though for the price it is hard to fault them. Guess there is a factory somewhere with paid off machinery churning these out.- Noise of the second hand movement. At first a bit quaint though after a while it starts to wear especially in a quite environment.

They aren't great at keeping a drink warm for a long time -- if you enjoy drinking a warm beverage over an hour or so, they probably aren't the right choice for you. In terms of style, however, they can't be beat. And I like the fact that they don't hold heat for a long time, as I prefer my coffee warm rather than hot.The biggest negative I have found is that after washing them in the dishwasher, every couple of weeks for two years, they became brittle. In a period of three weeks, most of them cracked or shattered when I picked them up.

Everyone has some insecurity, I suppose. But the way this author is apparently projecting her fear of rejection and the at times ludicrous rationalizations to assuage what she is first assuming of women at large is just plain outright insulting. Lastly, it becomes apparent that the term \\"romantic obsessions\\" really is a euphemism for one-nighters--or generally promiscuous and risky pursuits. In another time, it was called \\"free love\\" and as we know love doesn't come for free and what is free isn't love. The author confuses then one-nighters with real romance. Mere intercourse and orgasm doesn't constitute romance--it's just sex.

As an intermediate learner this book is quite challenging especially since you translate the Spanish 'literally' and the English version is a proper translation, so after that initial shock it's quite good reading. However, you also have to get over the idiomatic expressions.

This recording, with its cuts, is perverse. Christoff should not be roaring his way through the music. The tenor is inadequate. Callas was not suited to Wagner's heroines. Her uneven vocal production and lacking middle register were inadequate for Brünnhilde, Kundry, and Isolde. She had the vocal size for these parts in her early years, but she didn't have the smooth, even vocal production or the rock-solid middle register. When she sang Isolde, she had to force her middle. Nilsson had a larger voice than Callas and could blow her off any opera stage."},{"rating":"1","title":"If bad writing is made a crime, Spence can represent himself","review":"Every cliche imaginable is pasted together in this horrible first novel. If uber-lawyer Gerry Spence had dealt with things as they really are, instead of how he would like them to be, this third-rate book could have been second-rate. For example, Spence realizes more than anyone that most of his clients are guilty, so if he wanted to explore the ethical dimensions of the death penalty as he does here, avoidance of the \\"innocent man dying\\" myth would have been a plus. But to quibble with any one aspect of this [weak] attempt at fiction is to imply it could have been saved; it clearly was beyond repair.The only reason Spence's first novel gets two stars instead of one is his colorful, textured description of the New West.

The poacher is too shallow, so it is nearly impossible to get the right amount of water in the boiling pot. Too much water and it boils through the holes on the edge of the poacher, drowning your eggs in water. Too little water and it boils off quickly. 2. The poacher easily rusts, ruining whatever pot was used to boil the water. 3. The poacher increasingly loses its \\"non-stick\\" properties, leaving difficult to clean egg residue in the pan (spraying Pam does not even work).If you plan on occasionally poaching eggs and want a cheap solution, this should do alright, but if you poach eggs on a regular basis, I suggest getting a real poacher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda non-stick","review":"This item claims to be non-stick but hardly passes the test. Unless you use butter and make sure the butter fully coats the container area were the eggs will touch, you may get achieve non-stick but don't count on it. If you use olive oil, you'll be scrubbing the egg off this product. My view of what a non-stick product is means you do not have to coat the pan with fats and oils to make it work. I guess you get what you pay for. In this case, you get what you didn't pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome.","review":"I haven't made poached eggs this good in a long time.

A three minute egg took 4 minutes with my old poacher but this one is spot on. Eggs stick a little to the \\"none stick pan\\" but a little olive oil takes care of that.

Has anyone else noticed that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good product","review":"Within a month of use, the non-stick quality of the surface stopped working, and every time I used it, I would have to *really* scrub to get it clean. Also, as others have said, it's too close to the bottom of the pot, so you can't put enough water beneath it. Too much water means that the boiling water overtakes the eggs; too little water and it boils away. I am not pleased with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"This is near perfect for poached eggs. Put a little water in a skillet, bring to a boil, Put a little butter in the cup, add the eggs, set timer for 3 minutes, cover and enjoy. So far, none of the eggs has stuck to the poacher and by adjusting your time slightly, you can cook them to your desired consistency. Easy to clean up. Only complaint is that the center handle gets hot and you can't grab it with a bare hand to take the poacher out of the skillet. At least you only do that once. Makes poaching eggs really easy.

I have to use butter to keep the eggs from sticking.Other than that I love this product. I have a perfect stainless steel frying pan for the poacher. You don't need to have a furious boil to generate enough steam to poach eggs. I fill the water about 2/3 of the way up to the top of the pan and I have poached 3 sets of eggs without refilling the water. I recommend placing the poacher in the pan and bring the water to a low boil first.

Unfortunately, the \\"non stick\\" feature was non existent.

At one point, I soaked it in warm soapy water for 3 days to try to loosen the egg, and it still required a great deal of time and effort before it would come clean. I have since put it in the back of my cabinet and have returned to the old fashion way of poaching. If you want my poacher, I'll send it to you for free if you'll pay for shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eggs Stick to Pan / Hard to Clean","review":"We have used this poacher several time with both butter and water in the bottom to prevent sticking.

While it is good that these egg wells have a flat bottom, otherwise this is a cheap egg poacher that does not deliver on repeat use. It is very difficult to remove the cooked eggs--they stick and break and take so much time to remove that the others overcook from the heat of the pan. We've tried everything and used tons of butter to avoid sticking, and no luck. The metal pan gets pitted in the dishwasher, and it leaves rust stains on the porcelain sink when soaking to loosen the stuck-on egg.The teflon surface is flaking off, and that is not healthy. We do not like waste, but the only thing to do with this poacher is feed it to the garbage can.We are searching for a good-quality replacement so that we can enjoy a nice Eggs Benedict breakfast with less frustration. ;-) We suggest you save yourself some trouble and do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks Great But Doesn't Last","review":"At first, I was pleased. As many have noted, it really does a good job cooking the poached eggs to your preference. The problem is the non-stick finish. I consistently greased the depressions with butter or oil, but within about 10 uses, the eggs began to stick. Shortly thereafter, the non-stick coating started to peel off. We exchanged it. Same thing happened to the new one. The product has a manufacturing defect and rather than exchange them after every 15 uses, we pitched it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible product!","review":"This is so bad I wish I could rate it a zero!

Output is decent but advertised 10 ppm color/12ppm monochrome is a serious exaggeration. Printing basic monochrome Acrobat PDF and Word Perfect files yielded 1-2 pages per minute. Ridiculous.

Pricewise it's an excellent deal with the 64mg of memory and the duplex feature.We've been using this hp quite a lot to generate mailing labels via Tray 2 (the default paper supply) and haven't any problems. The manual (electronic file) advises \\"Never print on the same sheet of labels more than once or print on a partial sheet of labels.\\" So it's a pity that the rest of a multiple mailing label sheet has to be tossed for just one label.A wonderful quality of experience is the near \\"instant on\\" (very minimal warmup) feature and it's quiet.

The $6.99 price tag along with the fact that I didn't know any of the actors and it had only one review made me leery. In the end the trailer was just too compelling so I figured I'd take the risk. I'm glad I did. The movie does a good job of setting the tone and conveying the general feeling of unease you'd expect to get from a mental hospital, along with a solid cast that comes off believable. An excellent thriller with just a dash of good horror.

Our Belgium \\"Tax Shelter for Films Investing\\" studio must have played pin-the-tail-on-the-map as a site location for their fantasy tale. As for the script it's usually females that are picked by writers as victims who can only make dumb decisions while being implausibly \\"no way out\\" trapped by bad whatevers but in this case it's a rock band group (How could all of them have gotten the same cafeteria jobs at once?) having to defend themselves. The whole thing seemed contrived and as artificial as the blood. You have to be desperate to want to see red stuff (sort of since the lights were mostly out) to last through this one.

I own most of their other albums as well, but this one has sooo much atmosphere and harmony that it would be sheer blasphemy for any self-proclaimed folk-metal fan to not own this disc over their others.The only down-side to this CD is that it's import only (from what I can tell) and only a few record stores carry it over here in the states.

With my iPod off and the noise reduction on the sound was significantly reduced, you shouldn't expect it to be eliminated unless you are wearing ear defenders!

The high frequency handling is as good as MDR71 though. So my suggestion is that unless you are dying for the noise canceling function of NC22, the MDR71 is a much better choice given that its so much cheaper than NC22. I know, some of the reviews said that the material insulating the wire of MDR71 is poor, my experience is that this only occur due to heat.

This CD is the five act version thought edited it is there. The company must have scruded up there. This recording is would be tops if not for the microphone. Sutherland is excelent with the high notes as is Corelli with his.

Though she was in fabulous voice, the music of the opera was virtually ruined by the sluggish tempi and especially by Franco Corelli's abuse of legato when he should be singing more rhythmically, skipping many of the written high notes, and omitting some cadenzas. Of course, if you are a Corelli fan you probably don't know much about music anyway, so you can just ignore this review and go on adoring his goopy vocal style.Overall, the finest \\"Huguenots\\" is still the famous 1971 Vienna performance with Shane, Tarres, Petkov, Diaz and the superb Nicolai Gedda as Raoul. Marzendorfer conducts with a real sense of purpose and drama, the sound is shockingly superb for so vintage a live recording, and Gedda comes closest to the Meyerbeerian ideal tenor.

Thefifth act is NOT ommitted, contrary to the statement in the music notes included in the box set. The synopsis in the notes is very misleading.

Also, don't think you can turn this on to get a party going. Most of the songs are slow and not jumpy. Bottom line, PURE REGGAE is far from being pure reggae.

Basically, the thing is always staticky. I have to turn the volume way up on my RCA Lyra for the radio to get reception, and then the signal is weak, so the volume on the radio has to be cranked too. The result is that any impurities in the FM signal are magnified and it sounds terrible. I have tried new batteries. I have tried several cars. I have tried all four selectible frequencies in various cities across the country. I have tried every position imaginable. I just can't make the static go away. I don't know about the newer generation products, but I would avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Static, static, static","review":"I have to agree that the static is terrible on this transmitter. I, too, do not know whether they're all like this, but I have to assume that the fact that transmitters continue to sell means that they're not. If you tap this thing even a little, the signal gets lost. If I'm not actually holding it in my hand (very safe while driving, really), the static is so bad, it's inaudible. I listen to audiobooks during my 2 hour commute, but mostly nowadays, I listen to static.Avoid this product. Spend the extra $10 to get one that works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Deal","review":"It's very simple to use. I've had no problems with it. I use it in all my cars and indoors as well.

Of course I checked before I bought and in my DRIVEWAY I can use any of them. As soon as I turn off my street, this item is useless as even the most static-y station will override the transmitter.

In the Dallas market, all four (4) frequency choices [88.1; 88.3; 88.5 and 88.7] generated a signal but 88.3 was the weakest so I tried that. The ONLY way I could get the Belkin to work with my stereo was to sit the Belkin unit ON TOP OF THE FM (dipole) antenna. That makes the range from transmitter to receiver less than one inch. OUCH.

I live in Houston and all four of the preset stations are actually already being used here (hard to believe, but true). The weak signal of this device cannot overpower the FM stations here in Houston and so what you get is mostly static.However, Belkin makes a better model that has the entire FM dial avaliable, and I have had a pretty good experience with it. It is called the TuneCast II FM Transmitter (F8V3080. It costs a few dollars more (I think it was $50, whereas I paid $30 for this cheap one) but it is worth it if you live in a big city. The Tunecast II allows you to find stations that are available as you drive around the city, and it emits a stronger signal (at least it seems to) than this model.BTW, if anyone can find the older, analog FM transmitters, they actually have a stonger FM signal and always worked great for me back in the 90s..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries","review":"I bought this and tried to use it several times, the batteries die quickly and the sound quality and range are poor.

I've owned the original VSOP disc for awhile and am glad that more music has been released by this incredible group. This group is essentially the second great Miles Davis Quintet without Miles. Herbie Hancock seems to be the leader here with Freddie Hubbard filling in the trumpet chair. Freddie does an outstanding job of filling in for Miles. In my opinion, Freddie is the standout of this group. His playing is out of this world and during this period (1975-1985ish) he is untouchable. His solos are inventive and brash,and always make your jaw drop at one time or another. Herbie is no slouch either playing some beautiful solos himself.

That she was past her prime when this album was recorded is a VAST understatement. It is absolutely horrible in every respect except the piano accompaniment. Weill is probably screaming in his grave and would sue if he were alive. This was clearly a vanity piece but someone at DRG should have told her that this album was unreleasable. They didn't; thus, the memory of a great singer is tarnished forever. I know Weill can be difficult anyway, but Stevens, Kaye, Martin, and Lemper seemed to be perfectly at home with his music.

Awful CD Program.","review":"I've seen Tony Robbins where he's been dynamic and life transforming, but I'm sorry.... this \\"Get the Edge\\" CD set is almost painful to listen to. Tony goes on and on for HOURS, in an unstructured, almost chaotic way. He bounces around from thought to thought, sometimes losing his train of thought and going off topic for 5-10 minutes before he finally comes back to what he was originally talking about. He also sounds as if he is taking bumps of crystal meth throughout the entire CD program. He's so jacked up, that he almost doesn't even make sense at points.I was a HUGE Tony Robbins guy, still am, but I can't even listen to these CDs. I found a similar problem with this Personal Power II program. Tony is best in a Q&A; format, where he can stick to the subject at hand. He gets so juiced up about what he's talking about, that he so very often starts ranting and raving about something completely unrelated to the topic.

It would be great for schools to recommend this product and it's reasonably priced too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I was still finding nits in my daughter's hair after 5 days of through checking I decided, it was worth the money to try this. I used this product along with the Nitfree Terminator comb and I was surprised. I would look and look at a section of hair thinking it was clean then run this duo through it and see a nit on the comb. It pulled off 5 nits that I would have missed on her hair, these things were barely visible to the naked eye, For one I had to put it under my kids microscope because I couldn't believe there was a nit I did not see. I have just used the product once and not sure if is the comb or mousse but, it has been worth it so far."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"So.

This is the only thing I found that broke down the glue on the nits successfully. After applying the product as descibed on the label I put a little conditioner in my daughters hair and went through it with the nit comb. I did't find a single nit after I was done.

It is my favorite all time show actually and I have been thirsty for any info I could get on the show. This book is very informative and has a lot of information I was looking for. The episode summaries are also great. I like learning facts I didnt catch myself or dont remember. The one pet peeve I have about this book is it has, like way too many exclamation points!!!!!!!! That may be geared more to the younger readers as to where I am 27 years old."},{"rating":"1","title":"I only gave it a star bc I had to","review":"OK...I know that a lot of people love the Tv show Roswell, but before the show was created, I was a hardcore fan of the books that the show was supposed to be based on. I was so excited when I found out they were making the show, but I could not have been more disappointed. Seriously, if you want to read something good, read Roswell High by Melinda Metz. It's the original story about Max, Liz, Michael, Maria, Alex, and Isabel. It's an awesome series and it's soooo much better than the show ever was!"},{"rating":"2","title":"YES!","review":"This is a book to be read cover to cover...the poems progress that way, weaving in and out of personal experience to Edgewater, (both lake and metaphor), and back to personal experience again. And what experience!!! That of a sensitivity most deeply in touch with the world and the heart. A sensitivity that accepts life's hard places and embraces its wonderments. An unflinching sensuality. Always brave, always loving, these poems should be taken on a walk, or read in a forest, or on a beach or on a plane. You should read them and read them again (I have), because they say what you have always wanted to say and couldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"These girls are hip & strong, but not hard.

Unfortunately, they had limited success. There's a lot of solid power pop on \\"Silver Tones Smile (my favorite is \\"Bent On\\"), and Bhowmik and Dubois definitely know how to write a tune. However, the sounds captured in the studio don't match the intensity the band achieves in concert. Nonetheless, this is a band that deserves your support. Don't miss a chance to see them live (currently, they're opening for the Man...or Astro-Man? Clone Project Gamma tour), and make room in your collection for this disc. You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"luminous vitality","review":"Here is pure music. Genuine music. Honest. Ernest. Refreshing. Wholesome. Earthy. Fun. I find these songs passionate, vibrant, warmly intimate, personal. And all sung with an inspiring karisma and luminous vitality that shine so brilliantly. This cd is immensely appealing in the full range of moods it evokes--at times stunningly victorious, at others, hauntingly mournful. And, too, the diversity of flavors in this music--rock, latin, blues, folk--keep it always fresh, interestingly rich, strangely compelling, provocative.I've been humming Yellow Shoes every day since I first heard it, so many months ago....

I'd recommend this book to any fantasy lover!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enchanting, anti-archetype","review":"These stories reflect McKinley's abilities to spell readers into wholly engrossing fantasy.

Each of the five stories is unique, non-repetitive, and short(perfect for nighttime reading). What sets this book apart, however, is that all the heroes are girls, a rare quality. Children and parents will be charmed by this enchanting tome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading but not enough!","review":"I love \\"The Blue Sword\\" and \\"Hero and the Crown\\" so was very anxious to read anything and everything related to Damar that I could find, and this book fit the bill.

Each story felt like it wanted to be it's own full-length book and I would have bougth every one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book because I had enjoyed McKinley's the Hero and the Crown and the Blue Sword. The only story worth reading in the book was the Healer. The rest of the stories made little sense and had disappointing endings. A lot of what the author writes is unclear and very strange- ex. a queen walks out on her country to be with a stagman. Overall, this book was badly written. I recommend reading the Hero and the Crown instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book I will cherish","review":"This book has rapidly become one of my favorite short story collections of all time. I rate a book by the way I feel when I finish reading it. If I am frustrated or disappointed, there is a good chance that I will trade it in with my next used book store visit. This book left me feeling warm and comfortable and satisfied. I had a small smile on my face and the afterglow of knowing that for just a few moments, I saw magic. I have gone back to it several times when in need of comfort or escape and it has drawn me in each and every time.Ms. McKinley seems to have a lovely little window through which she can glimpse a wild and magical place.

Even if I tell my TV to zoom in it doesn't fill the screen.

OK.. so maybe I am a dunce and didn't treat it right. I filed for a refund and they sent me a new plant right away.. great customer service.

Having already mastered the spazzy pop song, this album explores some new directions, with a more mature, introspective sound. There are some jaw-droppingly beautiful sounds and Rachel Warren's songwriting continues to improve. Planeiac, You Dance Bad, Liquor Store, and Talk to Your Captor are standout tracks.

I can only say watch it, read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well....","review":"One thing that gets me is that whenever I get around a Black Isle product, I have to buy it. I have definately not been disappointed. This expansion kit is definately worth it, but if you go too attached to character and NPC conversations, you'll be disappointed here. The graphics and story line continue to be first rate, but it seems as though BI went back to the BGI format as far as interaction and NPC freewill in BGII:ToB. There also seemed to be a problem with continuing the game from BGII:SoA into ToB. There was a big problem continuing with the party at the first of the game, and some of the graphics tend to slow the game if your processor isn't top-notch. It seemed as though BI rushed this a little. The expansion pack is a worthwhile buy as long as you are interested in more adventure and level gains and didn't get too attached to character interactions and conversations from SoA. B+"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End never looked so good","review":"This is a great expansion to one of the best RPGs of all time. I loved this game. I only have one major gripe about it that made me give it 4 stars. When I played BG2:SoA, after i would complete a sidequest and try to talk to the person i completed it for so that i could get the XP, it said he appears busy!! So then i would wait numerous days (completing other side quests in the process) to get the XP i should have gotten way earlier. But other than that it was one of the best expansions to a game ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-have for Baldur's Gate II players only","review":"This is an expansion and should be considered like one. It does not improve upon the original Baldur's Gate II so much that I would buy BGII just to play this expansion (the way I would buy Starcraft just to play its expansion, Brood Wars).For those who already own BGII, however, this is an investment more than worth the money. The new areas (especially the now-infamous Watcher's Keep) are fairly challenging, the new spells, skills, and items are almost mind-boggling in their sheer ...-kicking power, and there's a brand new (if not terribly original) storyline to boot. You'll definitely want this expansion if you wanted to play the Bhaalspawn saga to its bloody end.As an added bonus, Throne of Bhaal allows players to use the 'Tab' key to highlight items on the ground, chests, doors, etc. While this may not sound like much of an improvement, now that I have it I can't imagine playing BGII without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baldur's Gate II: Throne of Bhaal","review":"This game is great. Though the overall gametime is much shorter than BG2, BG2 expansion has many options that make it just as entertaining. First of all, you may play the original SoA version and the ToB version together. Next, the new array of spells and weaponry is a nice addition because of the new monsters' high HP and better equipped enemies. My only difficulty with BG2 ToB is that new characters start at level 17+. For one thing, this ruins the character because you don't know what the characters full potential is unless you play them all the way through, at the very least through BG2 SoA. Also, this is a lower level than you can achieve by actually playing all the way through BG2."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have been a whole new game!","review":"I love BSG II. And when I got this, it was such a let down. It has cool battle's and a decent plot but I think BlackIsle could have put a little more effort into this and make this a new game (aka BSG III). I give this two stars because it does have potential. But overall, a big disapointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you go wrong","review":"Though this expansion has not come out yet, you have to ask yourself can Bioware really screw up the Baldurs Gate legacy. And the answer is no, it is almost impossible to make a bad baldurs gate game, because first of all Bioware have been doing these RPG's for many years now, so they definetly know how to make one that appeals to most pc game lovers. Just like it says above HOW CAN YOU GO WRONG, well techinically you can't unless bioware went insain for some reason. If you love RPG's and the other games that bioware has produced I highly recommend preordering this game today."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOO HOO","review":"OK. I have had this game for a while and I am reviewing it now. I loved this game. It is excellent. The XP cap got raised to 8,000,000 so now my mage can get to 31st level!!! It was very fun . The 9th level spells are really cool. All the warrior classes gain special abilities like Critical Strike, which lets every hit you hit the enemy with be a critical hit for a few seconds! Wicked for killing dragons. The graphics and sound are stunning to. GREAT EXPANSION.Also, the wizard 9th level spell Dragons Breath is TOTALLY awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Game Ever","review":"I have to disagree with almost every dissent I've read about this game. This is easily the best expansion I've ever played and is high on my list for best game ever.Some have said this is too hard: I have certainly not found this to be the case. It is appropriately challenging, but there is no challenge in the expansion that is unbeatable. In fact, with a little creativity (and exploitation of the mediocre computer AI) some of the should-be-hard fights get easy fast.Second of all, there is plenty of voice acting. Thankfully, it's not overdone. If anything, it can be a little longwinded. The party members have some new dialogue each and spend more time talking to eachother, and the NPC's you'll meet have new and interesting things to say... if they do occasionally ramble on for a bit, it is forgiveable.All and all I'd say this is a fine conclusion to a series I was very sad to see finally end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Game!!","review":"This game incredibly fun and interesting. Even for a casual gamer like me, I was drawn in with the amazing plot twists and climactic battles. Having played the all of the other games in the baldurs gate series, I think that this made the best possible conclusion to the story of my hero as he progressed in this amazingly deep and detailed world. If you own Baldurs Gate 2, I would strongly reccomend finishing it off with this amazing game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This was an awesome addition to the Baldur's Gate saga. More creatures, battles, and abilities are never a bad thing when talking about one of the best computer rpg's of all time.The only thing that I didn't care for was how this expansion had a more linear feel to it than the previous three games, but it wasn't enough of a deterrent to cause me to lower the score.If you are one of the five people that hasn't played this game, I recommend you get your hands on it any way you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Plants...","review":"Very dissappointed...Always had good luck with late summer romaine and spinach.

Why was he masquerading as a street hustler? If there was an explanation, I missed it.The Judge had an amazing ability to multi-task and warp time, because he seems to be finding and torturing a new victim every 10 minutes.

Leon Trotsky, a central leader of Russian revolution and commander of the Red Army offers an insightful analysis of what led to the rise of the Stalinist Bureaucracy in the former Soviet Union.War weariness, scarcity of the necessities of life, and the retreat of the world revolution created conditions for career seekers, faint hearts, dogmatists and bullies to thrive, and slowly but surely drive the Russian workers and peasants out of politics.The idea that the fall of the Stalinist regimes in the late 1980's and early 90's would usher in a new prolonged period of prosperity for capitalism has proven to be wishful thinking at best. As Trotsky painstakingly details in the book, the workers states is stronger than the Bureaucracy that sits and feeds upon it.The present US led invasion of Iraq is partly due to the failure to save it's declining empire through the Moscow route."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trotskyite falsification of history","review":"Trotsky, objectively an enemy to socialism who allied with the Nazis against the USSR, apparently has no idea what he is talking about. Among all the lies and exaggerations are some facts too, but he interpretes them in an obviously tendentious manner and takes every mistake Stalin did as a proof of his counter-revolutionary character. For example. The 30's saw an increased productivity because of the need to prepare for the fascist war. Trotsky sees in this nothing else than an exploitation of the workers! I won't waste more of my time now, but it's also interesting to note that Trotsky actually says that under SOCIALISM, there will be no state! And also that the formula \\"By each after ability, to each after work\\" is NOT valid under socialism.

The others have motors which are woefully underpowered to extrude the pasta. There are other little features and design characteristics which also put this unit above the rest. The only problem is that you must expect to replace 2 of the plastic parts after approximately every 50 uses.

Through the whole book readers are treated to Catrina whining of how she loves Flint thens hates him, and then loves him again, and if you can get through that readers have to deal with Catrina almost sleeping with two men, then being almost raped by the same two men. It took me less then 10 min. to make it through this book and that it because I skimmed over half the pages.

It was fascinating to read about the influences behind Van Gogh's paintings and what motivated him to work so hard on his art. His objective was to make art that consoles, a striking idea.

The book is stretched out by way of font size and spacing (were normally formatted it would probably be 30% thinner). It was short reading. The book, for me, was not very funny, but just a nice little myth style adventure. It certainly is not as funny as a Terry Pratchett book. I gave it 4 stars for several reasons, but my biggest gripe is the cost of the book for what really is a couple of hours of reading, and I am not a very fast reader. Still, if you are a fan of the series you will enjoy this book. I also wish that Aahz played a bigger role. I don't want to give too much away, but there is a little bit of a twist that makes for nice reading, but some of it was just a little too simple and too easy.

Either that or Aprin's style has changed dramatically since the earlier books in this series. About the only positive thing I can say about this book is they have Phil Foglio back doing the artwork so it at least LOOKS like a Myth book again (which is the only reason I gave it two stars).

I have smoked meat for years, and this is the first time I have read about some of the tips for creating great food. Sure, there are some typos, but this book was written by a real barbeque competitor who loves to sample barbeque from every part of the U.S. It has recipes for rubs, mops, type of wood for specific meats, barbeque sauce, and a guide for how to modify them to suit your taste.

The Life Extension Revolution goes beyond this mentality and strives to provide a comprehensive look at the aging from process, and things we can do everyday to help halt and even reverse it. With a focus on blood testing, Dr. Miller gives many real case examples of people he's worked with and the regiments used to help them. I found it very detailed without being too scientific - it'd make an excellent read for anyone interested in taking a proactive approach to aging (and his/her doctor as well)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unpredictable and Unassuming","review":"Despite what other reviewers have said, this book made me laugh out loud... A LOT! It has step by step solutions for how to accept an Academy Award, be a British monarch, request your three wishes from a genie, what to do when you win the lottery, and more. Complete with sketches for how to properly wave like a British monarch, hold your Oscar, rub a magic lamp lap, etc.Tougue in cheek and very witty. Think positive and be prepared! These things could happen... right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as funny as I'd hoped","review":"I was disappointed with this book. It just didn't strike me as being that funny. The jokes are fairly predictable, and it doesn't hold as much appeal as the Worst-Case Scenario book. I had thought I'd enjoy it as I've always been a big fan of Tierney's columns in the New York Times, but I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me...","review":"I don't know what I was thinking. This book wants - really, really wants - to be clever, but when someone has nothing to say, has no real observation to make, it just comes across as empty. Why did the author base a book on another which was half-baked to begin with? And how can you make a successful parody of a book whose only saving grace was a chuckling undercurrent or irony. At least the original was subtle. I hope the poor dears don't decide to write a novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is a parody to itself.","review":"I was not expecting this book to be nearly as funny as the Worst Case Scenario series, but even with low expectations, this book left me completely underwhelmed. If you've read the WCS books, don't buy this one, its not even remotely amusing. The scenarios are interesting to imagine, but the \\"tips\\" this guy gives do not have the same \\"over the top\\" humor that the WCS books have. In fact, the introduction says \\"open the book to any page and you will find it so funny you will buy the book.\\" Not true at all.One of the things that made the WCS books great is the illustrations. This book features an old balding guy in every illustration (is he supposed to be the author?).I only purchased this book because an Amazon 3rd party seller had it for 70 cents, which still seems like a rip off to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT BY BUCKLEY","review":"The ads make you think its by Tierney and Buckley. But Buckley only wrote the intoduction. A satire on a satire almost never works. I guess SOUTHERN'S CANDY on VOLTAIRE'S CANDIDE is an exception. But Tierney ain't no Southern, in fact he is no Chris Buckley. Read Buckley's NO WAY TO TREAT A FIRST LADY or THANK YOU FOR SMOKING , but don't buy this boring, laughless book ,READ only the front cover which gives the best advice and is the only funny part.(You can click on the cover and enlarge it and read it on the internet.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"spinner ring for men","review":"I like this ring and my worrying husband loves the fact that he can spin it whenever he is worrying.It is very thick so if you do not have large hands don't do it.Also the sizes seem to run a bit small, we ordered a 13 and had to return it for a 13.5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk.","review":"Obviously you shouldn't expect a whole lot for under $10, but if it's going to be junk, why even sell it?

I custom created the characters but played the actual game for all but 30 minutes and yawned and went to bed. Bor ing. The voices were stupid and not funny at a all. I personally think they should have been left out! They completely ruined the game for me. Dwarves don't sound like teenagers, and that's what the voices were, just like Might and Magic VI+. Get some serious actors in there or don't even bother putting voices in at all!As for the interface, it was tedious and could only be controlled with the mouse, no hotkeys. You click on an envelope and out comes a smiling face saying \\"let's get dangerous\\" or \\"I'm yer worst nightmare..\\" something equally stupid. You then deside wheather you want to attack with sword, gun or magic then click on the monster. What a teenage concept, I think I'll stick with the classic games.

Movement is really sluggish, either using keyboard and mouse, I also found out when the updated DirectX8 replaced my Direct7-most of other games wouldn't run well that used the Direct7.Bane and WizGold are better, though some people don't agree, I'd rather play the older versions than this one.

For the rest of us it just doesn't cut it. The graphics are straight out of 1992 and the control options are sad. You're forced to pivot your POV around with keyboard keys like a tank turret which completely kills any feeling of suspense. The character development within your party looked promising, but that's not enough to cary the dated game play.

While I did finish it just to satisfy my curiosity to see if I had guessed correctly as to the villain (and I had), it was painful and I would recommend that all lovers of the genre stand clear.

It has lived up to my expectations! It has great sound quality and it is really easy to use. It fits perfectly on a night stand or shelf, it isn't too big or too small. My favorite thing about this iHome is that I can wake up to my favorite songs. I mean that its better than waking up to a beeping noise, but if you like beeping it also has that. The only problem is that the buttons are harder to use. You need to hold onto it so that it doesn't move while you are setting your alarm or clicking any of the buttons on the side. It also bothers me that the machine has to be plugged in in order for it to play your iPod. I wanted to bring it in my car to play some music but it wouldn't let me play music because it wasn't plugged in. But all in all, I love this product and it serves its purpose...

I popped in my iPod with the correct attachment and hit play. After pressing several buttons, it finally played. I turned up the volume by repeatedly pressing the volume up button that worked sometimes and sometimes didn't. The volume down button would either not work or would get stuck and instantly take the sound all the way down to 0. This POS was promptly sent back to Amazon.

The back up battery will keep the time set, but the alarm won't work.2) To turn the alarm off, the button is at the top. To snooze, the bar is on the bottom.

However, the backlighting of the digital time display was still too bright to leave on at night, so I turned that off.

Also, I have noticed that some non-Blu-Ray DVD's don't look that great when played on my Panasonic Blu-Ray player. I have yet to watch this on a conventional player to see if it looks better on a non-Blu-Ray machine. That being said, I did enjoy the DVD and have no regrets over purchasing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Colors - Lacking Quality","review":"The comforter set LOOKS great but when you make the bed the material inside the comforter is not attached to the outside of the comforter - thus creating lumps everywhere.

Unfortunately I feel the ceramic is too brittle. I was using it to slice a guava yesterday and midway through finishing it I noticed a chunk missing off the middle of the edge. This pretty much means I probably swallowed a small chunk of ceramic. It must have broken off when it contacted one of the seeds. If I have to constantly worry about whether or not I can use this knife for this or that task because something may be too hard, it's just not worth it.

Coogan's Bluff therefore acts as a cinematic link between the two critical phases of Clint's career: the spaghetti westerns of the 1960s and the police procedurals of the 1970s.On its own merits, however, this film falters. Uneven and bizarre, with an uneven and bizarre supporting cast, Coogan's Bluff is not worth watching twice. The dialogue is stilted and so is the romantic liaison. The lone cop motif is available elsewhere at higher entertainment value. For example, 1983'sLone Wolf McQuadestarring Chuck Norris.

I really think that's a very smart and considerate decision. For people who want to learn the Chinese characters, you need to get familiar with both forms. If you're taught only in simplified form, you're missing a lot -- especially the beauty of the Chinese characters. I strongly recommend that Schaum list both forms like you did with the grammar book. Besides, I guarantee that if you make this small change, the book will sell better. Otherwise, I won't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Include Traditional Characters!!","review":"Hi-Nothing fundamentally wrong with this book or its contents, except it DOES NOT INCLUDE TRADITIONAL CHARACTERS.Unlike Schaum's Outlines, Chinese Grammar (which includes both simplified and traditional characters), this book does not.This is a serious shortcoming, which should be indicated plainly in the publisher's/Amazon's description of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully useful content presented clearly","review":"I've studied Mandarin (off and on... too much off) for about twelve years.

It tells you, for example, how to say \\"web browser\\" and \\"mouse\\" in Chinese (which I find essential for showing my in-laws how to use a computer).

The thick pages make it easy for young hands to grasp and turn them and the detailed coloration will also attract their eyes. A large number of colors are used, which keeps their attention for an extended period of time. There is also a lot of supplementary detail in the images. For example, the black sheep is covered with a brightly colored quilt, wears granny glasses and knits, and on all pages after the first, there are people in the background doing other things. There is very little text, consisting of the simple poem that starts with the title. I strongly recommend this book to parents with infants."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible lid design","review":"The trouble with this pot is that food eventually works its way between the glass lid and the lid's metal rim.

Before that, I was very happy with them. I have small ears and these were the first ear buds I've ever used that fit and stayed in my ears. The sound quality was great for the money, and I also liked that the cord was extra long and having the volume control on the cord. The case it came with was pretty useless as it took forever to get them inside of it and when you did, it never closed right. All in all, I was very happy with them until the left side stopped working. I believe one of the wires must have gotten loose since it will work if I hold the cord a certain way, but I shouldn't have to do that. I don't believe that I abused them in anyway, I only used them while sitting at a desk, so I can only fault the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"I expected better","review":"I got these to use with my 80 gig ipod that I got for xmas and at first they seemed okay but now they stopped working on me and I'm annoyed that I couldn't get at least three full months use out of them before they broke.

There is a decent amount of bass and the volume slider is convenient. They come with a total of 4 different bud sizes to fit a variety of shapes to cater to your ear.The biggest problem with these headphones for me personally is that they do not sit well in the ear and fall out very easily. I have tried all four different sizes of ear buds and while each tends to provide a slightly different fit, they all generally start falling out after several minutes of listening, even if I am just sitting at my computer at work.

They make the classical music I put on it sound much cleaner and more crisp. And when you listen to rock and stuff, the bass and drums sound much more pronounced and not muffled like the ipod's buds were. If you have an mp3 player with an equalizer on it, experiment with it and they'll make these buds sound even better.

I contacted Skullcandy and they were great about it and just requested to send back the ear buds for new ones, which I received in a timely manner. Satisfied with their customer service, I was happy to have had my Smokin' Ear Buds replaced at no charge. However, after three months of regular use at the gym, one of the buds gave out yet AGAIN.I'm thoroughly disappointed with this product.

(i lost two buds in 2 month)the cord is super short.SUPER SHORT. i intended to use it with my nano, but the cord's lenght is not even long enough to connect my pants pocket to my ear.lastly. the cord plastic is cheap. after using it for 2 month, the plastic starts to change its color and becoem rigid.don't buy...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound quality","review":"So I got these headphones about 6 months ago, and tonight my right earbud would not produce any sound.I mostly use these for listening to music while I play games, and I was so annoyed when I couldn't hear anything outof the right ear bud.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I bought these headphones to attach to my pocket pc phone, but when they didn't fit, so I decided to use them on my pc at work. The only way to keep the ear phones from falling out of your ear is to jam them into your ear canal which is very uncomfortable. I do like the length of the wires and the fact that you can control the volume. However the maximum volume is not very high (the headphones I got with my IPOD are much louder.) Also I found it impossible to rap the earphones into the case neatly, I would always end up bunching them together and cramming them into the case, then I have to untangle them once I open the case."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Ear Buds!","review":"I love these ear buds...they are the first ones that fit my ears.

I paid $35+ at a local store. They seemed to work better than most for my ears. But within a couple of months the right ear started cutting in and out (I always put them in with the lettering showing outward). I thought this was possibly due to something I may have done by mishandling them or maybe I just got a flukey bad pair - after all they were expensive right?So I bought a second pair exactly like the first. Yep, you guessed it. They started cutting out in the same ear and before I could get back to my bag to swap them out for another pair they completely stopped working. Both pair have some kind of issue with the connector where they connect to my ipod - the issue being a cheap connector or cheap solder joint! So now, $70+ later, I have no headphones. Imagine giving away your $30."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Good headphones much better than stock apple headphones.

I read reviews for over 15 different earbuds and decided to go with these ones. Delivery was not as quick as i hoped but the wait was well worth it. Very durable and sounding great! The bass level is just right and the sound is clear and crisp. I use them with my zune player on a daily basis for school and around the office. They block out outside noise well and fit very nicely in the ear.Great product and so far they are making me happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Price, Good Sound.","review":"First thing, Don't expect these to sound like a pair of Bose earphones.

I bought the Skullycandy earbuds because they were in the store around the corner from my job and because I heard about the brand and wanted to try it out.I use the earbuds with my 1st Gen iTouch. I like the fact that I can regulate the volume from the headphones. What is really disturbing is that the sound is not of the greatest quality. It is all treble. I tried to change the iTouch equalizer setting but nothing really changed, still all treble.I guess it is my own fault for not checking the package to see that it said \\"stereo\\" but these days isn't stereo a given?The earbuds can be used the best when listening to podcasts or audiobooks; music is a no no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh...","review":"For a low-priced earphone, the sound quality on these isn't all that bad. I've had mine for almost 2 months and haven't had any dropouts. That said, I'm surprised I haven't chucked them after that long: the fit on these is terrible! They come with 3 sets of silicone plugs, and none of them seem to create an acceptable seal. I can occasionally get a good seal, and thus good sound quality, but most of the time they work their way out and sometimes even fall out completely.Another complaint is that the cable lengths on the 'Y' portion are asymmetric - the left ear is much shorter than the right, so you have the double-annoyance of increased weight on your left ear and a dangly loop of wire constantly brushing against the front of your neck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it, buy something else","review":"While the overall sound quality is ok (beware: they really have no bass) the Smokin' Buds aren't worth the money, not even at $15.The sleeves fell off the first day, and I cannot find replacments anywhere. I've contacted the company 5 times, no response, no customer service. So it appears I have to buy another pair of buds at $15-$20 to replace a 30 cent part.The thin cord becomes tangled very easily. The box is impossible to open, so just throw it away. The cord length isn't symmetrical to both ears, causing the buds to constantly pull out on one side. Overall, they don't stay in your ears long and require a lot of rearranging.I would try other products in the $20-$30 range before recommending these.

I bought another and they also broke, the right earbud would always short out.I'm now on my 4th pair and I've switched to the black version.

I suspected they might not be the same style, as the ones I bought were in the $25 range and these were a bit cheaper, but I wasn't sure if that was an amazon discount or not.I used these for a bit. They're smaller, not as sturdy, and in general I didn't find them to be a very good headset. The sturdiness issue was confirmed when one day when walking into the gym, I knew the headphones (which had been hanging a little lose) and bumped the door on the way in.

If you want to know what it's like working a dead-end job, maybe this movie would show you something. If you already know what that's like, just look in the mirror and you've seen this movie. Even if you're the jackass with the excursion and have no self-awareness, this movie won't make you a better person--it just doesn't present a coherent case for anything.I still can't figure out the message of the movie, unless the message is to be nicer to strangers, but that would be a bit hypocritical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you like working class biography pieces?","review":"I do, I own pretty much every book that involves a disgruntled worker or a worker that loves his job.

I couldn't take anymore.I thought this movie was going to highlight the way people behave behind the wheel of a car, in a parking lot, or dealing with parking lot attendants. Instead, it focused on the attendants who (apart from the lot owner) are completely unlikable. They're a bunch of over-educated, obnoxious, self-absorbed, misanthropic, bitter white kids who passive-aggressively take out their anger on their customers.Don't think this is a movie about rude drivers mistreating service sector employees. It's a movie about self-important suburban kids acting like stuck-up a**holes."},{"rating":"1","title":"good product....don't use this supplier though.","review":"This supplier charges almost $10.00 more than other suppliers and even the manufacturer. I wondered why, so went to AC Lens site. They call there product \\"complete care system\\" and other suppliers call it, \\"starter set\\". On the AC Lens site they show the same picture as they show on amazon and this box looks different than that of the starter set. They show below it, 12 bottles of solution, so I thought, that must explain the higher price. Well, I received the same starter set as the other suppliers are selling for $10 less and no extra solution. When I called AC Lens, they said what is shown on their site and on amazon is a box containing 12 bottles of solution. What??!!? The box shows a picture of the plug in cleaning unit. Also, that would mean they are selling 12 bottles of solution for almost twice as much as the other sellers on amazon. Just ridiculous. Great product. Buy it from a different amazon seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea Flawed in Practice","review":"I was really looking forward to getting this system. And it is snazzy. Here are my problems and my solution. First of all the lens holders that flip out are very flimsy. VERY flimsy. I was afraid that my ogerish hands would break them everytime I used it. Secondly the bulb got hotter than expected. Maybe I had a bad bulb, not sure but when I opened the case it had chemically altered my contacts and made them a little shrunken and rubbery feeling and it had split one.Since I had no choice but to send it back, I opted for a peroxide system called Ultracare. I then soak the contacts for an hour or so in Unisol 4 Preservative free saline. Both products, available here on Amazon. I have absolutely the maximum amount of comfort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PuriLens Complete Care System","review":"For people with sensitivites to the chemicals in regular contact lense cleaners and disinfectants, this system is great. I have used it for over four years now and have no complaints. Lenses are cleaned and disinfected at the same time in only fifteen minutes. The cleansing unit has a life time guarantee if you use their solution. I have replaced three units now and find that it's cheaper to just buy another care unit when the contacts on the base of the care unit rust out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disney makes great movies and that's about it...","review":"Once again, another Disney toy fails to live up to what it's offering.

If you have a air gun that shoots under 600 fps and at a low ft-lbs of muzzle energy then it may hold up. My Benjamin Trail develops 1100 fps at 30 ft-lbs of muzzle energy and this took this trap apart, literally. The back flap deflector gone, shot clean off after 15 rounds and a hole the size of a quarter shot through the back of the pellet trap can, had to back this \\"poor thing\\" up with a thick phone book.

This trap is not suitable for the purpose intended. The rails which hold the paper target are badly deformed from pellet impacts and so is the pellet trap which attaches behind the cone.

On receipt I was a little surprised at the size but, none the less this is a very sturdy and well built trap that I'm sure will last for many years to com. I bought this trap so I'd have a traditional target trap, which I'm certain will be very beneficial in training other people to shoot handguns with a little less worry about AD's, muzzle sweeping, learning proper trigger press, and control of sights. The inclusion of 100 targets (printed on a cardboard type stock) was greatly appreciated. If you plan on doing a lot of shooting you may want to order an extra box of targets, and a 1250 box of roundnose pellets Also available on the Amazon website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"So this came un-assembled with nuts on the bolts of each side. The bolts and nuts were so corroded that after unscrewing them the threads were gone and I had a pile of rust. The powder coating was so poor it's hard to describe. Super thick coating in some parts, none in others.Edit: The wife and I put a few dozen rounds through it, almost all of the coating has burst off the cone, and I'm pretty sure that if we were to use a bench rest we'd drill right through it in a few shots. I'm using a 1377 with 5 pumps on this guy. So WAY below what it's speced for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not heavy enough","review":"I shot the back out of this product very quickly. It worked fine with 550 fps .177. I used it to sight in a more powerful gun, a 1000fps .177. After a few groups the back was shot out. I used standard weight lead pellets at about 27 feet. Oh well at least is was cheap. I may send it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but could be better","review":"Easy to install and works fine. However, needs improvements to get to 5 star:1. Pellets leave minor dents on it. And BB's are REALLY tearing it up, huge dents. Per my gun, it says BB has 650 fps vs 600 of pellet. Also, pellet deforms upon impact, thus absorbs lots of energy. Whereas BB's don't. So stronger steel would be better.2. After some shooting, I had to re-tighten the nuts. The shock from all those impacts had loosen'd them. So watch out.If these two areas can be improved, it would be a 5 star for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I the only one who didn't like this book?","review":"The story line is predictable, the writing lacks polish, and what passes as a \\"twist\\" at the end is nothing more than an inexperienced (and failed!) attempt at suspense.

This little-known piece of history is brought forth by Tom in the context of the surrounding wild cowtowns of Wichita and Caldwell. In that context, Tom tells the reader of many of the seemly incidents endemic to the cowtowns. With that basis, he brings out Belle Plaine's desire to steer their community away from such a life, toward that of a well-to-do farming community. But that road was not without tragedy as Tom points out so well. I would certainly recommend this well-illustrated and very readable book to both the serious historian and the casual reader of 19th century Americana."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Album ACT TWO","review":"\\"Preservation\\" is the greatest album by The Kinks in the 70s.

(or any of the Kinks mid 70's efforts) To put this bloated thing in the same class as Village Green, Arthur, Muswell Hillbillies (or Low Budget, for that matter) is ludicrous. I am a huge Kinks fan, and listened to this double LP many times, trying earnestly to become fond of it, but there is just not much there to get excited about. Ray is still a competant songwriter, but there are none of the inspired melodies of their classic late 60's and early 70's LP's. The whole thing sounds like Ray had run out of steam musically, even if he had an interesting concept to work with. It's a long way from being a bad album, but in The Kinks pantheon, this one is, in my opinion, quite rightfully neglected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disaster","review":"Like Act 1, this album had about one LP-side's worth of decent material. However, on this album, that collected 20 minutes worth of songs just isn't as good as the best 20 minutes of the previous album (Act 1), and it's spread out over a double album instead of a single one. (Fortunately, it all fits on one CD, so you can program your CD player to deliver said 20 minutes of quality listening.) Instead of putting the enitre opera on the Kinks' albums, Davies & co. should have picked the highlights and put them all on one terrific LP, instead of 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a surprise","review":"I had never heard this album and was totally unfamiliar with it.

I agree with other reviews that the machine is pretty dinky and I'm planning to build my own dehydrator one of these days (for a design see the hippie food-drying bible \\"Dry It -- You'll Like It!\\"). But I've been using it for a couple of years with great results. We live in NYC and during the summer running the oven for days on end is just not an option. So the dehydrator is terrific if you don't want to spend money, want something that's quiet, and don't mind that it might break.

I honestly love the beef jerky that you can create. You can spice to your personal preference. This dehydrators like many others has trays that you need to manually rotate. So plan to do this when you are going to be around the house to rotate your trays. The heating element like another suggested isn't protected, so you want to be sure to keep that extra clean, especially when working with herbs that may tend to crackle apart. The trays can be a little tough to clean, but generally nothing that your average dishwasher can't handle.I have also used my dehydrator to dry vegetables, and banana chips. All in all I think its a great price to see if you enjoy making dehydrated foods. I have not used this machine to make yogurt, but I think it would be a bit cumbersome to make yogurt in this. But a couple of round of beef jerky and you have more than paid for this machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"The Ronco does work, however, it is very hard to clean.

By the way, this was such a great purchase, I bought another one. Tomatoes are another delicacy, it brings out the sweetness in them; plus, I dry bell peppers and mushrooms for pizzas and soups. There are hundreds of uses for vegetables and fruits. Zucchini is great dried, all you do is hydrate it again, and you can use it to make zucchini bread. I do not do jerky because I do not like it; although, my 2 grown sons do but since their wives have a dehydrator, I assume they can make their own jerky. If you have not invested in a dehydrator, please do. They are inexpensive and you will by far recoup your investment the first month.

I would do beef and turkey and flavor it any way I wanted. So much more inexpensive than those big expensive bags with little meat that you get in the store!We also made banana and apple chips which turned out yummy as well.Now that Im an adult I had asked my mom if I could have the food dehydrator as I still love jerky. Unfortunatly she had given it away when I got married cause she never used it. So now I am ordering my second one. I love this machine!This is very easy to use, easy to clean and not loud at all.

By 2007, the damage had already been done with subprime mortgages being created for the last 10 years. Blame whoever you want, but rest assured that it was this feeding frenzy of low no documentation, interest only \\"creative\\" loans that broke the mold along with the credit default swaps that created this mess. It was also the reason for the housing bubble, now that the people who became eligible for a mortgage increased. It would have been more interesting to know more about the relationship between Freddie Mac and Barney Franks during the past 10 years.

I must admit, I'm a little biased since I like the idea that I might discover answers on my own as to the out-come of the HP books, but I like the self-discovery and discussion of others' ideas on the septology.

The rest is a regurgitation of the plot, interspersed with comments like, \\"Flitwick was a dueling champion? Awesome. Sounds like the students had better behave in Charms class. ;o)\\" And yes, the emoticon is in the original text. Also, the author's theory that Flitwick and Lockhart are gay wouldn't be so bad (though, like most of the other theories, it seems off-base) if it weren't for the nudge-nudge wink-wink homophobia. Galadriel Waters sounds like a pen name, so I'm not sure who actually wrote this book, but I really hope s/he isn't an adult. If the author is a young kid, then I guess I feel bad about laughing at his/her horrible grasp of the English language.

The book is actually rather accurate most of the time (I read it after I read OotP). Some fascinating septology clues are pointed out that I never would have found on my own, like references to other works that JKR might parallel.There were some things I didn't like. For example, parts of the Restricted Section in the back. I found it a bit far-fetched, though, certainly, what they say is possible.

If you are new to the Harry Potter series, this is a good background book for the first few books.If you think you are a HP sleuth, I also recommend that you read newly released ULTIMATE UNOFFICIAL HARRY POTTER HALF-BLOOD PRINCE BOOK 6 TRIVIA BOOK by author Daniel Lawrence. I think authors Lawrence and Waters are the two most recognized companion writers on HP insights. If you want to become a HP expert, then reading both of those books will get you on your way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to kill time with","review":"With each (say, 30) subsequent reading of the books, I discovered new nuances, and this book can help you to do that. JKR is a devious writer, and she uses a lot of obscure references and hints and clues to help pull her books together into the incredible story that eventually gets scrutinized by millions upon millions of people (and yet, no one knew it was the rat in book 3).If you enjoy sleuthing out the secrets of the Harry Potter books, this is for you. It brings up a lot of amazing plot points and little details that are easily missed, and really gives the reader something to ponder in the time until book 5 comes out. (For example, James Potter might not REALLY be dead...)This book is a little bit over the top in some parts, over-analyzing in some places and glossing over some details that one would think were important. All in all, though, it is a fun book to read on a rainy day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book is the most in depth Harry Potter I have ever come across, with carefully researched data and rules of thumb that can be used again and again for all the books. Although it does resemble a computer document that hasn't been completely reworked (i.e. emoticons, misspellings) all that is worth it, and makes it more interesting to read. The book takes you through each of the HP series books, keeping up a running commentary and explaining when a key point has been made. At the end of the book, in the \\"restricted area\\" the authors tie together any loose ends by making preditions about the end of the 5th book and the ultimate end to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book really makes you think.","review":"This book was lent to me by a friend. It is an interesting book. Some of the theories, especially about the possible endings, are crazy, but some are plausible. Anything is possible in the world of Harry Potter.

Aren't Harry Potter fans smart enough to draw their own conclusions about the book? I enjoy making predictions about what Harry will do next, and sharing my views and anticipations with others--we don't need a book full of them to keep us happy. This book is only one person's view.

But the writing style is an extremely annoying chatroom-ese (i.e., \\"tee hee\\" - so you'll know when something's meant to be funny- or \\"Not!\\" to indicate sarcasm) the authors have an agenda (Gilderoy Lockhart and Professor Flitwick both homosexual? I don't think so - and is this relevant in a children's book?) and we are assured that Sirius Black isn't \\"phased\\" by Voldemort's power. Too much mention of a possible numerological theme that is never really justified.Wait for June."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Most of this book is a paragraph-by-paragraph summarization of the story so far (for books 1-4), followed by specualtion and \\"questions\\" for each section.

The only problem was that the brush leaked detergent, leaving a gooey mess on my sink. With time, this problem became worse, and so I resolved to get a new brush made by a reputable company like Oxo. I researched kitchen brushes on Amazon and found a couple of promising Oxo brushes. One even looked like the one I had. Then it occurred to me to check the brush I had to see who made it. It was difficult to distinguish the name, but I finally made it out: Oxo!Avoid this brush like the plague. It looks great but is poorly designed and manufactured. While in principle the detergent reservoir is a good idea, in practice it just creates annoying messes and wastes detergent.

It breaks after days of use, you loose the seal and dish soap leaks all over the place. It is a total waste of money and resources that it took to make the product. I expected a lot more from OXO. I know their motivation was to allow the brush to go into taller drinking glasses without catching on the rim, but at the expense of the integrity of the product. The older design was much better. After my first one of these broke, I bought another one, thinking that it was a flaw in just that single unit. Nope, the 2nd one broke in a week.

The button only works if the reservoir is 100% filled, and if you press it down at less than 100% not only does it not squirt out soap, it also starts to break. Mine currently has a hole on the side so it squirts soap out at the button at me when I'm washing, and it took long enough to break down to where I can't return it to Amazon.My recommendation? Look for something else. The design of this brush will never work correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good while it lasts","review":"I have purchased this product twice and each time the plastic connection piece that accommodates the brush head has broken.

The black rubber cap that covers the soap hole is on the side. It worked fine for about a month, but now it doesn't form a good seal and detergent leaks out all over my counter. I would guess that I lose 75% of the detergent I fill it with from leaking out. It covers the side of the handle and gets all over my kitchen counter. The other big problem is that the seal also acts as a button to dispense soap. By pushing the button, it is supposed to force air into the reservoir and push soap out onto the brush. It has never worked and soap never comes out. I have to squirt soap onto the dishes and basically just use it as a standalone brush. This is a terribly-designed product."},{"rating":"1","title":"leaks!","review":"Oxo Good Grips Soap Squirting Dish BrushThe brush leaks from both the plug and brush dispenser.

I've gone through about 3 of these brushes. In general, the brush body will last long enough for you to go through 2, maybe 3 brush heads.Still, it is a good idea, lets you use just enough soup without wasting. Just wish the rubber button was made out of something more durable, like silicone.Update 2/18/12 - They are on their third design change and have still not gotten it right. The button on the most recent change (this one you load the soap from a screw off handle) develops a split/crack even faster than previous designs, making the soap leak all over. Did not even get through one brush head.I've taken off a star for this. A good idea but very sloppy design. You'd think they would get it right after three tries. It's almost like they WANT it to fail so you have to buy a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use","review":"Easy to use and to fill/refill with soap, my only complaint is that I wish the bristles were a bit shorter to make it easier to use, but it works great and I will continue to use as an easy way to dispense soap as/while I'm cleaning pots and pans in the sink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not last","review":"Initially, I was exited to find a kitchen dish soap brush that did not leak. The initial investment was higher than with some other brands, but I thought it worth it...especially considering the less expensive cost of the replacement brushes. Worked great - at first. Then, the rubber button which you push to cause the soap to release from the handle...tore. I had not even worn out the brush yet. Somehow, I thought the handle would last through multiple brush replacements. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be called \\"the non-stop soap dripping dish brush\\"","review":"This item is well-constructed and works fine as a simple scrub tool, but the self-dispensing function - for which I purchased it- is a dismal flop. It leaks non-stop. I can't even put any soap in it. When there is soap in it, it comes out through the pressure stop on the side of the handle - and not through the end of the brush. I'll keep it anyway for overall utility, but don't buy this if you think it will be an efficiency saver as a self-soaping tool. I've spent more time cleaning up soap messes from the leaks than I could have ever thought possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO LEAKS!!!","review":"I recently purchased this soap squirting scrub brush to clean my new set of cookware. I was worried that the soap would leak and spill every time the brush was not in an upright position, as I have had other brushes that boasted the same claims and had failed. I should have known that OXO would live up to its name!!!!! Not one drop has left the handle of this brush unless I have pushed the release button willingly!

It's just such a mess that I had to add another 'leaky' review myself!The good news, and why it got 2 stars from me instead of 1, is that the brush is actually quite nice. It doesn't scratch my non-stick pots but it does do the cleaning job well. With that said however, the amount of soap that I've had to clean off the counter is ridiculous! There is no angle that makes it stop. Face up and the loading seal leaks; face down and the brush's dispenser leaks.

But this pile of crap does not last more than a few weeks. The first one I bought, lasted maybe a month before the large flat end where the brushes attach came unglued. Yes, it's only glued on, and the adhesive just gave up, so soap leaked out all over the place. I had purchased a bunch of the brushes and scrub pads that go on the thing, so I thought I would give them a second chance. The second one I bought lasted about three weeks before the hinge that the internal mechanism is mounted on just broke off. These two items were not abused, used heavily, or in the case of the second one, hardly even touched.

I've had both versions of these (the old ones you use to fill through the button and the newer ones you fill in the handle) and both have failed to the point where they are ineffective as a self soaping brush. I average around 4-6 months of use out of them before I have to buy a new set. I really wish they would fix them so they are more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product!","review":"We discovered this company online almost 3 yrs ago and have had our dog on it ever since. She was having alot of stomach problems and vomiting. Since putting her on this, she has not had any more problems. This product is all natural and helps so much to supply the nutrients/enzymes that is lacking in so much of the dogfood out there and this product helps alot. She just turned 12 and has a beautiful long coat.

Oscar Hernandez (who's credit list goes from creating the theme song from HBO's \\"Sex and the City\\" to working with Tito Puente and Paul Simon) directed this group of musicians who had never before worked together, but whom innately shared the powerful history of the rhythm.The album opens with Tito Rodriguez' \\"Mama Guela,\\" and also includes tracks such as Willie Colon and Hector Lavoe's \\"Llegó la Banda,\\" the popular bolero \\"Obsesión,\\" and the well-known \\"Somos Iguales.\\" Un Gran Día en el Barrio might be a lively danceable album that everyone can enjoy, but above all, Un Gran Día en el Barrio is a documentary of Spanish Harlem's music traditions where the true soul of salsa is captured."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"This is a great CD.

All I would have to do is look at my monitor and I would see exactly whats happening.

But everything else works just as advertized.They are pretty bad and hard to understand. But once you get over that, the thing just plain works. I agree that having a backup battery system would be nice so you don't have to renter stuff all the time, but then again it would only make it more expensive and be one more thing to replace.You put it in, program your numbers and it works! The other thing is I was amazed how loud the alarm is. Not sure you could hear it outside really, but it is ear piercing if you are inside! Definitely would send me running if I was an intruder. I had to go to silent mode after the test run, it was just too loud.If it lasts a couple of years then definitely the best money I ever spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived DOA","review":"ZERO rating!!!

I certainly would not have bought this book had I known it was an abridged version. I suppose that's why the publishers have cleverly entitled this book a \\"collection\\".

Who would check out the body of someone who is posing a physical danger to you while engaging in lengthy lustful thoughts? Hello?! fight or flight not a time out for sexual fantasies!.....could not get past the first couple of chapters and that is a shame because I am sure that Castillo as usual has a lot of insightful things to say....maybe I will give it another chance someday..after skipping those first chapters....I am SO disappointed at one of my favorite authors....."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing book","review":"This is a disappointing read.....

There are varieties of these windchimes like Japanese, Balinese, etc so buyers might like to find samples at online stores to test which one they prefer. The Chinese one is excellent. The prices vary as there are soprano, mezzo-soprano, alto and bass sizes. All come with varying warrantees too.

I will admit it was used when I got it. Within two days it flooded my apartment. Upon opening the unit for repair I found that two hoses had simply popped off of their connections. It seems that the element gets too hot within the unit and causes the plastic valves and connections to soften. This makes the hose clamps insufficient to maintain proper pressure to hold their respective connections. Again the element is hot without proper airflow to move the heat out of the casing. I see this as a fire hazard. Even if the unit vented into the space surrounding it, it would be better. It may not \\"require venting\\", but it should.

And as I was looking it over to see if I could make it work somehow, I noticed one of the little wooden caps that hide the screws was carelessly missing. The combination of those two problems made this box the biggest waste.DON'T BUY IT.I even went to the craft store to see if I could find some wood and screws to widen the box myself so it would fit, but I found it was actually cheaper just to buy another box from the craft store.

Here's why: #1 - the menu-master was originally written in 1971 and has not been updated since. Of course German cuisine has moved on since 1971. #2 - the menu master was basically useless for the regional cuisine I encountered in the southern region of Germany. Finally English is much more prevalent than what I had experienced on my last trip - of long ago.

Then to my suprise I noticed I was regularly laughing out loud! This novel is delightful and compelling, although you may feel it becomes just a little long-winded from the moment when the narrator retreats.I also want to add that I don't really understand why so many readers think it is impossible to find out the sex of the narrator. I thought the affair with Inge and the hilarious semtex attacks on the men's urinals were evidence enough for her being a woman... But I must admit the author definitely plays with preconceived ideas of gender.

I've read so many just like it.Of course, the main story is completly original. I've never read one like it before, but as I said it was still all very familar. The art was pretty good, but other than that I wasn't interested. If your over the age of 13, I think you will find yourself very bored with this manga.

The mostly synthesized score adds a haunting touch to this \\"journey\\" through a community's grief. I highly recommend this CD as a balm for those surviving the loss of a loved one. \\"Hidden Legacies (Lullaby)\\" provides comfort in the face of a powerfully sung \\"Give Us A Death Undiminished\\"; whose defiant, tightly clustered chords are, for me, the highlight of this recording. Ric Garretson's clear tenor solo on \\"Dinosaur\\" provides a chilling look at the lonely \\"survivor's guilt\\" that engulfed so many in the first decade of AIDS. The bold irony of the jaunty country-western setting of \\"Left Behind\\" has made it an often-performed staple in the international gay chorus community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth reading","review":"I felt very disappointed after reading this book.

The interesting vocal acting here is at the Alberich-Wotan axis. Zoltan Kelemen combines great character-acting with good precision and attention to pitch. His initial encounter with the rheinmaidens comes off particularly well. He's better in this performance than in Karajan's studio recording. George London is at the top of his form with firm resolution and powerful penetration.Unfortunately, the recording volume fluctuates widely over the performance. You will need to adjust the volume several times if you take it in at one sitting.

This text serves many as an intro into the field.Geisler is a Thomist in his approach as an Evangelical Protestant. He first builds a test for truth claims, then applies each worldview (philosophy) to this criteria. Then, having shown theism to be true, he presents evidence for its claims.Primarily does Geisler rely upon the tests of unaffirmability for a false worldview, and undeniability for a true worldview.When moving on from theism to its competing worldviews (Judaism, Islam, etc.) Geisler abandons the previous tests and uses rather \\"systematic consistency.\\"For this reviewer's apologetics, Geisler cides too much on the reason side. I prefer more of a classical approach, particularly William Lane Criag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written falsehoods","review":"This book simply fails. It misrepresents several of the worldviews it attempts to undermine, and for most of them it doesn't adequately logically refute them (though it claims to).

You want find it. It's more or less the same old arguments reworked that have already been adequately rebutted. He asserts that everything except God is a contingent being by nature. Whereas God is a necessary being. What about matter/energy? How can he say that's not necessary? Even logically prior to the big bang, matter/energy still existed. There is no known or accepted realm in cosmology at any time when there was \\"nothing\\" from which God could create something. Matter/energy is eternal, not contingent.His other arguments are equally unconvincing and weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Masterpiece of Apologetics!!!","review":"After evaluating the alternatives and methods, Geisler exposes two tests (unaffirmability and undeniability) to test the worldviews without general circular reasoning.

First, you are falsifying information and introducing inexistent information. Two, you are defending a myth of Christianity, not the existence of a concept called God. Three, Christian apologetics is an art of intellectual dishonesty. Four, well...this should be enough.\\"Keep in mind that if we ever prove that ANY event in a scripture that has taken place that does not involve the supernatural, it only proves that the event happened and no logical bridge can be formed between that natural event and a supernatural event that postdictions and interpolations force us to believe.\\" By the way, most of the events in the Bible has been deemed us fictional.

The only thing worse than the smoker is Amazon's customer service. I have not been able to get it retuned, they are not responding. The smoker is made in China, they used to be made here. Evidently Great Outdoors has been sold a couple of times, and now is a big supplier to Wal-Mart which explains how they have gone from high quality to tin metal.

What kept the book alive was the sheer thought that Jesus christ was a mere mortal like you and me and that his miracles could be quantified, as it were."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these flatbread","review":"When i first tasted these i feel in love with them, then i notice that I could get them by the dozen which was very very good my only problem is that several of my packages had a whole in it, it wasn't that bad because it did not spoil, I would probably order again but ask that you check to make sure there aren't any whole in the opening of the package"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love those Suzie's","review":"I love Suzie's flatbreads!

While there is a lot of information in this video, it is explained too quickly to be easily understood. But the biggest problem is the grainy, streaky, poor quality of the video image. Watching the players' bushy hair and the coaches' unflatteringly tight jerseys makes clear that this video was made a long time ago. Since the information is valuable, it would be wonderful if Little League remade the video with modern video technology and sold it as a DVD. Until that happens, this is not a video that is worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concise, Informed, Helpful","review":"For some, this video may seem dated and cover too little material. However, the filming is good and the material is very good (there are some minor differences that I teach, but they are very close). Players, on the other hand, may get the most benefit from this video. They will not be overwhelmed with too much information and kids play a large role in the film (which kids really like!). The sections are organized well and enough time is given between breaks to both allow the material to sink in and to allow quick fast-forward or rewind to particular sections.

In requesting a refund from the seller, I was told he would refund minus shipping. Understandable! However, No refund has been received. Not good.

It was less money than water pick---well, you get what you pay for. Half of the time while on the high setting I would only get low power surges. I would move the unit around and this would correct it until the second week were it was just low power. Also, the irrigator tips moved around too easy and I would have to constantly adjust to keep the jets of water in the right direction. As far as I am concerned, this unit is garbage.I went to Bed and Bath and purchased a Water Pick WP-65W and am extreamly happy with its performance. Now get this--this unit on the Water Pick site goes for $$$$, I found it at Bed and Bath for $$$$$, plus I had just received a 20% off one item mailer coupon.

I will be returning it to where I purchased it for a full refund, unless, between now and then, my opinion on this product can be altered.What a waste of time and money for me as a consumer, the store from which I bought it, and finally the manufacturer.

Big mistake. Very weak water pressure even on its highest setting. Very small water reservoir which isn't enough for a thorough cleaning.

Had used the old WJ7 for many years before it pooped out. Bought this thinking it was the same unit. They look the same but the old WJ7 weighs in at 2lb 6 oz and the new one weighs 1lb 3 oz. The most notable difference is the weight. The new version actually is better looking. Now for its performance. I liked the old unit because it would deliver a steady stream at an adjustable force. This delivers a stream with comparable force, and it is fairly non-pulsing like the first one. If you don't get a strong stream at first you probably have to make sure the pump is primed. As one other person said in his comments suck on the tip until it is primed. The one big question is: Will it last as long as the first unit? My opinion is probably not.

The pump runs but no water flows. I checked the water path and it's completely clear. No blockages anywhere. The pump simply doesn't pump water anymore. I wouldn't get another because even when it did work the water jet was underpowered. The WaterPik brand has a more robust stream and is more effective. As other reviewers have pointed out, the pressure dial on the Interplak can be almost impossible to turn. There is a large array of attachments will for most people will simply be a cleaning nightmare since they'll never use them. So they just sit on top of the unit collecting dirt.
